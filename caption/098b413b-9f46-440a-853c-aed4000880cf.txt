1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,160
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: getting through material.

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:16,230
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I have a couple things that i'd like to do as usual we'll start with some questions I actually like to start today with by revisiting a little bit of the decision theory.

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,720
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: exercise that we started to oh i'm muted, am I that's weird.

4
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,820
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Can other folks hear me.

5
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,280
Morgan Caitlin Byrd: We can yes okay.

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,580
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I think, unfortunately, this might be on your end then.

7
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:49,020
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: we'll give it a moment um so we'll revisit the or revisit the decision theory exercise that that we started yesterday and then.

8
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:06,240
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And then i'd also like to go over a little bit of the game three material time permitting this morning, we will talk about agent based models, if not, then marissa will cover that this afternoon, along with network models.

9
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:20,160
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I also wanted to revisit a question from yesterday that I didn't have a terribly satisfying answer to and i've spent a little bit more time with, and I think I have a slightly more satisfying answer and that one in particular dealt with the.

10
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,270
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: person likelihood function, or the person log likelihood function respect organize my tabs here.

11
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,940
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So right, so what we what.

12
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:39,210
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: It was Kevin I think what what we were looking at yesterday was a.

13
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:57,540
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Particular derivation of log likelihood for person distribution one thing to note about this particular log likelihood is that this is log likelihood for estimation of the fundamental rate or stale parameter of a person distribution itself, a thing that distinguishes this from the.

14
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,510
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The maximum likelihood case for.

15
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:10,350
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: For fitting an SDR model or kind of a more broadly what I might think of as posts on regression is that.

16
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:27,870
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If you're just estimating the parameter from from some data, then you don't need to worry so much about the predictive values, where if you're fitting a model to data what your parameters actually represent our.

17
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:44,550
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Well, the way that those manifest is by the predicted outcome of the month, your your output data in the notation mercy uses that's the why the series of why and same deal in a person regression.

18
00:02:45,210 --> 00:03:00,600
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If you're fitting a persona regression model to some data you'd have a data series X and a predictive series y, which is the result of some set of parameter values that yield that particular data, where.

19
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:08,010
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: An equivalence that's actually kind of helpful to keep in mind here, so this is from Wikipedia which is surprisingly good at math and statistics.

20
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:17,070
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The kind of the work between these things, the fate of parameters here, this is the rate parameter for.

21
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:28,020
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: For facade distribution or the scale parameter I don't know how they exactly chosen to parameter is this thing but either way and kind of doesn't matter because one is the inverse, of the other but.

22
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:40,080
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The tricky thing about that is that if you're working with a OD model for example you're not directly estimating that thing and you're not that's not sort of your.

23
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:48,750
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: parameter for the purpose of the model estimation, your parameters are the things that, like the right parameters for the model itself which generate.

24
00:03:49,110 --> 00:04:01,800
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: an outcome data or a simulation trajectory and that simulation trajectory is what you're comparing to the data, and that is in this presentation your series of why.

25
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:21,660
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So more or less the the position of the terms remains the same it's just that in your or it might might be X, in this case I don't actually know which one they're using as which, which is annoying sorry X is the predictive thing why I believe is the.

26
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,060
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The observed so.

27
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:44,280
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The thing to keep in mind them is that, instead of directly estimating the rate parameter and directly using that in the log likelihood function you're kind of indirectly getting at it through the the output of the simulation model.

28
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:52,770
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And that ends up being the in this case the X term because apparently I can't read sometimes.

29
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:11,700
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And some and the same logic applies with regard to the factorial term that that thing essentially removes itself because it's invariant with respect to the model so it's of no particular consequence for maximum likelihood estimation, because you just it just doesn't change.

30
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,040
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Does that clarify anything.

31
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,380
Kevin Chin-Wei Tracy: yeah that's helpful um if you go to the other tab.

32
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:32,280
Kevin Chin-Wei Tracy: um so this minus and data term since we're using the model estimates and would just be one for each of the points that.

33
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,040
Kevin Chin-Wei Tracy: All right, and then we're sending across all of the points.

34
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Essentially, yes, and the end.

35
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,530
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The data would be replaced by something that looks like this.

36
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,870
Kevin Chin-Wei Tracy: would be our estimate from them from the model right.

37
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,050
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: yeah where, what are the estimate from model is is what takes the place of this specific term yeah.

38
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,970
Kevin Chin-Wei Tracy: Okay okay yeah that that makes sense.

39
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,180
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: cool alright.

40
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,740
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So from there.

41
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:14,010
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: let's take a step in a totally different direction and look a little bit at our decision three exercises, so one of the things that might have bothered you while we're constructing this is that there is some fluff in how we think about.

42
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,900
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: How we think about some of the costs terms, some of the benefit terms in these models.

43
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:29,250
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Unfortunately, in this case I don't have a stupendously satisfying answer because what's fairly common when you're making a decision or a game three model is if you're modeling costs which.

44
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:39,690
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: don't have a clear quantitative operational ization like money or risk which which do tend to you often tend to lump these things together into kind of a.

45
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:54,150
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Well what's what's usually called a fudge factor, which is exactly what it sounds like it's just a it's just a term in an equation that represents the balance of cost benefit for those things that you don't have a super clean way to quantify.

46
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:05,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And so there's a certain amount in in these sorts of models, where, when you go to make an inference about why a person makes a decision, you might end up saying well.

47
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:17,400
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The most I can say here is that a person values things like inconvenience and side effects higher than they value the cost of risk of infection.

48
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:28,830
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: which can itself be informative in certain sort of a relative sense, but you often don't get the same kind of hard quantitative like what does it mean for the.

49
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:39,600
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Total inconvenience inside of that cost to be too well, nothing quantitatively but it doesn't matter in comparison to sort of the the risk costs terms right so.

50
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:51,000
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If you're or I mean i've kind of done this a bit strangely and that risk terms are negative in the costumes your positive but it's fine it works sort of either way.

51
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:53,820
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So.

52
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:10,410
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: You do often have to grapple with this some of this is part of why economists will tend to prefer to monetize everything to assign $1 value to everything that goes in the model because that means that it's apples to apples comparison for every component of the utility function.

53
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,700
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This has some pitfalls because well, that means that you have to assume that.

54
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:33,240
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: kind of as a second order condition that people have certain preferences over money, like the people's preferences over money are increasing, because if they're not and you use dollars to monetize things like the value of inconvenience or the value of side effects, then.

55
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:41,850
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: You could end up with some strange predictions if a person does not have a strictly increasing utility function over money, for example.

56
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:55,680
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But there are multiple ways to come at this depending on how you're presenting your work and, depending on what kind of information you have to to give you more or less quantitative views of.

57
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:07,800
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Things like these kind of abstract costs and, to a certain extent, the concept of utility To begin with, is the idea of assigning a number to some of these nebulous abstract concepts that is.

58
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:15,780
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Where the the idea of utility came from it was it was it was really a measure of happiness from I want to say Bentham and.

59
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,520
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: who's the other philosopher who developed expected until the theory.

60
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,610
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Of liking on it, but.

61
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:32,280
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This this was the original idea that maximizing utility should be equivalent to maximizing happiness and to a certain extent that kind of.

62
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,290
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Framework in words is still sort of similar to the way that we think now it's just that.

63
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:51,930
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: When possible we try to use things that we can actually quantify that exist on reasonable scale like risk is nice because that has a scale right risk should go from zero to one because it's a probability measure for the most part.

64
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:11,160
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: There are ways also that I kind of briefly touched on to link types of models together, so we saw in the stochastic lecture on Tuesday seems like forever ago now i'll pull that up really briefly because.

65
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:18,780
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We can use some stuff from so we saw this simple newly process model of infection.

66
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,370
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Where.

67
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,860
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If you know, the number of infectious people a person.

68
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:30,690
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: may encounter the probability of infection for contact you can estimate the total probability the susceptible individual gets infected.

69
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,420
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And there's this nice closed form expression for that.

70
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,740
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So how is this relevant for our purposes well.

71
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,500
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: to switch back over.

72
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:51,600
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If I want to know my short term risk, for example, call this risk over three months, well, I could use.

73
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,720
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Ah, why inconvenience and side effects of positive impact on utility um.

74
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,320
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: yeah so um.

75
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,840
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: It might be that I put terms in the wrong order here.

76
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,020
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: When I was thinking about this and I should have done a minus instead of a plus.

77
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,890
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Part of this is because I framed risk as.

78
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:33,240
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: A cost term when what I probably should have done is framed risk because the benefit term these things is costumes, and this is a benefit term so here, I was bit sloppy this is positive, these should actually be negative, and we should probably be positive.

79
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:46,170
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So that was a that was an error on my part due to time, however, if I were to do something like like this and flip the terms on everything, then we probably get something that's slightly more sensible.

80
00:11:47,760 --> 00:12:01,620
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Like more or less if you keep your pluses and minuses consistent costs and benefit wise, then you will tend to be okay, in this case, I did not because I was rushing and got sloppy so sorry for sorry for confusion on that front.

81
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,730
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Let me fix that and actually see what we get and then i'll.

82
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,420
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I will revisit another thing.

83
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I might have to fiddle some because risk as a.

84
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,510
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: risk is a benefit here.

85
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:35,610
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What I should have done is prevent like I shouldn't have made risk a term explicitly because i'm.

86
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:45,180
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Or maybe I should have made risk itself a cost term in any case, this is where this is where constructing these things sometimes is a little bit of a.

87
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:53,670
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: little bit of a back and forth process to figure out how best to express components of the model so like I mean, let me do a couple things that are definitely.

88
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:05,460
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So these are definitely benefits, these are definitely costs risk, I think, actually now that i'm thinking about this risk is properly a cost like risk is bad, no matter what so.

89
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,890
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What we're probably going to find is that we have a bunch of negative numbers in our total utility which is fine.

90
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,490
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: and

91
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,310
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Then we have our ads.

92
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:34,260
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So yeah so let me, let me step back and fix my mistakes from from rushing yesterday, this is what I get for trying to make something live.

93
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:43,950
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So inconvenient side effects these are clearly costs i'm going to treat risk as a cost, because it's a bad thing that happens if you do a thing.

94
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:54,510
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Where the cost might be lower under some scenarios than others, but there is still a cost term and then peace of mind X is benefit term.

95
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:08,490
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This is a somewhat more dismal model, apparently because interestingly, this is sort of emphasizing the impact of these individual costumes where the prediction now is that I wouldn't get a booster at all because.

96
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:18,660
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This is the highest utility value essentially directly, because these two things are capable of overwhelming these other aspects.

97
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:30,330
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And maybe we don't think that's what should happen, maybe we don't think these these terms should be this big relative to these other terms and that probably would be a reasonable supposition so we could we could.

98
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,110
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We could cut those things down by half.

99
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,460
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And likely arrive at a different answer we're in here.

100
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:49,110
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Are our optimal decision is to get a booster Now this is sort of where the the fudge factor stuff comes in, where.

101
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,410
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Usually when you're when you're sort of testing out your decision theoretic model and you're sort of.

102
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:02,460
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: trying to figure out what terms go in and and how they interact, you will do a little bit of this kind of playing around guests and check process.

103
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:11,010
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: To to get a feel for what ranges of values will tend to overwhelm each other and often you want to try to keep your costs and benefit terms on a similar scale.

104
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:18,030
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So, if your benefit terms are on kind of 01 scale you probably want to keep your costumes on a 01 scale as well, so that you don't have.

105
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:30,300
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: wildly varying ranges of things like if these things could go from zero to 10 we'd have an immediate problem, or we kind of know what the model is going to do, because everything else is on sort of a zero to one scale and we'd want to reschedule deal with that.

106
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,810
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Anyway, that being said.

107
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,120
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We could, leaving aside for a moment the.

108
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,930
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: fudge factors we could do a more quantitative estimation of our risk by using the renewing so.

109
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:57,390
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: How am I do that well, first, I need to think about how many contacts with people i'm likely to have over the next three months, and for that we could actually look for some sociology on the subject to see, on average, how many people this person track with on a given date.

110
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:13,740
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: For the time being i'm just going to kind of back of the envelope estimate this based on my own personal sort of contact patterns so on a normal day or on a normal week, for example, I go into the lab a few times a week and I go to the grocery store once a week so.

111
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,550
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In those circumstances let's suppose that I have contact with.

112
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:37,620
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What would that be got about two other folks in the lab and that's two people three times a week so that's six people plus call it an extra three people at the grocery store so nine people per week four weeks in the month so 918 36 people per month and then.

113
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,370
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Whatever 36 times three is.

114
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,470
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So 108 people in a month, so if we want to calculate risk so.

115
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:58,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Is 36 310 wait.

116
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,950
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: that's what my calculator said right yep one away so, then we can go back to our.

117
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,890
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Our model and the probability of infection is.

118
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,750
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This is going to be equal to one minus one minus.

119
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:29,040
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: One to reference itself it's as yet empty because i'm going to fill it in one minus the probability of infection for contact to the power of.

120
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,800
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: that's the total number of contacts right now.

121
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,560
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: let's say the probability of an infection per contact is 10%.

122
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:51,600
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This means that over three months if that's what happens and if all these people were infectious.

123
00:17:52,140 --> 00:18:04,860
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I would be certain to become infected there's something a little bit wrong with this right now in that all those people are not infectious so let me adjust things a little bit to get a little bit of a better estimate we're going to.

124
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,670
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: let's take the prevalence of infection.

125
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:14,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What is the current prevalence of cold it's likely to be I will back of the envelope this one.

126
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,700
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So there are let's see how many.

127
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:31,140
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But 137 confirmed cases over the last week in in Washington county.

128
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:45,120
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: population of Washington county is about 370,000, so I will let me put this in the thing so let's see problems on 37.

129
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,570
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: pop is about what did I say 370,000, which means the.

130
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,880
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: prevalence.

131
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,950
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: equal to this divided by this.

132
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:25,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: prevalence among contacts, is this times the total number of my contacts, so this actually This makes the situation rather better because we have a very low prevalence right now, relatively speaking, or well apparently low prevalence I think some of this is due to testing, but whatever.

133
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,170
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And then.

134
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:38,430
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Now we have a slightly more quantitative estimate of our risk, and we can see that the.

135
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,920
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The risk is actually fairly low in this circumstance, essentially because, just to walk through this.

136
00:19:48,030 --> 00:20:01,470
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If I contact 108 people, not all of those hundred and eight people are going to be infectious and my risk is really only increased by contact with an infectious person i'm doing a really dumb simple way of estimating how many of those contexts are.

137
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,030
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: likely to be infectious.

138
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,570
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: over here i'll put this spreadsheet back and chat in case if this place, the link.

139
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:21,720
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: By taking the point prevalence of code, right now, or a back of the envelope estimate at the point prevalence multiplying it by my total contacts and using that to approximate the number of my contacts, who are likely to be infectious.

140
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:31,710
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The probability of infection for contacts actually almost certainly vastly higher than that because i'm crunch real infectious so.

141
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:44,070
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This obviously somewhat dependent on things like our estimate of the prevalence which is likely to be low right now, let me see if I can find a.

142
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,450
See it's not counting say.

143
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So new cases.

144
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:03,900
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Actually, so the week of July 2 there were 661 new cases so we'll go with that that's a little fire going off of.

145
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,650
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This thing code cases and washtenaw county so.

146
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:15,660
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Oh, this was 400,000 i'm dumb I was actually we could probably fat calculate that.

147
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:23,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: let's use that so weekly case rate per hundred thousand was 198 for 100,000 so.

148
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,410
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So this was 198.

149
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,920
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: per hundred thousand i'm going to recalculate these bits.

150
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,910
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So if that's per hundred thousand.

151
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,280
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: How many is that absolutely.

152
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:12,180
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: is then this times this times my total contacts about point to one of my contacts and then this is raised to this oops.

153
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,380
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Okay.

154
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,570
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: There we go that's a little better.

155
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:34,860
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So I get a total risk over the next three months of about point one four so here, I could actually I could use this directly but for as my total risk.

156
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,660
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And then.

157
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,160
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Suppose the short term risk under the booster is.

158
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,590
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I don't know this times.

159
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,340
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: A about 20%.

160
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,540
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: or point oh two seconds so let's let's use that.

161
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:05,160
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Why am I using that number because i'm supposing that the booster gives me about 80% protection give or take.

162
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:14,400
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I could do similarly with the long term risk for the long term risk is over the following three months of the year, so in that case, that would be.

163
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,270
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That would just be this fixed risk.

164
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,230
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: or point one four.

165
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,000
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And then the long term risk under the booster than would be.

166
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:33,870
The.

167
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:40,020
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Probably lower because I think breakthrough from the boosters actually like the lower if I.

168
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:55,530
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Or to do something like that so we'll call that point one times total risk or slightly lower 0.014 and we could.

169
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:02,340
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We could fiddle some with some of the these are negative, we can fiddle some with some of our assumptions about.

170
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:14,730
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: boosters long term short term risk all of that stuff while we're while we're building things in here, I feel as though there's a term here that i've calculated slightly strange three but.

171
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,080
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I don't know.

172
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:33,570
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So again, leaving aside the fudge factors, this is a way that we can kind of join types of models together right we've used some of the structure from a simple stochastic model to do things like estimate risk terms for a decision theoretic model and in.

173
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:41,010
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In performing this estimation, we also drew from some empirical data we did it in a slightly.

174
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,110
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Slightly back of the envelope the way but there's nothing stupendously.

175
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:59,400
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: methodological Lee wrong about doing this in some sense right like i'm working from an empirical case rate which doesn't principle, give me something close to an estimate of prevalence, which is something in the neighborhood of an estimate of kind of the.

176
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:08,070
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The chance that i'm going to bump into an infectious person just on a given day right like prevalence is a decent estimate for that specifically if I want to know.

177
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:19,770
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: For any given person i'm going to bump into what's the chance that they're infectious well prevalence is not a bad estimator of that, and in fact we use that a lot in this kind of linked model to give a sense for how to calculate risk.

178
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,590
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Any questions at this point.

179
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,150
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Alright let's move from there on to game theory, then.

180
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:56,970
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: we'll also do a little model building exercise time permitting from there, hopefully oh.

181
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,790
Rishi Chanderraj: Sorry, one more question i'm sorry to interrupt yeah.

182
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,360
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: yeah go ahead.

183
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,510
Rishi Chanderraj: is, I know that, like there's.

184
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:21,570
Rishi Chanderraj: There can be a lot of complicated calculations about like discounting What about like how future benefits and our are worth less than the present you know, like I know there's ways to that a lot of economist model that does that.

185
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:34,080
Rishi Chanderraj: Does that i'm sure that there are a lot of these more sophisticated do lot of these horses, do you have to account for that often and some of the decision theory models.

186
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,970
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Yes, um and and, in particular so.

187
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,760
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The the question of.

188
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:46,500
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Where and how to apply future discounting tends to tends to depend on.

189
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:59,730
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: how you think that particular time horizon of your decision theoretic model interacts with with like people's time skills for decision making, so I probably would want to impose a discounting factor.

190
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:07,140
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: On on this model because several months out, I mean empirically like if i'm.

191
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:20,880
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Planning things for myself several months out I do future discount like I will over schedule myself for three months from now, and then regret it immensely in three months, when I get there, the methodology for future discounting is actually relatively straightforward.

192
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,560
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: it's if I can Google it really fast, there is a.

193
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,330
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Future discounting utility.

194
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,870
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: discount function.

195
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:46,620
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Here we go.

196
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,010
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So one of the.

197
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:51,960
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: One of the.

198
00:27:53,250 --> 00:28:04,770
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: fairly commonly used discounting functions at the exponential discounting function, which is basically just a like it's either the time interval time some discounting factor.

199
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:12,720
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And that is a really, really common approach and see if I can find a cleaner closed form equation.

200
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,650
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So.

201
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,690
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Quality is counting.

202
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:27,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: just want a nice clothes formulation.

203
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:44,640
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Well, I think this is going to be one that I post on the on the canvas thing once I find a cleaner equation or dig back through my notes to find the exponential discounting function but.

204
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The there's there's a couple of factors that.

205
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:58,140
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That influence your choice of discounting function one more or less is how fast you tend to you tend to discount future.

206
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:03,390
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Future outcomes relative to current ones so um.

207
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:10,050
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: let's see so look at exponential versus hyperbolic burst temporal discounting.

208
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:23,400
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: hyperbolic discounting isn't when I use terribly much I usually tend to apply an exponential discounting factor to results, but the the sort of long and short of it is.

209
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:33,240
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: You will almost always do that if your time horizon is sort of on the order of a year, at least.

210
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:49,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In which case, this is a model of of that where you're considering something in the future models where your utility function includes money will almost always imply a discounted factor and one one thing that you will almost always throw into a.

211
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:58,830
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: into a model that uses money as an outcome is effective discounting through inflation adjustment so.

212
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,800
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That.

213
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,930
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That you often have to include, in addition to an additional discount in addition to a discounting factor to represent the fact that we don't.

214
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:16,140
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Only in we don't only think about inflation as the reason that we.

215
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:21,780
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: devalue future outcomes that makes sense, so what you'll often see in a.

216
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:38,970
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In a future discounting model with money is you'll have an inflation adjustment factor for future returns, but also a discounting factor to reflect the fact that we don't value that money as highly even even given inflation adjustments if that makes sense.

217
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:53,700
Rishi Chanderraj: yeah that doesn't make sense, I think a lot about this, I will, I think this is interesting because i'm an infectious disease Doc and a lot of what I deal with is like inappropriate antibiotic use.

218
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,830
Rishi Chanderraj: yeah since they have like you know it's not clear what they have.

219
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:07,080
Rishi Chanderraj: And so, a lot of people will get antibiotics because it's like well if they have an infection the benefit right now is a lot greater than.

220
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:13,650
Rishi Chanderraj: The emergence of antimicrobial resistance in general in the future.

221
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:25,050
Rishi Chanderraj: And so I was just i'm like this, these are just like this kind of modeling is really interesting to me for that reason.

222
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,560
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: yeah that actually, that is a.

223
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:33,360
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Okay, so so that decision making process actually is one that I think would be really interesting to do.

224
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:33,930
Like.

225
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:42,360
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: an actual analysis of like, and I think in realms like that, where.

226
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,300
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Where the.

227
00:31:46,830 --> 00:32:02,280
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The sort of future risk utility is based on say emergence of antibiotic resistant strain, and this is not necessarily directly monetize well that's a case where, if you were modeling this problem you'd have a lot of flexibility and how you choose to apply discounting to that so.

228
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:15,720
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What I would tend to do in order to model something like that would be to test different scenarios of future discounting so I might do a really strong scenario where i'm like let's suppose that our physician in question.

229
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:29,580
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: doesn't care at all about future outcomes, so they essentially completely discount any of those future costs, compared to suppose someone has kind of a smooth discounting curve like an exponential discounting function, where.

230
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:40,380
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The longer it takes for antibiotic resistance to develop in expectation, the less they care about it but it's not just that they straight up don't care about future outcomes.

231
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:51,540
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: versus one where someone does care very strongly about future outcomes, so I would tend to do that kind of scenario analysis to give myself a feel for how can we explore the range of.

232
00:32:52,740 --> 00:33:03,990
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: of decision behaviors that we see at the at the at the health care provider level, given that we probably don't know exactly how how physicians future discount although.

233
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,710
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I think I think there's actually a lot of room to do.

234
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:24,270
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: To combine empirical studies with modeling studies in the sense that you could you could design a behavioral study, where you survey physicians and you try to use that to actually directly estimate the the discounting factor, or some of those costs factors.

235
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:32,280
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And then use that to build your model, I think this is something that this is something of a lot of personal interest to me because.

236
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:40,140
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In a lot of cases we do still just treat a lot of these costumes is fudge factors, because we don't have empirical data on what people think about these things.

237
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:55,140
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But there's no reason you couldn't go out and try to collect that or try to survey it I think it's just that often we don't think to do that because we don't necessarily think to design studies, specifically, so that we can parameter eyes this style of behavioral one.

238
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,270
Rishi Chanderraj: yeah.

239
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:57,960
Rishi Chanderraj: I mean.

240
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:58,800
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Oh sorry go ahead.

241
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:08,760
Rishi Chanderraj: yeah well, I mean this is really cool that you're bringing this up because, like i've been actually have a ton of data about like antibiotic use by practitioner type.

242
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:24,600
Rishi Chanderraj: And so i've been thinking a lot about like how best you know, like empirically describing like I don't know like what how people how groups of providers like how their discount you know, like how you know what they're thinking about that.

243
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:35,160
Rishi Chanderraj: Some of this might be so well anyway, I think it's really interesting, so I would love if you're if you'd have some interest in pursuing this i'd love to talk to you offline.

244
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,610
Rishi Chanderraj: After after the class but yeah so because, just because it's a big interest of mine as well, so.

245
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,460
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: yeah I would i'd be happy to talk further about that.

246
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:50,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I think there's a couple of interesting linkages there i'll note also just as kind of a quick.

247
00:34:51,300 --> 00:35:02,400
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Quick digression that that's another case where you could kind of link in other kinds of modeling to the decision theoretic model, because if you wanted to estimate the the formation of antibiotic resistance.

248
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:10,470
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: There are things, called evolutionary dynamics models that you can use to model, the develop the like.

249
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:21,870
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The development of different genetic or phenotypic traits in the population, so you could use one of those models to represent the kind of development of antibiotic resistance process.

250
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,000
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: and thereby give yourself kind of similar risk estimates here, where you.

251
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:36,090
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: You pick a particular organism that you're interested in you try to calibrate its evolutionary dynamics model to its particular.

252
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:49,530
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: mutational processes and things like that, and then use that model to approximate how likely it is for that thing to develop resistance under certain time horizons and then use that as one of your one of your sort of model.

253
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:56,220
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: parameters or inputs there, so there there's there's a bunch of different ways to kind of come at this problem but.

254
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,440
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But I think it's.

255
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:11,130
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: it's kind of a similar case in terms of you can link models, you can use different kinds of data, you can use outcome data to try to back estimate some of the some of the costs terms like the utility terms, so yeah i'd be happy to discuss further.

256
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,160
Rishi Chanderraj: Well, thanks.

257
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,070
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: All right, let us talk about what happens when people have to care about what other people do.

258
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:26,850
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Which is deeply inconvenient but but it's what it's what happens so sorry this is this is our world.

259
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:39,690
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Actually, let me make sure that this the current first my notes, because I noticed it's tagged 2020 so I might have done something stupid and not updated the one that I was looking at relative to the one that I should be using.

260
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:48,030
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: i'm not a morning person, so I apologize i'm a little scattered when we do these.

261
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:57,480
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I did update this one seriously I think what I did was I updated, one of the game examples, and I have, I prefer this one so we're going to use this it's it's a game example that.

262
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:03,810
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That has probably the worst best fun that i've made and i'm proud of it so.

263
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:16,140
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We in Decision theory we looked at models, where a person is making a decision basically an isolation and the things that other people do don't have a strong influence on what they do.

264
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:24,510
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But we we saw even in the vaccination example a case where that kind of breaks down right vaccination isn't an independent behavior.

265
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:33,420
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: My vaccination behavior likely depends on what other people are doing, whether other people are getting vaccinated and it also depends on other behaviors that people are engaging in like.

266
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:45,720
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If I think that everyone else is just running around coughing on each other i'm going to be a lot more likely to get vaccinated or if I think everyone's staying home I probably don't care as much, so there is that interaction.

267
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:52,140
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: between my behavior and the behavior of others I started from.

268
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:53,940
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Looking down.

269
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:04,500
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Occasionally, I am trying to fill out paperwork for a volunteer and my colleague is texting me stuff.

270
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:15,930
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That should be done.

271
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:30,480
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So game theory, then, is really a development that extends kind of the economic behavioral modeling framework to deal with these problems, where I have to care about what someone else's do.

272
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:37,410
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And and it's not necessarily that I have to care about what someone else is doing, because I care about them because.

273
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:47,880
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Like I don't have to be any kind of decent empathetic person for this to matter I could be I could be the most self centered person on earth, but as long as i'm clever enough to realize.

274
00:38:49,500 --> 00:39:01,140
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I can't unilaterally get my way, then I engage in a game theoretic type problem right if I can't just kind of bludgeon my way to getting the kind of lunch that I want with friends.

275
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:11,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Then i'm going to have to to engage in this kind of interactive logic to figure out how I think I can arrive at the outcome, I want.

276
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,640
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So um.

277
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:30,900
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This might this might lead us to a question of how do we think about things like preferences or utility when the outcome of a decision depends on the outcome of other people's decisions, so if i'm gonna.

278
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:37,860
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If i'm going to get lunch with someone i'm going to propose a particular type of food, so I might propose let's get pizza.

279
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:48,360
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But they're they're potentially going to counter propose something they might be like oh I just had pizza can we do something else right and so that means that what we end up getting.

280
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:59,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: is going to depend on what each of us wants and what each of us says we want and what you how we negotiate that process, maybe a less trivial.

281
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:07,650
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: example would be salary negotiation right there's some amount of money that I want when I when I get a job or when I get a promotion.

282
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:15,360
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And i'm going to i'm going to have that might my potential employer is going to have some amounts in mind they're going to propose some amounts of money.

283
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:25,950
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And I might counter propose and then they might counter counter proposing at some point will either settle on a salary which is mutually acceptable or one of us will balk.

284
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:42,360
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I might be like No, this is, I don't I will not accept your account or proposal I have other offers so i'm just going to walk away, and that means that what actually happens is a consequence of this negotiation process.

285
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,550
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So.

286
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:53,250
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Before we before we get into that what are some other examples of this kind of social behavior or interactive behavior that you might come up, they could either be.

287
00:40:53,940 --> 00:41:04,170
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: topics that are of interest to you from a research perspective, they could be topics that are interesting to from a social perspective it kind of doesn't matter there's a lot of these and i'm curious to see what you come up with here.

288
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:17,250
Caroline Godfrey: I mean potentially there's some aspect of this and, like shared medical decision making, where the patient preference matters, in addition to guideline based care.

289
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: yeah that's a really good one.

290
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:19,800
Caroline Godfrey: um.

291
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:24,570
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What happens if a patient demands a certain treatment, for example.

292
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:34,950
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: saw that in covert certainly and that ties back to a certain extent to the antibiotic resistance and the anybody prescription question as well that.

293
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:44,550
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Patients and providers may have different preferences a similar thing can play out between like public health professionals and medical providers were.

294
00:41:44,910 --> 00:42:01,080
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Public health professionals want specific treatment options and medical providers might want different ones, because they have to maintain their their their client relationship essentially their patient relationship other other examples, or thoughts about this.

295
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,220
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I have one more we're ramping up.

296
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:27,990
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Paper revisions So when I submit a manuscript to a journal I want them to accept my paper as it is, because I think it's great I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

297
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:42,270
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The reviewers get it and because they're biased morons they don't like it, and they want to see the paper change in ways that conform to their their specific preferences over the paper they send the review back and.

298
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,950
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: assuming they didn't reject it because they thought I was a biased moron.

299
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:58,890
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I have to look at those reviews and figure out how to deal with them and they might be like Oh, we want you to address X, Y and Z all look at those reviews my innate response is going to be get bent i'm not changing anything.

300
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:06,570
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But if I want the paper published i'm going to have to modify things about the paper to make it acceptable to those reviewers so.

301
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:11,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Clearly I can't just be like here's my paper accept it.

302
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:18,300
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Instead, I have to go through what effectively isn't negotiation process with the reviewers and maybe the editor to be like.

303
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,950
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Well, you wanted this i'm going to kind I don't think you're right but i'm going to kind of.

304
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:34,560
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: write my way around your critique so that you think that I did what you wanted, even though I didn't actually change anything, or this critique was actually valid i'm going to change stuff consistent with it.

305
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:43,230
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And at the end of the day, either the paper gets published or it does not and that ends up being the outcome of that particular process and.

306
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:51,180
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If you haven't sat there and thought reviewer to as a giant moron then then you've either had really good reviewers are you are deceiving yourself because.

307
00:43:52,890 --> 00:44:05,970
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I swear this happens every time there's one review or i'm just like why, why are you the way that you are so that's that's an interactive process i'm sure i've caused that for someone to i'm sure i've made a critique where they're like.

308
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,310
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I wish I hadn't requested you as a reviewer.

309
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:28,650
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Other other examples and grant submissions kind of same process where you send the thing and and inevitably you're like I deeply regret sending this to the particular study subsection I did because.

310
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:33,870
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: it's full of dentists, or whatever, and they don't understand what i'm doing so I get really weird views back.

311
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:48,870
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Grad student and supervisor yeah that's a that's a really good situation and, and this, this is a good example of a case where you have interactions that may have a power dynamic where someone may be able to.

312
00:44:49,410 --> 00:45:06,180
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: influence the decisions of the person that they're interacting with because of their position so gratitude and supervisor or employee and manager are cases where people may want different outcomes, but there may also be a power gradient that influences how much effective.

313
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:12,630
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: sort of effective wait a given person has in that interactive process.

314
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:17,400
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And, to be honest, this is something that's been on my mind, since.

315
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:29,850
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Since being promoted to faculty that the way interact with people isn't the same as when I was a postdoc that are a student like when I interact with students after be a lot more careful of not accidentally coercing them into something because.

316
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:45,780
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Like I do have power now, instead of being a postdoc or a Grad student were really I did not so that's the thing trusting water after a water quality incidents, I imagine flint is on all of our minds in this particular case.

317
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:52,140
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Residents for slaughter managers or residents versus elected officials broadly.

318
00:45:54,270 --> 00:46:12,540
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What do you, what do you do when the the resource that you rely on is controlled by people that you might not trust, how do you how do you make decisions in that case, how do elected officials or water managers make decisions, knowing that people don't trust their decisions.

319
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:18,120
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Maybe they don't care because, again, this is a case where you have a power gradient.

320
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:33,510
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So yeah that's that's a very good example, what do residents of flint do in the future when their elected officials, make a decision that is likely to affect their health i'd wager that they're likely to be increasingly suspicious similarly.

321
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:50,610
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: You I think they're interesting extensions to this kind of problem where you have kind of systemic lack of trust between certain groups and and their elected officials or people, people in power in a particular domain where.

322
00:46:52,530 --> 00:47:04,740
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: you like, why is it that we see higher vaccine hesitancy in Detroit neighborhoods well, presumably because there's a long history of those neighborhoods getting screwed by elected officials either like.

323
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:06,180
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: bulldozing a highway through.

324
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,890
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Those neighborhoods or.

325
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:19,020
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: or enacting segregation policies or things like that, and all of that cumulative lack of trust kind of bubbles over whenever there's a new situation where.

326
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:30,630
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: you've got a directive coming down from above and people look at that and they're like well you've screwed me a bunch of the past So how do I feel about you now that you're trying to tell me that you're doing something good.

327
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:38,220
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And that that's a that's a whole thing things like i'm on kind of a similar topic, I have a lot of.

328
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:48,210
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I have a lot of kind of hindsight slash criticisms of the way that the the code vaccination was rolled out at a mass vaccination level.

329
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:57,480
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So we used for code vaccination we more or less used polio mass vaccination as an example to follow.

330
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:03,360
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And, leaving aside other sorts of issues of medical hesitancy is between, say.

331
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:10,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: predominantly black neighborhoods in Detroit and a predominantly white medical establishment of which there's.

332
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:15,810
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: ample problems we might we might think that there are some.

333
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:23,580
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: issues in using polio vaccination as a model for modern mass vaccination.

334
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,440
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In particular thing that's been on my mind is that.

335
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:35,310
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: polio vaccination was done in the 50s and 60s, shortly after the construction of the interstate highway system and.

336
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:49,020
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Shortly in the wake of well the consequences of the construction of the interstate highway system on cities like Detroit and its neighborhoods the interstate highway system was well for one Why am I talking about the interstate highway system and a health context.

337
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:56,370
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: will get there, like the interstate highway system in and around Detroit was essentially designed to enable.

338
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:05,340
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Car manufacturers to efficiently ship goods and employees to and from their factories what this what this tended to.

339
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,760
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: to lead to was that people who could afford to live, not in Detroit proper.

340
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:22,800
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: would do that they move out into the neighborhoods now they have the interstate highway system, which will take them from their neighborhood in the suburbs to their employer directly, without without having to live.

341
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:34,350
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: or interact with the rest of the city, so you get this substantial sort of white flight dynamic, where a lot of people who have who have resources move out of Detroit.

342
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,580
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: what's left are people who cannot afford to move for a variety of reasons.

343
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:48,780
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But then when we go to do our polio mass vaccination, where do we put the clinics, well, we tend to put the clinics in places that people can access via.

344
00:49:49,620 --> 00:50:01,770
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Via automobile transit will put them in those neighbor in not not in the neighborhoods proper to try it in the suburbs, or will put them in central locations in Detroit that are accessible by the interstate highway system so.

345
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:12,000
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: My question then is on the basis of this, who is that vaccination campaign, most likely to in to to affect like who is this targeting effectively.

346
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:26,460
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And by kind of a similar token when we cram a gigantic mass vaccination clinic at Ford field, who is this most likely to disproportionately benefit.

347
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:42,630
Kavita Mosalpuria: People who are connected to the influential or administrative authorities.

348
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:47,040
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: yeah people are who people are connected to the people administering vaccines.

349
00:50:49,530 --> 00:51:00,270
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I might I might suggest, in particular, it also disproportionately benefits, people who have the means to get to the mass vaccination clinics from wherever they're coming from which often means people who.

350
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:06,300
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: live in the suburbs, have access to a car and can drive via the highway system to Ford field.

351
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,210
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: People who have sufficient like.

352
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:14,460
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Computer and Internet access to know that these things are happening at all.

353
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:23,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But but there's also a certain amount of signaling that happens here to where if you're if you're looking at a vaccination campaign like this and you live in a neighborhood of Detroit.

354
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:36,780
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: You might kind of look at this having that and having intrinsic sense of Is this really intended for me, or is this intended for those suburbanites who can you know who can take the time to drive down to Ford field wait in line for.

355
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:40,830
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: A while and then get vaccinated so there's all these sorts of.

356
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:47,850
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Socio demographic and sociological features that influence how a person might perceive.

357
00:51:48,270 --> 00:52:01,890
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The implementation of the mass vaccination campaign, but then influences whether they're likely to interact with it in that critical early phase where you're trying to we're trying to vaccinate people in bulk in order to hit a herd immunity threshold.

358
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:15,090
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: religious reasons were a big reason for resistance to polio vaccination in Asian African countries yeah so so cultural factors will influence the acceptability of different kinds of interventions similarly.

359
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:29,340
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: There was there was a lot of there's a lot of resistance in the Ebola outbreak in 2014 or so in West Africa to things like the the cemetery burial practices, because.

360
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:43,800
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The people implementing those burial practices didn't do them in ways that were culturally sensitive and so people kept on burying their dead in ways that were culturally appropriate but we're not necessarily sanitary until.

361
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:55,380
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Until health professionals came up with a way of sanitary burl that respected the cultural traditions of the region, so this would be an example of having to.

362
00:52:56,190 --> 00:53:07,920
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Having to realize that you cannot unilaterally bludgeon your way toward an intervention solution, and you have to actually consider the preferences and views of the people for whom you're trying to ostensibly benefit.

363
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:17,010
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I get annoyed about this sort of thing with what I tend to call health tourism where someone will parachute into a developing country dropping intervention on them.

364
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:27,180
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Take some pictures of smiling people and then leave this is not a good example of considering the preferences and behaviors of the people in the place that you're trying to actually impact.

365
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,590
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And I get irritated when I see presentations and things like that.

366
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:34,560
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So.

367
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:48,000
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: let's go let's go back to our modeling framework in Decision theory, we had a single person making a decision or even a class of people making decisions, independent of each other.

368
00:53:49,020 --> 00:54:02,190
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So, in a game theoretic framework we're going to extend this to people interact with interacting with each other to come to a decision, because this is called game theory we're going to call our set of people in the in the game theoretic model players.

369
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:10,560
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The actions available to each player we're going to call strategies, and this is sort of to generalize actions into a broader.

370
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:21,390
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Contingency kind of context and then i'll talk a little bit more about this, and then we still have payoffs, which is the value allocated to each player, based on the choices of all players in the game.

371
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:32,130
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And this is where we really start to see the difference between game theory and decision theory and decision theory the payoff or the preference or the utility only dependent on the outcome of the game, based on what I did.

372
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:41,550
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In game theory the payoff is a function of the strategies of all of the other players, the strategy choices ballplayers and the king.

373
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:52,290
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: will start with a simple classic games, the simplest possible we're going to talk about static games have complete information.

374
00:54:53,490 --> 00:55:02,460
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So, in a static game every player chooses their actions simultaneously and independently, so this is rock paper scissors right me in the person in playing rock paper scissors with.

375
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,710
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We choose our action, ostensibly independent of each other, and then we see what happens.

376
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:20,130
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In the game of complete information every player is assumed know the strategies available to all other players, all of the outcomes available and all the payoffs available to all other players as well, so you're assuming to know the structure of the game.

377
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:29,520
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This isn't always true but, when it is not we can modify our game structure to accommodate deviations from complete information.

378
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:46,560
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So let's get into what a strategy isn't a game theoretic model this generalized is the concept of an action to a complete plan of action leading to an outcome, so when I say strategies often rather than thinking of is a contingency plan, if I do this.

379
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:58,050
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: suppose you do this if that's the case, then I do this, but then, if you do this other thing then i'll do this other thing so it's this kind of hypothetical contingency plan.

380
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:03,570
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We could define a special kind of strategy called a pure strategy.

381
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:15,930
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Which is a deterministic plan of action, and then we might want to think about the set of all pure strategies for a given person which we're going to denote a big SCI.

382
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:31,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Finally, because we have to care about what everybody else did let's define a thing called a strategy profile, which is a set containing one pure strategy chosen from among the setup your strategies available to each player, for every player.

383
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:38,070
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So this is just going to be a vector of or a set of strategies chosen for each player.

384
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:48,810
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The strategy sets available to each player, do not have to be the same, and this can reflect sort of asymmetric situations where what I can do is different from what someone else can do.

385
00:56:52,470 --> 00:57:00,780
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So then, if we have a static game of complete information, we can construct what's called a normal form representation of that standard normal form get.

386
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:05,130
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In a normal form game, we have a set of players, which will usually enumerate.

387
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:12,570
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: A set of pure strategies for each player and this accommodates the possibility that each player could have different strategies available to them.

388
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:29,280
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And then, a set of payoff functions for each player that map strategy profiles to real number of values, so this is this is basically a utility function, and I will use those terms interchangeably a utility function in a game theoretic model is the same thing as a pale function.

389
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:49,050
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Note that each player could have their own payoff function, so this in this accommodates the fact that even players with the same strategies available to them might value the outcome of the game differently so even if suppose suppose i'm playing a symmetrical game with a friend.

390
00:57:50,760 --> 00:58:01,320
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I might I might assign different values to the outcomes of the game that my friend, if I am very competitive then i'm going to assign heavy value to any outcome which I went.

391
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:10,620
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Where if my friends, is just it's just kind of an agent of chaos, they might assign uniform values to every outcome of the game, because they don't care what happens.

392
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:28,110
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We could also specify the game in terms of preferences over outcomes, instead of preferences over strategy profiles really all we're doing here is saying that a strategy profile uniquely maps to some outcome or maps to some outcome in the set of outcomes in the world.

393
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:32,250
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So what what we can do here is say.

394
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,870
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Strategy profiles can be kind of cumbersome because.

395
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:45,900
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Well they're they're this set of one strategy chosen for each player, and this can be kind of abstract, but we can also say that.

396
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:55,710
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: in real life, the things that each player chooses do lead to some actual outcome something happens when everyone chooses a stretch.

397
00:58:56,070 --> 00:59:05,940
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And so we could make our payoff functions, so that it is a function of an outcome, instead of directly of the function of strategy profiles, these things are relatively equivalent.

398
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:23,910
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But we have to make sure that our payoff function remains rational, in the sense that, if one player prefers an outcome to another than they should get a higher payoff for that outcome compared to an outcome that they prefer less.

399
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:29,460
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So here's the best one that i've ever made in the entire world.

400
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:40,050
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: let's let's let's play a game where we have two people trying to trying to figure out if they want to wear masks when they when they when they interact.

401
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:46,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: i'm not usually a pleasant person, which is why i'm inordinately proud this one so.

402
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:56,430
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: You when I when I teach this in the class that I teach it and it's often around Halloween so i'm usually especially morbid mood but anyway.

403
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:11,580
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Suppose we have we have two people or in this case to skeletons who are going to meet up to discuss the dilemma of trying to seek inherent meaning in the world, which offers none I also wrote this during the middle of the code pandemic, so I was feeling, especially nihilistic.

404
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:20,970
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The only reason I mentioned, this is that if you look at classic examples of game theoretic models, a lot of these models were developed during the Cold War.

405
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:31,890
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And you might think that the kind of attitude in the Cold War may have influenced the way that they framed their models and you'd be right there's a lot of models which are sort of fundamentally founded around.

406
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:44,640
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Do we fire missiles at the Russians, thereby obliterating all life on earth, so that that tended to be the motivation for a lot of those models and subsequently you see a lot of classic game three models that are designed around sort of the fundamental concept of.

407
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:54,690
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: How do we either engage in or avoid war on a scale never before seen how do we, how do we either engage in or avoid a total nuclear war.

408
01:00:55,890 --> 01:01:03,990
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And so there is that kind of nihilistic character to them that you tend to see propagate throughout the line of of classic game theoretic moments, but.

409
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:17,850
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But let's let's go back to our nihilistic skeletons here before they meet up the skeletons you're going to decide whether or not you're going to wear a mask because they don't they don't want to infect each other, you can even a skeleton cares and sunsets.

410
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:25,110
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And let's suppose that each skeleton in our model prefers that the other one wears a mask but.

411
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:34,560
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: finds learning mask themselves to be kind of inconvenient, so what they want here is for the other person to do the inconvenient thing, but for themselves to not have to do it.

412
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:43,680
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: there's a lot of there's a lot of scenarios that imagine we could think of where this is the case you never want to take on the inconvenience yourself if someone else can do it for me.

413
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:55,080
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So what does this mean in game terms, well, we have two players and we have a symmetrical game where each player has the same strategy available to themselves, they can either wear a mask or not.

414
01:01:55,830 --> 01:02:05,070
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And then there are actually four distinct outcomes of this game either both players wear a mask one doesn't and it might depend who doesn't.

415
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,760
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And the outcome or nobody wears a mask.

416
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:15,750
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Now let's think about preferences from one player's perspective because they're going to be symmetrical to the other player.

417
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:30,570
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Suppose suppose on player, one I would prefer the outcome, where I don't wear a mask and my partner does to the one where we both wear masks I prefer that one to the case where I wear a mask and they don't.

418
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:35,220
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And then I prefer, I still prefer that outcome to the one where nobody wears a mask.

419
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:45,420
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So here, this is expressing my preference order that i'd like it if somebody wears a mask but i'd prefer that it be the other first.

420
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:47,730
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The other skeleton here.

421
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:58,440
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This game, you can more or less directly translate into things like the other kind of classical example I think there, so the other kind of infectious disease related example would be.

422
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:05,880
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: User profile access before before sex and an attractive use a similar model to represent.

423
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:16,740
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: condom use behavior in men who have sex with men in the face of kind of an arbitrary sexually transmitted infectious disease, where you often kind of see similar preferences where.

424
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:26,820
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: You don't be you don't want to be the one who has to wear protection in some sense or you, you have you have some incentive to not do the protective behavior.

425
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:47,100
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So when we think about payoffs for this model, remember that if we have that one outcome is preferred to another one This implies that the payoff for that outcome should be at least as big as the payoff for the other outcome that you don't prefer and recall also that.

426
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:53,640
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We can have weak and strong preferences that govern the kind of strength of.

427
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:56,100
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: of difference in pain.

428
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:10,890
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But there's not a unique payoff mapping to a preference or so here's a preference order, but we could come up with a bunch of different payoff mappings that are consistent with that paint with that with that preference structure so.

429
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:14,160
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Again, from from player one's perspective.

430
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:26,700
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We could say that my most preferred outcome gives me 10 and then, if we both wear masks I get five if I have to wear a mask I get to and then, if nobody wears a mask I get zero.

431
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:31,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But we could also come up with the equivalent payoff order or payout structure where in.

432
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:43,500
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Both of the two sort of less preferred outcomes are equal right, this is legal, because I said that this is a week preference hear me wearing a mask or the other skelton doesn't.

433
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:57,630
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Is weekly preferred to nobody wearing the mask and week preference can allow for ambivalence, which is essentially what we're modeling here the same value is assigned to me wearing a mask and my partner, not to.

434
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:13,050
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Nobody wearing a mask, how do we interpret this difference, what does this mean from a from a game theoretic perspective in order for that to make sense we're going to need some idea of the solution of this game, what happens when we model, the situation and.

435
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:28,620
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This is where the game theory can can get a little counterintuitive relative decision theory, because the fact that two people have to choose things can mean that we get outcomes that we wouldn't have expected if If I could just do what I wanted in isolation.

436
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:37,530
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And this is sort of the fundamental solution question for game theory what's the predicted outcome of this game or any given game.

437
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:50,220
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Well we're gonna we'll get there, and to get there, we have to walk through a couple of kind of intermediate concepts so first i'm going to present the concept of a dominated strategy.

438
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:51,750
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So.

439
01:05:52,800 --> 01:06:04,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: let's suppose that a strategy so by strictly dominates another strategy as prime survive if it's the case, but the payoff for so by given.

440
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:20,760
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Given what everyone else does is bigger than the payoff to me of S privacy by given what everyone else does i'm going to use this notation so minus I to indicate the strategy profile for what everyone else does except me.

441
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:37,260
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So when I use this notation this is, I choose si everyone else does whatever they do, and this is, I choose as surprised if I survive and everyone else does what they do, but but keep that the same between these two cases so basically the saying.

442
01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:42,810
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: si just gives me more than as prime.

443
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:54,150
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And we could define a week dominance relation in the same way by by using a greater than or equal to so weak dominance can allow for equivalence again so.

444
01:06:55,980 --> 01:07:04,680
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: um so no matter what anyone else does I get more by choosing si than choosing us prime spot, so it could be the case that.

445
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:19,680
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If if me wearing a mask strictly dominates me not wearing a mask, this means that I will get more for wearing a mask given what other players are doing, then, if I didn't wear a mask given what other players are doing.

446
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:30,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: It wouldn't be terribly surprising them that strictly dominated strategy or strategies with strictly dominate other strategies might be within our solution sets.

447
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:48,510
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In particular, we can extend the concept of rationality to suggest that a rational player will never pick a strategy that is strictly dominated by some other strategy, this makes sense right because, if I were to play a strategy, but that gave me a lower payoff and some other strategy.

448
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:53,550
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I shouldn't pick that one that I would no longer be economically rational.

449
01:07:54,240 --> 01:08:01,920
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And if there is some strategy that strictly dominates every other strategy available to them a rational player will always play it.

450
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:15,210
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Again, this is just an extension of the concept of economic rationality, where, if I can form a preference order over things that happened I should always pick the thing at the top, and I should never pick, something for which there's something that I can see is better.

451
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:32,640
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Okay now let's let's define another intermediate concept, we could say that a strategy si as a best response to the strategy profile of other players, so the minus side if it's the case that I get a.

452
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:36,690
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Better ish pay off if I play si.

453
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:46,860
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Then, if I play so so prime survive for all other s prime survive So if I look at what other people are doing.

454
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:53,370
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The thing that is the best response to that is whatever whatever action gives me a higher pale.

455
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:04,920
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This will become more concretely clear when we when we come back to our example game, and I can actually show you what is a best response strategy in that case, but for now just.

456
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:13,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: kind of keep the definition in mind the best response is a strategy that gives me a better payoff than other strategies that I can pick.

457
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:31,950
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Given what other players are doing, which also means that a best response strategy weekly dominates all other strategies, given the strategy profile of the other players, so there is a correspondence between dominance and best responses in the game theoretic sense.

458
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:42,420
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And again, we can extend rationality to suggest that a rational player will always play the best response strategy to any strategy, they believe their opponent will play.

459
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:46,110
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So when we solve game theoretic models and when we think about game theoretic models.

460
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:55,680
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: there's a certain amount of inference going on implicitly about what we think the other player will do sometimes This is explicitly modeled in a game where you don't necessarily know.

461
01:09:55,860 --> 01:10:03,990
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What you think the other player will do, and you have to try to infer based on what you can glean about the type of person that they are.

462
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:18,780
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So now we have all the bits in hand to create a solution constant i'm going to define a special kind of strategy profile we're remember a strategy profile is the set of strategies chosen by each player.

463
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:28,380
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: we're going to call this thing as Star and it's going to be a Nash equilibrium, if it is the case that the payoff to each player.

464
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:36,090
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: For playing their Nash equilibrium strategy, given that everyone else is playing their Nash equilibrium strategy.

465
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:47,970
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: is bigger than or equal to the payoff to any given player of changing strategies from the Nash equilibrium strategy, assuming that everyone else continues to play, along with the Nash equilibrium strategy.

466
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:57,600
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So this is equivalent to saying that a Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile in which each player is playing their best response to all other players.

467
01:10:57,870 --> 01:11:04,530
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Another way of putting this is if we're at Nash equilibrium if we happen to all be playing, along with the Nash equilibrium strategy.

468
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:21,630
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Nobody could do better by changing their strategy if, for some reason the Nash equilibrium to the mask game is both of us wear masks neither of us could individually do better by choosing to not wear a mask we'd get a worst payoff assuming the other player continues to play along.

469
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:30,810
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: One thing that maybe makes Nash equilibrium, a little more intuitive is that we can think about them kind of like an equilibrium in a.

470
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:39,600
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In a dynamical systems model and an odd model if you're at Nash equilibrium or sorry if you're an equilibrium in an odd model.

471
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:45,330
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If you perturb the system off equilibrium she could change the value of that trajectory off the equilibrium, a little bit.

472
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:55,530
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The model comes back to that equilibrium right So if I start if I say the equilibrium is here, I start here and I bumped the system, a little bit this way.

473
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:10,170
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The system comes back to the equilibrium, and this is exactly what a Nash equilibrium course there's no way that if i'm if i'm playing, along with the Nash equilibrium, I could do better by changing my strategy, so the Nash equilibrium is sort of intrinsically stable.

474
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:21,420
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: It was actually Nash equilibrium were were derived by john Nash, who, if you've seen a beautiful mind them you've seen Russell crowe play them and that's that.

475
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:39,960
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And they were derived essentially using sort of differential equations and dynamical systems theory, so they are literally an extension of dynamical systems to game theory to say that we have an equilibrium solution concept that works and basically the same way.

476
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:45,960
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: it's just that we're in a discrete set space, instead of a continuous one.

477
01:12:51,960 --> 01:13:04,620
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So, now that we have a solution concept it'd be awfully nice if we could use that solution concept to actually figure out what happens in games that we might want to construct so.

478
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:15,570
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In order to do that, we could organize our game in a form that makes it a little bit easier to analyze so let's define a game matrix as a representation of a two player game.

479
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:27,210
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: For now, that includes players strategies and payoffs and each element of this game matrix is going to essentially contain the payoffs available to each player.

480
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:40,800
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Given that they choose a given pair of strategies i'll note that you can make a game matrix for games of arbitrary size with arbitrary numbers of strategies and arbitrary numbers plate there's, however.

481
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:52,860
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: It might not surprise you to learn that if you made a game matrix representation of a three player game, this is going to be a three dimensional matrix if you make a game matrix representation of a four dimensional game, this is a four dimensional matrix or a hyper cube and.

482
01:13:53,460 --> 01:14:03,330
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Perhaps unsurprisingly, the more players you add the more complicated it is to solve for the equilibrium by hand you could algorithmically solved by program the solution method into a computer and that would save you some hassle.

483
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:20,700
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I won't worry too much about the notation here, this is just this is just giving you a formal idea of what is stored in each game matrix element, but what I can do is give you a concrete example from our little skeleton mask wearing game so.

484
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:36,390
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Both player one and player to have the same actions available, they have the same strategies, but they can either wear masks or not, and the combination of actions chosen by each player determines the outcome of the game right so.

485
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:47,880
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If if both players wear a mask they both get five if player one wears a mask and player two dozen player, one gets to play or two gets 10.

486
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:53,370
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: and vice versa, so this is how you read the thing and i've color coded it's make it a little bit easier to read.

487
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:59,460
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Now that we have our game matrix, how do we solve for anything in this.

488
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:07,950
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Well, in our in a in a two player game what we're going to do is essentially solve for best responses for each player.

489
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:18,990
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So we're going to start column wise and identify the strategies that would identify player ones payoff in each column, because a column represents.

490
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:31,500
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: A strategy that player to has chosen and then we're going to go row wise and figure out which strategy maximize the payoff for player to because each row represents a strategy to play one chooses.

491
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:45,810
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Then, if there's some strategy pair that maximizes both player one and player tooth payoffs in this way that strategy, Paris and Nash equilibrium that's a bunch of words, how does this look in implementation i'm going to draw this out so.

492
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:51,480
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: here's our actually you know what i'm going to go back to our book and go back to our.

493
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:56,850
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Our matrix so.

494
01:15:59,070 --> 01:16:10,410
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If i'm player one if I think player two is going to wear a mask if we start looking down this column which of my two strategies gives me a higher payoff wearing a mask or not.

495
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:18,420
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Not yeah, so this is my best response you.

496
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:27,360
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: OK, so now, if I think player to is not going to wear a mask which thing gives me my higher pale just my best response.

497
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,700
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: we're in the mask yep.

498
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:38,670
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And then we'll go real wise same process if I if i'm player to now and.

499
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:45,540
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And I think that player one is going to wear a mask it's we're going to go down this road, what do I do.

500
01:16:49,740 --> 01:17:00,300
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I don't wear a mask and then, if we if we look at this row here if I think player one is not going to wear a mask what should I do what's my best response.

501
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:08,250
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: wearing a mask yeah so what we've arrived at is that there are two Nash equilibrium of this game.

502
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:10,080
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This one.

503
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:14,640
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And this one, which means that our Nash equilibrium.

504
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:16,740
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So, we could say.

505
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,470
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That star will say a star one is equal to.

506
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:25,890
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And m.

507
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:32,280
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And F star two is equal to em at.

508
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:48,120
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This might seem a little bit strange because what this game is predicted is that sometimes one player wears a mask sometimes the other player wears a mask So what do we do with that, how do we, how do we grapple with this well one interpretation is that.

509
01:17:49,620 --> 01:18:01,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This means that if you observe either of those behaviors out in the wild then these are rational behaviors right if you see two people meeting up or one person wears a mask and the other one doesn't.

510
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:11,280
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This is fine and it doesn't matter who that person was that is still a rational behavior so that would be consistent, that would be an observation consistent with the structure of the game.

511
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:22,950
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Another way to think of this might be well there's some probability that you end up in either of these Nash equilibrium, sometimes player one wears a mask sometimes player to wears a mask.

512
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:28,260
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And that probability is governed essentially by the sort of.

513
01:18:28,890 --> 01:18:37,710
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: weighted average of the payoffs that each players receive under the different Nash equilibrium which leads to a thing called a mixed strategy master equilibrium.

514
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:52,560
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Where each player plays one of their choices with a certain probability instead of deterministic we won't quite get into that but know that these are things that are legal that you could have Nash equilibrium in pure strategies, as these are where.

515
01:18:53,640 --> 01:19:01,050
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: People play strategies with probability one you could also have Nash equilibrium mixed strategies, where people play their strategies with some probability.

516
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:10,680
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So now we've demonstrated that we can actually solve for equilibrium of the game or predicted.

517
01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:17,190
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: predicted states of the game another kind of another interpretation of this sort of thing is that.

518
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:21,780
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Maybe we could think about this as a process that leads to people.

519
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:29,850
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: coming up with kind of a stable set of decisions with each other, and what that means is that maybe the players kind of.

520
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:40,830
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: pick their strategies at random for a while and kind of intuitively figure out which combination of strategies works best and through this process we stabilize out one of the Nash equilibrium or another.

521
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:53,400
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This would be more of the kind of dynamical systems view of a game that you, you start somewhere and then you gradually converge to an equilibrium and, in this case, your prediction to be that you'll converge to one or the other of the equilibrium.

522
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:57,990
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Any questions at this point.

523
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:16,560
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We can demonstrate pretty quickly this the stability of the Nash equilibrium right, because if we're at this Nash equilibrium, this first one.

524
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:22,590
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This one here if i'm player one, and I think player two is going to keep playing, along with the equilibrium.

525
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:30,750
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Well then, if I were to show up wearing a mask I get a lower payoff and so that is not incentivized I wouldn't be rational.

526
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:42,390
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Right, this is bad similarly if i'm player, too, and I think player one's not going to wear a mask if I were to consider changing my action to not wearing a mask i'd get a lower pay off, which is bad.

527
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:46,650
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: How do I know the payoffs in real life um.

528
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:56,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: It depends on the way that you've chosen to define your payoff structure so in a game like this, where i've chosen payoffs which are kind of ordinarily related to.

529
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:03,600
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Preference orders they're based purely on a hypothesis of how people behave right so so what i've done in this game.

530
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:11,040
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: As in a lot of mechanistic models is I have hypothesized that people have a certain preference order over outcomes in the game.

531
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:24,570
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And I have made that hypothesis concrete by assigning ordinary numeric values to the combinations of outcomes in the game and then i've solved things out to see where that leads know if I wanted to be more empirical about that.

532
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:34,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Maybe I would design a game where these payoffs aren't just kind of an abstract ordinary thing, maybe I think that they are governed by.

533
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:47,520
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The risk given under different situations so here again it's one of those cases where I could use something like an estimation of risk from a disease model from a disease transmission model to try and give myself a sense for what decisions people make.

534
01:21:49,140 --> 01:22:06,750
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So I thought that the primary driver of wearing masks or not is the risk mitigation given by wearing a mask, then I could estimate the risk to each player under each of these outcomes scenarios and use that as my payoff function.

535
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:09,660
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Similarly, if I like.

536
01:22:11,070 --> 01:22:18,900
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If we were representing a salary negotiation game that would actually be a really concrete case because the payoffs are literal dollars right I.

537
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:28,410
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: My employer say says i'm going to offer you 60,000 a year, plus benefits, I say no, I want 90,000 year plus benefits they come back and they're like I.

538
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:34,950
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Know i'm going to pay you 70,000 a year, plus benefits and, at the end of the day, i'm like either okay or no.

539
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:53,880
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Right and all of those all of those outcomes, like the end of the game and that in that particular game is either I taken offer or I don't all of those things mapped to specific dollar values that I actually received right and so those are things that we could know empirically.

540
01:22:55,140 --> 01:23:02,430
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In other classes of games like in a lot of health related games, there will be some components of the game which is risk related.

541
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:11,820
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And so, when we make payoffs for that component, we will tend to try to estimate that component based off of some empirical or model based estimate of risk itself.

542
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:18,990
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Where if we're doing a game that has an economic foundation like return on investment for some decision then.

543
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:23,730
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We would try to use dollar values or monetization or things like that.

544
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:34,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If we wanted to do something like estimate like we could do other sorts of risk estimates, where maybe we use burden of disease estimates to try to get a sense for how bad do people think different diseases are like.

545
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:47,700
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We could use burden of disease estimates to try to quantify just how bad is it if I get sick maybe we don't think risk is the only metric that's relevant for determining if I do a health related behavior maybe it's some.

546
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:56,100
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: multiplicative combination of risk and the burden and the expected burden of disease, if I get sick so maybe i'm more risk averse to things that are going to cripple me.

547
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:04,560
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: than things that are just going to inconvenience me for a bit, so we can we can pull that information from other sources, and that will tend to be how we.

548
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:20,670
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: kind of fill in the blanks of what values we actually use a balance between whether we need something empirical and what sources are available to derive those empirical estimates heck we could even do parameter estimation.

549
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:30,750
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: To try to estimate what some of the path terms are and i've done this in preliminary work for the Ebola outbreak.

550
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:45,720
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Where I used incidence curves cumulative incidents curves to estimate an actual cost term in a dynamic game theoretic model linked to a link to a disease transmission model so that's legal to like, even if the values and the the.

551
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:56,190
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Interpretation of the values is abstract you can do parameter estimation, to try to figure out what values are consistent with a given with with given data so that's another option.

552
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:10,050
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But this also speaks to the fact that the payoffs in the game, or the Nash equilibrium, the game might or might not be sensitive to.

553
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:21,960
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What the values of the payoffs are right, so there were multiple there were multiple payoffs that we could assign that were consistent with the preference structure that we set up for the game right.

554
01:25:22,710 --> 01:25:33,210
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And, and that means that maybe we can end up in a world with different Nash equilibrium, if we were to change those payoffs so let's let's try this really quick so i'm just going to run this out.

555
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:43,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If i'm player one what's my best response here well it's this by one, these are both actually best responses, because neither is strictly better.

556
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:48,600
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And over here what's best response, this one, this one, and this.

557
01:25:49,740 --> 01:26:00,060
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So now we've added a Nash equilibrium to our set of Nash equilibrium for this game, because we changed the payoffs right by making it so that.

558
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:09,780
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: These kind of off diagonal cases where one player wears mask and the other is equally bad for the player that doesn't wear the mask as the case for nobody wears a mask.

559
01:26:11,190 --> 01:26:15,240
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: we've we've allowed an additional Nash equilibrium into our system.

560
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:29,400
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Which means that when we are designing payoff functions to represent preference orders, sometimes we want to think about this from kind of a sensitivity analysis perspective, what would happen if I changed the payoffs in this game.

561
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:41,310
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: we're bait we're at 10 o'clock and we should take a break before lunch so i'm going to leave things there, but if you have questions, think about them and we will come back to that in 15 minutes.

562
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:46,500
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But I will let us take a quick break and i'll see you again short.

563
01:26:48,030 --> 01:26:48,690
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: section of the game.

564
01:26:51,090 --> 01:27:05,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And after I after I talked through that i'll take some questions and then I think i'd like to i'd like to take feedback on where we go from there there's a couple of potential options, based on the the time we've got today, this morning, particular.

565
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:07,230
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So.

566
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:20,460
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The essentially the procedure that we performed to to solve for Nash equilibrium in our in our particular game or in general really can be summarized as.

567
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:34,080
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: doing the following for each player and for each strategy profile containing the strategies of all other players you basically are maximizing the payoff for each player.

568
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:48,810
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Given the strategy profile of other all other players and then solving for the strategy that that maximizes that or the way that I would say this is find the argument that maximizes this function, the payoff to player I.

569
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:53,460
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Given that all other players play strategy profile so minus side.

570
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:59,520
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What we are back to the slides and I forgot to screen share.

571
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:11,760
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This one here so we're doing is we're doing an art Max where the argument we're maximizing is strategy profile so by our strategy has to buy and we are maximizing this function.

572
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:19,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The reason I present this is that sometimes you'll get a you'll get Pal functions which are defined as like you know.

573
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:29,970
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Sensible mathematical functions like like continuous mathematical functions and kind of similar similar features apply to the decision theoretic model.

574
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:47,430
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If you happen to have payoff functions which are reasonably well behaved, then you can do this maximisation procedure using calculus right if you have, if you have a continuous or, if you have a differentiable and single pete paid off function with respect to.

575
01:28:48,510 --> 01:28:50,580
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: With respect to some of the strategy for.

576
01:28:50,610 --> 01:28:51,360
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: files here.

577
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:58,590
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Then doing this, our Max is pretty easy you do the first order condition and you figure out which X.

578
01:28:59,970 --> 01:29:08,970
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Which X is the one that maximizes that also primarily tends to work if you have a continuous strategy space, which is legal right, you can do.

579
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:16,650
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Illegal and often seen in like again a lot of economically themed games like, if you want it to see.

580
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:25,620
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If you're doing a salary negotiation game, for example, and you're doing like a one off, then you might do something like.

581
01:29:27,810 --> 01:29:42,810
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What dollar value does each person the the employer and employee select for potential salaries were those dollar values are positive real valued and presumably your utility function over those would have some.

582
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:51,480
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: reasonably smooth features, certainly on the employer side you might see a utility function in salary that looks.

583
01:29:52,410 --> 01:30:02,190
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Maybe a little bit more like this right, where they'd rather pay you less than more, and on the employees side you might see utility function that's a little more like this, where they'd rather have more than less.

584
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:08,160
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And as long as those functions were single peaked and they didn't just kind of have a plateau.

585
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:15,150
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Or it if they had a plateau you've that still solvable is just a little more awkward but single weaknesses easier.

586
01:30:16,290 --> 01:30:28,350
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Then you could do maximisation through calculus this is this doesn't work, as well as you've got like a discrete set of things, then you tend to have to do, like a like discrete maximisation.

587
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:36,720
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Where I might if I were if I were faced with a circumstance like that what I would probably do is just implement a computer algorithm that that iterate through.

588
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:48,600
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Elements the axes of a game matrix and maximises that which isn't terribly hard, because the procedure that we saw earlier for to.

589
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:57,900
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Our to strategy game generalized is pretty nicely to more strategies more players things like that, and it really just comes down to.

590
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:08,670
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The kind of overall computational complexity of solving the thing under those circumstances so i'll pause for now do we have any questions.

591
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:20,130
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Up to this point because we've we've gotten through quite a lot about kind of the foundations of basic game theory, so it might be worth stepping back to see what made sense what didn't make sense.

592
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:29,640
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Are there areas that you're curious about applying these things to or how to apply some of this theory to different topical domains anything of that sort.

593
01:32:09,810 --> 01:32:16,260
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Well, if there are not questions here's where here's where you have a choice of what we move on to next so.

594
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:18,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: there's a few options.

595
01:32:20,790 --> 01:32:31,380
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I have more slides on game three to get into more elaborate forms of games that deal with less simple situations than these kind of one off standard normal form games.

596
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:42,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I also have a another model building exercise kind of analogous to the decision theory one where we kind of think through putting together a simple game theoretic model and what goes into that.

597
01:32:42,810 --> 01:32:55,830
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So those are some options we can spend more time on game theory this morning, or I could also just move straight into agent based models and leave sort of the rest of the game theory material as stuff for you to take a look at on your own time, if you want.

598
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:08,310
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So do we have do we have preferences or thoughts on that on that subject, would you rather see like would you like to do a bit of a game theory model building exercise.

599
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:14,580
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Would you like to see more game theory stuff in general, or would you like to move on to agent based model.

600
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:30,750
Adriana Perez: Can you make it public health applications, so that me, maybe we can make a decision, because I don't see how this plane in public health, for example.

601
01:33:31,860 --> 01:33:33,660
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: yeah so the vm.

602
01:33:34,770 --> 01:33:38,490
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The game three model building exercise that I had in mind was.

603
01:33:39,630 --> 01:33:40,800
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: was to think about.

604
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:44,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: tobacco industry behavior in the face of regulation.

605
01:33:46,230 --> 01:33:56,280
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: One of the one of the particular areas that I think came through is really interesting to us in public health is to think about the behavior of actors that we often don't explicitly model.

606
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:02,040
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So some applications one one classic application of game theory in.

607
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:10,920
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In public health is modeling vaccine behavior like taking taking some of the ideas that we were thinking of in the decision theoretic framework.

608
01:34:11,130 --> 01:34:22,470
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: and extending them to the game theoretic framework where vaccination is a collective behavior and, in particular, vaccination behaviors depend on how.

609
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:33,750
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: How people evaluate risk dynamically because because risk changes over time and so there's a classic paper or what I like to think it was a classic paper that.

610
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:46,110
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That models changing dynamics of vaccination over the course of an outbreak, because, of course, like outbreak dynamics will often strongly govern incentives to.

611
01:34:47,850 --> 01:34:54,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: To engage in particular behaviors you're, not the other example that I would tend to choose, in particular, is.

612
01:34:55,590 --> 01:35:10,890
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I wrote a paper, a number of years back, I kind of alluded to it modeling the use of condoms is prophylaxis for sexually transmitted infections among men who have sex with men, particularly in context of an ongoing outbreak so.

613
01:35:12,210 --> 01:35:20,310
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: motivated by the particular feature that prophylaxis use in that particular population is primarily driven by.

614
01:35:21,030 --> 01:35:30,990
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: By risk motivation, so if there weren't diseases going around presumably condom use just wouldn't really be a thing, and to a certain extent this is part of why we saw.

615
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:52,080
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Like the development of the HIV epidemic and things like that, because well without without preventing pregnancy as a motivation, there was not an incentive to use condoms among among men who have sex with men in the 70s and 80s, or so so.

616
01:35:53,580 --> 01:36:00,360
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Those models were intended to demonstrate the impact of explicitly modeling changes in behavior.

617
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:08,520
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Alongside a disease transmission system, the i'll find the.

618
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:12,390
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Vaccination paper it is.

619
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,500
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Chris bosh and someone else.

620
01:36:21,690 --> 01:36:25,830
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: it's literally called vaccination theory of games bouncing around that's the one thinking of.

621
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:27,930
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: It is.

622
01:36:31,410 --> 01:36:35,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So this one was more or less designed for.

623
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:48,570
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I suspect with stuff like flu vaccination in mind, because this papers from oh gosh from 2004 so this line of work actually goes back a decent ways.

624
01:36:49,620 --> 01:37:02,670
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And some of the things that I like about this, or you can see how they've chosen to build their payoff function i'm going to screen share this just kind of for a brief overview, you can see how they've chosen to build their path functions and things so.

625
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:20,490
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What they're building specifically is a thing called a population game model or more or less than evolutionary game model and they link this to an OD model of disease transmission so.

626
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:33,960
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: They have they have power components, one of which represents the risk of infection this one here and that risk of infection is governed by the the SI our model that.

627
01:37:35,070 --> 01:37:38,160
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The generates a simulated outbreak trajectory and.

628
01:37:40,050 --> 01:37:41,640
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Here, where is it.

629
01:37:45,450 --> 01:37:54,810
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Somewhere in here they use one of the specific components of the osi model to approximate the instantaneous risk, and one of the things that I quite liked about this paper is that they.

630
01:37:55,350 --> 01:38:03,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: They use it to demonstrate different regimes of vaccination in different sort of equilibrium states of vaccination, on the basis of.

631
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:13,800
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: different levels of risk of disease and I think this was a really clever and simple demonstration of the potential utility of.

632
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:19,050
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: of game theoretic modeling alongside epidemiological modeling.

633
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:26,040
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And it's a really it's a really clean model like they don't have to do a whole lot of elaborate stuff.

634
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:35,400
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: To hook those two models up together, and I am that was actually kind of personally eye opening for me that you could actually link these styles of models really easily because.

635
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:48,870
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: an evolutionary game theory model is basically just a system of differential equations and so it's fairly straightforward to integrate into another system of differential equations as long as you have a reasonable understanding of what what different features of those things me.

636
01:38:51,270 --> 01:39:01,620
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The other the the one of my own work that I sometimes use as an example is, let me dig that one up older paper of mine.

637
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:03,810
Which.

638
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:07,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But that's.

639
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:15,060
that's.

640
01:39:24,690 --> 01:39:25,650
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This one here.

641
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:30,390
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If you're curious.

642
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:38,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And for my purposes, I tend, I was particularly focused on dynamics of the system so.

643
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:43,290
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So in this case I implemented a tech.

644
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:54,480
stuff.

645
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:20,670
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So in this case I implemented a more or less a bayesian game between individuals were in when they do kind of a one off condom negotiation at the time that they meet to have sex and link this into effectively an si es style model.

646
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:29,700
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Where the model then breaks down into different kinds of pairs of people, depending on their their.

647
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:39,990
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Their condom use behavior the kind of main takeaway here is that when you have disease driven incentives to you to uptake up protective behavior.

648
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:49,350
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: You tend to get kind of oscillating cycles of of infection because perhaps not surprisingly, when.

649
01:40:50,190 --> 01:41:03,960
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: When prevalence goes up people perceive a higher risk and so adopt protective behaviors at higher frequency and then that tends to reduce prevalence because it's tamping down on transmission it's attenuated transmission.

650
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:11,310
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But then, as transmission goes down prevalence goes down people's perceived risk goes down and the incentive to stop using condoms.

651
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:30,510
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: starts up again and then you get an upswing and, in particular, one of the things that's noteworthy is that the timescale of adaptation at the person at the behavior level matters a lot like if people if people very strongly reacts to an outbreak and and.

652
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:32,340
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Adopt condom use pretty strongly.

653
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:43,380
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: it's possible for that that spike and condom use to drive the outbreak to extinction such that you do not get a recurrent outbreak once you don't get an endogenous recurrent outbreak.

654
01:41:43,620 --> 01:41:58,140
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Once the first one kind of results, even though the incentives to use condoms starts to decline toward the end where if that response is not strong enough, then you will tend to end up in these in this sort of awkward cycle world where.

655
01:42:00,930 --> 01:42:11,430
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: uptake is kind of constantly chasing the the actual outbreak peaks so from an from an infectious disease perspective, those are that's that's sort of what I think of for like.

656
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:17,190
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: For examples, there are others, actually, I have a paper to review right now, that is a.

657
01:42:22,650 --> 01:42:31,470
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: A adoption of non pharmaceutical interventions during the code pandemic that uses an evolutionary game theoretic model for similar things it's it's a.

658
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:40,770
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: 3% so I can't show you that and yet, but that is to say that folks are using this kind of approach to think about these kinds of behavioral interventions because.

659
01:42:42,930 --> 01:42:46,440
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Oh, because, because the pandemic, I think, particularly exposed.

660
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:55,890
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That we have to be thinking about dynamics of behavior change, particularly for all of these non pharmaceutical interventions like social distancing mask wearing and so on.

661
01:42:56,100 --> 01:43:04,440
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That depend on human compliance in order to work and for which human compliance tends to be very risk perception dependent.

662
01:43:05,970 --> 01:43:15,900
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Other other questions about some of the some of that stuff for examples and things there's another there's a longer line of work on the backs on game theoretic modeling the vaccination in.

663
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:25,320
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In epidemiological models with varying degrees of mathematical complexity, focusing on varying aspects of vaccination decisions so.

664
01:43:27,810 --> 01:43:34,260
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: it's it's if you're interested in those are areas that are not terribly hard to like dig up via literature search.

665
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:49,350
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Timber Luca while he was a Yale did a lot of work on this in allison Gabonese group but Chris bosh and David are and also do kind of like modeling and sometimes health policy issue related stuff.

666
01:43:55,980 --> 01:44:02,910
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The other The other thing I will note about this style of model is that because, in total, these models are essentially like they're.

667
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:10,410
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: dynamical systems models of disease transmission there's nothing that says you can't fit these things to data right you just need to define your output.

668
01:44:11,190 --> 01:44:23,550
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Your output variable and then a suitable data source and then you can fit the like the cost parameters of the of the model itself.

669
01:44:24,150 --> 01:44:33,660
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: As part of the the set of parameters of the overall model so in performing parameter estimation, you can make inferences about say the values of the relative risks.

670
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:42,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In in that behavioral model provided you know provided you don't have a an identify ability problem which sometimes happens, but.

671
01:44:44,610 --> 01:44:55,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But the fact that you can combine these frameworks in some sense gives you that power to also use an exploit the parameter estimation framework to make other kinds of influences so that you're.

672
01:44:56,730 --> 01:45:03,030
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: you're kind of inferences about behaviors get a little bit more empirical and that that can help kind of make some of the less abstract.

673
01:45:13,830 --> 01:45:23,820
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So I did see one request to do an example of the game theoretic models are do you have any other thoughts or preferences on that front, or shall I shall I have us take a look at that.

674
01:45:33,090 --> 01:45:34,710
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: All right, let's.

675
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:48,510
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: let's do this thing, so the context that I wanted to propose is kind of the ongoing struggle to figure out what to do with menthol cigarettes in the United States from a regulatory perspective, this is, this has been going on for a bit.

676
01:45:56,010 --> 01:46:05,400
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In particular, the FDA has been trying to trying to figure out how to regulate menthol cigarettes, more or less since the tobacco control act got passed, I think.

677
01:46:05,790 --> 01:46:17,730
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Possibly before that i'm not 100% sure on that front again people who are more involved in tobacco control research than me should feel free to jump in and correct errors that I make in presentation or naive to taste.

678
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:27,990
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: More or less the the long and short of it is the first time the FDA proposed menthol cigarette regulation.

679
01:46:30,030 --> 01:46:31,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Those regulations got snarled.

680
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:41,550
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: More or less indefinitely and nothing ever came of it, the reason for this is because it is very easy to block up federal regulation.

681
01:46:42,570 --> 01:46:45,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The way that the way that regulatory agencies tend to work is that.

682
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:51,930
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Before they actually publish a rule, so let me back up a little bit.

683
01:46:52,320 --> 01:47:04,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: A regulatory agency which is like the FDA the EPA their executive branch agencies that have the ability to promulgate rules that have the force of law they essentially have delegated authority from Congress.

684
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:18,900
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: To do things that that come with the full force of law, but in order to do that, they usually have to follow a particular procedure, and what that looks like is an agency has to.

685
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:32,100
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Essentially state their intention to regulate a particular domain and that that proposed regulation goes up for public notice and comment for a certain period of time.

686
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:48,720
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And the FDA regulatory agency by law has to respond to the comments that they receive, or they have to consider the comments that they received during that notice and comment period before they roll out a final rule know what this means is that.

687
01:47:49,950 --> 01:48:04,170
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: It is really easy for a large enough entity to challenge a role before it even gets proposed in draft form like if an Agency says hey we want to do something about menthol cigarettes, then.

688
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:11,370
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: it's not hard for tobacco company to roll out a massive lobbying campaign to to essentially letter bomb.

689
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:20,910
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: letter box, that means a different thing but but a carpet bomb the the FDA with with emails and letters that are like, no, no, no don't do this, this is bad.

690
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:35,430
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And the FDA has to consider that and some of what the signals is the opposition's willingness to go to bat against this regulation should the FDA or whatever regulatory agency, you want to pick chooses to pursue it so.

691
01:48:36,330 --> 01:48:48,780
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What what can happen here is that when when tobacco companies throw a bunch of comments at the FDA when they draft a rule this both slows down the.

692
01:48:49,500 --> 01:49:02,220
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The regulatory process because it's also not hard to request extensions of the notice and comment period, which of course means that regulation will take longer, even if it succeeds, which increases costs for the agency.

693
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:11,640
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: it's also not hard for say tobacco companies to signal that if you do this we're going to sue the pants off of you.

694
01:49:12,750 --> 01:49:24,630
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And so that can increase the risk of version of an agency to be like we don't want to get snarled up in legal proceedings for the next hundred years potentially losing those because.

695
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:31,110
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The industry interest or the opposition interests are willing to throw a lot of money at that, because the alternative is they lose a lot of money.

696
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:37,110
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So it's it's fairly easy to stop a regulation is the long and short of it.

697
01:49:38,820 --> 01:49:43,890
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And that more or less happened, the first time the FDA proposed mental regulation.

698
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:51,720
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: industry lobbyists came out hard against it and pretty much in a unified way that the major tobacco companies.

699
01:49:53,010 --> 01:50:02,760
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: mounted unified opposition to mental regulation, and while the initial proposed regulation was never explicitly dropped that I know of.

700
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:10,650
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: It just never went anywhere kind of perpetually remained in like preliminary form and never moved on and that.

701
01:50:11,190 --> 01:50:24,600
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That is a fairly common thing in in regulatory politics that an agency might not absolutely give up, but they might kind of tacitly give up, I never move anything moving anything beyond the notes and comment phase, because the sheer magnitude of opposition.

702
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:28,860
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: makes it quite clear that this is a no go that this thing's dead on arrival.

703
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:50,940
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Now within the last year or so uh the FDA has signal that it wants to try again on mental and this is really interesting to me because i'm because that raises the question to me of what's changed since, is it 20 2012 2014 or so tobacco folks was the first time the FDA tried.

704
01:51:04,170 --> 01:51:05,940
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: yeah the first menthol notice.

705
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:17,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: used to remember this and i'm blanking on it right now.

706
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:28,050
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: 2011 that sounds that sounds like the neighborhood.

707
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:43,950
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Okay yeah so so 2011 the advisory committee recommends removal of menthol cigarettes.

708
01:51:46,050 --> 01:51:47,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: sometime after that.

709
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:49,830
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The FDA.

710
01:51:52,500 --> 01:52:04,260
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The FDA published their proposal to regulate and then very shortly after that they got they got hit by by a lobbying and legal campaign.

711
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:11,910
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So if we think about if we think about industry actress then in this particular problem um.

712
01:52:13,170 --> 01:52:28,260
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: here's here's here's a here's a freebie question, what is the incentive for first tobacco companies to spend an enormous amount of money lobbying and suing to block regulation what's why, why did they do this.

713
01:52:37,830 --> 01:52:41,340
Nicolle Krebs: All to keep their consumers.

714
01:52:44,130 --> 01:52:57,360
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: To keep their consumers yeah and in some sense at heart to maintain their profits and revenues from those products because of a mental bandwidth would decimate that particular segment of the industry, which is.

715
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:04,470
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Multi billion dollar industry it's it's huge mental cigarettes in the US alone are are a big deal.

716
01:53:06,810 --> 01:53:07,350
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I want to say.

717
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:10,140
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Sorry go ahead, no, no.

718
01:53:10,770 --> 01:53:23,910
Kavita Mosalpuria: What we're saying is also the most common flavor used by the lessons and the young adults, so they are ensuring that they have a continuous flow of customers for the long term.

719
01:53:25,170 --> 01:53:41,040
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: yeah yeah so there's both short term and long term gains to be potentially lost in this world where where you have strong regulation, it also is, if I recall right, this is also a product that is disproportionately highly used among.

720
01:53:42,510 --> 01:53:44,640
Kavita Mosalpuria: African American blacks.

721
01:53:45,810 --> 01:53:59,280
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: yeah so you have that huge you have a big market there, and you also have a fairly natural legislative ally in the Congressional black Caucus which which tended to oppose.

722
01:53:59,310 --> 01:54:00,990
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And still I think tends to oppose.

723
01:54:01,110 --> 01:54:12,420
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Mental bands, out of concern for essentially for overly aggressive policing, because there is also a history of aggressive policing for tobacco related offenses.

724
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:25,740
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: On on targeting the black Community so there's there's this kind of interesting policy alliance that happens there because of the demographics, using the product and so.

725
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,470
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So yeah you have this oh no go ahead.

726
01:54:29,370 --> 01:54:34,110
Adriana Perez: And it will do a very similar to breed settings in 2011.

727
01:54:34,650 --> 01:54:50,430
Adriana Perez: The black upon upstate so just seen his cigars and see her in laws which are different, that the permissions yards we're not in the market, so now, the big tobacco company, instead of providing cigars are extremely.

728
01:54:51,300 --> 01:55:09,930
Adriana Perez: expensive because of the taxation brain then scenarios, you can get to full adult or something like that, so I think that that's the reason, because they are now regulating toes and came back again because, again, did you the doodles can for $1 right.

729
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:12,450
Adriana Perez: So that's though that are some cheers.

730
01:55:14,190 --> 01:55:15,840
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: yeah so new products.

731
01:55:15,930 --> 01:55:28,230
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: have a huge impact on both the regulatory regime and the responses of of industry actors as well and, in addition to, in addition to things like new cigar scenarios other kinds of.

732
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:41,250
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: combustion based tobacco products, we of course have E cigarettes and the whole ecosystem surrounding that that that our regulatory state is still kind of struggling to keep up with.

733
01:55:43,050 --> 01:55:56,520
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So suffice it to say the market landscape now is a fairly different beast from the market landscape in 2011 and that may have consequences on how a regulator may view.

734
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:11,880
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The urgency of the need for regulation and potentially the feasibility of regulation, which is what I kind of want that sort of the aspect that I want to take a look at now, so the thing that I want to do is focus on the.

735
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:27,840
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: focus on the industry actors, because, as I said, I think it is, I think it is worthwhile sometimes to spend some time thinking about well from from our perspective in a lot of ways, how the enemy thinks because.

736
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:38,640
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: an enemy that you don't understand is more threatening and a lot of ways, because because their actions are harder to predict where one that you do.

737
01:56:39,390 --> 01:56:50,220
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: becomes strategically comprehensible, which is not to say that industry actors are always straight up the enemy, but sometimes from a regulatory perspective, you can kind of predict to the opposition is going to be right so.

738
01:56:51,960 --> 01:57:00,420
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So I think it is often instructive to think from the opposition perspective and try to figure out what those incentives are and how those incentives may.

739
01:57:00,690 --> 01:57:07,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Change under different market conditions, in particular, one of the things that's motivated the example that we're going to look at for me is.

740
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:20,070
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This is kind of inspired by sort of current unpublished work that that unfortunately i've been dragging my feet on because covert hitting to change my research it changed my entire career trajectory quite a lot.

741
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:26,610
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But the the character of this work was motivated by the observation that.

742
01:57:28,620 --> 01:57:43,080
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: that one of the major tobacco companies altria padam enormous stake in e cigarettes, through their acquisition of jewel or through their majority share a jewel and and that one since kind of gotten itself mired in a bunch of trouble because.

743
01:57:44,130 --> 01:57:51,990
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: tool with it has been fairly scandal ridden and they've been hit pretty hard by potential regulation and all tree has written off bad investment and so on and so forth.

744
01:57:52,320 --> 01:58:10,110
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Nevertheless, we are in a world now where traditional tobacco companies have stakes in a whole different product category and, in some ways a device that uses kind of fundamental tobacco like to in a different form factor and in a more like.

745
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:22,140
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: techie form factor, so what this also means to me is that the tobacco companies have a more diverse profile of products, now that they did in 2011.

746
01:58:22,410 --> 01:58:32,610
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And that may change the outlook in some sense for that may change their incentives in different areas, the other observation that I thought was possibly worth making is that.

747
01:58:33,180 --> 01:58:44,250
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: When I started this work, a few years ago it wasn't just the tobacco companies had stakes in e cigarette manufacturers, but they had differential strengths of stakes like.

748
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:57,810
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: By by being the majority shareholder of Joel and the effective owner of jewel altria essentially cornered a huge part of the E cigarette market in a way that its competitors.

749
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:04,380
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: had not their their competitive efforts in the E cigarette market we're just not nearly as.

750
01:59:04,650 --> 01:59:13,050
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: As strong and they weren't nearly as market dominance, which meant that you ended up with companies with differential market dominance over this new product category.

751
01:59:13,590 --> 01:59:18,510
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Why do I think this is important at all well I might be inclined to suspect that.

752
01:59:19,410 --> 01:59:28,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We talked about just a little while ago that menthol cigarettes are appealing to younger demographics and can be used as kind of an initiation product as sort of a.

753
01:59:29,370 --> 01:59:44,040
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: thing that a way to get new users into into smoking and into using tobacco products well E cigarettes, have also been fairly appealing to younger demographics and so, if part of the rationale on the.

754
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:59,760
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: On the tobacco company front is to maintain this pipeline of younger users, then we might be inclined to suspect that having an e cigarette portfolio may fulfill a similar function.

755
02:00:01,530 --> 02:00:01,920
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: and

756
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:08,610
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And we, we also see that the regulatory state has.

757
02:00:10,020 --> 02:00:21,120
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: has had to kind of catch up with with flavored E cigarettes, particularly as as devices that were really appealing to younger demographics, such that now, I believe.

758
02:00:22,170 --> 02:00:30,720
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Tobacco and mental are the only acceptable flavors in e cigarettes, but that's still essentially leaves a carve out for menthol flavored E cigarettes right so.

759
02:00:32,370 --> 02:00:48,630
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So we have a product that we might think fulfill some kinda similar functions in addition to things like like scenarios and other sorts of tobacco products that may be kind of acting to fill sort of similar market holes.

760
02:00:49,650 --> 02:00:52,920
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: As might be left if menthol cigarettes were to be banned or.

761
02:00:54,390 --> 02:00:56,460
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Or if their usage possibility declined.

762
02:00:58,050 --> 02:01:14,190
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So this, to my mind, forms the context for how we might start to think about an industry model of how how tobacco companies might respond to proposed regulation on menthol cigarettes like a proposed ban on mental cigarettes so.

763
02:01:15,330 --> 02:01:17,970
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: there's our there's our lengthy background.

764
02:01:20,730 --> 02:01:23,880
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And i'm gonna i'm gonna start a new spreadsheet here.

765
02:01:25,740 --> 02:01:34,260
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If it seems overly simplistic but i'm doing a lot of my like basic game and decision theory modeling in excel that's actually fine like these models, at the end of the day, are not.

766
02:01:35,490 --> 02:01:39,780
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: terribly hard to construct and analyze at a simple level like if you're doing a.

767
02:01:41,670 --> 02:01:50,910
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: One off like a normal form game that's actually something that you can implement pretty easily just did an excel spreadsheet and analyze it through that format and it it works pretty well.

768
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:56,040
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: it's a little low tech but hey use but use it you've got use what works right.

769
02:01:57,180 --> 02:01:57,900
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So.

770
02:02:01,650 --> 02:02:13,920
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: To start with, we need to think about, we need to think of course about players strategies and so, who are the relevant actors in our world, what can they do and what do they get out of what they do.

771
02:02:15,660 --> 02:02:16,230
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So.

772
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:23,160
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What I might propose is that we start by thinking about a world where.

773
02:02:24,030 --> 02:02:29,850
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: A couple of tobacco companies are trying to figure out what they want to do in the face of proposed regulation because.

774
02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:42,930
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Companies are not always a monolithic coordinated block they have their own incentives and they do compete to varying degrees within their domains, we might argue that there's kind of a trial happily of.

775
02:02:43,350 --> 02:02:47,040
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: of tobacco companies that exhibit some kind of cartel like behavior but.

776
02:02:47,910 --> 02:03:06,120
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: They, but they do want users using their products over a competitive like as much as as much as toothpaste is frankly entirely interchangeable both colgate and P amp G care a lot about people using their toothpaste right, so we might suspect that similar dynamic sexist here.

777
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:13,590
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So, to make our game as simple as possible let's think about two players right so.

778
02:03:15,690 --> 02:03:17,820
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Company a.

779
02:03:21,690 --> 02:03:24,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And if we're thinking in this kind of.

780
02:03:28,260 --> 02:03:30,900
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Product dominance kind of area.

781
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:39,270
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We might think about these companies is having product portfolios that are stronger or weaker in different types of products right so.

782
02:03:42,930 --> 02:03:45,660
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Part of the part of the motivating example, for this is that.

783
02:03:48,000 --> 02:04:01,500
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Oh heck i'm it's now been long enough that past me knew the name of not altria in this context and current me, for some reason does not which which companies, the current market leader in mental cigarettes.

784
02:04:15,780 --> 02:04:17,700
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Oh may it may come to me.

785
02:04:17,790 --> 02:04:20,640
Nicolle Krebs: Give Dr Reynolds.

786
02:04:21,570 --> 02:04:22,650
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I think that's right, I think it is.

787
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:24,420
Nicolle Krebs: Reynolds newport's.

788
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:27,960
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: yeah I think yeah that sounds right.

789
02:04:30,210 --> 02:04:31,230
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So we could think about.

790
02:04:31,380 --> 02:04:33,750
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: i'm going to be somewhat unsettle.

791
02:04:36,090 --> 02:04:37,770
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: There altria and Reynolds.

792
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:44,970
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And so we might think about them as having differential dominance across product categories like, if I remember right altria.

793
02:04:45,630 --> 02:04:57,810
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Has mental cigarette brands, but they're not the big player in that space, maybe this has changed since the last time I looked at it, but that's that's my rough recollection on the subject so.

794
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:04,830
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: kind of to think about our conceptualization of this world let's suppose that let's suppose we think about.

795
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:08,160
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: menthol cigarettes.

796
02:05:10,290 --> 02:05:12,780
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Were this is kind of a.

797
02:05:21,540 --> 02:05:26,130
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Just kind of again to lay out our sort of conceptual argument for how we're going to build things about this month.

798
02:05:27,810 --> 02:05:30,120
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We could do something like E cigarettes.

799
02:05:31,290 --> 02:05:40,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Where i'm going to go off the slightly older notion that altria is more dominant this notion has has reynold shown any signs of life in the cigarette.

800
02:05:41,250 --> 02:05:41,730
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: area.

801
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:54,840
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Last like three years ago, when I looked last it was pretty pathetic but but they they have since innovated it seems.

802
02:05:55,860 --> 02:05:57,150
Adriana Perez: I don't think so either.

803
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:05,400
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So views is doing well now that's funny to.

804
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:06,420
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That is, that is.

805
02:06:06,690 --> 02:06:15,660
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: that's awfully interesting that they've they've done well, that it is possible, perhaps that they've done well on the on the back of jewel getting nailed.

806
02:06:16,770 --> 02:06:17,970
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And, and some of the.

807
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:30,030
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Some of the smaller products getting nailed about 30% market share each wow that is an incredible game like views was not even on the radar a few years ago.

808
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:40,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: that's interesting that and that is likely going to change the results of this model even relative to the last time I did a look at this so that's that's awfully fascinating to me so.

809
02:06:43,950 --> 02:06:53,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: yeah 30% market share each like I feel like it, I think it used to be that, like jewel was about 60% of the market itself, so this would suggest that views is eaten into that pretty nicely.

810
02:06:59,670 --> 02:07:02,850
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Over 75% yeah they just they just won the game for a while.

811
02:07:09,330 --> 02:07:21,840
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Are there other product categories that we might think are kind of in this domain of potential equivalence or potential replacement products for menthol cigarettes, for which say altria and Reynolds have differential dominance.

812
02:07:43,950 --> 02:07:52,170
Nicolle Krebs: we're gonna have the category of the heat heat not burn products, but I don't think either of these companies.

813
02:07:53,220 --> 02:08:02,400
Nicolle Krebs: actually have a product that's on the market, I Coast was on the market, but they actually had to take that off of the market because of a patent disagreement.

814
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:16,500
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: yeah and the heat not burn products those don't have full approval, like those can't be sold broadly the US right like there's still certain markets only is that it or am I am I behind the times.

815
02:08:16,530 --> 02:08:18,330
Nicolle Krebs: yeah yeah it was only.

816
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:21,630
Nicolle Krebs: Certain markets.

817
02:08:24,330 --> 02:08:25,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Where are they now.

818
02:08:28,530 --> 02:08:34,260
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Are they now actually broadly available in the US, or are they probably permitted in the US now or.

819
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:46,680
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Okay, I Kostas products with the mta and Mr TPA authorization, so they have the potential for broader distribution now so we could we could think about keep not burn potentially.

820
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:51,630
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In potentially in the pipeline as maybe a longer term thing.

821
02:08:52,680 --> 02:08:55,440
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: remind me who makes lycos is it Reynolds or altria.

822
02:08:57,690 --> 02:09:03,930
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: he left the market in November, because the FTC case altria functionally as I coast so.

823
02:09:05,850 --> 02:09:06,300
let's.

824
02:09:07,590 --> 02:09:10,470
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: let's put this in just just because maybe we want to think about it.

825
02:09:15,510 --> 02:09:18,420
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Now, Philip Morris through altria through yeah.

826
02:09:21,060 --> 02:09:25,920
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I enjoyed the the convoluted web of tobacco company ownership, that is a whole thing.

827
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:36,240
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So would we tend to say then that altria has potential for dominance in the heat not burn category in the current oh licensing okay gotcha.

828
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:39,090
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So licensed from felt marks.

829
02:09:43,710 --> 02:09:51,360
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Like would we tend to think that either company them is, it is the only one in the US so potentially.

830
02:09:53,070 --> 02:09:53,580
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: A minute.

831
02:09:55,770 --> 02:10:02,310
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And, and then potentially so oral products that could compete.

832
02:10:04,080 --> 02:10:09,510
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And the FTC case involves British British American rounds.

833
02:10:10,530 --> 02:10:13,320
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Good this is that's good that's Nice.

834
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:18,990
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So then.

835
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:26,310
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If we think about oral products would we tend to think that either company is Is it better position than the other here.

836
02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:33,150
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So both without like.

837
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:43,530
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Something like this they've got something out there, but it's not just winning the game.

838
02:10:48,930 --> 02:10:57,570
Nicolle Krebs: I think xin oral patches have the most market share, but i'm not sure which company has those.

839
02:11:09,090 --> 02:11:16,770
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So I think, for the moment, I shall leave this as it is, unless we must we're reasonably certain that there is sort of differential dominance here but.

840
02:11:18,030 --> 02:11:23,640
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Then kind of to summarize where we're at we have a suspicion Ben that these companies.

841
02:11:24,150 --> 02:11:40,380
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: may have different sorts of product lines that could potentially fill some similar roles that menthol cigarettes currently fulfill on the market, which might be interesting from the perspective of what happens if this market segment effectively goes away the US.

842
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:49,290
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: pmi successfully acquires which match, then a would have dominance over our so there's stuff percolating that could change the seat.

843
02:11:51,390 --> 02:11:53,070
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: that's that's interesting.

844
02:11:54,360 --> 02:12:01,230
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I will say that my so our product is basically below which is, which is British American.

845
02:12:03,720 --> 02:12:10,770
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This, I think, is where we start to get into kind of the the future potential question in in coming up with.

846
02:12:11,310 --> 02:12:24,150
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: monetization or components of a utility function, where we might start to think about like how do these companies evaluate their market segments and their future market segments, which is also, which is also a thing.

847
02:12:25,470 --> 02:12:26,040
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So.

848
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:42,300
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: we'll come back to this in a little bit because let's let's set up a very, very simple game played between, for the moment, ultra and runs the only reason i'm not including any other tobacco company here is that.

849
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:48,180
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Two player game is a lot easier to represent and I don't want to draw Q so.

850
02:12:49,680 --> 02:13:05,190
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Obviously this is, this is an oversimplification and it's going to be an aggressive oversimplification of many, many, many, many things, but bear with me, because sometimes we can get interesting results or interesting, we can learn things from aggressively over simplified models so.

851
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:08,310
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: let's let's think about something like follow.

852
02:13:09,690 --> 02:13:22,770
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If there is, if if we get a proposed menthol ban on the table suppose that that is the policy that the FDA wants to promulgate just a blanket ban on the sale of menthol cigarettes.

853
02:13:24,450 --> 02:13:34,110
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Let us suppose also but that ban does not directly touch other product categories for the moment, we can think about cases where it does.

854
02:13:35,700 --> 02:13:44,310
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: To TEE up why this is sort of on my mind and why this current situation is so interesting I think it's actually kind of interesting that the FDA chose to both.

855
02:13:45,330 --> 02:13:57,570
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: kind of start the ball rolling on new mental regulation and also hit jewel with a pretty hard withdrawal of product approval, which then got walked back after after.

856
02:13:59,370 --> 02:14:02,520
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: After jewel I believe sued for a stay on that.

857
02:14:03,750 --> 02:14:07,260
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So there they currently have a temporary stay on the.

858
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:15,120
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: On the effective ban on jewel products, I think that's where we're at right now again, please correct me if i've said something wrong or dumb.

859
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:25,170
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But but, from my perspective, one of the main things that I thought was quite interesting was the fairly rapid reversal a fee of the effective ban on julie's cigarettes.

860
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:29,130
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So let's.

861
02:14:30,330 --> 02:14:43,110
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: let's think about what the tobacco companies might do under different circumstances, so the way that I, I might tend to frame this simplistically is that the actions available i'm strategies, if you like, could be.

862
02:14:47,430 --> 02:14:50,610
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: opposed delay or accept a potential back.

863
02:14:51,900 --> 02:15:00,030
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: were opposed means you you go to bat, and you sue the pants off of the FDA and anyone anyone remotely related to them.

864
02:15:01,290 --> 02:15:17,550
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Delay is sort of the sort of cheap strategies, where you carpet brom with them with your carpet bomb the notes and comment period you you request multiple extensions have been noticed in comment period you basically tried to kill the thing by by slow rolling it to death.

865
02:15:18,990 --> 02:15:34,890
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: or even if you're not successful, you might you might use delaying tactics to try to buy yourself time to reshuffle your product profile, so that you know you're not you're not getting hit as hard and accept would be you don't you don't do anything you don't do anything you don't.

866
02:15:38,130 --> 02:15:49,560
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: You don't take measures that that aggressively trying to stop up the regulation and maybe we don't think this is terribly likely to happen, but it's worth keeping in mind as a thing.

867
02:15:51,270 --> 02:15:56,010
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Are we broadly okay with this is there other stuff that we should maybe think about in a in a fairly straightforward model.

868
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:20,310
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So this seems like a kind of okay starting point for us.

869
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:30,240
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So let us, let us make a little game matrix here, so these are the actions, these are the players are game matrix is going to look like from.

870
02:16:32,220 --> 02:16:34,380
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: owes de les eps.

871
02:16:36,900 --> 02:16:43,620
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: i'll put this in in chat again case you want to go back to the thing i'm looking at sheet to going to rename these things so.

872
02:16:58,620 --> 02:17:01,020
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: beausoleil accept this is going to be a this is going to be our.

873
02:17:04,560 --> 02:17:10,770
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: History remember how to color code these things to think it was all true is blue and Reynolds was orange was the maybe the other way around.

874
02:17:12,390 --> 02:17:12,840
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So.

875
02:17:13,860 --> 02:17:28,080
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Now our task really is to fill in the payoff matrix, and this is where this is where it gets a little crunchy because we want to start thinking about what do tobacco companies get out of different kinds of outcomes of this game so.

876
02:17:29,640 --> 02:17:30,090
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: um.

877
02:17:31,410 --> 02:17:42,540
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So the way that we think about this, generally speaking, is that pairs of actions define the outcomes of the game, so our outcomes then going to move this down.

878
02:17:54,480 --> 02:17:57,480
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So we have a pose oppose.

879
02:17:59,820 --> 02:18:00,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: A little face.

880
02:18:01,650 --> 02:18:02,670
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Was delay.

881
02:18:04,650 --> 02:18:05,970
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: supposed to accept.

882
02:18:07,440 --> 02:18:08,040
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: and bad.

883
02:18:09,540 --> 02:18:13,950
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: delay delay delay except except except I think that's.

884
02:18:17,820 --> 02:18:28,770
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That missing i'm assuming that there are symmetrical parish these things right so there's also a delay oppose there's an accepted pose and so on, so that we can cover our total space.

885
02:18:30,210 --> 02:18:32,130
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So uh.

886
02:18:38,670 --> 02:18:51,360
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Now we can start to think about what these map to from the perspective of like what comes out of the regulatory process if this is how the companies behave, so I might propose that in this circumstance.

887
02:18:53,760 --> 02:19:00,090
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If you get monolithic opposition I would I would be very surprised if it didn't straight up kill the regulation.

888
02:19:02,490 --> 02:19:13,380
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: folks folks who are involved in this, please tell me otherwise i'd be interested if you think that there are paths for the regulation to survive if if we end up with monolithic opposition from the tobacco companies on it.

889
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:23,910
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: i'm basing this kind of on my prior from the 2011 case where 2012 and so on, where this thing just got stopped up until it died.

890
02:19:35,850 --> 02:19:40,770
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In particular, I might suggest that this one is actually kind of a dead on arrival like I would be very surprised if.

891
02:19:42,030 --> 02:19:51,090
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If if mental regulation was able to make it much past the initial notice and comment phase if there's if there's a huge coordinated campaign against it.

892
02:19:54,480 --> 02:20:03,960
Nicolle Krebs: Would it matter like who's an office, like the administration, you know whether, because by it, an administration they're.

893
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:09,510
Nicolle Krebs: very supportive of harm reduction shortages.

894
02:20:10,530 --> 02:20:14,340
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The administration, probably does matter, although I might suggest that it's.

895
02:20:16,470 --> 02:20:18,030
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The thing about the administration that.

896
02:20:18,030 --> 02:20:28,410
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Probably matters is some combination of office of management budget it friendliness toward regulation general plus whoever the Commissioner of the of the FDA is.

897
02:20:29,580 --> 02:20:30,120
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Like I think.

898
02:20:31,890 --> 02:20:45,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I thought it was interesting that Scott gottlieb forever, for example, seem to be fairly strong on the idea of mental regulation his successor less so, partly because the coven pandemic hit this 10 year and.

899
02:20:46,770 --> 02:20:47,400
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I.

900
02:20:49,500 --> 02:20:53,430
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I think the current Commissioner seems to be a little stronger on that notion.

901
02:20:55,620 --> 02:21:05,340
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So there isn't there is likely to be an administration effects for the time being I i'm not convinced that that administration.

902
02:21:05,820 --> 02:21:15,120
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Support for regulation is necessarily enough to prevent a regulation from getting killed in the face of coordinated opposition mostly because my prior tends to be that.

903
02:21:16,740 --> 02:21:19,350
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Regulations are pretty easy to kill in the US.

904
02:21:23,700 --> 02:21:26,670
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But again i'm happy to hear dissenting thoughts on the subject like if.

905
02:21:27,780 --> 02:21:31,290
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The folks folks have experienced, otherwise I would love to know that.

906
02:21:48,510 --> 02:21:55,380
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The weirder cases start to happen in these kind of I guess off diagonal outcomes right so opposed delay.

907
02:21:57,120 --> 02:22:14,160
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I might suggest that what we might see here is still dead put but not just yet like this is, this is a case for maybe you see like an extended notice and comment period, and then the FDA gives up at some point, so that later.

908
02:22:16,740 --> 02:22:19,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This is this one this outcome is weird.

909
02:22:23,670 --> 02:22:24,210
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What what.

910
02:22:25,290 --> 02:22:45,480
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: here's here's here's the question that I will post directly to to folks what do we think would happen if you have non coordinated industry behavior like if some tobacco companies like okay cool like however likely we think that actually is what happens there to to regulation.

911
02:22:49,590 --> 02:22:57,930
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Do we think it would act something would actually make it through in that circumstance I don't know like I don't have a very strong prior up, because this is a weird case.

912
02:23:09,210 --> 02:23:14,370
Nicolle Krebs: I guess it would come down to like how strong do we think that one opposition could be.

913
02:23:15,930 --> 02:23:17,430
Nicolle Krebs: If it's acting alone.

914
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:22,560
Nicolle Krebs: Compared to having them both be opposing.

915
02:23:23,580 --> 02:23:27,270
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: yeah I, I agree that that is the crux of it.

916
02:23:29,490 --> 02:23:30,000
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I.

917
02:23:31,440 --> 02:23:40,710
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If I have a prior on this I I maybe would suspect that you might actually get a rule promulgated out of this regime, because.

918
02:23:43,140 --> 02:23:50,190
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Because the appearance of non coordination between tobacco companies might be enough to kind of sneak something through.

919
02:23:51,570 --> 02:24:07,590
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: It might get mired for a bit and it might not be clean, but you might be able to get something by on this, because this might also mean that you're able to split other interest groups on the subject, so that you don't get as fully coordinated opposition all around.

920
02:24:09,690 --> 02:24:11,520
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I think that's.

921
02:24:12,810 --> 02:24:21,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Again, this is, this is a tough one, and this is me kind of fiddling with different kinds of judgment calls on the subject, because this would be weird but.

922
02:24:23,220 --> 02:24:31,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But maybe there are worlds, in which this could happen, where you don't get coordinated industry opposition, which would be awfully interesting if that's incentivize full so we could say.

923
02:24:41,580 --> 02:24:50,250
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Something like that all formalized to smoke as we go but that's kind of my word a description of what I think might happen to delays, probably means, just like.

924
02:24:52,710 --> 02:24:53,400
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: way later.

925
02:24:54,480 --> 02:25:04,290
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Like if all that happens is both companies are like we're going to hit you with a bunch of letters and we're going to request a bunch of extensions of the notice in common period but we're never actually going to sue.

926
02:25:04,560 --> 02:25:12,210
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And we're never really going to actively threatened to sue then i'd wager that stuff goes through, it might just happened a few years down the line, or a year down the line, or something like that.

927
02:25:14,280 --> 02:25:17,160
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: delay except I think I would call this a promulgated.

928
02:25:20,850 --> 02:25:23,940
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: A bit later, and this is just promulgated.

929
02:25:26,010 --> 02:25:26,280
The.

930
02:25:29,250 --> 02:25:41,850
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I would be shocked if we ever saw something like that, but hey, we have to think about it, because we need to think about contingencies in in game theory so even the weird cases, we need to be prepared to explicitly model.

931
02:25:43,770 --> 02:25:51,150
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So now our question is how do these things map to the payoffs that our tobacco companies get right.

932
02:25:51,990 --> 02:26:01,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So this is where we start to think about the economic incentives that companies face under these different regulatory regimes and maybe i'll make this a little bit clear that what we're thinking about is.

933
02:26:15,480 --> 02:26:18,810
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So other product categories remain unchanged but.

934
02:26:19,890 --> 02:26:34,020
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But we try to ban menthol cigarettes again this is, this is a simple case There probably are other kinds of combinations we might be able to contemplate but we're there's only so much we can do in the time span, we have available to us to work on.

935
02:26:35,160 --> 02:26:35,610
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So.

936
02:26:36,750 --> 02:26:49,110
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: um so for each of these product categories, then each company does make a certain amount of profit right that that's how we might think about this, or we might also think about this, as they receive.

937
02:26:49,530 --> 02:26:57,540
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We can think about their past has been kind of proportional to the share of those markets that they receive modified by the size of the market right, so if.

938
02:26:58,020 --> 02:27:08,040
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If the heat not burn market is teeny tiny, even if a company is potentially dominance over that market then they're expected returns are not necessarily very big from that part of the market.

939
02:27:09,540 --> 02:27:10,080
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So.

940
02:27:12,510 --> 02:27:17,550
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So to start to start to fill these things in we could think about the.

941
02:27:20,910 --> 02:27:23,250
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The different market components.

942
02:27:26,430 --> 02:27:35,370
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And if this is a case where if we have some some kind of back of the envelope dollar values we can start to use those, otherwise we can kind of come up with sort of.

943
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:40,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: More abstract description so men fall.

944
02:27:42,750 --> 02:27:44,640
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Cigarettes E cigarettes.

945
02:27:46,230 --> 02:27:46,890
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: not burn.

946
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:48,600
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And portal.

947
02:27:51,630 --> 02:28:03,570
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Do we have a rough estimates for the magnitude of the markets, even if it's like a an order of magnitude on like tend to the whatever do we have thoughts about sort of the scales of these things.

948
02:28:17,070 --> 02:28:21,540
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Another one where, at some point, I had a rough guess the size, the mental secret market.

949
02:28:23,160 --> 02:28:31,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I think it's like 60 70% 60 70% of the total cigarette market.

950
02:28:32,070 --> 02:28:35,340
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: yeah yeah Okay, so that would.

951
02:28:42,630 --> 02:28:44,160
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: How much is.

952
02:28:53,010 --> 02:28:55,260
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Well, so okay so here's here's the thing the.

953
02:28:57,030 --> 02:28:59,340
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So the CDC suggests that in 2020.

954
02:28:59,460 --> 02:29:07,110
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: menthol cigarettes were 37% of cigarettes in the US is is that an underestimate or is 62 hi.

955
02:29:08,670 --> 02:29:09,060
Market.

956
02:29:27,930 --> 02:29:31,800
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This is one right I literally don't know so if.

957
02:29:33,660 --> 02:29:35,070
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We have other stuff.

958
02:29:37,650 --> 02:29:44,340
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I suppose I could split the difference and go for like 40 or 50 to assume a certain degree of market growth in the years between 2020 and 2022.

959
02:29:49,350 --> 02:29:53,820
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: As well as pricing differences can maybe change the effective market share style thing to.

960
02:29:56,610 --> 02:29:58,230
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Well, let me.

961
02:29:59,550 --> 02:29:59,820
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Let me.

962
02:30:00,990 --> 02:30:03,750
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Let me hedge essentially is what i'll do so 50% of.

963
02:30:05,850 --> 02:30:06,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: and

964
02:30:08,700 --> 02:30:12,990
Nicolle Krebs: Mobile phones have mental smokers, not necessarily.

965
02:30:14,670 --> 02:30:17,610
Nicolle Krebs: So I guess that doesn't equate to the market share.

966
02:30:18,300 --> 02:30:22,650
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Okay, so prevalence is fairly high, but market share might be.

967
02:30:23,970 --> 02:30:24,390
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Different.

968
02:30:25,980 --> 02:30:27,780
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Okay okay that.

969
02:30:28,650 --> 02:30:31,260
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That seems fine to me, I can make and square that circle.

970
02:30:31,440 --> 02:30:31,770
That.

971
02:30:32,970 --> 02:30:33,480
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Because yeah.

972
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:42,240
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Different buying habits so we'll go with 37 from the CDC estimate of the market size.

973
02:30:45,240 --> 02:30:45,750
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The.

974
02:30:50,010 --> 02:30:55,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What would we say is a reasonable estimate for the dollar value of the total us cigarette market currently.

975
02:30:55,890 --> 02:30:57,750
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Like 10s of billions probably.

976
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:01,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: it's big I remember.

977
02:31:07,020 --> 02:31:07,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So that would be.

978
02:31:23,640 --> 02:31:33,390
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So quick googling is suggesting something in the neighborhood of like $77 billion for the total tobacco market cigarettes being maybe.

979
02:31:34,410 --> 02:31:35,550
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: it'll those.

980
02:31:36,780 --> 02:31:39,210
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: A rough estimate would maybe be 60 ish billion.

981
02:31:41,940 --> 02:31:42,630
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That seem.

982
02:31:43,860 --> 02:31:46,170
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Does that seem too high or vastly too low.

983
02:31:55,770 --> 02:31:59,310
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: About 50 billion okay we'll go with that so 50.

984
02:32:00,630 --> 02:32:04,740
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: million is we 3123123 that's 50 billion right.

985
02:32:07,170 --> 02:32:09,660
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: You know what i'll put these in billions, so that I don't have to think.

986
02:32:14,880 --> 02:32:16,290
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In billions of dollars.

987
02:32:20,610 --> 02:32:21,360
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And then.

988
02:32:22,470 --> 02:32:23,670
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So this is.

989
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:37,140
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This times point three, seven, which is lots of billions still um What about e cigarette market what's what's the approximate market size for that one then.

990
02:32:40,170 --> 02:32:44,010
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Like wager sort of fractional onto onto the cigarette market.

991
02:33:00,540 --> 02:33:03,840
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Maybe like what if what if we called it like 5 billion ish.

992
02:33:06,330 --> 02:33:08,070
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: A meaningful percent but not.

993
02:33:09,180 --> 02:33:09,900
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Not quite.

994
02:33:13,320 --> 02:33:14,490
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Not quite cigarettes.

995
02:33:16,320 --> 02:33:19,650
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Keep not burn I have zero idea of between five and 10.

996
02:33:21,900 --> 02:33:29,640
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: i'll do five on the low end because it's a nice round number keep not burn we don't really have a meaningful market in the US right now right.

997
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:32,040
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So that wouldn't be.

998
02:33:46,110 --> 02:33:53,580
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That would likely be a huge thing, what about oral products that what's what's the rough market value of that in the US.

999
02:34:34,620 --> 02:34:35,760
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: cigars are bigger.

1000
02:34:37,620 --> 02:34:41,250
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Do we think that they serve as a likely replacement category.

1001
02:34:43,650 --> 02:34:50,220
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Like do do we think that they would have a positive net positive growth if menthol cigarettes are banned.

1002
02:35:22,050 --> 02:35:28,470
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We can stick to we can stick to fewer product categories if it's trickier to estimate, some of these other things like we could think about something like.

1003
02:35:29,250 --> 02:35:40,350
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: mental and E cigarettes only, but since we have other products, I figured we can we can throw them into the mix and see what we get their product that people might switch to a governmental policy.

1004
02:35:40,950 --> 02:35:48,960
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But it's easier to have fewer policies um i'm not opposed to two cigars as a and sort of the broader category.

1005
02:35:52,170 --> 02:35:52,890
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But.

1006
02:35:54,870 --> 02:36:01,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Other combustible if I said something like one to $5 billion for those markets with that strike you is too high or too low.

1007
02:36:16,410 --> 02:36:26,880
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And i'm going to fudge it and we're going to call this about a billion dollar industry, for now, that and, of course, you know if we find better we can change these things, that is, the beauty of this sort of work.

1008
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:31,800
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So that's part of what we want, so.

1009
02:36:33,150 --> 02:36:35,610
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: One of the things we can start doing is trying to map.

1010
02:36:37,890 --> 02:36:52,050
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The impact of like these regulatory outcomes to some notion of how much money companies stand to gain or lose from those outcomes and there's there's more and less elaborate ways we can do this, but.

1011
02:36:53,220 --> 02:36:54,600
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If we suppose that.

1012
02:36:57,330 --> 02:37:03,510
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We could do something like suppose that the dead on arrival situation basically maintains the status quo.

1013
02:37:05,130 --> 02:37:13,410
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Where some of these other situations cigars might be 12 billion wow that's a that's quite a that's a big industry.

1014
02:37:14,670 --> 02:37:14,910
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: huh.

1015
02:37:16,980 --> 02:37:18,660
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Okay we'll go with that that's interesting.

1016
02:37:20,310 --> 02:37:22,500
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I had no idea their revenues are that high.

1017
02:37:25,950 --> 02:37:26,970
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So okay.

1018
02:37:30,300 --> 02:37:36,480
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So now we need to start mapping our revenues to our to our outcomes so.

1019
02:37:38,580 --> 02:37:46,380
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What we can start doing is thinking about pre and post band revenues and we can start very simply, and then make this more complex, as we go.

1020
02:37:47,730 --> 02:37:50,490
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So what do we want to do um.

1021
02:37:53,040 --> 02:38:01,920
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: let's let's start by divvying up this pie right, so this is the amount of money that is in the total market so.

1022
02:38:04,860 --> 02:38:05,670
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: A share.

1023
02:38:07,050 --> 02:38:07,710
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: These.

1024
02:38:08,970 --> 02:38:09,300
there.

1025
02:38:10,620 --> 02:38:16,830
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So we said that altria is less dominant in mental where Rentals is more dominant.

1026
02:38:20,250 --> 02:38:25,440
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I feel like my back of the envelope from before was something the neighborhood of 7030 or 6040 type split.

1027
02:38:30,570 --> 02:38:34,320
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Again kind of to within the back of the envelope estimation.

1028
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:39,210
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If I said 7030 Reynolds all true, would you be deeply suspicious of me.

1029
02:38:54,450 --> 02:38:56,880
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: nobody's yelling at me so i'm going to go with that for now.

1030
02:38:58,560 --> 02:39:02,460
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: To do 70% times this that.

1031
02:39:05,670 --> 02:39:06,930
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: 30% of this.

1032
02:39:08,640 --> 02:39:15,990
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And then E cigarettes, I recall each of them had about 30% of the market between Joel and views so i'll go with that.

1033
02:39:27,780 --> 02:39:35,580
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And then is there is there af particularly differential dominance over cigars between altering Reynolds lips.

1034
02:39:38,580 --> 02:39:40,530
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Are they sort of even players.

1035
02:39:46,470 --> 02:39:47,160
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Presumably.

1036
02:39:48,660 --> 02:39:51,660
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Between the two of them, they don't necessarily hold the entire market but.

1037
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:31,050
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: i'm entirely happy to take like wild half educated guesses on this to, or else I will make my own wild half educated guess.

1038
02:40:32,280 --> 02:40:36,690
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: It will probably be more wild than are folks who actually know more stuff about tobacco than I do.

1039
02:40:38,220 --> 02:40:43,530
Nicolle Krebs: was like oh tria has like the black and mild, which is a popular brand.

1040
02:40:45,990 --> 02:40:50,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So, so we might suspect that altria has a little bit of dominance then.

1041
02:40:53,190 --> 02:40:55,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We could we could make it, we can be like a 6040 split.

1042
02:41:00,270 --> 02:41:01,920
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And we may we may actually.

1043
02:41:02,190 --> 02:41:04,590
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: find that we want to scale things otherwise.

1044
02:41:05,850 --> 02:41:13,590
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But but, again, we want to start somewhere, so what we could what we could think of this, as is essentially so i'll do total.

1045
02:41:18,150 --> 02:41:22,110
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And we're just going to add up this call deal over here.

1046
02:41:23,670 --> 02:41:38,880
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So, as it stands, what we've gotten here essentially is sort of what each company stands to make under kind of the status quo, if nothing changes, we could think that maybe this is in the neighborhood.

1047
02:41:41,190 --> 02:41:46,350
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Of what happens if the bill just gets if thing just gets killed.

1048
02:41:49,740 --> 02:41:50,310
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So.

1049
02:41:52,680 --> 02:41:57,540
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: i'm actually going to expand this so that we can make our thing a little bit easier.

1050
02:42:00,480 --> 02:42:01,860
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So suppose, do you buy.

1051
02:42:03,420 --> 02:42:04,890
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: except those.

1052
02:42:07,680 --> 02:42:10,020
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Oh, you know I don't need to do that I just need to do.

1053
02:42:13,290 --> 02:42:16,770
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So one thing we can do is fill out kind of the opposed to post square because.

1054
02:42:17,220 --> 02:42:31,710
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: killing the thing quickly is basically you get this stuff minus whatever you spend on legal fees to smack the thing and legal fees are going to be on the order of like millions I think 10s maybe even hundreds of millions, but it's Probably not.

1055
02:42:32,970 --> 02:42:37,650
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Probably not talking anything in the neighborhood of these revenues, but I will put it here so i'm.

1056
02:42:39,810 --> 02:42:41,070
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: going to do something like.

1057
02:42:42,420 --> 02:42:47,610
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Even on the outside let's do like point 1 billion so that's about 100 million in legal fees, which is.

1058
02:42:48,630 --> 02:42:49,260
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Maybe high.

1059
02:42:50,910 --> 02:42:57,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But i'm going to spit ball, this one, for the moment, so opposed to pose what we get for altria is.

1060
02:42:58,500 --> 02:43:08,760
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This minus this, and right now we're thinking about these is kind of present value and will do take kind of a similar approach to all the other things, obviously, there will be some sort of like.

1061
02:43:09,420 --> 02:43:25,350
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What we're not including in some of these just yet is is growth potential and things like that and and discounting so from that perspective, we are vastly over simplifying some things so here's here's roommate room, we might start for pose to pose.

1062
02:43:27,960 --> 02:43:36,480
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: opposed delay i'm going to assume that the Lang is practically free because it does not cost a lot to do some of these tactics like to request a.

1063
02:43:37,680 --> 02:43:42,900
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: A lengthened comment period or to kind of spin up a grant a an astroturf campaign.

1064
02:43:44,220 --> 02:43:51,360
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Less than less than legal opposition really so what I might suppose that here on this dead later thing.

1065
02:43:54,420 --> 02:44:02,400
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The thing kind of travels along and still dies, and we, for the moment are out whoever.

1066
02:44:03,450 --> 02:44:12,900
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Whoever spent money on on opposition is out a little bit of money and whoever's out whoever just tried to delay is not out any money at all.

1067
02:44:13,530 --> 02:44:27,840
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Again we're going to start from this hideously oversimplified place, and then we will talk about how to build in complexity like dealing with the fact that these outcomes are actually going to be projected out a few years, because they should be projected out on the time horizon of.

1068
02:44:29,220 --> 02:44:37,590
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Whenever kind of the final outcome of this thing is like dead later means dead and maybe six to 12 months things like that.

1069
02:44:40,140 --> 02:44:42,510
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: oppose except, then, is.

1070
02:44:44,520 --> 02:44:58,680
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Is weird because now we have to start thinking of so we said oppose except is this weird unclean rule promulgation thing that takes some time, and presumably preserve some revenues so.

1071
02:45:00,480 --> 02:45:01,620
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We could do something.

1072
02:45:03,360 --> 02:45:18,390
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Like whoever paid the opposition cost pays the opposition cost right, but now we're in the world, now we're in the post mental world eventually where your you no longer are making some of these revenues so.

1073
02:45:20,310 --> 02:45:26,520
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So now let's start to think about what the post mental world looks like in these cases where a rule actually gets promulgated.

1074
02:45:29,010 --> 02:45:31,380
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So this is before.

1075
02:45:32,520 --> 02:45:37,530
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So if a rule gets promulgated what do we think happens to these different market shares.

1076
02:46:19,860 --> 02:46:31,830
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: i'll do cigars, for now, because that's what we've kind of construct things to I would perhaps suggest that the mental cigarette market entirely goes away so that maybe is nice that is straightforward.

1077
02:46:35,130 --> 02:46:37,500
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So here is the sticky question.

1078
02:46:39,810 --> 02:46:51,060
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: For the purpose of hypotheticals and counterfactual how much do we think E cigarettes and cigars would pick up what the mental market dropped, if there was a bad.

1079
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:59,670
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And this is another case where you're entirely welcome to be speculative based on based on your experience with subject.

1080
02:47:09,660 --> 02:47:14,400
Nicolle Krebs: Well, cigars and other combustible would be like the closest.

1081
02:47:15,930 --> 02:47:20,100
Nicolle Krebs: You know similar product to cigarettes so maybe more people would.

1082
02:47:21,180 --> 02:47:24,090
Nicolle Krebs: switch to that product over E cigarettes.

1083
02:47:24,990 --> 02:47:27,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Sure let's work with that assumption.

1084
02:47:27,810 --> 02:47:30,870
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So let's see what i'm going to do is.

1085
02:47:37,050 --> 02:47:41,850
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So here, let me say that this is, I don't know.

1086
02:47:43,290 --> 02:47:45,690
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: 2575.

1087
02:47:46,740 --> 02:47:48,360
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So this means is.

1088
02:47:50,460 --> 02:47:56,550
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: that the market then is this times the initial.

1089
02:47:59,790 --> 02:48:04,050
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: menthol market, and this is equal to this times the initial mental.

1090
02:48:07,350 --> 02:48:15,780
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Now this doesn't seem that nobody's quitting like we're just we're just shifting people around to different products, so what we could do is suppose that some people do quit.

1091
02:48:17,430 --> 02:48:18,090
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So.

1092
02:48:20,160 --> 02:48:21,330
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: i'll do another thing.

1093
02:48:24,870 --> 02:48:28,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: i'm just gonna i'm gonna be dumb about this for.

1094
02:48:32,700 --> 02:48:34,860
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: For for the purposes of.

1095
02:48:36,780 --> 02:48:47,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Simplicity so suppose 25% of people quit, which means that our final market size equal to this times one minus this.

1096
02:48:49,590 --> 02:48:51,000
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Times this.

1097
02:48:52,470 --> 02:48:57,900
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: add some extra apparently the seas, so that I don't accidentally miss calculate.

1098
02:48:59,220 --> 02:49:07,920
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That is always a risk, then this is equal to this times in parenthesis one minus this.

1099
02:49:09,090 --> 02:49:10,020
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: times.

1100
02:49:11,190 --> 02:49:11,610
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This.

1101
02:49:12,960 --> 02:49:13,230
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Okay.

1102
02:49:14,250 --> 02:49:17,130
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So what we're left with is a total market value.

1103
02:49:21,030 --> 02:49:25,290
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Of these things total market value of about $13.8 billion.

1104
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:39,780
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And if we assume the same proportional shares of those different market categories, then we can try to estimate how much of the remaining pie altria and Reynolds get.

1105
02:49:46,650 --> 02:49:58,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So we said that ultra and Reynolds had about 30% of the cigarette market if we if we assume that that continues to be true, again, this may be a strong assumption let's do this.

1106
02:50:03,510 --> 02:50:10,170
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And if we maintain the same fractional distribution here than we'd conclude that we have.

1107
02:50:12,270 --> 02:50:13,710
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Times this oops.

1108
02:50:17,220 --> 02:50:26,610
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And this, and then we can do our totals to see how much is left of today, that seems oh yes that's because I can't type.

1109
02:50:27,720 --> 02:50:27,960
Okay.

1110
02:50:30,270 --> 02:50:32,580
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So one thing to note is that.

1111
02:50:33,600 --> 02:50:41,160
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In this world reynold stands to lose a whole lot more than altria does and that's maybe interesting to look at.

1112
02:50:43,530 --> 02:50:53,430
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And perhaps not terribly surprising because Reynolds has a whole lot of menthol cigarette share so maybe we think this is sensible.

1113
02:50:54,630 --> 02:51:03,270
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So let's walk this through a little bit more than so in the accept case the band goes through, and what we're left with is.

1114
02:51:05,550 --> 02:51:08,610
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The value of the market afterward.

1115
02:51:09,750 --> 02:51:11,310
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: i'm not going to distinguish.

1116
02:51:13,140 --> 02:51:18,600
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Some of these promulgated cases, yet we can we will talk about how we will change those because.

1117
02:51:19,380 --> 02:51:29,310
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If I implement this in a simple way we'll get a game it's probably not going to be terribly interesting game, but then we can talk about how to make the game more interesting by addressing some more complicated cases.

1118
02:51:29,730 --> 02:51:33,780
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Right now, I just want to get numbers filled in before we break, so that we can see something.

1119
02:51:34,860 --> 02:51:43,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And, of course, if these things are interesting please feel free to engage me offline and we can talk about that so for now what's this could be so this is going to be.

1120
02:51:45,120 --> 02:51:48,570
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: altria is going to get this minus.

1121
02:51:49,980 --> 02:51:51,300
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This if they oppose.

1122
02:51:52,380 --> 02:52:10,290
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And Rentals is going to get this minus this or actually they suppose confusingly they don't bother to oppose maybe they're all asleep on that day, and now we can keep filling this thing out so opposed to lay here so altria delays, so they get this.

1123
02:52:12,720 --> 02:52:16,950
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Reynolds opposes so they get this minus this.

1124
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:18,960
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: delay delay.

1125
02:52:19,290 --> 02:52:24,600
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Is a later promulgation but the roll still goes through, so you get the delayed payoffs for now.

1126
02:52:31,350 --> 02:52:40,920
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: delay except is also a promulgation at essentially no cost so so this we're going to treat for now as equivalent to.

1127
02:52:42,480 --> 02:52:43,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The other thing.

1128
02:52:45,540 --> 02:52:46,170
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: and

1129
02:52:47,520 --> 02:52:49,260
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: oppose except is.

1130
02:52:50,340 --> 02:52:52,650
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The outcome here.

1131
02:52:55,050 --> 02:53:04,620
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And this one minus opposition costs a delay, except is also very simple.

1132
02:53:07,650 --> 02:53:14,070
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And if you're looking at this and in your brains kinda screaming this is wildly unrealistic, yes it is we'll we'll talk.

1133
02:53:17,400 --> 02:53:36,810
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Okay, so, but what we've done now is we've actually made a game matrix that we can we can start to work with right so that's Nice and i'm going to block out some of these things, so we can solve the actual game that is being inefficient about my walking rj.

1134
02:53:40,050 --> 02:53:42,570
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I don't like the way Google sheets does this.

1135
02:53:49,260 --> 02:53:49,470
Okay.

1136
02:53:50,910 --> 02:53:57,660
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So now let's solve the way that we would normally so if i'm altria and I think Reynolds is going to oppose.

1137
02:53:58,710 --> 02:54:01,230
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What gets me the highest payoff here.

1138
02:54:03,630 --> 02:54:13,170
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This case delay, so this is going to be my best response here if I think Rentals is going to delay then opposing is my.

1139
02:54:14,280 --> 02:54:14,970
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: best response.

1140
02:54:17,880 --> 02:54:23,910
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And if I think Reynolds is going to accept, then these two are both best responses.

1141
02:54:25,230 --> 02:54:33,360
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Conversely, if i'm Reynolds and I think ultra is going to oppose, and I should going across wise I should delay.

1142
02:54:36,840 --> 02:54:37,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: oops.

1143
02:54:38,730 --> 02:54:40,020
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I feel like a mix the colors up.

1144
02:54:43,830 --> 02:54:48,900
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If I think ultra is going to delay, then I should what's best for I should oppose.

1145
02:54:51,180 --> 02:54:55,650
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And if I think ultra is going to accept that I should.

1146
02:54:58,590 --> 02:55:00,930
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This this correctly at night thing.

1147
02:55:02,280 --> 02:55:03,600
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So it didn't today.

1148
02:55:05,100 --> 02:55:07,320
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: These things seems like it's slightly to plot.

1149
02:55:10,530 --> 02:55:15,210
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Point one oh yeah these are better it's just numbers are very similar, and so I have a hard time.

1150
02:55:17,790 --> 02:55:23,820
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So here we've made it we've made a game theoretic model we have solved the national equilibrium and we found three of them.

1151
02:55:24,330 --> 02:55:32,280
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: One is that someone opposes and the other one delays and they kill the the children regulation, the other ones that someone else suppose.

1152
02:55:32,670 --> 02:55:44,100
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The, you have the asymmetrical case where the other one opposes the other delays and they killed the regulation and then there's this weird equilibrium, where if they think if they think someone's going to roll over they'll just roll over.

1153
02:55:45,300 --> 02:55:55,470
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So one question might be Is this reasonable do these do these equilibrium seem like they're halfway sensible like this.

1154
02:55:57,840 --> 02:55:59,460
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Or are there things wrong with them.

1155
02:56:02,130 --> 02:56:16,140
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: there's a part of me that thinks that these actually are pretty sensible like if you can get the outcome, you want without doing any amount of effort, why not right that's this is kind of that game of chicken thing, where, if you can do.

1156
02:56:17,250 --> 02:56:24,480
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: as little as possible still getting the outcome, you want cool, this one is probably the weirder one, why does this happen.

1157
02:56:26,190 --> 02:56:32,310
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And, and a lot of this is driven by the fact that we gave a lot of room for a role to get promulgated and we didn't.

1158
02:56:32,490 --> 02:56:45,510
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: We weren't very sophisticated about how we calculated the payoffs in any of these scenarios, where a role gets promulgated like we didn't really distinguish between delayed promulgation unclean promulgation were like some things get stripped out and.

1159
02:56:45,720 --> 02:56:50,790
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: You weaken the rule versus a clean promulgation where you get from the agency's perspective, what they wanted.

1160
02:56:51,270 --> 02:57:03,480
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And those those distinctions would change the payoffs presumably right, so the fact that we're treating all of these role passages as the same does, to a certain extent, lead us to the conclusion that.

1161
02:57:04,350 --> 02:57:11,280
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: If either if you're a tobacco company, and you have a pretty good signal that your competitor is going to roll over when when a.

1162
02:57:11,790 --> 02:57:26,430
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: When a regulation comes out, you might not want to get stuck holding the bag and being the the one opposing it if you think that thing's going to pass anyway, maybe you think what you should do is just keep mum and then fight a different battle another day.

1163
02:57:27,930 --> 02:57:44,490
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Maybe that's not what would happen right and if if we don't think that's reasonable logic, then we should probably examine our assumptions about the payoffs that our companies are getting under different scenarios to figure out if different outcomes would be more sensible in this month.

1164
02:57:45,630 --> 02:57:54,150
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So what's one thing that I really did not consider that I probably should have that if I was doing this for actual work I absolutely should have considered.

1165
02:57:58,650 --> 02:58:03,210
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Particularly to do with the payoffs and the the market share calculations and things.

1166
02:58:28,170 --> 02:58:46,770
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: accounting for usage, potentially, in the sense that well usage trends could change in more ways than we've accounted for here the total market could actually grow or shrink in general, so it could be that more people use tobacco of any kind in in some amount of time.

1167
02:58:48,480 --> 02:58:50,010
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Let me, let me focus things further.

1168
02:58:52,170 --> 02:59:05,490
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This process takes time and the rule is not going to be promulgated for some amount of time, no matter what happens so How does that change our perspective on the payoffs that companies get under different scenarios.

1169
02:59:26,880 --> 02:59:28,800
Nicolle Krebs: Do you mean like feature discounting.

1170
02:59:30,420 --> 02:59:31,320
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: that's part of it.

1171
02:59:33,030 --> 02:59:45,000
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Both future just counting and the other thing I propose probably matters here is the way and monetized outcomes in this game was to look at the current size of the market and assume that, after a band.

1172
02:59:46,440 --> 02:59:54,660
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That market share, would be largely in various except for quitters right, so the the amount of money that companies get pre and post band.

1173
02:59:55,170 --> 03:00:07,410
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: or under different band scenarios is just kind of directly proportional to the size of the current market but that's probably not the most sensible way to think about how a company is going to value.

1174
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:12,750
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: outcomes that happened in a little while like the company might care about.

1175
03:00:14,040 --> 03:00:20,970
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What their revenue would be over, maybe a five year horizon or something like that or a two year horizon or something like that.

1176
03:00:21,360 --> 03:00:27,960
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: In that post outcome world as opposed to right now right, so what they might look at is well.

1177
03:00:28,470 --> 03:00:36,210
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Okay suppose something happens How much money do I make over five years after the resolution of this whole process.

1178
03:00:36,720 --> 03:00:40,770
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And that means that I can no longer just look at the current size of the market, I have to.

1179
03:00:41,130 --> 03:00:52,920
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Ask to forecast a little bit of how much that markets going to grow and what the cumulative revenue would be over some time with us so maybe I wanted, maybe I want to do something like this times five to reflect a.

1180
03:00:54,270 --> 03:00:57,390
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: A static market over five years.

1181
03:00:58,560 --> 03:01:03,900
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Then further maybe I want to play a little bit of discounting to account for inflation over five years.

1182
03:01:05,280 --> 03:01:13,770
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But then, where this gets a little more complicated, is what if I as a tobacco company think that one of these product categories is going to grow beyond.

1183
03:01:14,100 --> 03:01:19,920
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The current market share, that I holding it over that five year post Bam period So what if I think.

1184
03:01:20,250 --> 03:01:28,350
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: i've got this really good E cigarette product in the pipeline that's just going to blow away the competition, then what I might do is.

1185
03:01:28,770 --> 03:01:37,980
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: change my estimate of my effective market share over that time horizon to reflect my belief in my product and my belief in market growth.

1186
03:01:38,520 --> 03:01:49,770
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: and capture of market share over that time horizon, maybe I think that well i've done jack all and cheat not burn right now I know i've got something in the works that I think is going to do really well.

1187
03:01:50,070 --> 03:01:56,880
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And I think I can get it out before my competitor, so I will capture more of that post ban market share than they will.

1188
03:01:57,180 --> 03:02:12,150
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And that will change the outlook of the post ban market layout which then changes the payoffs that I am my competitor received in this post band world What if I think that I stand to exploit a band by.

1189
03:02:12,900 --> 03:02:22,950
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: by getting some other product out click that captures market share well that's going to change my perspective on what I think I should do in that post band world right and so.

1190
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:33,150
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Moreover, these unclean outcomes might carve out more or less for specific types of products, what if there's some kind of delayed ban.

1191
03:02:33,360 --> 03:02:44,580
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That enables me to keep making money on menthol cigarettes, for some of that future period before they drop off, which also enables me to spin up other product lines that pick up the slack.

1192
03:02:44,970 --> 03:02:50,610
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Well that's going to be a very different world, especially for Rentals right if you're Reynolds looking at the situation you're probably.

1193
03:02:51,090 --> 03:02:57,690
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: What you might be thinking is well I need to contingency plan for if somehow a band squeaked by, in spite of my best efforts right.

1194
03:02:58,140 --> 03:03:06,660
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I better be ready with some products in the oven, to try to capitalize on this somewhat or at least recoup some of my losses So these are all the sorts of.

1195
03:03:06,900 --> 03:03:16,440
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Complex defying factors that if we were to try to do this and write a paper on it and, and this is something that isn't my perpetual back burner is to finish my paper on this.

1196
03:03:16,830 --> 03:03:27,750
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: that these are things that are in my brain to try to to try to suss out what kinds of factors are going to change the landscape, such that we get different predictive outcomes of this game.

1197
03:03:28,410 --> 03:03:33,540
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: That tell me something about so now if i'm looking at this game as a regulator, I might be like oh.

1198
03:03:33,750 --> 03:03:49,830
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This is bad right, this means there's lots of potential scenarios, where I get screwed and I get left holding the bag, because I tried to do something I got a pose and my regulation failed, and I look bad because of that, and I can't fulfill what I think is my public health responsibility.

1199
03:03:51,510 --> 03:04:06,660
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: And I don't think that I can credibly course companies like I don't see a way to get to this equilibrium so Oh, this is bad, where, if there were more space in in this game and in the Nash equilibrium that had these kind of weird.

1200
03:04:07,080 --> 03:04:16,800
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: outcomes like if a Nash equilibrium was like maybe there's one here, maybe this one's one then as a regulator, I might look at this situation and be a little bit more optimistic and be like okay.

1201
03:04:17,100 --> 03:04:28,560
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Maybe there's room for me to exploit some of these market dynamics and exploit some of the things that drive companies to be more or less willing to accept regulation.

1202
03:04:30,180 --> 03:04:35,520
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Maybe I think there's room to try to push that regulation hard that makes sense.

1203
03:04:37,230 --> 03:04:39,630
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So this is where i'll leave things for now, and unfortunately didn't.

1204
03:04:40,230 --> 03:04:42,990
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Like maybe fortunately we spent more time kind of.

1205
03:04:43,200 --> 03:04:55,200
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Breaking down my internal logic of how I build a game theoretic model, so that we can see the steps of like Okay, I want to include this this and this i'm going to cut things back to make them, simple and I know i'm going to have to deal with them later.

1206
03:04:55,620 --> 03:05:10,890
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But this is so, this was not a trivial exercise like it's a simple model, but this is the process that I go through when i'm trying to build a game theoretic model of a given situation, so all of the all of the things that we're thinking about here, these are real, these are real and meaningful.

1207
03:05:11,970 --> 03:05:13,530
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Things to contemplate.

1208
03:05:15,210 --> 03:05:22,500
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Do you have thoughts or comments as we're getting close to lunchtime all that marissa know that she'll want to cover agent based models intersections afternoon.

1209
03:05:26,400 --> 03:05:33,030
Nicolle Krebs: they're published papers excusing the game theory and tobacco control like examples.

1210
03:05:33,930 --> 03:05:36,720
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I actually don't think so I don't think there are.

1211
03:05:38,940 --> 03:05:39,570
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This is.

1212
03:05:41,100 --> 03:05:42,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This is new.

1213
03:05:44,640 --> 03:06:01,800
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: There are, I found one or two older kind of game theory papers kinda sort of getting it like games of general like regulation, but I don't know if there's been prior work explicitly using game theory to analyze tobacco regulation.

1214
03:06:03,210 --> 03:06:05,880
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: So this is kind of the Wild West in some sense.

1215
03:06:10,470 --> 03:06:22,440
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: it's also i'm sad that kovats sort of derailed my my research plans, because I wanted to have a couple I wish I could have said yes and I wrote them, but no that's not yet.

1216
03:06:31,650 --> 03:06:42,600
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Other questions comments, did you find this useful at all like what did this do anything helpful from like a methodological perspective or in terms of framing potential avenues for research.

1217
03:06:50,670 --> 03:06:52,500
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: there's a yes i'll take that that's good.

1218
03:06:54,930 --> 03:06:57,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: I like affirmation like like other humans.

1219
03:07:04,620 --> 03:07:13,620
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Well i'm happy to let this percolate for a bit this spreadsheet is still shared so you're welcome to work with it, if someone does manage to scoop me it's been good for you.

1220
03:07:15,180 --> 03:07:15,540
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But.

1221
03:07:16,950 --> 03:07:23,580
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But hopefully this gives you a taste for some of the ways that you can apply economic models of behavior.

1222
03:07:23,790 --> 03:07:32,040
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: To research domains that maybe you're interested in working on like we saw applications to vaccination we've seen an application to tobacco and even if.

1223
03:07:32,490 --> 03:07:37,860
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Even if kind of the whole logic of how you build these things hasn't set in, yet what i'd hope you take away is that.

1224
03:07:38,790 --> 03:07:45,300
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: The these methodologies exist, and so, if you're interested in applying them and if you're interested in modeling.

1225
03:07:45,600 --> 03:07:53,730
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: behavior in general and any domain that you're thinking of researching there are actually methods out there to do that so i'd encourage you to.

1226
03:07:54,060 --> 03:07:59,040
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: keep that in mind if you ever have questions about like well I kinda like to model this particular behavior.

1227
03:07:59,550 --> 03:08:11,370
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: How do you think you'd go about that, please do get in touch with me because i'm happy to talk through thoughts about that I almost certainly have thoughts about those sorts of things so i'm happy to be a resource on that front, but.

1228
03:08:12,900 --> 03:08:16,920
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: This is to say that sometimes you can find methodologies to model things that.

1229
03:08:17,460 --> 03:08:24,090
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: You might not have thought you could model in areas that you might not have expected like this literature comes out of political science and economics.

1230
03:08:24,270 --> 03:08:36,450
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But it turns out that there are, I think a lot of applications and a lot of applications that have yet to be done in public health research across infectious disease chronic disease health policy because.

1231
03:08:37,590 --> 03:08:45,060
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Well, at the end of the day, human behavior matters a lot for a ton of health problems, so the more we can try to understand that the more we can try to.

1232
03:08:45,750 --> 03:08:50,820
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Formally break that down into models, I think, the more we can gain traction on.

1233
03:08:51,090 --> 03:09:03,480
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: On understanding, a lot of what's going on, when we try to regulate something that doesn't work or when we try to do an intervention and we get a weird result because people aren't using the product or they're using it wrong or something so that's what i'll leave you for now.

1234
03:09:04,770 --> 03:09:05,190
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: and

1235
03:09:06,390 --> 03:09:18,330
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: Like I said I will see you again tomorrow marissa will talk about agent based models and introduce a little bit of the sort of proposal that we want you to put together, so we can pure discuss them on Friday.

1236
03:09:19,380 --> 03:09:29,010
Michael Akira Lee Hayashi: But with that I will see you all Friday afternoon, I hope you have a great rest of the date, and I hope you enjoy the agent based model stuff that is usually fairly popular.

1237
03:09:32,190 --> 03:09:32,670
Nicolle Krebs: Thank you.
