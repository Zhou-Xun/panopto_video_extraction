1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:08,760
Okay. That's really funny. Welcome to one more level five stealth strategy.

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,840
I probably shouldn't on it is because chances are you're not going to pay much attention.

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,030
But what we are reviewing today has nothing to do with the home.

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,700
But you have to go on Sunday. We are starting survival analysis.

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:30,749
That will be for our next call where everything you need for the homework on Sunday.

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:38,780
We are ready to review it because it's on the count. Why so models binomial negative binomial models are inflated models.

7
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,020
Therefore all these. The good news is that love is very, very short.

8
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,680
So I like try to cover everything. Well, true, but like very fast so you can just work on their homework in the meantime.

9
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,940
So sounds good. Okay, so this is the outline for today.

10
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,960
We are going to do a quick review about survival analysis.

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,830
We are going to talk about the data said we have and then throw out best first thoughts

12
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:18,960
and then survival package are okay so what is a survival analysis it's we try to we want

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,170
to estimate already the probability of an individual a subject in my dataset surviving

14
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,499
after time t the innovation we are going to use for the rest of the classes as follows.

15
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,230
I It's individuals from once when the AI is time to event for an individual.

16
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,760
I see AI is censoring time, which is a potential follow up time.

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,380
And then our observed time is the minimum between these things, these two things.

18
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,910
So remember that for each individual in my dataset I can have either two things.

19
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,540
Either they have the event, for example, let's say I'm talking about that.

20
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,219
So they have they died and I have like that time or I don't know what happened to them.

21
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:07,260
I only know that until, for example, time 15 I followed them 15 units of time and nothing happened.

22
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,540
Thus that is the CII on the observe time is the minimum between those things.

23
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,980
We also have something that we are going to call Delta AI, which is going to tell us which happens first.

24
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,070
Either the event happened first for that person or this entry time for that person.

25
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,149
So, for example, if they die, these are they'll die.

26
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,520
It's equal to one because the event happens first.

27
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:40,200
Or if this is equal to zero, it means that this entering time happened first rather than the actual event that we are looking at.

28
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,960
Okay. So to estimate some of our survival probabilities,

29
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:57,150
we are using something that is called a kaplan-meier estimated in order to build this estimate are we are going to like clearly do it in SAS or AI?

30
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:03,120
We're not doing these by hand. The first thing we're going to do is we are going to divide our observed time.

31
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,959
So let's say like half times between like for one unit and time until like 120 units.

32
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:18,150
Sometimes I'm going to divide those things into little ranges in which the event happened for at least one people.

33
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,330
Okay. So for example, let's say I have someone in my data said that died at time 15,

34
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:31,170
so I'm going to have one time interval between zero and 15 and then another between 15 and 22.

35
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:37,410
If I have time trying to do someone else die, so on and so forth until I cover all of my possible times.

36
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,370
Okay. Based on that we are going to create new variables.

37
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:51,810
Y sub j is the number of other people at each of those like r ranges that I have

38
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:58,740
here and the j is the number of failures or number of events that occur on that

39
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:04,680
time period based on these two things we supplemental one are for C remember

40
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,370
that SC is the probability of surviving after county is given by B's formula.

41
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:20,549
So these formula first, which is the product. So I am multiplying a lot of things and multiplying one minus y is one minus because it's survival.

42
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,730
So it's surviving after time. T And this is that one minus.

43
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,230
This is why you have one minus. And then I'm just dividing these two things.

44
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,020
The number of events that I observed in each range divided by the total number of people at risk.

45
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,360
And I multiply all of those probabilities. Any questions so far?

46
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,950
Okay. So the big, big question here is how do we call these in transport?

47
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,710
So we have a little example.

48
00:04:50,730 --> 00:05:00,809
Let's say I have a data set with 25 patients that were diagnosed with myeloma, ptosis, which is a type of cancer in my dataset,

49
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:07,230
I have for random, for variables, duration, which is the absurd time that I have for every person.

50
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:18,809
But it's the minimum between B and C I work to is time driven and see I've seen since time to sensory so duration is the minimum is what

51
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:27,690
I observe is that those is that Delta II is going to tell us whether that person might either have the event in this case is that or not.

52
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,700
And I have two covariates. One covariates. It's just for a random assignment for two types of drug treatment.

53
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,139
And then another covariate is going to tell me it's an indicator,

54
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:48,690
but it's some indicator of categorical variable for the renal function of that person because we think that's probably something we want to like,

55
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,760
just for when we are calculating or estimating survival probabilities.

56
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,450
So our dataset looks something like these are what each row represents.

57
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:06,180
One subject in my dataset I have 25 rows because I have 25 patients.

58
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:13,050
For example, for this patient right here, I have that the observed time is 52.

59
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,340
So I follow that person until like times 52 times unit.

60
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:25,980
And the second column here is the Delta II. So this is an indicator function that is telling me which happens first either the event or b sensory.

61
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:34,530
So for this person, I know that they died because one event happened first they died at time 52,

62
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:44,220
and then they were assigned to the first group, their first drug treatment, and then their renal function is classified as one.

63
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:51,450
But for example, for this person right here, for this person right here,

64
00:06:52,260 --> 00:07:02,850
I follow them on 1090 919 units of time IV until that moment, they didn't die.

65
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,820
So that's what I know about that person, because I have a zero here.

66
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:12,450
I also know they were assigned to the second group drug treatment and their renal function is classified as zero.

67
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,700
Is this clear how to read this table? Okay.

68
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:25,739
So in this particular lab, we are only going to work with the first on the second variable later on.

69
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,180
After the break, we are going to incorporate the covariates into the analysis.

70
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,879
Okay. So how do we estimate survival probabilities in size?

71
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,880
We are going to use something that is called the proc life test.

72
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:45,210
So I have proc like this here. Data is my dataset, my role, the asset that I have.

73
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:51,690
And then very important I want to say the survival plot and then I have CRL.

74
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:57,630
So I display not only the estimate but also the confidence interval and then these are

75
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,010
risk here is going to show you is going to show something very specific in the plot.

76
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:11,550
I will tell you later what that is of any estimate or remember that in survival analysis we are interested in estimating probabilities,

77
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:20,370
but that's just an estimation, which means that for every estimate that I have, I should also have a standard errors and confidence intervals.

78
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:27,300
Correct? It's just that we are estimating probabilities, but it is standard errors on confidence intervals.

79
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:35,670
So these are the things. Nelson and as the we are under error I giving need those things.

80
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:46,950
The confidence interval understands our errors. These last four outs are equal something it's saving the output of this survival function.

81
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:59,490
Okay, so this is to save the outcome. And finally, the very, very important part in the project test is this last line that I have here.

82
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:12,450
So remember when, for example, when we run up crowd logistic, I have a model and then my outcome equal, my covariance.

83
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:20,820
This is something very similar. Instead of model I have time because that's the variable I'm using to estimate my survival probabilities.

84
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:28,530
So I have like time and then I'm gonna use and then I'm gonna use the two variables that I need from my dataset.

85
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:38,340
So duration, which is the observed time and then it starts, which is telling me for each of our time whether that person was like dead or alive.

86
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:48,980
So that's the basic. That's the basic notation we're going to use instead of model, which is the thing that we are used to.

87
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,700
For example, when we write for registry here in life space,

88
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:00,930
we use time because time is the variable that it's going to allow us to like calculate probabilities of survival after time.

89
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:06,930
T And then the equation here is use duration, which is the observed time and then also use this.

90
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,580
Paxos because that's the variable that I'm like whether they are life or no.

91
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,950
And then you're probably asking about like this zero here. We are going to modify it up later.

92
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:21,570
Just remember that for these loop, I'm not introducing any covariates.

93
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:27,420
I'm like estimating probabilities in the simplest, simplest possible way,

94
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:34,260
which is just taking into account the times that I observe and whether people were alive or dead at that time.

95
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:41,190
However, I could introduce some covariates, for example, whether they are smokers, sex, gender or race.

96
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,930
So we are in that case, we will change that later here.

97
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:55,840
So that's why this zero practices that we have here. Okay, then we run this up frog life test and why now?

98
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:00,990
But the real answer is this huge table, which is like the table of our estimates.

99
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,360
How do we read this table? So for example.

100
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,090
Okay. So, for example, this is telling me this is the time.

101
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:30,240
So, for example, the probability of surviving after time 13 it's equal to 0.88 the probability of surviving

102
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:37,260
after time 13 is 0.8 on the probability of dying of the complement which is 0.12.

103
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay, so that's how we read it. This is the time. Probability of surviving after time date is 0.88.

104
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:51,720
And then right here on there is time that errors. We have the standard error of that estimate, which in this case is 0.06.

105
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,190
We also have the cumulative hazard right here.

106
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:02,070
We also have at that point in time how many people have died and how many people are alive.

107
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,540
So, for example, remember in my dataset, I only have 25 subjects.

108
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:15,180
So this is telling me that by time 13 three people have already died in my data set and 22 are still alive.

109
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,290
Does that make sense? Do you guys have Jewish?

110
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,190
Any question about how to read this table?

111
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:36,260
Okay. We also have some summary some summary statistics.

112
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:45,350
Between the summarized statistics, there are two very important topics of the median underneath the mean.

113
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,140
I believe you haven't talked about this in class, so we will leave these for next lab.

114
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,750
However we can talk, we can and will do talk about the median in this case.

115
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:13,400
So the summary, a statistics table that I have here is telling me the probability of surviving after time 2000 until I remember that.

116
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:20,690
First of all, the median, you know, it's a 50%, it's equivalent to the median, which is a growing to like 0.5.

117
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:33,440
So these point estimate is telling me the following the probability of surviving after 2000 until units if units of time after 210 I'm sorry,

118
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,580
after 210 units of time, it's 0.5.

119
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:44,840
Does that make sense? That's how I read this date. The same goes for like these 25 that I have here.

120
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,640
This will be the probability of surviving after.

121
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:02,840
25. And so on and so forth. These value of the mean.

122
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:12,050
We'll talk about it later in the next class because this is something that we haven't covered in class.

123
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:21,970
And then finally, here we have just how many of our observations were censored on how many observations were actual?

124
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:31,940
That's in my dataset, but that's just a summary that you can kind of calculate by the very important output from Frog Life.

125
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,920
This is this graph. So this graph is just displaying the survival probability.

126
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:45,200
So for example, in this case, at times zero, this probability of survival is always one,

127
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,580
because at times zero, no, nobody have died, has died in my dataset.

128
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:54,520
And then we can see how is decreasing as time increases.

129
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:06,890
Okay. And then, for example, we were talking about that the median point five in the survival probability was something like 210.

130
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:15,410
So that just means that the value right here is close to 210.

131
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,890
Okay. That's just how I like we can visualize the value of the median.

132
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,310
So I have the probability of 0.5 here. And then if I draw a line, this will be 210.

133
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:36,490
The low shaded area is the confidence interval in this case is a 95% confidence interval.

134
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:46,370
B So vital probability here I have the time, of course, and then these values that we have in there are very small at risk.

135
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:55,790
So here I have 25, then seven is the number of observations, number of subjects in my dataset that are at risk in these like points in time.

136
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,450
Okay. Any questions so far?

137
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,080
Oh, just these are risk.

138
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:11,180
You can modify it whether you want it or not in your graph by just modifying these parameters here.

139
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:18,170
So if you include our risk there, it's going to display that like that number of people at risk.

140
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,460
Any questions so far on how to read or interpret these?

141
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,620
Take these graph this for. Yes.

142
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,470
How would you get the point from five? They could.

143
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,940
This is close to be 63. That's a good point.

144
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,720
Thank you for pointing that out. I didn't even notice it.

145
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,560
Thank you very much. This would be like the 63.

146
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,360
So this is actually displaying the.

147
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,040
The one minus is just like with the median one -0.5 is still 0.5.

148
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,400
So this is showing you like this 0.75 in the table in the graph here.

149
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,820
Does that make sense? Okay. Thank you.

150
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:42,549
And then just a little bit of lay home is probably just the only thing that is like maybe kind of hard

151
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:49,930
to in the graph that I have here is that these are these numbers may be confusing with the actual times.

152
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:54,470
So there there's some way to like change it to be below like right here.

153
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,060
So it's easier to read. And that's what I'm doing here.

154
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:10,830
So by setting outside equal zero, what we will do is just change that row of address to be right here, which is like maybe easier to understand.

155
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:17,530
And we kind of, we don't get confused with the actual duration or time that I have in the x axis,

156
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:25,960
but that's the only thing I'm doing, just changing that. I'm not modifying the survival probability or the graph itself.

157
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,460
Any questions so far? All right.

158
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:38,820
That's all for survival in. Now, the question is, how do I do it?

159
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:45,190
So in our the first thing, it's we need the survival package.

160
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:54,780
So make sure to first do install those packages survival and then hold the not very survival into your script.

161
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,910
Then what? What I'm doing here is just. I'm bringing my data.

162
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:05,610
Data set. In this case, the data side is the XP.

163
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:10,080
So I use the function rig table, but it can be any type of data set.

164
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:15,610
So I just read my data set. I know I have two columns X, which is the observer time data,

165
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:26,309
which is my the indicator variable and then my to correct some about Z and then to calculate the survival probabilities to estimate I'm sorry,

166
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:30,210
the survival probabilities I'm using. Probably it should change colors.

167
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,270
I'm using the function that is SQL Server. So Ft.

168
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:42,740
Okay. So Ft. There are a couple of things in this functions.

169
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:51,530
The first is that there are multiple ways to estimate survival probabilities in the.

170
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,340
Probably the most common used one is the couple in Mary's T mater.

171
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:04,330
So what I'm doing here is specifying that I want to use that estimate to estimate my probabilities.

172
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:09,640
So that's why I have here type problem there as well.

173
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:18,640
As we discussed before, since this is an estimate, I not only need the estimate but also the estimator errors and the confidence interval.

174
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,590
So here I'm just a specifying how do I want to calculate those errors?

175
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,010
And that is by using the green wood method. Okay.

176
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,320
So that's what I have here. And then my dataset.

177
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,120
Finally, the most important part in the survival function here.

178
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:43,020
It's how do I a specified model? The model.

179
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,630
It's just specify. In this.

180
00:20:50,960 --> 00:21:00,110
In this part. So I'm using the function which is also included in this part, which is u r v for survival.

181
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:07,309
And then here, remember that to the minimum number of variables that I need to estimate,

182
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:14,120
survival probably are two times on my indicator variable of whether they were alive or not.

183
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:22,010
So that's what I have here. So I want, I estimate, the survival probability of these times given whether people were alive or not.

184
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,150
So those are my two variables. And then I have Delta.

185
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:32,990
In this case, I have. I'm sorry. This is still up. I have Steve by one because I don't I'm not using any I'm not using any covariance.

186
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:40,490
However, later on, when we introduce more covariance in total model, we are going to change this one by multiple covariance.

187
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:47,430
You know, remember, this is very similar to when you specify a model, for example, in the GLM.

188
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,070
So you have the outcome and then the event and then all of your variants.

189
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:57,679
This is basically the same structure is just that the outcome is a little bit bigger because I

190
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:03,980
have to specify it's a survival probability that is based on time on my indicator function.

191
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:09,470
And whatever comes after the host is called the.

192
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:18,980
These we are symbol are the covariance. But because this is the simplest possible example and we don't have covariance, I just only have a one here.

193
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:30,010
Does that make sense? Okay. When we run that, the outcome of the summary of my function is very similar to what I had in the US.

194
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,710
So I have multiple times. I have the number of people, I have respect each time.

195
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:41,470
I have the survival probability and the confidence become the standard errors on the confidence interval.

196
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:48,220
You interpret these graph these probabilities in this same way.

197
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:58,510
So for example, here. The probability of surviving after time 23 is 0.8.

198
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:04,660
Okay. And there were 21 people at risk of that moment.

199
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,350
And also the confidence interval around that time.

200
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:14,440
It's between 0.610.97. Any questions so far?

201
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:25,230
Okay. You may be also wondering, how can I get the hazard ratio ratios?

202
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,630
There is an easy way to do it and actually there are two ways to do it.

203
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,840
The first one is. Run this line.

204
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:42,790
So this is my survival function and then money symbol and then cumulative hazards.

205
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,430
Or there's another way you can alter your global environment in art.

206
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,000
And the global environment is not.

207
00:23:51,010 --> 00:24:00,460
It's normally located at the right top part of your script where all of your variables are, and then you're going to find your function.

208
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:06,279
Survival data in this case. And there's like a little arrow.

209
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,150
If you click on that arrow, you can see all of the attributes for that function.

210
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:18,940
So, for example, I have how many people I have the different times of the number of respectful address people for each of the times.

211
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:24,540
The survival probability is this on that error on here I have the commodity cluster.

212
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,270
Okay. So that's another way to access the same information.

213
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,580
Any questions so far? Okay.

214
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:47,090
If we use the following command, which is print of my survival function, and then also print the arming equal draw,

215
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:56,480
I'm going to have those same 2550 unrestricted mean times that I have earlier in sorts.

216
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:00,080
So for example, these are mean is the restricted mean.

217
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:06,670
We will talk about that in the next class. But more importantly, I also have the medium we already talked about these.

218
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:15,050
Here is my 210. Okay. So the probability of surviving after I'm 50 because is the medium I'm sorry,

219
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:22,730
the probability of surviving after time 2000 and then is .5.5 because it's a medium and so on.

220
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:30,320
Okay. And then the most important part is, how do I love the survival probabilities?

221
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,879
Just use the function plot. So plot.

222
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,540
And then here I have my survival function. You can modify the level.

223
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:46,260
So if I use x amount time, I have time here.

224
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:54,250
So this is just for displaying the levels as well as I have survival probability here, which is the name that appears in the y axis.

225
00:25:54,810 --> 00:26:01,850
And if you only do like blood sort of data, it's going to display these exact graphs.

226
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:10,740
You don't have to do anything else is going to do it for you. We can read and interpret this graph exactly as we did it for subs.

227
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,510
So here I have my survival probability.

228
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:21,560
Between the dashes lines, I have the 95% confidence interval.

229
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:32,600
And then in this case, I'm only I am only displaying one survival probability because I don't have covariates.

230
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,100
I'm treating all of my patients as if they had the same characteristics.

231
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:43,970
However, for example, let's say I want to compare how effective are through drugs are.

232
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:54,320
So I have a number of people that are in Group one and then I have another group of people that are in group two for the second drug treatment.

233
00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:03,770
So what I could do, and we will do this next class is just instead of this plane, only one survival probability I could display to.

234
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:10,290
Sorry. Could this be another plot, something like this. And these will be, for example, foreign group, too.

235
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:16,560
And these will be, for example, from group one to control those things we can.

236
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:22,960
Include different groups, and that's the major part here.

237
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,400
But for now, you don't have to worry about that.

238
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:32,229
If we manage to display the survival plot like this, it's more than enough because we don't have any coffee.

239
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:38,510
It's for now. Does that make sense? Any questions so far?

240
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,550
Great. Well, that's it. So that's the good news. That's it.
