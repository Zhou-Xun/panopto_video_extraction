00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,750
Errors happen in life and certainly in data collection for epidemiology.

2
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:22,870
In fact, we spent the last several videos talking about how those errors can happen and what the impacts of those errors are on our analysis.

3
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:30,880
In this particular video, I'm going to walk you through different methods that we might use to minimize information bias in the design phase.

4
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:36,490
And then I'll describe some methods that we use to minimize information bias in the analysis phase.

5
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,210
So let's get started as always.

6
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,310
And I will keep saying throughout this whole course. When you start your study,

7
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:51,440
you really need to be thinking very carefully about what you want to collect and

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,380
why this will help you to define your exposures and your outcomes appropriately.

9
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:03,170
Thinking about timing. Thinking about what kind of construct you're trying to answer.

10
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:09,610
Now, once you do that, the next step, which is always a good idea,

11
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:15,790
is to use well-established and well-characterized measures of both your exposure and your outcome.

12
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,700
Preferably, we always want objective rather than subjective measures,

13
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:29,560
unless that is the purpose of our study is thinking about how, you know, people perceive a certain health outcome or exposure.

14
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:37,330
When we have measures that have not been commonly used in the past and are not well validated,

15
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:47,800
it is always valuable to pilot those new ones before using in our studies just to make sure that we really understand what data we're capturing,

16
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:55,210
what it means, and how much error it might have when it's impossible to get exactly the measure you want.

17
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:00,640
You might consider getting multiple measures because comparing across multiple measures,

18
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,510
each with our own type of error, is going to give us consistency and more confidence in our findings.

19
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:19,090
Now, next up, it is always advisable for studies to create detailed protocols on how you're supposed to collect the information of interest.

20
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,460
What this does is it ensures accuracy, it ensures precision.

21
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:31,570
It also ensures that you're going to have similarities across different investigators, across different observers.

22
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,890
And it means that you can transfer your data from one study to another.

23
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,970
For example, protocols might have advice in terms of teaching technicians not to use leading questions,

24
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:50,980
asking questions, neutrally, calibrating your instruments with zeroes for examples or known quantities.

25
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,630
And all of those things are going to improve both the validity and the precision of your measures.

26
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:07,390
Now, on the flip side of having protocols, you really need to be able to train and certify your studies staff.

27
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:16,210
If your study staff is not actually implementing those protocols correctly, you're still going to have problems with your data.

28
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,450
And so having methods of training people,

29
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:29,920
bringing them in periodically for retraining and even observing them during the study protocols can be highly valuable for good data quality.

30
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:40,270
Now, one final technique that we use in our studies in order to reduce information bias is the concept of blinding.

31
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,720
And this is specifically used in randomized controlled trial.

32
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:50,860
But the idea is, is that if investigators and participants do not know what their exposure is,

33
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,000
then they're not going to change the way that they report the outcome.

34
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:02,590
And there's a lower likelihood of introducing differential misclassification or measurement error in your studies.

35
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:13,690
Now, in spite of many of our best efforts, often our information is imperfect and we worry about information, biases, impacts on our study findings.

36
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,540
While all is not lost, the truth is,

37
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:22,840
is that our ability to correct for information bias in studies that have already happened can be quite challenging.

38
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,440
Now, as with selection bias, there are, however,

39
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:35,200
some techniques that people use either to quantify the impact of the bias or to remove the impacts of that bias.

40
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:42,100
But the ability to do this successfully really depends on how well we understand our measurements.

41
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:53,500
Now, one option when we have information bias is simply to anticipate the impacts of those errors and report that in our discussion section.

42
00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:00,610
My summary slide that I prepared for you in a previous video may be particularly helpful because it

43
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:06,430
gives you a summary as to the different directionality that you might see with misclassification.

44
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:16,060
Now another technique is that if we have validation data sets that allow us to characterize the errors in our measures,

45
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,040
it may actually be possible to calibrate our estimates explicitly.

46
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:28,870
Approaches like regression calibration effectively use validation datasets to simulate what

47
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:34,480
associations of interest might have looked like if the measurement occurred in the absence of error.

48
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,639
Now, to be honest with you,

49
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:44,590
these techniques are generally considered to be more advanced methods and are still not all that common in most mainstream epidemiology.

50
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Though I should note that the field is beginning to take these kind of issues much more seriously, and new methods are constantly evolving over time.

51
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,450
So in summary, I just want to reiterate that whenever we're designing a new study,

52
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:07,660
we really need to think about how the information we're collecting is going to impact our results.

53
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:14,440
With respect to information bias, you need to consider what you want to measure and when you're going to measure it.

54
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:23,530
You also want to standardize your measurements of both your outcome, your exposure, and even your covariates like confounders as much as possible.

55
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:31,960
In the event that information bias has occurred. It is possible to predict the directionality of that bias.

56
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:41,560
And sometimes we can even adjust a way of the biased when we have additional validation data sets that we can use to calibrate our information.
