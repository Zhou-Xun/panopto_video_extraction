1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:12,810
And I. I didn't send the wrong customer.

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,980
No, I guess I'm still older. What's the number here?

3
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,870
530. Yeah.

4
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:33,560
530 slash. 413.

5
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,940
Yeah. Okay. I should have, you know, cause.

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,220
We're going to do it. Okay.

7
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:52,310
Got. Yeah.

8
00:00:52,330 --> 00:01:06,370
The somewhat less severe students in the symposium was going to come back from Rackham for this is for this session on.

9
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,370
It's being recorded, he says. It'll be recorded at that point.

10
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,840
Okay. Some students don't feel so impressive.

11
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,670
Hmm. There's no crossover between it's in person, but it's recorded, so.

12
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,890
Yeah. Sounds good. All right.

13
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,170
I think we should get a start. Oh, so you have all these.

14
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,730
Hello, everyone. And thank you for staying strong here.

15
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,110
I know Friday afternoons. But it is my great pleasure to be here.

16
00:01:50,200 --> 00:02:03,220
We had to talk to Professor Horton, who'd come to talk about the vaccine cost effectiveness.

17
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:13,600
As I mentioned earlier, a professor who is from our health policy and prevention management,

18
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:23,460
and they really are experts in cost effective analyze vaccine and treatment to come in.

19
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:29,410
And we pulled up at the beginning of this class semester.

20
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:40,670
You know, the decision the vaccine development requires all that is involved in preparation for this.

21
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,470
At the very beginning of the process, we have four decision rational people.

22
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:54,970
And all of you have answered some exam questions about, you know,

23
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:04,300
how C column and cost effective analyzes if it's cost effective to develop a vaccine or to handle both.

24
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,670
So today we have four experts.

25
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,060
Professor Horton is the expert in cost effectiveness is.

26
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,130
Very, very interesting. Highly interactive.

27
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,290
Next year, over years. Oh, I'm glad to hear that. Yeah.

28
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,110
Okay. So, Savitri, tell the students as.

29
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:39,410
What about you? Sure. Well, I think you're doing a lot for the interaction and the opportunity to be here with you today.

30
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,530
So I'm I'm a professor in the Department of Health Management and Policy.

31
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,780
And so you'll get a little more of that kind of policy perspective on things today,

32
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,230
although my background is in kind of engineering and mathematical modeling and simulation.

33
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,440
So some of the things you've been learning about in this class for simulating infectious diseases,

34
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,850
that's something that I'm, you know, knowledgeable of and and interested in as well.

35
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:10,750
But I guess my my practice in operations research, industrial engineering, very much interested in efficient use of resources.

36
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:17,740
And the way I think about it is that cost effective science is really a type of analysis that can help us.

37
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:25,450
You better allocate resources better efficiently allocate resources thinking about the costs and the budgets that we have.

38
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,940
And then how can we maximize the health gains from those budgets?

39
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:34,690
And I will say vaccines oftentimes are very cost effective, a really good, efficient use of resources to improve population health.

40
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,430
I'm trying to mention to not only I do kind of the academic ivory tower thing,

41
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,830
but I have worked with policymaker policymaking groups like the W.H.O. on some hepatitis B policy,

42
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,240
CDC on a variety of kind of vaccine economics topics.

43
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,149
And I'm and hopefully we'll have time at the end to talk a little bit about that.

44
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,090
So different projects I'm working on and some things with Health and Human Services as well,

45
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,700
that kind of quantifying the value of about vaccination as well.

46
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:08,799
So what today, I want to talk to you briefly about cost effectiveness analysis in general, then talk about modeling, infectious disease modeling.

47
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,770
You probably already have a lot of that already. And then we'll talk about how these things tie together vaccines and cost effectiveness.

48
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,990
And then I'll give you some example, products that are worked on. So why should we care about this at all?

49
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,640
Some of you might be aware of The Onion, a great, great America's greatest news source.

50
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:37,620
But here's a. A fake news article here about a severe a hero, a severely injured woman, heroically fighting off the paramedics to avoid medical debt.

51
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,340
As you know, in the United States, health care costs are really expensive and that's a challenge for us.

52
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:48,870
So here's an example of current health expenditures per capita over a 15 year period or so on.

53
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,980
The United States is near the top of this.

54
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:04,100
Near the top of this chart, up here at the top with really high health care expenditures compared to a lot of peer countries.

55
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,240
But yet our life expectancy at birth is not better. Right.

56
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,440
If you think, okay, if we spend we spend a ton of money.

57
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:16,320
If we all lived to be 300 years old, that'd be great, right? It wouldn't be that bad if we were spending a lot more money than everyone else.

58
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,520
But in fact, our life expectancy at birth is much lower than these other countries.

59
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,840
Now, you could argue, though, the way we count, life expectancy at birth is different.

60
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:30,200
You know, infant mortality maybe is slightly different in differently in the United States, in other countries.

61
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,830
Or you might say, hey, the United States doesn't have health care coverage for everyone.

62
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,730
Right. That's not a fair comparison. Well, guess what is a fair comparison?

63
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,550
At the age of 80, everyone in America, we basically have socialized medicine here in the United States,

64
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,820
Medicare, pretty much everyone has Medicare or Medicaid around age 80.

65
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,150
But even at age 80, when pretty much everyone has health insurance,

66
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,960
we don't have better health outcomes, at least in terms of, you know, life expectancy.

67
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,299
You could look at a variety of different measures.

68
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,990
The United States is not some sort of shining beacon of health and longevity compared to the rest of the world.

69
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:10,569
But yet we spend a lot more money than the rest of the world. So that's why I would argue it's important to think judiciously about how we spend

70
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,800
your money and maybe we could do better things to get better health outcomes.

71
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:24,959
One important part of our, as you may be seeing things like this is an important, you know, cost driver is infectious disease.

72
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,640
Of course, we talked a lot about chronic diseases here in the nineties, but infectious diseases are still quite a big problem.

73
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:39,270
Here is a kind of little graph here showing an example from a paper in 2016 about some of the cost of vaccine preventable diseases here.

74
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,820
The nice big green one is influenza, but pneumococcal disease also very expensive herpes zoster shingles,

75
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:53,000
lower virus causing a lot of cancers, hepatitis B, something I've been involved in and other diseases.

76
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,540
So, you know,

77
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:02,010
a lot of this economic burden is attributable to vaccine preventable diseases and a lot of this burden is from people who have been unvaccinated.

78
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:08,640
So that's a that's a challenge. And by the way, this pie will grow as we have more vaccines to treat more and more things.

79
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,720
So why should we care? Well, again, we have limited budgets.

80
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,370
And I would argue, you know, we don't have unlimited funding. You can see with the inflation we're seeing recently, I mean,

81
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,390
there are challenges when the federal government tries to print more money and more money to pay for things.

82
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,280
We have expensive health care interventions. More and more often we see highly expensive interventions.

83
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,450
Even vaccines are some new vaccines are quite expensive.

84
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,219
So we have to make choices here.

85
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:39,710
And just in general on health, you know, maybe you can say, hey, should we spend money on preventing HIV or treating HIV?

86
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:47,500
Should we spend money on HIV versus diabetes? Maybe we should spend money on vaccines, but which vaccines and who do we give the vaccines to?

87
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:55,220
So we've got a lot of interesting policy questions here. How many of you have heard of comparative effectiveness research?

88
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:01,100
When you heard of Pickering, the Patient-centered Outcome Research Institute. Anyway.

89
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:07,909
There are there is this push in the world that can help policy to do in and actually in the world of medicine

90
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:14,330
and so forth to do comparative effectiveness research and understand which are the best interventions.

91
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,429
And a subset of that is cost effectiveness analyzes where we are interested in comparing,

92
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,880
you know, intervention versus intervention be or intervention versus doing nothing.

93
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,860
And we're also not only interested in the health outcomes, but also the cost outcomes.

94
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:33,890
So you can think about a variety of health policy examples, whether the infectious disease or not,

95
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,780
you know, breast cancer, HPV, vaccination, weight loss, drug addiction, transportation.

96
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,190
And then a lot of interesting questions here. You know, should women over 50 have annual mammograms?

97
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,540
Should young women get the HPV vaccine? Should young men get the HPV vaccine?

98
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:53,430
Should old men or women get the HPV vaccine? Who how should we're going to be transparent.

99
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,280
We've got a lot of interesting policies. And it's and I argued later on,

100
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:05,360
we actually have some tools where we can try to answer these questions and actually make comparisons across these different disease areas.

101
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,219
And it's difficult to think about, you know, a breast cancer question versus a weight loss question versus a transportation question.

102
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,840
But I think using certain methodology methods of approaches, we actually can make these comparable.

103
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:23,000
And hopefully in the next 20 minutes or so, you'll agree with me on just another example with thinking about resource allocation here.

104
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:31,460
So what if someone said, you know, that this is, you know, decades ago in the 1980s, there was an Illinois politician who said,

105
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:41,149
hey, we should screen all people coming in to get marriage licenses to see if they have HIV at that time.

106
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:45,620
And HIV was really stigmatized, really no treatment in the 1980s.

107
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,799
And guess what happens when people get married? Oftentimes they have sex. HIV is transmitted through sex.

108
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:58,160
So politicians said we should do it. We should mandate primary HIV screenings so people know if their partner is infected with HIV.

109
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,830
He said, If we could just find 100 people who could possibly infect another another hundred people, it will have been worth it.

110
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:12,890
Is there any problem with this statement? Maybe not.

111
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:20,180
Okay. I would argue, though, the resources are limited and maybe the state of Illinois didn't need to spend money on pre-marital HIV screening.

112
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:27,140
So what do you think would happen if, you know, in the grand think of it, this is 1980s.

113
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:35,150
HIV is a death sentence. There's no treatment for it. So what do you think would happen if Illinois institutes pre-marital HIV screening?

114
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:42,530
Yes. You're talking marriages, maybe a reduction in marriages.

115
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,820
Yeah. Yeah.

116
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:55,399
Well, um, so interestingly, if I've been sleeping around a lot and I'm engaged to my fiancee and I'm worried maybe I do have HIV, I don't really know.

117
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,000
Maybe I just myself. You know what I mean? Hey, honey, let's go to Vegas.

118
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,270
Get married in Vegas. Right. Let's go to.

119
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:07,040
I've heard there's a really nice venue in Indiana. Let's go across the border in Indiana and get married there.

120
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,390
Right. So, yes, you might you might actually have fewer marriages in Illinois.

121
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,970
It might not limit the total number of marriages, though.

122
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,470
You people are just going to go across the border to Wisconsin or Illinois or Indiana and so forth.

123
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:25,520
So interestingly, when they did this process here, after six months, the problems,

124
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:30,410
the marriage license applicants was about half that of the Illinois blood donor pool.

125
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,540
Now, interestingly, with you know, anything about this kind of things, typically blood donors have low prevalence of diseases.

126
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:39,860
So these are people who are who are civically minded, etc., etc.

127
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:46,760
Generally, generally they have lower prevalence of the general population, while the prevalence in marriage license applicants was half of that.

128
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:53,720
Now part of that might have been the people who actually went across the border to get married somewhere else or and so forth.

129
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,660
But, you know, typically if someone is deciding to be married, they might have different characteristics than other people as well.

130
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:05,450
So maybe this wasn't the best population to test to get to find as many people as you could.

131
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,420
In fact, many residents went to other states for marriage licenses,

132
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:13,850
and the cost per case found was more than 150 times the state's voluntary screening program.

133
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,470
So they didn't have a voluntary screening program.

134
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:22,550
And people who would choose voluntary screening probably had a hunch, Hey, maybe I'm infected, and they wanted to get it tested.

135
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:31,339
But this mandatory premarital HIV screening cost 152 times more than the state's voluntary screening program.

136
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,420
So maybe they should've just put more money into the voluntary screening program and found more people.

137
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,680
Quote, Is the money that was spent on this could have been per person, 150 million condoms.

138
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:49,310
Well, actually, sorry, I said earlier there wasn't a true and there was treatment AZT at the time, very new treatment for HIV.

139
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:54,990
It could have paid for AZT for one year for everyone identified as having age

140
00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:00,140
AIDS in Illinois or quadruple the state's expenditures on AIDS education.

141
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:06,799
So I guess I would argue, you know, although well-intentioned, this might not have been a very efficient use of resources.

142
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:14,780
It could have been used better in other places. So clearly, money is a problem and a limited resource here.

143
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,120
So let's talk about cost effective analysis and precisely what is cost effectiveness analysis.

144
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:25,129
Well, we are interested in understanding interventions, how it could be a medical intervention,

145
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,570
it could be a pharmaceutical intervention, it could be a public health intervention like a vaccination campaign.

146
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:37,130
And we want to look at costs and health outcomes cost and that effectiveness is really the health outcomes here.

147
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,690
And then we're going to compute something called a cost effects ratio, which I'll explain in a minute.

148
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:48,320
We also want to look at when I say costs and benefits, we want to look at really all benefits to everyone.

149
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,960
So not just the sick patient, but also the health care system, maybe the insurance company.

150
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,389
And depending on the type of intervention you're thinking about, you could think about the impact in the criminal justice system.

151
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:05,150
So maybe you're thinking about an intervention to give methadone maintenance therapy to people injecting drugs.

152
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:05,810
You know,

153
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:12,110
you might impact the criminal justice system and then also you might impact the families or other people in the community with an intervention.

154
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:18,470
So if theoretically, we want to look at as many costs and benefits across all of society in these analyzes.

155
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,150
Today I'm going to talk about we're talking about cost effectiveness analysis.

156
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:30,660
And specifically, we'll talk about a subset of that for cost utility analysis, the cost effectiveness analysis.

157
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,750
We're measuring dollars in monetary units.

158
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:40,830
We're going to measure the health outcomes, either in terms of some sort of natural health consequence, like number of infections prevented,

159
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,020
or we're going to mention we're going to measure something called the quality adjusted life improvements by the minute.

160
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:52,500
Keep in mind that sometimes there are health economic analysis done called cost benefit analysis.

161
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,729
And in those analyzes, all of the health outcomes are just measured in terms of dollars.

162
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:02,190
So we just say, okay, you broke your leg, that's $1,000 worth of payments.

163
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:09,540
We're gonna put a dollar value on it. Someone died, that's $10 million, and they'll put a dollar value on those health outcomes.

164
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:16,960
But in a cost effectiveness analysis and in particular a cost utility analysis,

165
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:22,960
we're going to try to measure those health outcomes into a common unit called a quality adjusted life year.

166
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,819
Now, if we want to, a life year is pretty clear. You live for a year or two.

167
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,540
You know, 2.2 years of life would be to life years.

168
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:38,370
But how do we quality adjusted life years? Well, we measure things in terms of a scale.

169
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,210
In fact, that's a 0 to 1 scale. And it's multiplied by the length of time in that health state.

170
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:49,030
And so we have to measure this quality adjustment.

171
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,210
And so it's on this zero one scale. And I'll give you some examples from the literature here.

172
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,210
So moderate chest pain might be 8.9 to asymptomatic HIV.

173
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,080
You have no symptoms, but you have some anxiety, right? So maybe 0.90.

174
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:13,680
A migraine might be a point 87. So we're going to go through this now, mild schizophrenia, though, could be pretty serious.

175
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,710
You pointed out they should only be 2.61 and so forth.

176
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:22,770
So the things where your quality of life is better near the top, two things at the bottom, it's worse quality.

177
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:30,540
So, for example, if you lived for one year with mild schizophrenia, we would say that would be 0.61 quality adjusted life years.

178
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,070
Let's say you live for two years with moderate chest pain.

179
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,930
3.92 times to 4.184.

180
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,070
So these are these are qualities that we associate with that now.

181
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:49,160
One of the question is, well, how do you get something on that zero one scale as this just professor, I'm sitting there.

182
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,160
I think that's a 0.62. No, it's not just, you know, someone guessing.

183
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:04,020
There is a several different approaches, but one of them is a very precise quantitative approach called the time tradeoff method.

184
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:11,400
And people who are in the population are surveyed and asked about various health status and how they compare to each other.

185
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,950
So one question might be this theoretical question here,

186
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:23,320
but how much time would you be willing to spend in a more desirable health state be followed by death versus time in a less desirable health state?

187
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:30,030
Followed by death? Yes. Yes.

188
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:43,730
The Panopto is the. So what how you calculate this, as you'd say, well, if in years in health safety is equipment and years of health state pay,

189
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:50,720
then the utility for A relative to B is an over M.

190
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,040
So let's walk through an example here. So this is a little more concrete.

191
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:08,149
So imagine blindness. Imagine that you have to have blindness and you have a complete loss of vision, no light sensitivity whatsoever.

192
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:12,470
You can't even tell if it's kind of light out or not if you're in the sun or or complete pitch black.

193
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:21,140
So you have zero light perception. Now imagine living for ten years with complete blindness.

194
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,860
Imagine what your life would be like if you live for ten years to complete blindness.

195
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:30,620
Now, when research academic researchers really do this, they give patients a lot of sorry,

196
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:40,820
the participants a lot of information about what is it like using Braille and in speeches, therapy and using the cane and all these kinds of things.

197
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,740
What is your life really like? So I.

198
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:50,030
I won't go into those details for today, but think about what your life would be like living with complete blindness for ten years.

199
00:19:51,440 --> 00:20:01,250
Now, imagine, is there a different period of time living in perfect health that you would consider equivalent to living?

200
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:07,180
Ten years of blindness. Well, I'll first ask you a question.

201
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,350
Who here would prefer to live with ten years in perfect health?

202
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:17,050
So, yeah, you have a choice. You can live for ten years with perfect health or ten years with blindness.

203
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:24,790
That's your choice. Who would choose ten years in perfect health? Who would choose ten years of blindness?

204
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:29,680
So you all prefer perfect health to blindness. Okay, that's. That's pretty, pretty normal.

205
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:39,490
Now, imagine the following different question. Can they for ten years with blindness or zero years in perfect health?

206
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:43,450
You just dropped out immediately. So who'd prefer to live?

207
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,380
Ten years of blindness. Would prefer to drop dead, Dimitri.

208
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,430
Okay. So you all prefer living in blindness than being dead?

209
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,040
That's good. That's. That's also pretty standard here.

210
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:00,860
Now, somewhere in between zero years in perfect health, we're dropping dead immediately and living for ten years.

211
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:07,220
In perfect health, you might be indifferent between living that amount of time in perfect health.

212
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,010
So zero and ten years in perfect health might be equivalent to ten years of blindness.

213
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:23,510
So think about that isn't. Think about that. You know what point at what length of time in perfect health would you say?

214
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:29,180
It would be really difficult to choose. When I gave you that choice of ten years of blindness versus a certain number of years of perfect health,

215
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:34,160
would you struggle saying, Boy, it's really tough to decide which one's better at that point.

216
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,970
Maybe you're indifferent. You're having a tough time deciding which is best.

217
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:46,640
So think about that. So we know it's somewhere between ten and zero.

218
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,500
Okay. So who is it different? Somewhere between nine and ten years.

219
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,160
They say nine and somewhere between nine and ten years in perfect health is equivalent to ten years of blindness.

220
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:10,890
So no one said that between nine and eight years and for any questions for first.

221
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:18,340
Who's in difference between like eight and nine years in perfect health, you think is equivalent to ten years of life?

222
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:25,830
It's. Nobody between seven and eight years, some seven or eight years.

223
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,210
Around there is where you're in different 770 years. Perfect health in ten years in blindness.

224
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:39,320
No. Between six and seven years with perfect health.

225
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:47,460
Okay. No one there within five and six years in perfect health is equivalent to ten years of blindness.

226
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,280
Two people have been four and five years.

227
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:02,330
Maybe six people or so between three and four years.

228
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:11,010
Perfect health is a common status once. One between two and three years in perfect health.

229
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:20,900
Ten years one is between one and two years in perfect health, the quality and years of one second and then zero one.

230
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:28,430
Okay. I think I just want to highlight a few things here. One is we've got, you know, most of our distribution in this classroom.

231
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:38,000
Most of you said, you know, maybe three, four or five years in perfect health would be equivalent to living ten years with blindness.

232
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:46,100
So this was kind of a quick and dirty exercise here. But I want to highlight, you know, there's some variation, though.

233
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,050
Not everyone gave exactly the same number. So it's not clear there's a precise right answer for everyone.

234
00:23:51,800 --> 00:24:00,080
But we can get a population wide estimate of how how bad blindness is compared to current, you know, perfect health.

235
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:11,270
Our utility then for complete blindness would be let's say you said four years of perfect health is according to ten years of blindness.

236
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,260
So your utility be four over ten or 0.4.

237
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,340
So our our utility value for blindness would be 0.4.

238
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:25,430
Now, why is this helpful? What helps us prioritize interventions to prevent blindness or to cure blindness?

239
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:32,180
If we if blindness wasn't a bad thing, maybe utility for blindness would be 0.99 or something.

240
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,310
But then there wouldn't be much value in averting blindness because you can't get much higher than 0.99.

241
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,970
The best you can get is 1.8. Now this is telling us that quality of life with blindness is 0.4.

242
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:48,980
Would it be really valuable to to get up to 1.0 to cure blindness or to avert blindness?

243
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:59,810
So it helps us kind of prioritize how important it is to address this issue of blindness with this quality adjustment.

244
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,870
Okay. So why do we use quality is again, it helps us prioritize again, blindness versus other things.

245
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:10,490
So let's say we're thinking about breast cancer, where you could think of breast cancer in terms of progression free survival.

246
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:14,870
You could think of an HPV vaccine intervention as preventing HPV infections.

247
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:21,589
Weight loss intervention maybe improves your body mass index, drug addiction.

248
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:28,550
Maybe if we do a drug addiction intervention, we reduce unsafe injections, maybe transplantation where you look at one year survival.

249
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,349
But all these are different metrics.

250
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:37,160
It's hard to compare investing in breast cancer versus weight loss versus transplantation versus drug addition versus HPV vaccines.

251
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,960
They're all different outcomes.

252
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:47,660
If, however, instead, we can measure the gains, the health gains of these in terms of quality adjusted life years, then we can make them comparable.

253
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:53,150
Then we can make comparisons between a breast cancer intervention and a weight loss intervention and a transportation intervention.

254
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,270
If we put $1,000,000 into transportation,

255
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:02,990
we could calculate how many quality adjusted life years are gained and then compare that to investing $1,000,000

256
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:07,760
in breast cancer treatment and look at how many quality adjusted life years would be gained from there as well.

257
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:15,750
So when we think about gains in a cost effectiveness analysis or cost utility analysis,

258
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,190
we think of all along along this dimension of quality adjusted life years.

259
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,110
So some interventions might be worse.

260
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:28,290
They might give us fewer quality adjusted life years and some interventions might be better and give us more quality adjusted life years.

261
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:36,300
So we want to think about where different interventions sit on this line here of effectiveness in terms of fewer and more quality adjusted life.

262
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,370
And we can use we'll talk about this in a minute.

263
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:44,070
We can use mathematical models to simulate what we think the long term total quality of life years with various policies will be.

264
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:49,980
But I mentioned we're doing something called cost effective analysis, so we want to look at also a cost.

265
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,930
So an intervention might be lower cost here at the bottom might be higher cost here at the top.

266
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,680
And so we can plot interventions on this two dimensional plane called the cost effectiveness point.

267
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,000
So we say, where is that intervention on this cost effectiveness plane?

268
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:15,010
So let's think of let's do a simple exercise, for example, here, where we have two interventions, A and B for convenience.

269
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:18,750
As for A, the origin doesn't really matter precisely where they are.

270
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:26,160
What is important is how they sit relative to each other. So you're a health policymaker.

271
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:35,980
Which intervention looks better, A or B? Who votes for a who says he is better?

272
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,570
Who says B is better? Why do you say it better?

273
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:48,749
Yeah. There's increased health benefit for me. Yeah, it's better on both dimensions.

274
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,930
Right. Giving us better health, lower cost. We're happy, right?

275
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:58,290
It's better on both dimensions compared to a what if instead intervention be is over here.

276
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:05,070
Now which one is better? What's one who says hey is better now? Who says B is better?

277
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,620
Okay. Yeah. So be here is worse. If it's. If it's over here, it's higher.

278
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,050
Cost makes your health worse. We said it's dominated.

279
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:19,200
If an intervention is in this moral left hand quadrant compared to something else, we say it saves money, but also makes your health worse.

280
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,509
So it's difficult to decide where, whether you like it or not.

281
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:29,459
Oftentimes, you know, some people might say, I'm not willing to consider anything that makes my health worse.

282
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,770
But but, you know, a lot of people argue, hey, it depends on how how much worse and how much you save money.

283
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,419
The good news is new interventions are rarely in this law and it's not going to

284
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,479
get past FDA approval or something like that if you get a new intervention,

285
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,860
that makes health worse. But what is interesting is this upper right hand quadrant.

286
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,940
This is where a lot of new medical interventions like or new public health interventions,

287
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,200
someone says, hey, please give me $10 million to do this vaccination campaign.

288
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,470
Well, that's going to cost money to do the intervention.

289
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:06,060
It's going to cost money to buy all the vaccines. And it costs money to hire a bunch of nurses to go out and vaccinate people, etc., etc.

290
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:13,320
So it's probably going to increase costs, although it might also make sure it's going to increase costs going up here and there,

291
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,270
but hopefully it's going to improve health as well.

292
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:20,850
Now, here in this operating quarter, it's you have to think carefully about where you are in this upper right hand quarter.

293
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,360
So if you're way over here, if you're really,

294
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:31,319
really giving a lot of big a lot of health gains and the incremental cost is not that much, then maybe it looks like a good deal.

295
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:40,379
So if someone said, hey, I'll give you an extra ten years of life expectancy in perfect health so you won't even have a hanging on your finger or.

296
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:47,670
STEPTOE Perfect health. And so but it's going to cost you $100 who be willing to pay for that.

297
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,150
Yeah, that's a pretty good value for money, right?

298
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:55,590
Even though it increases cost, it might be worth it if it gives you, you know, ten years of perfect health care.

299
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,940
In fact, you probably pay a lot more than $100 to get ten years in perfect health.

300
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,670
So it's more favorable over here.

301
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:12,060
However, if something is up here where the health gains are kind of minor, but there's a really big cost to it, it's not as favorable.

302
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,510
So what if I said I'll give you an extra 3 seconds of life expectancy?

303
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,520
And by the way, it's going to be pretty crummy life expectancy and it only costs you $30 billion.

304
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:26,520
Can you say me? You know, yes, it is improving my health. It is excellent.

305
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,819
Life expectancy is a fourth, but that's too expensive. That's not a good value for money.

306
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:36,360
So that's, you know, something that's less favorable. Now, oftentimes, these health questions are not quite as simple as the ones I just gave you,

307
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,389
but that's what kind of what we do in this upper right hand quadrant is.

308
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,799
Think about that value for money.

309
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:48,720
So again, things here, if a new an intervention is really giving us a lot of big health gains at low additional cost,

310
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,500
it's more favorable than something over here is less favorable.

311
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:59,430
How we think of things in that quadrant is we covered an incremental cost effectiveness ratio.

312
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:05,640
So we look at how much more are we spending versus how much additional health benefit we get.

313
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,770
So we think about our new intervention and its impact.

314
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:15,740
What are the costs if we don't do the intervention? What are the benefits?

315
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,129
What our what's our life expectancy,

316
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:21,930
our quality adjusted life expectancy with the intervention minus what it would look like without the intervention.

317
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:29,340
And basically, to say price that you're paying, how much are you paying to in some ways buy a quality adjusted life year?

318
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:37,130
And so we want. So actually. So if you had a really high cost effectiveness ratio, is that good or bad?

319
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:48,120
Let's think about this equation here. If this number is really high, is this intervention good or bad?

320
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:56,240
Yeah. It's bad, right? You'd be spending a lot of money for the health gains you're getting.

321
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,640
If the ratio is really low, that means the costs are low, but the benefits are high.

322
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:08,080
So you want to. And anyway, the way to think about this also, it's kind of it's a price you're paying to buy quality adjusted life years.

323
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,060
And so you want to buy things at a low price.

324
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:22,860
So typically in the U.S., anything that costs less than $50,000 per party just look like you're pretty much all kind of health policy.

325
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,310
People who know this kind of stuff would say, that sounds like a really good value for money.

326
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:32,400
We routinely pay for a lot of things that cost $50,000 for quality, just like your gain or loss.

327
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:40,350
Now, if something's between 50 and $150,000 per year, maybe $200,000, probably people will debate about whether that sounds cost effective for a lot.

328
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:46,260
You know, a lot of people would say, though, we should be willing to spend up to 100, 150,000, $200,000 per family.

329
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:53,340
That's still probably a good value for money. And then once it gets really, really once it gets over, let's say, $200,000 per family,

330
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,380
then a lot of people say if that sounds too expensive, maybe that's not something we want to spend our money on.

331
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:04,230
Instead, we should spend that money on the things that cost $50,000 per year less if you think about this,

332
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:12,840
if you want to buy those qualities at a low price. And so if someone offers you, hey, here's a new intervention, but it costs $200,000 for quality,

333
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:17,160
you probably should say I would rather take that money and invest it in one of

334
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,210
these other interventions that gives me more more bang for my butt if you want.

335
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:29,530
Any questions? Yeah, I was just going to ask. So is this something that's usually done like animation, violent movies?

336
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:40,280
Because I imagine there are more places that have like more low income communities, like the price you pay for, like it could be a lot better.

337
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:46,310
So is this something that's done like or implemented more locally or like nationwide?

338
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:49,100
You can do it at a variety of scales.

339
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:56,120
So you could say, you know, is this cost effective in Detroit or is it cost effective in Ann Arbor or Michigan or California?

340
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:05,510
Although I will say most analysis in the U.S. or just for the general U.S. population, a lot of it depends on, you know, the wages and so forth.

341
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:12,110
So if it costs you know, if you're in Manhattan, it costs more to pay that nurse to deliver an injection than it does in rural Kansas or something.

342
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,390
So. So the cost of the intervention might be different.

343
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:23,209
One thing I didn't really highlight, though, is also with the on this scale here, this this costs inequality.

344
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:27,410
There's a lot because you should be the net costs and the net quality just the like.

345
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:37,580
So if I have an intervention that costs $1,000, but it saves me $700 in long term health expenses, then the net cost is $300.

346
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:46,040
I spent $1,000. I saved $700 in long term health expenses, like I prevented cervical cancer or something like that.

347
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:53,600
So I want to know what's the net cost impact and then the quality, just the life years too.

348
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:58,570
This also depends on the the net health impact.

349
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:03,200
So at 11 a.m. or 10 a.m. or something, 10 a.m., I got a flu shot.

350
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,130
My arm hurts a little bit today. That is a reduction in my quality of life.

351
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:13,460
Now, presumably, though, the net health benefit is going to be greater than that because hopefully I know that my likelihood of getting,

352
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:20,300
you know, preventing flu and the severity of how how bad that illness would be is worse.

353
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,900
And, you know, that's a bigger impact magnitude than this organism I are.

354
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:31,309
So you. But the net impact should include, you know, the loss of quality of life along with the benefits of quality of life.

355
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:40,410
Yes. So it was partially this depends on the perspective you're taking.

356
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:49,430
So earlier I mentioned we want to take a societal perspective and so interesting, you know, an insurance company is kind of part of that.

357
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:55,640
And oftentimes the government, whether the government, the insurer or private health insurance.

358
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:00,050
But one way or another, someone is paying for the service.

359
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,170
I mean, if we're taking a societal perspective,

360
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:11,120
we kind of don't care whether the patient pays the full cost or insurance or a private insurance pays the full cost or government pays the full cost.

361
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:18,350
Someone is paying the cost of that disease. And so when you're taking a societal perspective, you look at all the whoever's paying costs,

362
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:25,550
whether I have a 10% co-pay or 100% co-pay one way or another, someone is paying for that disease or something like that.

363
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:33,560
Now, you can also take a different perspective, and you can take that and you can just look at from a payers perspective like Blue Cross.

364
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,990
So how does this affect Blue Cross's costs?

365
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:41,660
That gets a little more complicated because then you have to figure out, well, Blue Cross pays 80% of this cost and none of this other cost.

366
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,920
But but sometimes that can that can give you some insights.

367
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:59,480
I did an analysis, but this is not related to vaccinations, but I did an analysis with some people in geriatrics looking at an intervention to reduce.

368
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,310
Infections or infection control in nursing homes.

369
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:10,739
And it turns out it's kind of expensive to do infection control because every time someone comes into the room, they get up,

370
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:18,150
down, down and got gowns and masks and gloves and and do extra cleaning in the in the rooms, in the nursing homes and stuff.

371
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,470
So that's kind of expensive. But you can prevent some some infections within the nursing home if you do that, all that stuff.

372
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,610
And as it turns out, there is an increased cost for the nursing home.

373
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,790
And there was some benefit, though, in terms of reduced infections.

374
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:37,200
And those savings from the reduced infections was about the same as the cost to the nursing home.

375
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:42,840
So the nursing home was like, Yeah, sure, maybe we'll do this because it doesn't actually cost us that much additional money.

376
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:46,770
But they weren't like jumping whenever. Yes, we're to do this sort of thing.

377
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,350
So much money. It was it was like a kind of a wash.

378
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:56,940
But when you look at the bigger picture, if you're like Blue Cross, guess what happens when someone gets an infection in the nursing home?

379
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:01,980
There might be some cost of care of the nursing home. But if it's bad enough, that person is going to the hospital.

380
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,480
Now, when that patient goes to the hospital from the nursing home, who pays for that?

381
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:11,280
To the nurse who will pay for that? The nursing home doesn't pay for that.

382
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:19,290
So that's not their problem. That's not their cost. They don't see the benefits of averting that $20,000 hospitalization, but Blue Cross does.

383
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:24,050
So when you look at Blue Cross perspective, you know, they're they're really excited.

384
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,209
They want the nursing home to do this intervention of infection control because

385
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,850
that will save them a bunch of money and really expensive hospitalizations.

386
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,810
But the nursing home doesn't see that because they don't pay for those hospital patients.

387
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,870
So sometimes if you do the analysis from a couple of perspectives, you can get a sense of the bigger picture and the local picture,

388
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:47,400
and you can see the local nursing home doesn't have in my mind, doesn't have the proper incentives to do what you think is best.

389
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:53,280
So then maybe Blue Cross needs to properly incentivize the nursing home to do the right thing.

390
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:59,640
Does that answer your question? Okay.

391
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:04,560
So yeah, here are a few example cost effectiveness ratios.

392
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:10,870
Um, I like keep in mind that the, the value of intervention is not just the technology like using condoms,

393
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:19,540
but it's condom use program for high risk women. So it's a intervention applied to a population.

394
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:29,710
So if you gave condoms to a population that wasn't high risk, maybe wouldn't be as valuable.

395
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:36,520
Like, this is a pretty low cost factory, just good money. And then here we have HPV vaccination of women age 35 to 45.

396
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,410
Now, HPV vaccination is cost effective in younger people.

397
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:48,430
But for people aged 35, 45, it might not be as valuable. So it's it's an intervention applied to a specific population.

398
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,200
Okay. Next is modeling. I'll go through this actually before we go to modeling.

399
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:01,340
Any questions about cost effectiveness in general? We're measuring cost health outcomes.

400
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,390
Yeah. I have kind of like a follow up question.

401
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:10,000
I know you were talking about how it's usually you get your analysis done where you get nationwide.

402
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:20,470
Mm hmm. How do you see, like, the discrepancy between, like, local variability compared to a national level analysis in cost effective?

403
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:29,680
Do you think it's something that certain communities like it misrepresented by certain communities or missed by these analysis?

404
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:38,349
It could be. I mean, I will say in the US, as someone who does this kind of analysis,

405
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:42,159
you want your analysis to be as generalizable and cover as many people as possible.

406
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:48,280
So oftentimes we will just say this is what the policy should or will analyze this from the perspective of the United States.

407
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:52,970
But you're right, sometimes there might be there might be specific populations that are higher or lower risk.

408
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:59,049
I'm working on a project with CDC right now or looking at some high risk populations in low risk populations.

409
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:06,400
And we you know, we were saying, you know, maybe you should do hepatitis B screening and STI clinics because that's a higher risk setting.

410
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:13,390
But maybe you shouldn't do that in other settings or vaccination in that setting versus another setting or something.

411
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:21,690
So you want to end it. And it could be geographic, but it could be other characteristics, like, you know, people coming to this type of a clinic.

412
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:31,470
Okay. So we'll often use mathematical models to simulate or ask me, I think the long term impact of policies might be.

413
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:37,820
The way I think about modeling is it's it's a it's an input to help us answer these questions.

414
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:41,280
So it helps us simulate where we think the outcomes are going to be.

415
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,280
And typically, these mathematical models are going to be explicit in their assumptions and their value judgments.

416
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:51,749
And when I say assumptions, it's things like what's the prevalence of this disease or incidence of this disease, but also value judgments.

417
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:58,110
So what is the quality of life with blindness? So we would plug in quantitative blindness as a 0.4.

418
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:04,979
Now, you could disagree with that number, but at least we're being explicit saying we think the quality of the value of

419
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,840
having this health state is is this also dollars is a value judgment saying,

420
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:15,000
you know, this kind of surgery is a $20,000 surgery. This kind of surgery is a $5,000 surgery.

421
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:19,320
We're putting a value judgment on those, you know, the resources used for those activities.

422
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,800
Now. Why do we use models while clinical trials actually are great? If you have them, they're kind of the gold standard,

423
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:34,760
but they oftentimes we don't have clinical trial data for everything we want and it can be expensive and time consuming,

424
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,370
especially if you want to look over a longer time horizon.

425
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:44,840
Mathematical models can be used to tie evidence together from multiple sources and and simulate what we think the longer time periods might be.

426
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:49,520
And also in complex populations where you might have dynamic transmission effects,

427
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:55,220
which you know, a lot of our interface, I guess, but a simple model might be a decision tree.

428
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:00,820
So how many of your familiar decision trees? Okay.

429
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:07,360
So this rectangle represents the decision. The arms emanating out of it represent the alternative choices we have.

430
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,310
So this this is a simple kind of finance finance example.

431
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,440
So we can say, choose not to invest or choose to invest.

432
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:18,280
And then if you invest, you might your investment might be a success or not.

433
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:26,920
And so the circle represents uncertainty. The arms emanating out of that represent the alternative ways that the uncertainty could resolve.

434
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,730
And the P and the one might be represent the probabilities of those things happening.

435
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:39,390
And then finally at the end, we have the outcomes we care about. This is some sort of finance investment thing.

436
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:47,049
Maybe we have a small pile of money. If we if we don't do it, a medium sized pile of money, if we don't invest, if we invest,

437
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:51,370
and if successful, a big pile of money if we invest and it's not successful, we have a very small problem.

438
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:57,270
Now, that's a kind of financial example here, but in health care, we have slightly different ways of thinking.

439
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,820
We might choose to vaccinate or not. Let's say it's a perfect vaccine.

440
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:07,060
And so if we if we vaccinate, we spend money on the vaccine, but we definitely are not going to get infected.

441
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,090
And maybe if we choose not to vaccinate,

442
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:18,670
then we're uncertain whether we're infected or not is probably will get infected and probably we won't be infected with this health outcome.

443
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,140
Now we care about more than just money. We care about cost, budget framework, we care about dollars and health outcomes.

444
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:29,920
So maybe if I chose to get vaccinated, I had to spend money on the vaccine.

445
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:39,579
So it's a moderate amount of money, but it's healthy. If I chose not to get vaccinated and I did get infected, I spent money on the vaccine.

446
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:42,790
Plus I have to pay for the expenses of having this disease.

447
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:47,410
And so this is kind of a worst outcome. I spent money on this and I got affected.

448
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:54,610
And then the best outcome is, is if I if I don't get vaccinated and I don't get the disease, it's the cheapest.

449
00:44:54,670 --> 00:45:00,340
And I also am healthiest. But that doesn't mean we should not get vaccinated here.

450
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,760
Right? Because there's a probability that I. The worst or the best outcome here.

451
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,750
If I if I go back to sorry anyway.

452
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,840
Okay. So let's, let's do an example here.

453
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:25,520
Let's say the risk of infection without a vaccine is 10%. If you're infected, you have to be treated at a cost of $3,000.

454
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:32,720
The vaccine itself costs $200 per person in this in this example, it's not a perfect vaccine.

455
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,440
It only reduces the risk infection if infection in half.

456
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:44,940
So my question for you is, is this intervention cost saving? Thinks is crossing.

457
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,870
We think it isn't cost saving. Who doesn't know you?

458
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:56,320
Okay, good answer. That's why we use these decision trees to help us answer these questions.

459
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:59,490
It's kind of diagram it out and do the math if you want.

460
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:08,340
So we're asking the questions to be vaccinated or not. And if we don't vaccine vaccinate, we have a 10% chance of getting infected.

461
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:14,400
90% chance of that. And if we do vaccinate, we drop that risk of infection in half to only 5%.

462
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:20,549
And then here we have the costs. If you vaccinate, let's you talk here.

463
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,610
If you don't, vaccine is 3000 hours cost of being infected.

464
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:27,600
If you don't, actually you're not getting infected. It's $0 cost.

465
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,540
And the infected coughs are the same. Except we spent $200 on the vaccine, too.

466
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:38,130
So if you vaccinate and don't get infected, you spend $200 if you vaccinate.

467
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:43,830
But we're unfortunate enough to also get infected. You spent 2 hours in the vaccine, plus 3000 hours for the disease.

468
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,320
So those are our this is our decision tree.

469
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:57,000
Just looking at the costs to solve this, we have what's called an expected value, which is multiplying the probabilities, times the outcomes.

470
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:04,680
So here we would get an expected value of $300 for the top.

471
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,270
10% times 3000 and the bottom we get an expected value of $350.

472
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:16,070
That's 5% times 3200 plus 95% times 200.

473
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:23,490
So we find out that this intervention is unlikely to be cost saving.

474
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:29,280
Now, it doesn't mean it's a bad intervention. That just means that it's it's not going to save us money.

475
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:35,330
And in the other simple example, so let's do this.

476
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:41,930
This is an analysis example. Part two. Same thing except the life expectancy of the population is ten years.

477
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:48,860
Assume the infection. Infection does not affect life expectancy, but it does affect your long term quality of life.

478
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:56,629
So the infected people have a quality of life of 0.9 for the rest of their lives, and the uninfected people have a quality of life.

479
00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:07,190
1.0 are perfect health for less than lives. So if you live in perfect health for ten years, how many quality adjusted life years would you get?

480
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,450
Perfect health. Quality of life is 1.0 for ten years.

481
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:23,150
Well, how many quality adjusted life years would that be? Do you think? Ten.

482
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:28,640
Yeah. You take the length of time to catch the quarterback, so it'd be ten. Now if you live for ten years with a 2.9.

483
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,070
How many quality adjusted life years we do it. We have no.

484
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:40,160
Okay, so let's build the tree here. It's the same structure. Except now here.

485
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:45,980
Let's look at the quality of life years we get from this. So here we say, okay, if we don't vaccinate and you get infected,

486
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,510
we end up with nine quality adjusted life years, which is point nine is 25 times ten years.

487
00:48:54,320 --> 00:49:00,620
And then if you don't get infected, you attend quality just about year nine if you do get infected.

488
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:12,530
Okay. So now we if we roll this back or calculate the expected values we see, that vaccination gives us 9.95 quality just like yours in expectation.

489
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:17,390
And then we've actually we did 9.9 quality adjusted life years.

490
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:26,640
So we think this will improve quality of life. So now we can plot this on our cost effectiveness plan.

491
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,750
So we have no vaccination. We got 9.9 40 in just five years.

492
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:37,200
$300 was our total cost. Now add the yes vaccination.

493
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:44,070
Here we get 9.95 quality adjusted life years or we spend $350 on average per person.

494
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:58,170
So we have an incremental cost and we're paying an additional $50 per person, but we're gaining 0.05 quality adjusted life years.

495
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:08,190
So when we work this out, our incremental cost benefit ratio is the incremental cost divided by the incremental quality adjusted life years,

496
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:13,650
$50 over oh five and we get $1,000 per quality adjusted life years.

497
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:25,830
Is that a good value for money? Should Blue Cross pay $1,000 to buy a year in perfect health?

498
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:39,500
Or is that too expensive? Should Medicare pay $1,000 to add a year in perfect health to their.

499
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:46,430
They're the people who are covered by Medicare. Should Medicaid.

500
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:57,070
Would you guys pay $1,000 to get an extra year? Like, let's say you found out you had a terrible disease, are going to die tomorrow.

501
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:04,390
Or you can pay $1,000 in live for an extra year of life. Is it worthwhile to pay that $1,000?

502
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:10,480
Yes. Yes. That was no. It's probably just like you're using incredibly valuable, I'd say, anywhere on the planet.

503
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:19,089
That's that's considered a cost effective use of resources. So in this hypothetical simple example, what's wrong about this example?

504
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:37,230
Where are some things that I left out? Yeah.

505
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:55,420
Um, so that's, yeah, that's five hundredths of a quality adjusted life year.

506
00:51:55,660 --> 00:52:00,040
And so that would be 15 days or 16 days or whatever it is.

507
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:08,020
Yeah. Mm hmm. So would you pay $50 to live an extra 60 days in perfect health?

508
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:18,010
It should be kind of the same question here about paying $1,000 to get an extra year of life.

509
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:22,570
Would you pay $50 to get an extra 60 days of life or whatever it is?

510
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:28,510
And, you know, I would argue I think most of us would pay that amount.

511
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:34,810
I guess I'll point out a few things here. One is this example.

512
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:40,780
I'm just assuming that if I if I vaccinate you, it reduces your risk of getting infected.

513
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:45,150
But we don't look at any community benefits to.

514
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:51,430
If I if I get the vaccine and I'm less likely to become infected, maybe I'm less likely to transmit to other people.

515
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:55,480
Now, that might that that might only be true in certain situations.

516
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,870
So I got this flu vaccine that might give me some immunity,

517
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:05,110
but it might not prevent me from getting the virus in my mucosal membranes, in me coughing it back on people.

518
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:13,450
So some some vaccines might might prevent the rest of people from it, but might just prefer to protect the individual who is protected by this.

519
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:15,250
But anyway,

520
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:22,300
what we can do with these mathematical models is kind of combine data from different sources where risks and benefits and explore long term outcomes.

521
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:28,510
So again, in this example here, maybe in trying to do this analysis,

522
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:33,129
you would have to, you know, understand what's the baseline risk of getting infected.

523
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:39,010
So maybe you'd find out from the epidemiological literature. Then we have to know how much does the vaccine reduce that risk of infection?

524
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:42,970
Maybe that comes from a clinical trial about the effectiveness of the vaccine.

525
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:48,670
Maybe I have to understand the quality of life with this disease. There might be some sort of study that looks at that.

526
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:53,500
Maybe I need to know how expensive is this disease?

527
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:56,710
Is it $3,000 to treat it? That might come from another study.

528
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:06,190
So you're getting data from a lot of different places and putting that together to weigh those risks and benefits and the costs and benefits really.

529
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,000
So there is a $200 cost to the vaccine. Is that worthwhile?

530
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:20,219
So that's what we're able to do with these approaches here. So we can say also looking at kind of weighing risks and benefits here.

531
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,390
So this might be a more complicated decision tree or say who we vaccinate or not.

532
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:29,760
Do you contracted or not? If you're infected, you see the doctor or not?

533
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:34,570
If you see the doctor, do you go to hospital or not? If you go to the hospital and so forth.

534
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:40,890
So you can make these decision trees a lot more complex and maybe you have risk of adverse events,

535
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:45,960
maybe have benefits in terms of reduced infection risks.

536
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:46,770
And again,

537
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:54,810
you might be tied together different sources of evidence from various studies on vaccine adverse events and general infection risk and so forth.

538
00:54:57,470 --> 00:55:02,450
One of the things that could be important is looking at population effects.

539
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:06,260
And so there you can use a variety of epidemiological models.

540
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:12,860
So just as an example here, we might have people who are susceptible to become infected that can be recovered.

541
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:21,680
And as you know, the interesting thing in these kinds of models are that the risk of becoming infected depends on how many people are infected.

542
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,890
And so these things can happen over exponential growth.

543
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:30,620
You know, if you have more and more people becoming infected, that that increases the infection rates.

544
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,700
So you get these nonlinear effects here where you might have something with has,

545
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:41,500
you know, rapid kind of exponential growth in the beginning and it kind of tapers off.

546
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:47,050
Why does this taper off? Why does this taper off peak when the distraught infinity.

547
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:55,360
Yeah. Because you're you have greater suffering. You have fewer and fewer susceptible people if you don't have any more susceptibility.

548
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,750
But you can't grow any more. Exactly.

549
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:06,509
But you get these interesting nonlinear effects, first of all, in the infection patterns, and we'll see later the effect of policies.

550
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:11,160
So, again, that you can think about some disease is kind of multiplying and spreading through the population.

551
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:21,810
But if we have a vaccine, it prevents one person getting infected and maybe prevents some sort of further chain of infections down the down one.

552
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:28,260
So vaccinating one person with some specific types of vaccine and so forth can protect more than one person.

553
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:36,960
So what we can do if we're doing vaccine cost effectiveness is we can use these first.

554
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,969
Are you going to use just decision trees?

555
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:44,880
And oftentimes those were great for interventions that you don't think are going to have secondary kind of population wide effects.

556
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:49,920
But if you do think you have an intervention that has these effects on population transmission,

557
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:57,990
you can use transmission models to simulate the impact of the vaccine on the general kind of broader population.

558
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:11,080
So here is a simple example where we have a very simple disease that over the course of 100 days or so ends up infecting 80% of the population.

559
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:18,310
Simple susceptible, infected recovered model here. This, I think is an R0 of two.

560
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:23,709
And so we can look at the effects of vaccine.

561
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:29,220
We can simulate that by starting the model off with a certain fraction of the population being vaccinated.

562
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:35,320
What I just showed you is what if 0% of the population is vaccinated, within about 80% of the population ends up getting infected?

563
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:44,260
That's the cumulative population. But if we vaccinate 100% of the population, then basically no one gets infected.

564
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:57,520
And we can we can graph what happens here. So if we vaccinate, let's say, 20% of the population, then only about 55% of population gets infected.

565
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,500
We actually 40% of population and maybe only 20% of population gets infected.

566
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:09,060
Another way of looking at this, so this is the the bad we're reducing the bad, if you will, the population infected.

567
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:12,400
We can also look at the good side of this kind of invert that curve.

568
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:18,040
So how many cases are we averting? So is it actually more restoration were averted.

569
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:21,850
More and more of those effective infections were preventing more and more infections.

570
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:28,360
Now, the interesting thing here is this is nonlinear, like as we vaccinate the first 20% of the population,

571
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:36,100
we're preventing, you know, 28% of the population from getting infected, an additional 28% getting infected.

572
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:42,550
If we go in vaccine, 40% of population now, maybe we've prevented 60% of the population from getting infected.

573
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:51,460
If we go up to 60% of population and cover them now, maybe 75% of the population or more has been averted those infections.

574
00:58:53,620 --> 00:59:03,310
But when we go to hit 80% of the population or 100% the population, what I want to highlight here is this jump half is non-linear here.

575
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:07,780
We get a big benefit from the fact that the first 20% package is a big benefit from vaccinating and

576
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:13,330
explains the foundation a pretty good better benefit from vaccinating the next 20% of our patients.

577
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:17,230
But as we go further and further, we get diminishing benefits.

578
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:21,160
Vaccinating that next person is less and less valuable in this example.

579
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:25,570
And so that's an interesting kind of nonlinear effect here.

580
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:31,450
And so this gets at the concept you probably heard about this possible indirect effects or herd immunity, right?

581
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:36,820
Once we get up to that herd immunity threshold, it's really important to get up to that threshold.

582
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,720
But then kind of going way, way, way beyond it is maybe not as valuable.

583
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:48,500
Also, some other small things are interesting in the world of kind of vaccine policy,

584
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:52,880
and that is the costs of vaccination programs might be non-linear as well.

585
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:57,410
So maybe you have some sort of fixed cost of doing the vaccination program like you're going to, you know,

586
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:05,030
rent a bunch of trucks and hire a bunch of people and so forth and buy a bunch of vaccines and buy a bunch of refrigerator space to store vaccines.

587
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:13,490
Or maybe there's kind of a fixed cost of just starting just doing any kind of program and then maybe it has some sort of cost per person.

588
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:17,600
So every additional person, I've actually been adding more and more costs.

589
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:26,840
So that is that's that might be how this looks. But then, as you can imagine, reaching those last people might be more and more expensive.

590
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:33,620
Think about the coronavirus vaccines. When we first vaccinated people, people were really eager to get vaccinated.

591
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:37,820
And, you know, January, February, March of 2021.

592
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,340
Right. Many of you probably weren't in that camp,

593
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,230
wasn't didn't take much convincing to get you to go out and get get vaccinated for that with the coronavirus vaccine.

594
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:49,310
Now, with that said, there are a lot of people in the United States and around the world who are

595
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:53,630
more hesitant about that and really were not excited about getting vaccinated.

596
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:58,340
And so it was pretty easy to vaccinate the first 50, 60, 70% of population.

597
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:03,700
But there is a certain in this, in our example here, a certain fraction of population that's very hesitant to get vaccinated.

598
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:06,860
And it might take a lot of effort to get the vaccine.

599
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:12,740
Think of that in case the corner of vaccine where people you could also think about this and have, you know,

600
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:18,560
maybe you're trying to vaccinate people who are homeless and trying to reach those last people who are homeless might be really difficult.

601
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:23,600
They were polio eradication, vaccinating, you know, the first 99% of the global population.

602
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,560
It wasn't too difficult.

603
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:32,000
But actually, that last 1% of population for polio and eradicate polio, that's very expensive to try to, you know, go and find, you know,

604
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:41,970
people in rural villages in Afghanistan and Pakistan and Nigeria, places that are war torn and very little government control.

605
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:48,320
You know, it's very expensive to get that last mile. So some of these things might have kind of interesting cost curves as well.

606
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,290
So your marginal cost indexation might be changing as well.

607
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:59,829
So a few kind of key things when you're thinking about the value of taxation is

608
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:05,020
that these indirect effects are harder for herd immunity are interesting here.

609
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:08,620
Vaccinating one person might protect more than one other person.

610
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,360
So there might be this kind of multiplier effects.

611
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:19,450
The benefits might be non-linear with respect to coverage, especially at high coverage levels, and you might also have non-linear costs here.

612
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:23,590
One of thing to this interesting thing, what is the value of eradication?

613
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:30,010
So I think, you know, smallpox has been eradicated. I will say that could be incredibly valuable.

614
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:33,840
You know, think about all the people. How many of you got your smallpox vaccine?

615
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:38,200
Hopefully none of you because you didn't have to, because it's been eradicated.

616
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:43,090
So it can be incredibly valuable to eradicate disease. You know, hopefully someday.

617
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:48,970
I mean, we've been saying for the last 30 years, oh, polio is almost, almost eradicated.

618
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:52,150
Just five more years, just five more years. Just five more years.

619
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:57,309
Just by four years. Just it we still haven't got there. But but we're people are optimistic.

620
01:02:57,310 --> 01:03:03,160
But that could be valuable then. You never have to do any use any of these polio eradication campaigns anymore, etc., etc.

621
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:08,750
So eradication could be really valuable if we can actually do it.

622
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:23,509
So a few projects that I'm involved in that are related to vaccine vaccines are hepatitis B vaccination, HPV vaccination, universal vaccine.

623
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:28,780
And we'll talk about a few other projects here. So hepatitis B, how many of you know what happens?

624
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:32,080
B, if you. That's good. That's good.

625
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:37,900
I didn't know much about this 15 years ago or so, but it's a viral liver infection.

626
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:41,560
It really affects a lot of people in China.

627
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:48,820
Between five and 10% of the population in China has chronic hepatitis B infection by it ends up causing liver failure,

628
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:55,120
cirrhosis, liver cancer, nasty things. But then there is a vaccine for it.

629
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:59,350
And it was introduced in the National Immunization Program in China in 2012.

630
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:09,530
Three made totally free in 2005. So we did analysis where we looked at the the value of catch up vaccination.

631
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:17,850
This is an analysis about ten years ago or 12 years ago where we looked at all those kids who didn't get vaccinated before the vaccine was made,

632
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:22,350
made free. Would it be valuable to give those kids the vaccine?

633
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:29,580
Maybe adolescents like this little girl here at China's CDC was contemplating a nationwide catch up vaccination program and they did a pilot study.

634
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:34,440
But we wanted to look at the cost effectiveness of this because, you know, there are many things you can spend your money on.

635
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:41,910
And so we found that expanded catch up vaccination would provide better health outcomes, which is kind of a no brainer, maybe.

636
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:47,280
But also we thought it would end up lowering overall cost that the actual long

637
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:51,360
term health benefits would more than pay for the cost of the vaccine itself.

638
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:58,590
So you'd think China would spend half a billion that's billion with a B dollars in vaccinating all these kids.

639
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:07,470
Mr. BIRD But we thought over the long term, China might save 1.5 billion almost in health care costs.

640
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:15,420
So the net impact would be to save a billion over the long term. So we shared this as my colleague shared with people in China,

641
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:23,670
and we're trying to health and this isn't the only thing that changed that change a minor or positive policy change.

642
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,370
But in April 2009, China did change its policy to provide free catch up vaccinations for children.

643
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:33,509
So these types of analysis, I think, can have an impact.

644
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:37,710
And policymakers are interested in understanding the cost effectiveness of interventions like this.

645
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:47,739
In the U.S. We've done some other analyzes here looking at vaccination of immigrants from high risk countries,

646
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:52,420
injecting drug users and individuals at higher risk of sexually transmitted infections.

647
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:57,070
It looks like these types of interventions, even in the US where prevalence is much, much lower than it is in China.

648
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:00,549
And risk of infection is lower. It still looks like it's cost effective.

649
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:03,610
And we worked directly with CDC to do these analyzes.

650
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:10,000
And in my experience, CDC is very interested in understanding the cost effectiveness of the policies they're going to recommend.

651
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:16,980
Just as an example. You know, CDC does have a lot of influence over vaccine policy.

652
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:21,550
There's the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

653
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:23,790
I've worked with them. If you project right now,

654
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:31,620
they make vaccine recommendations in the U.S. and one of the things they look at is cost effectiveness when they make their recommendation.

655
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:37,080
It's not the only thing, but it's important thing to do about it. And then there's the Vaccines for Children.

656
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:41,680
Grant basically provides free vaccines. And so forth.

657
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:46,810
And just as an example, just showing that CDC does care about this kind of thing,

658
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:50,890
when they were putting out a funding announcement two years ago, they said,

659
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:57,730
we're looking to obtain economic information or vaccines using economic and decision analysis and other appropriate methods,

660
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:01,600
and then looking at health outcomes, financial and economic changes.

661
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,250
So they're interested in basically what they're saying is they're interested in cost effectiveness.

662
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:09,220
They're interesting looking, of course, the health outcomes, but also the economic outcomes as well.

663
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:14,300
So CDC is definitely interested in understanding cost effectiveness.

664
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:20,240
Another little example is with HPV vaccination human papillomavirus.

665
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:25,030
So the how many of you know what the HPV vaccine is?

666
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,010
Most of you probably have had had a year at that age where you've probably been exposed to it.

667
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:36,230
But the interesting question is who should be vaccinated in what age groups?

668
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:40,010
And so here is this was a few years ago.

669
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:46,520
The 2018 19 is a survey looking at a two dose HPV vaccination coverage.

670
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:54,110
So these are the coverage levels in males, females at that time it's 13, 14, 15.

671
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:02,750
Now there's a healthy bill 2020 goal. So this is 2018. What do you think the healthy people 2020 goals?

672
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:16,159
There's like 20, 30%. Well, I think for 2020 goals like 80%.

673
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:21,770
So they're way, way below that and they weren't going to get that. So the question is then, you know, should they.

674
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:25,620
You know what? You know, what should we do to try to increase this?

675
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:29,510
And so we're looking at, well, what's the what's the what are the costs, health outcomes.

676
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:37,550
And you've got a cost effective way of increasing vaccination coverage up to 80% or maybe even above that healthy to 2020 goal.

677
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:43,670
So we built a mathematical model of, you know, transmission, but also disease.

678
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,639
And HPV is, as you probably know, you know, the main thing we talk about was cervical cancer,

679
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:53,390
which causes a ton of other cancers and other bad outcomes.

680
01:08:53,960 --> 01:09:00,680
And as you go from what was then kind of current like, let's say 28% coverage and go to 80% coverage,

681
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:04,190
and of course, you're reducing all these bad outcomes, which is a good thing.

682
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,330
So the green arrow, the arrow color green means good.

683
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:12,250
And there are things that would go down if we went from 28% to 80% coverage.

684
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:15,440
That's great. Of course, cost. It's a mixed bag here.

685
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:19,580
Cost of vaccination would, of course, increase because we're getting a vaccine.

686
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:24,620
Cost of screening a disease, though, because you could reduce cervical cancer screening and disease would drop.

687
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:30,890
That's a good thing. But the overall impact was it would add about $53 million in cost, we estimated.

688
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:36,140
So that's that's something undesirable, right? We don't like spending more money than we have to have to.

689
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:41,150
So we can plot this on on a graph here.

690
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:50,299
And I have a kind of a unique actually access here. These are the quality adjusted life years lost to HPV related disease over here on the left.

691
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:53,870
And we're losing more quality. That's bad over here on the right. We're losing all these.

692
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:58,280
But it's it's not as many from HPV disease. So this is better over here.

693
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:04,340
Now, this is the total cost of vaccination and HPV disease and the total net cost of the vertical axis.

694
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:11,299
So we can plot no vaccination. If we didn't do any vaccination, we'd be around here and 28% vaccination,

695
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:15,980
which was then kind of in 2018, then kind of status quo level of vaccination was right there.

696
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:26,090
And then we can kind of plot what if we went up to 40% vaccination or 50% or 60% or 70% or 80% or 90% or 100% vaccination?

697
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:33,229
What would that look like? And so there's a in my mind here, there's thing that's interesting here is that as of course,

698
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:38,210
as we increase vaccination levels, we're improving health. We're going to the to the right here.

699
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:45,340
But we're also increasing costs and the rate at which we're kind of change those two things is different.

700
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:49,280
So for calculating, for a request for information, we don't want to kind of calculate from here to here,

701
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:56,030
but we actually want to look at what is the the slope between conservative points here.

702
01:10:56,330 --> 01:11:01,309
So going from no vaccinations, 20% vaccination, that's really cost effective.

703
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:07,790
That's a good thing. And going from 90 to 100% vaccination still might be a good thing.

704
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:13,489
But you're paying more per policy gained because you've already covered a large

705
01:11:13,490 --> 01:11:16,370
fraction of the population and probably prevent a lot of transmission already.

706
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:26,670
So another way of looking at this is what is that incremental cost effectiveness of going from 0 to 20,

707
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:32,810
going to the next kind of percentage level of vaccination?

708
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:39,330
So we think, you know, vaccinating the 20% of the population, that's a good value for money.

709
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:51,540
It's only it's less than 20000 hours per point and going up to 70% actually when they go to 80% going to 80% vaccination coverage,

710
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:54,650
that's still probably good value for money, you know, 50, 60,000.

711
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:58,980
Yes. That would still be considered good value for money in the U.S. and even going

712
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:03,110
up to 100% coverage would probably still be considered good value for money,

713
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:09,060
less than 100,000. Our quality, which I would argue and a lot of people I think would agree with me, is still probably good value for money.

714
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:16,350
So we can look at the kind of marginal value of of increasing vaccination levels for them for a very long.

715
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:22,540
So that's kind of a healthy 2020 goal, which was the Soviet goodbye for many.

716
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:28,180
By the way, you know, unfortunately, I don't think we're still we're still not quite there.

717
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:35,020
I mean, again, the goal was about 80% coverage. And, you know, coverage was not so good even a couple of years ago.

718
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:40,450
So still some work to go there and still will probably be a really cost effective thing to do.

719
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:46,980
Another project I've worked on is looking at norovirus vaccination.

720
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:51,030
This is with some people here in the Department of Epidemiology.

721
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:58,710
And we evaluated the costs in particular well, the potential cost and health benefits of a norovirus vaccine.

722
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:04,020
And again, it's not just a technology, but it's a technology applied to a certain setting and population.

723
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:07,440
So here we are looking at daycare settings because daycare settings,

724
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:10,979
you got a lot of kids who are like puking and rubbing their hands over each other's faces and stuff like that,

725
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:17,280
which is great for transmitting norovirus. So we're looking at how effective would the vaccine have to be and at what cost

726
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:20,970
might it be considered cost effective to vaccinate kids who might be in daycare?

727
01:13:21,870 --> 01:13:25,740
So we're able to kind of build mathematical models of norovirus transmission.

728
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:34,200
And if the vaccine might be 50% effective at preventing disease and transmission or 80% effective,

729
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:43,110
we were able to calculate where we think the numbers of outpatient visits, E.T. visits, hospitalizations and deaths might be in this population.

730
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:47,639
The good news is this isn't very deadly, but the bad news is it has a lot of burden to it,

731
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:51,060
as you can see in terms of the numbers of hospitalizations and visits, all that kind of stuff.

732
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:56,970
So we can calculate health outcomes, we can calculate cost outcomes, economic outcomes as well.

733
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:03,540
So if we go and here at this table showing various levels of vaccine effectiveness of these first, this is no vaccination.

734
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:06,000
These next three rows are a 50% efficacious vaccine.

735
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:11,159
This is if we have an 80% efficacious vaccine because, by the way, we don't unfortunately don't have vaccine.

736
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:15,090
But there are some in the in the development pipeline and CDC wanted to be prepared for this.

737
01:14:15,630 --> 01:14:22,530
So if the vaccine let's say the vaccine was only 50% effective and it cost $500 per dose, well,

738
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:32,340
we estimated that you would be spending from $17,621 per quality adjusted life your game.

739
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:39,630
Just a reminder, is that a good value for money or not? Yeah.

740
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:45,870
We routinely spend 50,000, $100,000 for five years, 20 years or 16 or $17,000.

741
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:52,799
Probably not a bad value for money. So it was interesting here that a vaccine that might not be all that effective and might be

742
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:58,290
pretty expensive could still be considered cost effective again if applied in the right setting.

743
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:05,609
And this is a setting with high transmission. Work on some other projects.

744
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:10,290
I'm currently working on some proposed CDC evaluating another new vaccine that

745
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:14,220
is just kind of coming out of phase three study is looking for FDA approval,

746
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:24,330
and CDC's ACP is working to assess and make recommendations about who should get a look at the cost effectiveness of respiratory systems for vaccines,

747
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:27,690
especially in the elderly, but also in pediatric populations.

748
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:36,540
Look at hepatitis B interventions and so forth. So there are certainly a lot of organizations that help the services that are interested,

749
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:40,280
of course, in the health outcomes, but also the cost kind of economic as well.

750
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:50,030
So kind of big picture summary here. Cost effectiveness, we're measuring cost and benefits and then looking at trying to look at the value.

751
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:55,040
How much are we spending to get the health outcomes we want and trying to identify places where

752
01:15:55,040 --> 01:16:00,350
we can get more bang for our buck to improve health outcomes with this kind of low spending.

753
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:03,530
Modeling can be used to predict population wide health outcomes,

754
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:10,070
and that's cost effective in general is interesting because oftentimes it has non-linear and returns to scale.

755
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:16,970
I will say in general, vaccines are highly cost effective interventions that are worth investing in and spend money.

756
01:16:19,330 --> 01:16:25,320
So with that, I think we're running close to the end of time. But I wanted to say thank you and I'm open for questions.

757
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:35,330
Yeah. Yeah.

758
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:49,580
Um, so for the people with the illness also give like, are they part of the population that gets to decide with the cause?

759
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:56,480
I mean, different stuff like that, for example, where like all the other people outside.

760
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:01,790
Yeah. Yeah. So that's a great question. And typically it should be a kind of a combination.

761
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:11,120
So, um, typically that, so there's a lot of debate about this, but and clearly the people with the condition know the most about the condition.

762
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:16,520
Um, but the general consensus I've been seeing so far is the recommendation is to

763
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:20,720
survey the general population and get the general population's assessment of it,

764
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:25,999
but that that should be informed from the people who have the disease.

765
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,090
So people who have the disease should communicate, be able to communicate.

766
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:38,800
Here's what it's like living with X. And like, you're right, in the deaf community, they might say, I don't want you to turn my hearing on.

767
01:17:38,810 --> 01:17:44,660
I like being part of deaf community. And, and some people might say, hey, I'd prefer not to have here.

768
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:50,059
Yeah. Um, but I think for the most part I'm actually a lot of these conditions.

769
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:58,060
It is. You know, people would would say, hey, look, my climate is worse than it would be without this condition.

770
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:04,690
Yeah, but there are some interesting questions there about who should be making those those judgment calls.

771
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:13,000
And and actually, it might be different if you were, like, born deaf or you or you lost your hearing after having it.

772
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,830
You might have different preferences there as well.

773
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:25,780
And I guess the argument I've heard in for serving the general population is that if you're using general population funds to pay for this.

774
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:30,430
So if you're using, you know, Medicare or Medicaid or just might pull out, you know,

775
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:37,900
I pay for my private health insurance that I should be assessed on my preferences for those health states, you know?

776
01:18:38,110 --> 01:18:41,110
And so, yeah, someone who's deaf says, my life is great.

777
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:46,420
I think my point of life is perfect. You know, I still fear being deaf.

778
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:50,680
Maybe I should. We should assess. Quality of life is lower for that.

779
01:18:50,890 --> 01:18:56,620
So that incentivizes Blue Cross or Medicare to invest in interventions that prevent deafness.

780
01:18:57,810 --> 01:19:01,720
If that makes sense. Other questions?

781
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:17,160
That's a good question because that's the that's a that is a that's something that you show to a few of the minds about what comes into.

782
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:26,110
Calls could cost the taxpayer some sort of that in the U.S. So that's in U.S., yeah.

783
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:29,770
So that's compared to other. Yeah. So in the United Kingdom.

784
01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:35,020
So you're issue here in the U.S., we kind of occasionally use cost effectiveness explicitly.

785
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:45,250
Actually, very rarely is it explicitly. But in the United Kingdom, they so they have the National Health Service, which pays for health services.

786
01:19:45,730 --> 01:19:48,850
So they have to decide what are we going to pay for and what are we not going to pay for?

787
01:19:49,270 --> 01:20:00,280
And so in the UK, in the UK, they have a threshold of about £30,000 per caller, which is maybe about 40% is maybe 35, $40,000 for quality.

788
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:04,329
Just like yeah, I would say it's kind of on the low side.

789
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:05,709
I mean, they're explicit about using that,

790
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:11,740
but and maybe that's just to kind of try to lowball with pharmaceutical manufacturers who will say, please pay for our drug.

791
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:18,100
But the WTO once made a recommendation that says anything that costs less than

792
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:21,790
one times your GDP per capita should be considered highly cost effective.

793
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:29,420
And anything that costs less than three times GDP per capita. So what say the US Navy captain is roughly $50,000 three times GDP per capita.

794
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:31,950
That would be $130,000 per car, and that would.

795
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:38,320
Now they say that that should also be considered cost effective, not highly cost effective, but it should be considered cost effective.

796
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:45,230
So then you go to somewhere like China, which has maybe a lower GDP per capita, but you know,

797
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:51,220
one times GDP per capita would be considered cost effective and up to three times GDP per capita should be considered cost effective.

798
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:59,620
Yeah. So, you know, so you might have different thresholds in different countries which, which maybe makes sense because you say,

799
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:04,420
look, someone in Kenya, like the government of Kenya, doesn't have unlimited funds to spend on health.

800
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:08,440
So they need to have a lower threshold for what they'd be willing to pay for.

801
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:13,570
Um, but then it goes back also to question, you know, is that equitable?

802
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:19,359
And I would argue that, you know, organizations like the Gates Foundation often don't invest in global health because

803
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:23,560
simply because there are a lot of opportunities to massively increase health,

804
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:28,330
you know, you get more bang for your buck by investing in health in Kenya than you do in the United States, for example.

805
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:36,340
Any other questions? Just great.

806
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:39,970
Very well. Thanks for having me. It's been a pleasure. It's always fun to do this.

807
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:46,290
I'm happy to stay after. If anyone has individual questions, people will want to thank you to students.

808
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,300
Thank you very much.
