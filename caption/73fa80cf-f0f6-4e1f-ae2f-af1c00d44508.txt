1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,420
So would talk about of pollution control.

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:16,670
What other programs do I use in order to control these quote of pollution.

3
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:22,730
We talk about wastewater is really many deal with municipal waste.

4
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:31,580
But to open development you have kind of when you collect all these waste and then we start to to to to to clean it.

5
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,940
We started before we decided to have the receiving waterway.

6
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,320
So what the other program we're using in the Clean Water Act to try to control this.

7
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,430
I want you to remind you this one again, the. Remember this now.

8
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:54,480
Okay. We have these water quality standards based on the basic use of that word, physical waterboarding.

9
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:01,430
Whether it's for the source, for the drinking water, for recreational water use, or for the agriculture use, industrial use.

10
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,730
Okay. So. What are you to do?

11
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,400
Come with me. Right. And then if the meeting to work on this, then that's what we do.

12
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:17,440
Education. Okay, this is education.

13
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:23,140
If there is no middle one, quality standards that we have to implement.

14
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,430
We have this disconnect. 303 least.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,740
What do we need to do? Not develop the strategies for the total maximum getting out.

16
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,080
Okay. To the maximum D.N.A. and then we implement those values.

17
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:47,230
We'll talk about MVPDs programing today for ten days and then we will monitor again until

18
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,940
until the media work on estimate based on the delivery use to enable use of the law.

19
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,770
That's the important part. And that associate will work for extended.

20
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:06,160
This this diagram show you the major component of the Carnival Act.

21
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,410
Okay. We will also let you try to think about these, tell you the issues,

22
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,670
if you're really for that in this very well as use that as if they want to think about.

23
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:27,180
The thing about it is a good use of the water so that we have the water quality that and then we have this implementation.

24
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,060
How to do it. Okay. We talk about ways to go make them better notes.

25
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,170
This is the concept of the maximum D.N.A.

26
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,879
So this is this is not your father's water boarding.

27
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,690
Now you have this existing node, right? Existing nodes.

28
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,300
What do we need to do? Because that is the one constant that.

29
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,220
We need to reduce this is we have to reduce.

30
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:10,309
Okay, how much do we have to reduce? So here is the total maximum period of this is to the maximum that we have to

31
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,650
reduce from the existing load in order to achieve the one quoted standard.

32
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,720
So here is a two part of the to go back to the note.

33
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,159
One is from the lower allocation. These are from the numbers.

34
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,530
Also talk about an important source and then this is a waste notice from the point sources.

35
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,090
It's basically part of the West and the effects here.

36
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,710
We also have the margin of safety. We need to add to this margin of safety.

37
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:56,180
So so the load from the the numbers all is from point sources plus the the margin of 70 so that you have the room to manipulate.

38
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,659
So what you can see here, this is two to the maximum ten.

39
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:05,360
And no, these really reduce the load from the existing load.

40
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,590
Right. And this is kind of the budget now we have.

41
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:15,620
Okay, this is the budget we have now. So okay, now natural resources, this is how much you probably can load.

42
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:22,080
And then this from the point source. Is this how much again, note. You kind of budget is kind of buy.

43
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,200
So so what you can see here is a very little max.

44
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:33,030
And then the military is really kind of reductive to certain points now so that we can improve the water quality.

45
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,270
Villa. Right.

46
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:48,120
You have to reduce. And then this is the budget. I mean, this is kind of budget not assigned to visual sources and to the numbers of 2.0 sources.

47
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,290
So they can do they can do so is make and what's what you can do.

48
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,190
We talk about the footnotes of removal for some time. Is that why you attribute.

49
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:07,760
Because it is too high right now. Well, so they have to maintain they make sure that they can not exceed exceed their budget limits.

50
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:16,160
They are allowed to do that. So they added a third to president it to perfect it.

51
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,640
So this is to the maximum they're allowed to go to make some data load.

52
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,690
Basically you want to reduce further load. Reduce the loads into the receiving water.

53
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,360
Okay. That's close to the Amex intended. And then this is the budget we have to allocate to each source.

54
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,890
How much is the kind of budget we have? Okay. So how do we achieve this?

55
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,710
How to achieve the reduced reduction of the to the maximum getting them.

56
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,370
Okay. How do we achieve that? How we implement that. Right.

57
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,520
You develop that to go back to the those. Now.

58
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,060
How do you achieve that? Okay.

59
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,120
How do you achieve this? So this is in the in the in the Clean Water Act.

60
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:08,650
We have this system because the permitting system, national pollution information system.

61
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:18,730
Okay. That's which means that discharge is not a right is a privilege you have.

62
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,560
Okay. If you want to discuss. You need to get a permit.

63
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,980
How much to deduct? So you have to get a permit.

64
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:36,460
You want to be able to distance. Any word from Serge, from Pan?

65
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:45,520
You have to be treated with the best available treatment technology to treat you all to itself.

66
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,520
Okay. Even though one corner is great, the west wall, the wall is really great.

67
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,170
But you still need to learn how to use the best available.

68
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:08,380
So. But now let's say I use the best the best available technology, which is still the more.

69
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,550
Student work. So now, for example, here.

70
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:23,569
Now we know because the point A, point B and I already see you use this technology already, but I still cannot believe the world for this and that.

71
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,500
So you have to get a more remote and then you need to use additional technology.

72
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,220
For example, I need added ferric ferric iron.

73
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,030
You are the principally the more first of us to remove it. So they could research further reduce the distress.

74
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,180
Back to the graph there. So for the source, a source saying.

75
00:07:51,810 --> 00:08:01,610
Can it also be reduced from the 2.2 sources and or can only be reduced or in this case is this just this is here

76
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,900
is the point source identified several point of ways of what you have planned or you have also make a point.

77
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,880
So it's B is a careful, considered and moving operation.

78
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:20,159
You identify these police forces and then you the department around the quantity of them.

79
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,880
Okay, this is how much policy do you think you set? These are how much you can.

80
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,670
This is a budget we have every year.

81
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:37,759
The total number of first you can just tell us from your plan and then from the clipboard how much that if that will work.

82
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,959
And then you may need to reduce more of that time now. Instead, what can I do if you need additional technology, if we don't for precipitation,

83
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,320
at the very least, a bit more so that you can give such a list.

84
00:08:51,960 --> 00:09:09,580
Okay. So in a way, we talk about technology based basically as a commonly available economic sound technology, physical deployment.

85
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,530
Okay, let's use this requirement for the point for the two type of controls.

86
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:21,400
And if there's no work, then you need to work best because first you said, yeah, if this can I mean,

87
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:26,860
you have to use the best available technology to remove the waste before the discharge.

88
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:36,450
Okay. But if that's is still. Not good enough to maintain the water quality you have right now.

89
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,559
And then you need to use a water based technique.

90
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,420
Basically, control approach is really you need to use additional technologies for that.

91
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:52,940
Okay. Some new technology for this. Is most regional control basically is mosquito control.

92
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:04,310
And this that if you if you are working in a very nice area with the water quality is great.

93
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,830
So we have some capacity. Capacity, but you still cannot.

94
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,800
Contaminant pollutant. I mean, you can do tests, but you have the permit to do this.

95
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,610
They at least you have to use this available technology to choose your waste wastewater.

96
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:30,000
If you have the capacity to say, I can't see this, the pollution, I cannot just come here, you have to use.

97
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,910
Use the best available technology for them.

98
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:42,220
But if even you use that now your water quality is deteriorated, then you have an additional tremendous process.

99
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,920
Totem accidentally reduced further the discharge from this point sources.

100
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,350
Another two general approach control technology prevents to remove.

101
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:58,030
The other one is to. Through supervision.

102
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:05,200
So we developed this approach for them to go back to their know, how can you do this with pollution prevention?

103
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,810
If pollution prevention is more effective, more effective, think about more cost effective.

104
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,620
Think about anything you put into the dump, into the sewage.

105
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:20,770
Okay. The polluted. And it gets.

106
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:26,640
And then now you are all together with others. Now you want to remove them from the big amount of the water.

107
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:34,319
It's not easy. Okay? It's not easy. So 80 million gallons of water.

108
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,860
But you say you dump something to 80 million gallons with water.

109
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:44,370
But now you want to remove that. The why don't just say reduce the discharge from first place.

110
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,280
Reduce the pollution from first place use to less. Okay.

111
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:59,530
That's the principle of pollution prevention approach. There are some in the world have some evolution.

112
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,830
I will not go into the details of this and some evolution of the permits required

113
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:12,850
in terms of how they did that required in terms of the extent of the prudence.

114
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:18,070
So every time you have a revision and probably have some new items for the regulations.

115
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,140
So conventional prudence, really, the beauties was a beauty stand for what the beauty represents.

116
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,660
Indicates. Total organic, ocular organic materials.

117
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:38,130
So one of the major pollutants we want to remove is to the organic matter.

118
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:45,240
So that's you use the beauty to to indicate to the suspend your storage fecal coliform oil and agree

119
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:54,780
and agree that the conventional pollutants effects in the the the MPD system we have a permit.

120
00:12:54,830 --> 00:13:01,290
Is this something you have to control? Okay. And then we have also the property pollutants like six or five,

121
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:08,250
especially chemicals like PCBs, heavy metals, and then some noncommercial food nutrients.

122
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:16,270
That's added to the to this. They also some of this is a control approval control approach.

123
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:21,550
You can use the best of conventional pollution pollution control technology.

124
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:31,500
And some of them this course based conventional, prudent control technology and the best available technologies.

125
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,110
Some of the best available computer models.

126
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:46,530
So Nvidia's especially now this deal with one of the really deal with the municipal services so many the medical

127
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:54,240
this it's probably old walk to mental works rehab to receiving the sewage wastewater from the residual commercial.

128
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:02,730
Then you have to remove them before they just get some industrial they have to also first as a procurement program will talk about.

129
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,009
So what he gets see here the amputees program up to municipal services national procurement

130
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:14,820
program national procurement program is if you have these plans like we talk about the sewage,

131
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:24,190
the chemical plants when they're discharging to the sewage, which normally they don't discharge directly to the receiver,

132
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,840
always have to go through the municipal sewage and then they have a public procurement process.

133
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,780
Okay, so that's the beginning. Otherwise, they will upset.

134
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,950
Right up observe the the the with what you in the what's the treatment.

135
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,980
Basically you cannot do the work of the microwave and come up with the work.

136
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:50,760
The company still flew system and stonework throughout this ordeal with the potential intrusion from this.

137
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,810
We also have the minimum municipal sources and some industrial sources.

138
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,570
If that, then they have their own system. Sometimes they have old system.

139
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,240
For the search and the crisis in the nominees this complex.

140
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:15,770
And they also need to apply for the disapproval of into this.

141
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,980
The EPA again issues the reference and limitations.

142
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:27,960
So what happened is really some investors said, oh, this out of my ultimate because if they just touch the legal system, they need to pay for it.

143
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:38,939
Okay. So some of the president, they all if they discharge into the municipal system they are chemicals were really just to mess

144
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,950
up all the system in the west what you get so they cannot really get to the international system,

145
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,440
to the municipal system to have the authority. So they often need to give it to me.

146
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,050
Okay. They also need to give it to me.

147
00:15:54,530 --> 00:16:05,059
I walking in the walker with the the one of the automotive manufacturing plant is Indian plants vegetable waste water for example,

148
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:10,820
the metalworking fluids they use and what they use so they have a discharge.

149
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,860
Some of them so used to that they are almost like 1/2 mechanism they're using.

150
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:23,000
And if you said to you that you see that the tongue they have and then they come from over to get the work done,

151
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:29,390
but the system is not sufficient enough to remove the it. So what they do now the truck.

152
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:35,720
Every day they charge the wastewater to the municipal level, which includes the system.

153
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,290
So what they do, they need to check in to the Detroit Wastewater.

154
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:49,620
Okay. Because the West is not really directed to get to the houses and then before they can discharge, they pay for it.

155
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,950
But at the same time, there is impeachment. So if this is approved and the municipal world cannot handle it, they have a future.

156
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:01,040
So that's the problem we have. Can you explain a bit more about corruption?

157
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,500
Like, I'm still a bit confused why they're shocking to the.

158
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:11,210
So. So for them, they don't really link to the sewage system.

159
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:24,129
From your plan. Okay. So from the presser, they have to check the wastewater to the dumping sites in some sites in the in the sewage system.

160
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:31,130
They use the manhole dump into the manhole. Then they can't go to the municipal sewage system.

161
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:37,340
You can. This.

162
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,180
This is have different permits. You have individual permits adjusted.

163
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:46,580
And then you also have a general permits for General Mark office in Iowa.

164
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:54,200
When you get a permit as a general permit, all you individual permits like native,

165
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,320
tribal, for example, as a company, they may have the individual plans that just touch.

166
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:16,270
So apply for the permit is critical because then the Department of the Environmental Quality or the Eagle Forces, they can't they can know what to do.

167
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,540
So they have in some cases, like you said, if I don't apply me.

168
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,910
What can you do for me? Okay. All right. If I don't find a comedian.

169
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,460
Oh. If we do have of that, we know that.

170
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,460
You commit a criminal act. That's basically ten months because.

171
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,270
These guys, you've got your rights, the privileges you need, how the community says.

172
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:49,310
So if you have an operation and you say no, why are you hassle to apply for?

173
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:54,560
I do that. You have to get required by by the law in your act.

174
00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:00,040
You have to give a permit that you set. So what you have is committed to this as the.

175
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:10,810
The. The the. You go to department or some other correspondent department, they know how much you do.

176
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:16,250
Said you have. Right. We're just familiar with some of the information.

177
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,450
What's the total amount of this touch? You can find anything.

178
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:33,070
This is what I told Tucker about really the visual enrichment program, again, is industrial.

179
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:39,250
If we don't have your own wastewater treatment process, you want to use the municipal sewage system.

180
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,590
By reduce to reduce some chemicals, especially chemicals, into the air.

181
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,810
And then you cannot do that. You have a preacher.

182
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:55,450
A preacher. So what kind of manufacture you see is probably the most relevant.

183
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:05,870
Let's. Classic. Okay. I mean, you hear it in general, you know?

184
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,180
Yeah. Typical.

185
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:20,100
Which affected people. Okay.

186
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:25,050
I'm sure it's not sure how biopharmaceutical company manufacture.

187
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,040
But if they produce antibodies, for example.

188
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:36,800
The album I bought for them right there, produced enough and bought it.

189
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,870
My father and Maurice. They are in the media.

190
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,810
They use their final product they use.

191
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:54,140
So there is a lot of animosity into the system for sure, and value opportunity subsidy that people want in a way for the system.

192
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:07,600
Okay. So this kind of company may even need to pre-treat this system to remove these compounds that really upset upsetting the system.

193
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,960
Here is just one of the example here.

194
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:26,120
It's the Detroit Water Sutured Department. Yes.

195
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:31,700
Well, we have a capacity here in Aruba is a 180 minute.

196
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:37,740
Okay, 80 minutes where they have 1.3 billion down.

197
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:43,240
But they. Good. 1.3 billion.

198
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:53,079
So tremendous because this was four major steps, the same same way we have talked about primary, secondary, tertiary and the sludge disposal.

199
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,040
So these are critical components of the waste which to protect the overhead.

200
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,429
And then receiving water in a Detroit river, a different river.

201
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:05,810
They have offered because they produced at 1.3 billion gallons they.

202
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,780
And. So in.

203
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:23,090
I guess I have no question, because apparently the largest single facility in the US, it even surpassed the ones in, say, New York, in New York.

204
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,670
They have multiple different plans and multiple different plans instead of one single plan.

205
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,690
Okay. So that's that's I mean, like making that big city.

206
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,820
How come? Because sometimes they don't really transport to the one single place.

207
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:42,020
So. Yeah, totally. Just. Oh, really?

208
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,730
It just wasn't a single plan. Okay. But this is really a big one.

209
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:59,200
So they have this every image and then they have this for the combined sort of touch points and then the where where one operation wins.

210
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,150
They also have this procurement for a worm industrial procurement program.

211
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:13,460
The how the programs like that would they have. Okay. So what you can see here with our force, this was what you intend to have.

212
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,460
How many how many tanks and so forth?

213
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,690
Several they have. And then the discharge into the different locations in this.

214
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:31,640
I haven't been working with them. I mean, and to say but that's that's the system they have now.

215
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:46,459
It's just a huge, huge. Okay.

216
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,810
Let's take a quick break to talk about animal feed operations.

217
00:24:00,840 --> 00:28:03,810
Right. It's.

218
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:13,730
Careful as we talk about the kettles was a program we use for that.

219
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:19,940
The animal feeding operations. Its huge amount of animal feeding operation in the United States.

220
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:33,080
200 more than 250,000 animal feed operation in this is this is rough estimate number but only like about 15,000.

221
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:40,190
£50,500 confine to confine all constitute annual feeding operations.

222
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:51,230
So when we talk about the permits and permit you facts, only the chemicals required to apply for the permits.

223
00:28:53,610 --> 00:29:01,260
Not all animal feeding operation need to apply for permit only the small the big concentrated animal feeding operations.

224
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:10,020
They need to apply for me. So if you're desert desert as a kid, then you to try for the permit.

225
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:18,720
You can think about all the waste that produces the for the right from the from the fecal materials we have or game matters passages they have.

226
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:24,870
And also the smells either in the buildings or this, they could contaminate our environment more.

227
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:28,560
The water many the passages all came out its nutrients.

228
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,350
That's a minute stuff they use to do.

229
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,230
So what do we need to do here? Animal feed operations.

230
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:46,290
We have this fulsome admission discharge account is also standard for the cables.

231
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:51,360
Only the careful need to apply for the permit. Okay.

232
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:59,460
Either permit if it's annual fee operation constitute annual fee to operations nor all animal feed operation need to apply for permit.

233
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:07,930
That career or animal feed operation only didn't make it as a country to anamorphic operations.

234
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:15,190
So basically, we just we regret about 60% of the discharge from an Moffitt operation.

235
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:23,920
Okay. For the Moffitt operations as the the annual for the operation either in the in the in the agriculture sector,

236
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:29,350
agriculture, as you said, the discharge most of the time is non-point source of the past.

237
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:38,020
The point of the animal operations now in the United States, about 60% are regulated, but they are small, is very difficult to regulate.

238
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:46,410
We also have the stormwater discharge. Stormwater is interesting.

239
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,720
Topic here in terms of what what management or quality management because

240
00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:00,010
someone that you can consider other persons also currently is not possessive.

241
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:08,670
Okay. The point source is yes, and you can have the permit. The city has to have a permit to discharge you.

242
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:17,100
You see the the area where you see the stormwater are holes that because this is defined source you can identify.

243
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:21,450
That's point sources. Okay. But they also have the role of the diffuser.

244
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,140
That's one person can already do much about. Okay. So that's not I.

245
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,720
That's a number of different ways to control that.

246
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,910
But point sources you have help me. So, for example, see the above.

247
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:44,550
But you have a permit for discharge of your for your your stormwater outfall when they give you the water boarding to receive a water boarding.

248
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,930
Yes. There's a water runoffs, effects.

249
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:58,890
It's one of the major reasons for the incoming of the water here in the United States.

250
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,610
So we need now to have this for once.

251
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,990
Somehow we have to have structural approach. Somehow we have to have the educational approach.

252
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:13,830
For example, the coverage you get because charge activities, industrial activities, reduce the cost of a sewer system.

253
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:20,100
So here is just the fence and this is and construction that we can see.

254
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,280
There's a fence. This is for the water quality management.

255
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,380
Okay. If I was stone water because. Because jokes aside, otherwise, all these sediments will get into the.

256
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:36,710
Did you see the rivers? Lakes. That's part of this Clean Water Act.

257
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:41,640
As a matter of fact. The municipal sewer system again.

258
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:47,860
We have this municipal this basically, if you look at this municipal sewer system.

259
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:52,900
Basically, this is the stormwater the stonework system.

260
00:32:53,170 --> 00:33:00,670
And this is this one is a municipal sewage system. So some new places, we have a separate sewer system.

261
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:10,450
We have these separate stormwater system. You have the municipal sewage system and then the stormwater sources.

262
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:13,990
And it is our forces directed discharge for the center with the whole system.

263
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:21,220
You have to get treated to do. How do we manage best management practices?

264
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:30,040
Because this is stormwater management. You have to permit. You have to do the system management practices in order to maintain the water quality.

265
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:34,420
So in the cities, have the been to the lost campers yet?

266
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:39,130
The lost temples you see in the square, that whole area where they don't.

267
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:45,800
Doo doo doo doo before. It's like flat. Companies.

268
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:54,000
Now, the gorge snake routes, the small stream runs through that.

269
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:59,690
That's part of this best management practices for someone.

270
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,280
If you go to the also the west and to the west or west there.

271
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:10,290
Now, some places they build these like the small wetlands.

272
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:20,560
That's the stone wall system. It's called best war management practice, if you will, to reduce the discharge from the sewage outfalls.

273
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:29,120
Okay. Sometimes the process is the the construction, but also education.

274
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:37,340
Okay. Education. This is again, you have to have the permits for this test because this is you have the permit for this somewhat.

275
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:43,850
Okay. Again, the you have the public education involvement.

276
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:52,940
We also have this. It is it's just such an innovation because touch post, congestion, pollution, pervasive illicit discharge detection and emission.

277
00:34:53,210 --> 00:35:02,450
This is some places they the justice such system such like for example you have the cow washing this facility.

278
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,430
Though there was a lot of waste the right. Somehow they do.

279
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:16,580
I mean, they connect them to the to the message system. And they basically they just touch directly into someone right into the Air Force.

280
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,210
So what do you do? You identify some of these connections.

281
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:25,280
You need to take them to the municipal sewage system because they have to be treated before they can go.

282
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,450
Okay. But there's some places they may, in a small presence, eminent, don't do that.

283
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:39,020
So what they do is they hold properties that do it. And that the mockery is one of the typical example from that process.

284
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:51,450
Because storm water. So in the in the in the in the city, we have some of them.

285
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:56,190
We have these combined sources, something called the separatism.

286
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:05,070
The here you can see here we have this combined sewer system, basically municipal sewage systems, sewage it get into.

287
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:10,050
The same pipes and then they go to wastewater treatment plant.

288
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:18,810
But if you have this way with a lot of heavy rain and then they combine it with just go to really direct it.

289
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:22,500
So before, I mean, if has dry away, the flow is no.

290
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,450
And then all these get treated. But it is high.

291
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:30,410
You will be discharged directly to the cause of Air Force.

292
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,149
If have a separate exhaust system, you have a separate and then is connected with what?

293
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:38,570
Unit and all the way to the western front. If we have a storm, the Air Force.

294
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:44,690
So this defense approach we can see. But now it was new constructions.

295
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:50,300
You cannot go this system anymore. But we cannot read this system if you have this kind of system.

296
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:54,710
Life with all cities. For example, with Truman, with us.

297
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:01,520
We have running out of issues with our receiving water boarding because we have more frequent rainfall.

298
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,200
You have more frequent storms and then you have more frequent overflows.

299
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:18,390
Okay. Instead of receiving one body. And that's the reason some place is the water quality has issues and because this is the combined source system.

300
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:28,560
This community's overcome by resources, mostly in the Midwest here in the eastern part of the east passes here and now.

301
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:34,710
So it's walls, it's new buildings, new developments.

302
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,000
Basically,

303
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:44,550
you have the of the separatists or the separatists from surely is better than just the the the combined sources of like some city of Detroit.

304
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,750
You have both systems in place. Okay. So I mean, new development.

305
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:53,040
They have a separate resource system. But for these old areas, they may have the combined source system.

306
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:03,310
So here is, for example, here in the combined sewer system and the discharge.

307
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:15,240
Energy just here in terms of the volume. Treated wastewater is billion gallons, but we have several overflows.

308
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:21,250
This is how much? The discharge from the discharge.

309
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:30,350
So what can we do? We need to have a storage facility, sometimes a collection system, a control, and the maintenance treatment technology.

310
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,890
What are we also can do for Westword pleading for Westword playlist?

311
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,070
So what do Westword bodies stand for? Is that where you have the heavy flow of heavy rains?

312
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,610
They come back to us for treatment. We have a storage facility there.

313
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,820
If you put the adolescent inside a new facility.

314
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:56,560
But that is beyond their capacity. Okay.

315
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:06,550
If you think about it, how we could address some costs, that part of the bill very much in that short term time.

316
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:12,130
So I will facilitate. I can already start all this was one.

317
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:18,020
So what they did was they do in order to.

318
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:28,430
Motivated by the rules. You want to maintain our water quality and they may be able to discharge, they may be able to discharge.

319
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:33,200
But what they do, they will have some blending system here.

320
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,740
So you have the heavy rain. You have the heavy rain.

321
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:44,760
I really beyond the capacity of our treatment process right now, you still need to run them through the primary qualifications.

322
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:51,940
But then you have this. Rating system, how revenge cannot really go through the Secretary Truman.

323
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,840
Plus, we're just beyond the capacity so that they have the side flow.

324
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,710
The art of dumping lot of chlorine disinfection before the discharge.

325
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:12,030
So basically this step, because this step is a bottleneck step here, processing the process.

326
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:18,809
Is anybody on stage? So what I do again, elder warrior.

327
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:27,010
And then we added secretary and then discharged. That's one of the operations that we have, the stormwater monitoring.

328
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:42,880
That's what we do for for this purpose. So with our relief, basically we just needed a flow and then we had a disinfection bypass process.

329
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:46,660
Okay, bypass the second process and then we just kept it.

330
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:53,770
So that way we could we could reduce the contamination patterns into the water boarding.

331
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:58,330
And then you still have an organic method. How about all gang members?

332
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:02,170
Because, again, mafia, basically the body level is pretty low.

333
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:10,240
Right. So with all the the for all this come off the street where it's really poor, you know.

334
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,770
So that kind of poisonous pollution control.

335
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:25,730
I mean, we do a pretty good job in this area. Pretty good job in this area.

336
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,320
And and that helps a lot.

337
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:39,640
In fact, into the reduced pollution and the effect. I thought you said the Clean Water Act was established in 1970s EPA steps.

338
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:47,950
We see a gradual improvement, take about ten years to see a really tremendous, tremendous improvement of the world for the United States.

339
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:53,830
So our social Guatemala rivers, lakes, I mean, so far are relatively good condition.

340
00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:03,040
But we see here, if we do the valley with check, it's still about 40% of the river.

341
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:12,369
The lakes are kind of under the 70. Based on the data, it is used as a well for an extended scale.

342
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:17,230
But the problem we have and now the other issue we have.

343
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,980
We talk about this what's what you facility what available.

344
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:27,130
The drinking water also was for the facility. What do we need?

345
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:35,410
What do we have here? Sewage system pipes.

346
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:42,630
Right. All this painting. Painting pipes. We also have this wastewater treatment plant.

347
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:49,600
Was what you planned. So we are most of them, in fact.

348
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,900
But how this. 100 years ago.

349
00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:03,230
Well as. So now the issue that right now is really this aging infrastructure.

350
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,550
You have all the maintenance systems are beginning to work. We have to have a good.

351
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:12,340
Functional infrastructure to do this. To take the waste water.

352
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:17,200
Kansas Tribune, 57.

353
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:25,170
Before you set. So what are the ten you are facing in the in the country now?

354
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:32,640
It's really. In a condition that can see the.

355
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:41,410
My good conditions. Good luck. Good conditions. So here you can see for the west wide infrastructure.

356
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:49,250
Only 60% of the pipes estimate to be ready in high or excellent or good conditions.

357
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:58,900
Right. So you need to replace it to fix up some wastewater treatment plant effect.

358
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:07,480
And this in the drinking water is the same thing. I mean, like they have to spend every year.

359
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,930
That's how much you have spent.

360
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:22,129
Projection of increase in biological oxygen demand in the west, water in the water here, and which also indicates to me that more people must use.

361
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:25,320
So you need to get better treatment in order to do it.

362
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:38,340
To meet this goal. New creations, treatments, combines, or repression of flows control system.

363
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:50,700
This is how much? Estimates include the need. Say how much the infrastructure required by the EPA to require by the Congress.

364
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:54,720
That you could do estimation. What's the president with the least?

365
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:02,790
So this is a system they tried to do to to to do the analysis move that into the needs of the country.

366
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:09,120
Here is the procedure by the pipe classification. Excellent conditions.

367
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:16,079
Excellent conditions in the 2020. Excellent conditions also on one.

368
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:23,130
Once there is quote, because of the effort, excellent conditions, but then all the others.

369
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:29,530
Now it's up to 60%. About 50% or 60%.

370
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,690
Consider not ideal conditions. Poor conditions for conditions.

371
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:39,060
Very poor conditions. A lapsed condition.

372
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:50,049
Okay. So that's where we have a system. We have to think about the needs of the embodied.

373
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:55,870
Just pass the beer what they call how much they invest in the infrastructure.

374
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,360
Supposed to invest in the infrastructure.

375
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,410
$1 trillion. How many years?

376
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:22,080
Ten years, I believe that's that's all they have. And this is just the need for the for the one sector infrastructure to go about 2 minutes.

377
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:30,059
But the infrastructure to do this is estimates what's it cost the needs, you know,

378
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:36,210
how to maintain the clean water and the drinking water in the billions of dollars.

379
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:42,000
Okay. In the billions of dollars. The gaps to the 20 years, the gap is basically.

380
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,390
Nowadays with numbers probably on the estimates.

381
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:53,010
It's not enough with the increase of the price inflation.

382
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:59,010
Surely this is not enough? Not. Look at these numbers.

383
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:03,089
I mean, this is at that time, this is estimated back in 2000 to now.

384
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:06,260
It's only 20 years after. But we're still in the peak.

385
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,740
I mean, we lack of the investments in this area. Okay.

386
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:16,770
Think about it. Think about is how much really gets the big investment in this area.

387
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:24,180
Since 2002. I mean, I don't know where you are born, but I'm not really familiar with his history.

388
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:28,410
I, I, I joined the I came to the Unites States in 2001.

389
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:33,100
Right after that. He's 20 years.

390
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:40,630
We don't really see a lot of talking about this infrastructure investment.

391
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:48,590
Okay. Only the President Biden, now that the current administration said we need to do this, we need to replace our.

392
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:58,610
Bridge Road are this right? But most critical part in terms of our life, in terms of our regional water quality health.

393
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,920
This sector. Can you want to add a few if you want?

394
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,490
As you can see, all we have. Then you missed it.

395
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:18,470
So surely this is all management. So just based on the fleece, by the fleece for the event,

396
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:25,840
you won't be involved because all the training for clients but won't be in that won't one minute.

397
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:31,150
So how do you make this in the United States? Okay.

398
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:44,530
So. The big state is state of Michigan, passed a law now a couple years ago because for me,

399
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:53,020
what's crazy now is with the 25 years, all the city, all the carriages, they have to replace the little.

400
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:59,610
Within 25 years. Okay. Within 4 to 5 years required by law.

401
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:06,910
So now we come to the detail of who paid for. Who paid for it.

402
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:13,800
So could you compare which portion of that is indicating against that?

403
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:18,000
But I mean, this is a good law. That's good. Yes, you should be precise.

404
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:25,500
But you should come out with the resources for that. Mean open sourced funds for the request of these types.

405
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:31,620
The reason very critical is really and I've mentioned these three infrastructure,

406
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:39,720
really serious criminal civilization to improve our life tremendously, life expectancy, the environment tremendously.

407
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:44,670
If we don't do this or enjoy this, what can they do with our life?

408
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,200
We have not how much money we spend all this long.

409
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:54,000
That's not medicine stuff. West West on the money for the massive stuff.

410
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,020
So, Becka, more against the budget for the military.

411
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:05,050
Okay. But if you think about how much we spent.

412
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:14,340
Last year I saw the is almost close to 88,000 spinning dollars.

413
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:19,620
But it just for me, it is thousand being dollars for the museum.

414
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:23,910
And then the other part, to be honest, that is how.

415
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:28,900
So the Missouri spending is 50% of all the spending here.

416
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:34,200
And this is what we need. Is this what we need?

417
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:44,110
Because this is what we need. I mean, don't get me wrong, I don't think I mean, I don't really know a lot about the economy.

418
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:49,610
Yes, it's important. But if you think how much faith, then what do we need to give?

419
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,500
Okay. Our education system needs infrastructure need.

420
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,290
The crazy thing about that, too,

421
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:05,140
is that they have to if the military has to spend the money that they get for their funding to be renewed for the next year,

422
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:10,580
it's like if we just diverted the extra slack that like throwing money at like airshows

423
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:17,330
like military flyovers that are football games and I know a good chunk of the military,

424
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:23,190
but a not of the new money that was out in the budget was like $14 billion for this year

425
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:28,460
is going towards the Navy jet fuel in Hawaii that like cut into their water system.

426
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:33,120
I don't know how they invest that, but apparently so.

427
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,850
So, you know, I mean, this the cost base where the money goes.

428
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:47,560
Think about $8,000 million. Okay. I mean, I think we would use a picture of all the veterans that's showing it as more than happy to all this work.

429
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,390
But if you think about the vets and how they feel better sometime, it's really romantic.

430
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:54,740
Right. But. But for one, pick a place.

431
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:03,860
You are going to have a UFO. You know how much they paid for the one paper plates we eat for four for the meat.

432
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:17,880
Anyone who the idea was, of course, of that. We could guess get $52 or $52 to play while you come out with $52.

433
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:21,710
Christopher in my head. Okay, great. Good. Let's hope you're right.

434
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:29,680
Oh, yeah. That was the right. To pick a place for them forward for the year in the war.

435
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:33,550
That's 53, $35 per plate.

436
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:41,530
Have you seen the criticism on this? They have the coffee mug. This thousand dollars for coffee mug.

437
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,550
Okay. Who get the money? Who get the money.

438
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:52,380
Think about it. Who get that money? The contractors. The contractors.

439
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:53,930
We'll get you. The contractors.

440
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:04,570
Whoever gets the contract, wherever they to use the contract, think, how can you give your contract when you come under the contract?

441
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:08,850
Okay. Some groups this interest groups, they do the contracts.

442
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:14,970
Okay. So that's how this resources money is spent.

443
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:19,680
But this is where we meet with deputies here in this country.

444
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:25,710
To our infrastructure. We don't have the government too much.

445
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:30,450
A few things about. Countrywide? Yes.

446
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,660
We need a revenue subsidy for three years.

447
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:43,060
1%, 10% to 15% for infrastructure improvements will be more than sufficient.

448
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:56,110
Okay. One thing that's that's wrong would be that every time I vote, I want people who really supposed to give the infrastructure for this.

449
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:03,450
Well talking, let's say. What can you do with this Congress?

450
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:08,000
I mean, this is it now, you know, I mean, I'm just sometimes reach out the information.

451
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,410
I think what would have to think about these people today?

452
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:19,620
Because they see infrastructure in this country.

453
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:25,320
Right. If we want to maintain our life standard. Life expectancy and what we need.

454
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:29,360
We still have a lot of precedent of acceptance of this.

455
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,210
And this is just an agreement, a reasonable.

456
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:40,670
Um, yeah. I mean, you know, there's another religion issue is a very nice education system.

457
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:47,570
Access to how much the teacher paid in this country is funded in the wealthy.

458
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:54,200
If you go to high school, I mean, how much you pay with them.

459
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:04,010
So and and where the money goes. I mean, you spend the money on this trip that you get so that we can make us strong.

460
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:13,940
It's not just to go fight in a war making this job very sure it looks like a muscle but but really you to get your self employed,

461
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:18,080
your own infrastructure here you visit here and then.

462
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:27,430
You can have a for. Yeah.

463
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,350
Sometimes I don't talk to the press when all this I get just why we don't do this.

464
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:39,100
Okay. I'll see you Wednesday. I took up a number of questions.

465
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:44,239
Homework due on Wednesday? Yeah. Do we do anything about that or is it.

466
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,890
Suppose you take the quiz. There's a quiz there.

467
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:55,890
And then after you take the quiz, I can I can correct them and then I'll put the answer to that question.

468
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:01,630
Then we. No. When we start a quiz.

469
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:06,200
Do we finish? We have to finish doing the setting. I don't think so.

470
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:09,520
I mean, with this homework, we don't miss, you know, the events.

471
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:15,870
Yes, our homework. We don't. You.
