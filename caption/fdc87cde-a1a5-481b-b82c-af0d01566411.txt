1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,240
Hi, everyone. It is your GSI Jessica here.

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,860
And today we are going to talk about public health emergency preparedness.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:18,159
So the learning goals for this session are to understand some of the successes and challenges

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,230
and improving public health emergency preparedness in the U.S. over the past 20 years.

5
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:28,720
And to think critically about how this connects to the U.S. response to recent public health emergencies,

6
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:34,000
including the COVID 19 pandemic and the Flint water crisis.

7
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:43,690
And we're going to kind of talk about the history of emergency preparedness with an emphasis on the steps that the U.S. has taken since September 11,

8
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:48,220
2001, and to improve public health emergency preparedness.

9
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,170
So what is a role? A public health emergency preparedness?

10
00:00:53,860 --> 00:01:00,310
Public health systems play an integral role in preparing communities to respond to and recover from threats and emergencies.

11
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:07,059
The public health consequences of disasters and emergencies obviously initially affects local jurisdictions,

12
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:14,630
and during the initial response, the people and communities that are impacted must rely on local community resources.

13
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:24,940
And as a result, all state, local, tribal and territorial emergency response stakeholders have to be prepared to coordinate and collaborate

14
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:32,170
with partners across all different types of sectors and organizations at all governmental levels as well.

15
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:47,319
When emergencies occur, and that's regardless of the type scale or severity of the emergency and obviously when infectious disease outbreaks occur,

16
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,290
public health agencies are expected to take the lead.

17
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:58,990
But public health agencies also have to be prepared to coordinate with a diverse array of partners and stakeholders,

18
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:06,320
including other government agencies, when other technological, human cause or natural disasters occur.

19
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:14,470
So it's not like public health agencies are only involved when there's an infectious disease outbreak, such as, you know, the COVID 19 pandemic.

20
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:24,069
And so how do we as a country respond to public health emergencies after the attacks of 2001?

21
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:29,350
So that includes the 911 terrorist attacks, as well as the anthrax attacks.

22
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:37,310
The U.S. came to see that it needed to improve coordination across the various entities responsible for responding to events.

23
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,990
So across federal, state and local jurisdictions.

24
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,950
And this is where the national response framework comes in.

25
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,570
So this is a guide to how the nation responds to all types of disasters and emergencies.

26
00:02:51,930 --> 00:03:00,149
It allocates responsibilities across jurisdictions, so at the federal, state and local level and then also across entities.

27
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:06,330
So, you know, for example, the CDC, FEMA, emergency medicine, etc.

28
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:17,790
And so the national response framework kind of allocates responsibilities for how a coordinated response to a national emergency should go.

29
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:26,820
And this includes pandemics. So at the CDC, much of the responsibility for this is located in the Center for Preparedness and Response.

30
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,730
And so just a little bit more about the national response framework.

31
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:41,819
It's structured to help jurisdictions, citizens, non-governmental organizations and businesses to develop whole community plans,

32
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:49,559
integrate continuity plans, build capabilities to respond to failures among businesses,

33
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,070
supply chains and infrastructure sectors which you know, often occur during disasters,

34
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,140
and also to collaborate to stabilize community lifelines and restore services.

35
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:16,250
So in 2002, the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act was passed,

36
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:25,850
which appropriated $1 billion to supporting state and local emergency preparedness and response to address threats from bioterrorism.

37
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,650
And this was seen as a significant step beyond what was previously in place.

38
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,930
So then in 2006,

39
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:44,820
the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act expanded the purview of this this funding to also address emerging and reemerging infectious diseases.

40
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,320
And so this act and then as well as a reauthorization of this act,

41
00:04:51,650 --> 00:05:02,120
support a program run by the CDC called the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agreement, or also known as p, h e p or p help.

42
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:12,440
And so we're going to focus on how the P HEP program connects the federal and state, tribal, local and territorial health departments.

43
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:19,250
So back to this pyramid that Dr. Cleary had previously introduced in class.

44
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:28,250
We are going to focus on P hep as it connects federal agencies seen at the top to subtleties.

45
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:35,030
And this is kind of one framework in which to think of how federal agencies interact with state,

46
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:41,300
tribal and local and territorial health departments in the context of emergency preparedness.

47
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:53,139
So P hep is a critical source of funding for state, local and territorial public health departments to advance public health and to prevent,

48
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,800
protect, respond and rapidly recover from health emergencies.

49
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:05,170
And those emergencies might be chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear and might involve explosives,

50
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:10,180
all sorts of things that threaten to overwhelm routine business and health security.

51
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,809
PEP is credited with contributing to the progress that these state,

52
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:25,660
local and territorial health departments have made since 2001 and provides guidance and technical assistance for the state,

53
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:31,090
tribal, local and territorial health departments so that they are prepared to face emergencies.

54
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:44,800
There are 62 P Hep Cooperative Agreement recipients and that includes all 50 states and then additionally four major metropolitan areas Chicago,

55
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:53,410
L.A., New York and Washington, D.C., eight U.S. territories and free and freely associated states.

56
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:05,740
So if we have time in class on Monday or on Tuesday after our speaker, we're going to kind of explore this page,

57
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:15,730
which is a Web page on the CDC, where you can read about different examples of how our P has responded to different types of emergencies.

58
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:24,340
But this example here, you can see that P help helps Atlanta prepare for super for the Super Bowl.

59
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:33,999
So this you know, you wouldn't necessarily think of the Super Bowl as a, you know, disaster with public health implications.

60
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,510
But, you know, there we have to be prepared in the event that something were to occur.

61
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,719
So, for instance, in this article,

62
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:51,490
it said that they conducted trainings monitor for potential disease outbreaks and prepared to respond to any potential terrorist events.

63
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,510
So how exactly does P help? Help?

64
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:05,340
They focus on key domains of public health preparedness capabilities so they help

65
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,470
health departments and other local entities be prepared to respond to emergencies.

66
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,240
So the six domains are biosurveillance, community resilience,

67
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,610
countermeasures and mitigation incident management, information management and surge management.

68
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,150
And then there's a bunch of capabilities within those different domains.

69
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:34,080
So really, you can see that that P. P have really does a lot to help health departments be prepared to respond to emergencies.

70
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:43,049
So I wanted to go into kind of a little bit of a case study about the Flint water crisis.

71
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:47,510
So I'm sure you all have heard about this hopefully.

72
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,360
And, you know, this obviously occurred just up the road from us.

73
00:08:53,370 --> 00:09:03,930
So while there are systems in place to prevent and rapidly respond to public health emergencies, these these systems aren't always followed.

74
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:13,410
And in the case of the Flint water crisis, complaints from citizens of Flint were repeatedly ignored by public health and other government officials.

75
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:29,310
I included two different reports here, and I can I can put the citations in canvas so that you can access them if you're interested.

76
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:38,390
But these these were two reports that laid out exactly kind of what happened in a step by step way in the Flint water crisis.

77
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:45,510
And so just to kind of really boil it down and sum it up, there is obviously way more that went into this.

78
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:53,010
But essentially, Flint residents had been reporting heavily discolored and bad tasting water for well over a year.

79
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,750
A corrosion plan was not in place in Flint, as it should have been.

80
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:05,970
And Flint residents were exposed to unsafe water, including unsafe lead levels, which led to cases of lead toxicity.

81
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:15,000
And so eventually help was involved by providing blood lead level testing, providing mental health counseling and a crisis hotline.

82
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:31,600
But this is an example of when systems are not followed, and this situation highlights environmental justice or I should say, environmental injustice.

83
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:38,189
So environmental justice requires that all people in communities receive the equal protection of environmental

84
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:44,370
and public health laws and should have an equal and meaningful voice in decisions related to their environment.

85
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:51,870
And the people of Flint did not enjoy the equal protection of environmental or public health laws,

86
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,580
nor did they have a meaningful voice in the decisions leading up to the Flint water crisis.

87
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,830
And many would argue that they had no voice in this scenario.

88
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:11,040
So as the Governor's Flint Water Advisory Task Force found, the Flint water crisis is an example of environmental injustice.

89
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:19,200
And sadly and horrifically, a similar situation is unfolding right now in Jackson, Mississippi.

90
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:26,220
And so we can see that again, there are systems in place and these systems are not always followed.

91
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:33,509
So I just you know, there's a lot of good work that goes into public health emergency preparedness.

92
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:46,170
But I really wanted to highlight some of the more the failures of public health systems and emergency preparedness.

93
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:57,950
So okay. So aside from from what we've talked about so far, how are we actually doing in terms of public health, emergency preparedness?

94
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,780
And have we improved since 911 and since 2001?

95
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:13,760
So there was a nice study conducted by Murthy and colleagues published in 2017 in the American Journal of Public Health,

96
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:21,830
and it evaluated the progress that the U.S. has made in emergency preparedness from 2001 to 2016.

97
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,520
And there definitely are some positive aspects.

98
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:32,390
But this report includes several warnings that we need to be aware of moving forward.

99
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:40,100
And health departments were evaluated before 911 and then at some point after 911, they were evaluated again.

100
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:47,720
And I think it's important to note that before 911, most state, tribal,

101
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:55,850
local and territorial public health departments reported limited preparedness capabilities, which is very scary, obviously.

102
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:04,729
So within this article, they kind of created a timeline of on the left,

103
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:11,180
you can see a list of different emergencies that had public health implications.

104
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:19,160
And then on the right, you can see legislation that has passed, you know, kind of along that same timeline.

105
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:25,100
So if we look at this timeline for the first two decades of the 21st century, you might notice a pattern.

106
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:35,989
So an event such as 911 or SaaS, you know, the original SaaS or avian flu or Hurricane Sandy happens.

107
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:42,980
And then we see an act of Congress to fund programs to build more resilience and public health preparedness.

108
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,530
And unfortunately, this is kind of how it has gone here in the U.S. You know,

109
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:53,030
funding for public health preparedness tends to come after the fact as a reaction

110
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,530
rather than as a steady investment to build a more resilient set of capabilities.

111
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:02,749
But the good news is that we did make those investments over the past two decades,

112
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:07,070
and the results are important to notice and the accomplishments are significant.

113
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:14,040
That doesn't mean that it's perfect. Obviously, I think we can all look at examples from the pandemic and, you know,

114
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:19,760
from a lot of different situations and see that it's you know, it's not perfect, but progress has been made.

115
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:27,110
So progress in public health preparedness from 2001 to 2016.

116
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:33,379
This is a another table from that same article and I won't go into all the details.

117
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:40,460
But essentially between 2001 and 2016, across a number of key indicators of preparedness,

118
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:48,200
almost all of the 62 jurisdictions report that they had indeed developed the capability in full.

119
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,970
And this includes NGS, like being able to share epidemiological data electronically,

120
00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:00,110
having sufficient laboratory testing capacity, having conducted a risk assessment or hazard vulnerability assessment.

121
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:07,190
And so this finding and these efforts really do show a public health system that has made strides in a relatively brief period of time.

122
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,390
But of course, there are ongoing challenges.

123
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,100
So this is from that same article again.

124
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:23,689
So some of the challenges that have been cited are widespread concern among public health professionals on the

125
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:30,680
capacity of state and local health departments to sustain the capabilities developed or improved since 2001.

126
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:41,180
Also, 20% of jurisdictions still reported underdeveloped coordination between the health system and public health agencies, and that was in 2016.

127
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,530
Challenges and barriers to building building p help capabilities,

128
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:50,600
including lack of trained personnel plans and sustained resources and of course, funding.

129
00:15:51,230 --> 00:16:01,060
So this graph shows public health emergency preparedness funding per capita in U.S. dollars from 22 to 2016.

130
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:09,470
And we can see, you know, it's gone down from 2002 to 2016.

131
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:22,930
And you'll notice the green the tall green bar in 2009 represents a large chunk of supplemental funding and response to the H1N1 outbreak.

132
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:34,810
Um, but, you know, signs of deterioration of capability functions are evident by recent reports from city and local health departments.

133
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:46,380
Um. And the report, this same report suggested that limited resources may have an impact on the department's ability to respond to real emergencies,

134
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:50,160
train and exercise and participate in regional collaborations.

135
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,580
So funding for public health in the US continues to fall.

136
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:06,870
This is a different paper and this article that was published in American Journal of

137
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:13,229
Public Health analyzed the trends over 53 years and project out into the future,

138
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,690
and they looked specifically at the relationship between public health spending compared with clinical spending.

139
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:30,599
So they you know, there is no absolute measure of optimal sorry, there there's no absolute measure of the optimal level of public health spending.

140
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:36,839
However, and Institute of Medicine panel recently concluded that public health agencies are markedly underfunded

141
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,570
and that U.S. health spending is out of balance with spending for clinical care disproportionately high,

142
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:48,630
compared with spending for population based activities that more efficiently and effectively improve the nation's health.

143
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:55,510
And looking at this graph that they produced,

144
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:04,810
you can see this is U.S. public health expenditures in dollars per capita and as a percentage of national health expenditure.

145
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:15,250
And so going back to 1960, we can see that public health spending as a percentage of total national health expenditures has never been higher then,

146
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,410
never been much higher, at least than 3%. And the current trend is still downward.

147
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,400
So you all should have read the executive summary for the ready or not report.

148
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:35,980
And we'll be hearing more about this report on Tuesday with our guest speaker, Matt McKillop, who is one of the authors of this report.

149
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:42,489
And the analysis detailed in this report showed that despite having positive steps in the US public health system,

150
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,840
only half of the US population is served by a comprehensive public health system.

151
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,240
So what have we learned?

152
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:59,799
Public Health Emergency Preparedness Program links federal with state, local, territorial and tribal public health departments.

153
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,870
We are funding, support and accountability.

154
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:09,730
There have been important successes over the past two decades in building out public health, emergency response capabilities and ongoing.

155
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:17,080
There are ongoing challenges with workforce capacity, sustainable funding and coordination between public health and clinical care.

156
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:23,319
And here are some references. And thank you very much.

157
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,510
I will see you all on Tuesday.
