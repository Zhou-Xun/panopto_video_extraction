00:00:05,674 --> 00:00:09,156
Hi, my name is Sarah Ball and
I'm a staff dietitian in the Department of

2
00:00:09,156 --> 00:00:12,970
Nutritional Sciences here at
the School of Public Health.

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,410
Today, we're gonna be talking about
dietary assessment through plate waste.

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,390
As part of my role here at the university,
I also work for the nutrition obesity

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,090
research corps which does dietary
assessment for specific research studies.

6
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,090
So today, we're gonna specifically
discuss two non-traditional

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,270
methods of dietary assessment.

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,170
Plate wastes through weights and
through observation.

9
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,750
Additionally, we'll examine a setting in
which these two methods have been used

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,520
together to assess the dietary
intake of children.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,300
In the simplest of terms plate
waste is defined as the quantity

12
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,970
of edible portions of food
served that remain uneaten and

13
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,570
is often used as a measure
of food acceptability.

14
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,318
Plate wastes can be measured several ways,
we'll briefly discuss two,

15
00:00:58,318 --> 00:01:01,770
plate waste through weights and
plate waste through observation.

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,317
Plate waste is often used
in food service operations.

17
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:08,957
Excessive waste may be a sign
of inefficient operations and

18
00:01:08,957 --> 00:01:11,152
an unresponsive delivery system.

19
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:15,243
For example, this method of assessment
has been used extensively in

20
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:19,840
studies looking at food waste in
the national school lunch program.

21
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,610
It is commonly used to assess
effectiveness of a menu performance,

22
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,310
meal acceptance,
dietary intake adequacy and

23
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:33,145
the economic impact, and
efficacy of nutrition education programs.

24
00:01:33,145 --> 00:01:35,975
When thinking about estimating
plate waste through weights,

25
00:01:35,975 --> 00:01:38,165
it is pretty unsophisticated.

26
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:41,925
All edible food items
are weighed prior to meal start.

27
00:01:41,925 --> 00:01:44,975
Later, after the individual
has finished eating,

28
00:01:44,975 --> 00:01:48,595
the leftovers of each edible
food item are weighed again.

29
00:01:48,595 --> 00:01:52,720
To save on time and effort, for
studies with large sample sizes,

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,630
an average weight for a typical serving
size will be used instead of weighing each

31
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,880
individual's food item pre-meal.

32
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,930
Plate waste through food weight has been
assessed a number of different ways and

33
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,240
is expressed in varying terms.

34
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,320
As the proportion of food served that is
uneaten, the amount of calories uneaten or

35
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,940
the amount of nutrients uneaten.

36
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,860
Weights used to measure plate waste
can be assessed for an individual

37
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,926
by weighing a particular individual's
food items pre and post a meal.

38
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:27,780
More typically, though,
the aggregate method is used.

39
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,020
Aggregate non-selective plate waste
weighs was all food items for

40
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,060
all individuals together.

41
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,380
Whereas aggregate selective plate waste
separates the foods into categories,

42
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,490
but all individuals
are still weighed together.

43
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,990
Aggregate plate waste can
accommodate larger sample sizes, but

44
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,970
is obviously less specific
to a particular individual.

45
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,200
No matter the procedure,

46
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,200
plate waste is often calculated as
the percentage of foods not consumed.

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,930
For example, a 1997 study conducted
in several Montana elementary schools

48
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:07,860
found that of the calories and nutrients
served, roughly 25 to 30% were wasted.

49
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,845
With vegetables having
the greatest waste at 42%.

50
00:03:10,845 --> 00:03:15,690
Plate waste could also be measured
through visual observation,

51
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,910
this method makes use of
trained observers to visually

52
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:24,230
estimate the amount of food served,
consumed, and wasted by individuals.

53
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,535
This is considered an indirect measure of
consumption and waste where observers make

54
00:03:28,535 --> 00:03:33,810
judgments about the proportion of serving
sizes that remain on a discarded plate.

55
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,700
Observers often use a five point scale and
quantify the amount discarded all,

56
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:45,510
three quarters, one half, one quarter or
less and non, well, this method

57
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,540
can be used for individual plate waste, it
is not accurate for aggregate plate waste.

58
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,560
As you may guess,

59
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,690
both methods of measuring plate waste can
provide detailed and accurate information,

60
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,730
but can be costly and time consuming
to measure in person and in real time.

61
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:06,290
Recently the food photography method
has been developed where a person takes

62
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,870
a very detailed photograph of their
food pre and post meal consumption.

63
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,060
While this technology is still
under development and testing

64
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:19,580
preliminary data show it to be an accurate
way to measure both consumption and waste.

65
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,100
Over the past several years, Doctor
Peterson and I have been working with

66
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,550
researchers at Abt Associates on
a large study of the child and

67
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,380
adult care food program.

68
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,410
This national study, funded through the
USDA, is part of a congressional mandate

69
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,870
has the goal of determining what children
eat in childcare, among other things.

70
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,570
We are using a combination of food
weights, meal observation, and

71
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:48,270
parental food records to assess a 24 hour
dietary intake of children in childcare.

72
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,050
As well as individual and
aggregate plate waste.

73
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,010
Children in childcare often spend time
eating at home, at childcare, and

74
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,110
at another caregiver's house.

75
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,350
In order to assess their dietary
intake over a full 24 hours,

76
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,790
multiple methods are utilized.

77
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,490
In order to measure what a child
ate while not in child care,

78
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,860
parents were instructed to record
everything their child ate,

79
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,400
through the use of
a standardized food record.

80
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,890
Then, in order to measure what was
eaten while at the childcare program,

81
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:26,160
we utilized food waste and
visual observation of meals.

82
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,023
Childcare staff are instructed to
measure out five average portion sizes

83
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:32,286
of each food item.

84
00:05:32,286 --> 00:05:37,420
Which were then weighed by study staff to
determine an average weight for each item.

85
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,180
This was then considered the Reference
Portion Weight for that food for

86
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,195
that particular classroom.

87
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:49,090
Trained observers were then instructed
to observe three children for each meal.

88
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,130
They visually estimated the number of
reference portions served as the meals

89
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,300
started for each child.

90
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,660
They were then responsible for observing
the number of reference portions added,

91
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:05,970
such as in second portions or removed,
such as in food dropped during the meal.

92
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,770
When the child's meal was complete,

93
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,730
they observed the number of
reference portions remaining.

94
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,630
From this, we were able to determine
the number of reference portions

95
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,310
each child consumed and
wasted for each food item.

96
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,680
This was multiplied by
the average reference weight

97
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,770
giving us an accurate estimation of
the amount of food consumed and wasted.

98
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,810
For example, if a child was served for
chicken nuggets and left one half of

99
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,980
one remaining on their plate, we know that
child consumed three and a half nuggets.

100
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,740
At the beginning,

101
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,970
we established the average reference
way of a single nugget to be 24 grams.

102
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,680
So we know that, that child consumed
84 grams of chicken nugget.

103
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,170
This information combine with the
information received on the food record,

104
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:59,250
allow us to compute the nutritional intake
of a child over a 24 hour period of time.

105
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,180
In summary,while traditional methods
of dietary assessments are just food

106
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,420
frequency questionnaires and
food recalls are used most frequently.

107
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,790
There are times where plate
waste through weights and

108
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,430
visual observation are necessary.

109
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:18,071
Often a combination of methods are used to
get the full picture of a person's diet.
