1
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:21,850
And. Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,770
I feel that the posters around the room. I'm excited for poster session later.

3
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,480
Okay. We're starting our class presentations today. We'll have presentations this week.

4
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,569
We're on break next week. And then two more weeks of presentations.

5
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:43,480
And then your final project will be due to that last day of class for the presentations.

6
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,550
You'll have 10 minutes for your presentation and then we'll have 5 minutes for questions.

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,230
So while you're watching the presentations, be thinking about the questions that you want to ask.

8
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,370
I will give you a two minute warning and a time's up.

9
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,860
You'll also hear my phone alarm go off, assuming that I can figure out how to work it.

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,720
Um, let's see. I think that's it. Any questions?

11
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:19,360
Hey, Colin, you ready? Ready or not.

12
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:26,160
It's that she hasn't presented.

13
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,450
But yes, you do get a prize for being the first. Oh, really? Yes.

14
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,030
Well, your classmates gave you applause for being. All right.

15
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:40,990
I don't know where the presentation was, so I will let you find that while I figure out my class.

16
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:10,480
Okay. Now, got it. So today I'm going to talk about how this functional orientation related to isolation amount order down in the United States.

17
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:18,400
First time can be the. Okay.

18
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,830
So this topic is the proposal. So it's actually around the topic of suicide.

19
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,580
Suicide is an urgent public health issue in 2020.

20
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:38,409
There are more than 45,000 people die from suicide, and that means one person die from that every 11 minutes.

21
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:43,360
And it is the 12th leading cause of death in the United States.

22
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,740
Their ranking is even higher before the pandemic, I think is nice.

23
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:56,270
And we should notice that it's not just this 45,000 people and they are the every one copy.

24
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:05,710
It's complete. Suicide means there are more there are more people who attempt suicide or had a plan about it or seriously thought about it.

25
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:13,870
So that's a big issue. But I we're in the suicide research field.

26
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:21,010
Our predictive ability has not improved in the last 15 years, 50 years, five zero.

27
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,600
So that's and that's there is a gap there.

28
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,880
That's why we try to work on and work on this field and make some contributions.

29
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:41,410
So we are not going to address suicide here. We are going to start from some more of more sort of smaller things.

30
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,150
So the first topic is isolation. There are two kinds of isolation.

31
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:57,280
One is social isolated. As you can see, it's like someone in a house we don't like going home by themselves.

32
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:05,650
That's like more objective way to say isolated because you don't have people to talk to.

33
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,970
And the other kind of isolation is long.

34
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:20,470
It's emotional. Emotional isolation or loneliness is like, you can be a brother, you can be around a lot of people, but you still feel lonely.

35
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:26,740
And these two concept, they're distinctive, but they are highly correlated.

36
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:37,030
And this loneliness is more dangerous because it is also proved to be so.

37
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:45,370
Suicide risk factors some. Some countries start to pay attention to it like Australia and UK.

38
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:56,970
They have an initiative in, they have established some national initiative to address the loneliness among a population, especially older adults.

39
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,430
And the other topic we are going to talk about is the functional orientation.

40
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:13,240
So there are actually about like 30% people in the age between 55 and 46.

41
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:21,870
A 64, 64 have some form of disability and functional limitation is a subset of disability

42
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,180
is more about your daily activity like the picture you can see here can you?

43
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:42,069
If you walk by a cell. And my research question is, is this two concept has some kind of association between them and if so,

44
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,390
was how strong the association is and what kind of association?

45
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:55,480
To address this question on this is more detail about our study design.

46
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,260
We will use the HRA, the Health and Human Study.

47
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:11,740
To do a secondary data analyzes. So this is a national longitudinal study and it is focused on older adults.

48
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,820
They are respondent are 50 years old and older.

49
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,030
And a survey conducted every two years.

50
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:25,840
It is based in the University of Michigan. Super cool. And then more specific about aims.

51
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:32,440
So the first aim is to estimate the correlation between functional limitation and loneliness.

52
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:41,500
And for that, we want to examine the association, of course, ten years and identify a relevant covariance.

53
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,680
So the third part in the slightest.

54
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:57,040
And then I stress we try to use core sectional analyzes to do with the first aim and then the longitudinal analyzes to do with the second one.

55
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:13,250
More about the management is a little complicated. So we have two management for each of which each of our key variables for functional limitation.

56
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,540
And the objective one is the fiscal performance.

57
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,880
So in the US every, every weight,

58
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:31,399
how they will select half respondents to do their face to face interview is like the interviewer will

59
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:41,690
go to the respondents House and record their answer and perhaps them like time work or grab the strip.

60
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:49,729
So this data are more objective because it is recorded by someone else and in a subject

61
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:57,080
subjective measure is an self-reported scale called activity of any limitations.

62
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:05,000
Question are like do you have difficulties in undressing yourself, baby yourself, this kind of thing?

63
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,080
And in the outcome variable reported to,

64
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:20,479
we also have to measurement for the objective measurement we are try to get on quantitative features

65
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,450
of their social network is like how many type of relationship do you have to have friends,

66
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:37,940
children or a partner? And how many people like number of the social of your social network and how how frequently you have contact with them.

67
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,280
And in this subjective measure, we use the 11 item.

68
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,880
You see how a loneliness scale and the question.

69
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,600
It's like, how often do you have the following feelings?

70
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,710
Do you how often do you feel you are left out or alone?

71
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:01,620
These kinds of things. Okay.

72
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:11,280
And this is the timeline in the four from from the first month to the first month,

73
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:19,700
we would focus on the fourth inning to do the cross sectional study and month to month.

74
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:30,410
They are obviously the focus of the longitudinal study. And the last part is I want to talk about some limitations of this study.

75
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,130
The first one is the responder response bias.

76
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:43,560
As you can see, a lot of questions in my I just introduced are self-reported questions.

77
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:53,720
So you can imagine if some questions are sensitive to answer or I'm embarrassed to answer, like, do you have difficulty in addressing yourself?

78
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:59,540
Some people might feel like it's awkward to just say yes, so they probably say no.

79
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,380
So the how accurate we got, the answer is.

80
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:14,320
It's bias. Like it's likely that those answers are biased.

81
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:23,350
And the other potential bias is the selective and selective bias, as we can tell.

82
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:31,450
So this always kind of by phone or a face to face interview, if you can talk to someone,

83
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:40,239
a stranger by phone at 2 hours, I would like to say like you are less likely to be socially isolated to people.

84
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,410
Maybe those people who are really socially isolated or really feel lonely, they even don't want they won't be in the sample.

85
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,020
So that's the second bias and that's it.

86
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:11,469
And questions. I'm a business in the data set.

87
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,650
When you're doing the longitudinal analysis, how many years passed the total?

88
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,620
You might have said ten years, ten years of high school.

89
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:19,130
Yeah.

90
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:34,130
Because the first wave of questions that really tried to ask those questions about feeding or mental health or social or social science is from 2026.

91
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:43,610
And then you come down every year. So they they come down and they come back those session for half of the sample.

92
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:50,330
So if we want to do that like full circle in the crisis, actually we have a wave every four years.

93
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:05,990
Mhm. Um, so I think when you're first, so you started out talking about suicide and that the study,

94
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:12,110
your motivation for the study is to help ultimately understand suicide rates in older adults.

95
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:19,880
And I, if I remember correctly, you talked about how loneliness is has already been identified as a risk factor for suicide.

96
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,160
But what about functional limitations? Do we know if that's also a risk factor?

97
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:32,629
Uh, I read a couple research article about that, but it's not like a lot of research.

98
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:38,820
Focus on that. Yeah. Yeah. And I, I read, uh, Madonna and I talk about.

99
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,340
And is that why you wanted to study that? Really? Yes. Okay, that's what I see.

100
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,370
Oh, this is great. Is that rooted into suicide?

101
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:51,320
Yeah. Yeah. And so I've been thinking about those, too. Um, and then I had one other question.

102
00:12:51,320 --> 00:13:00,170
Really? Oh, is this a, um, in terms of the overall literature on suicide risk, is there a lot of work on older adults?

103
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,760
Or does it tend to focus on other groups, other age groups?

104
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:15,540
Or do you know, I think or uh, like now maybe this last decade, more and more people start go out.

105
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:21,770
Yeah, older adults. But before that more, more people focus on the uh.

106
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,510
Or teenagers have made age y males.

107
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:32,480
Yeah. That's the highest, uh, group has the most case of suicide.

108
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:50,110
Any other? Oh, yes. As.

109
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:04,010
Um. So I. That would be an interesting question, actually.

110
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:11,030
Now the program now the program to try to link with some national data.

111
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,620
And that's how we can get to those geo.

112
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:27,460
It's because I'm going. Thank you.

113
00:14:28,480 --> 00:15:18,110
Thank. So my study is in the aftermath of row differences in maternal mortality among teens and

114
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:23,350
adolescents in two states before and after the national late term abortion was over three.

115
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,360
So as many or probably all of you know, on June 24th, 2022,

116
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:36,009
the US Supreme Court released their decision on Dobbs versus Jackson Women's Health Organization.

117
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:42,550
And in doing so, they overturned the national constitutional right to abortion that was established in Roe versus Wade.

118
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,700
Several states already had trigger bans on the books so that abortion would be criminalized or outlawed.

119
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:55,060
As soon as the Supreme Court released their decision and several more passed restrictive legislation in the following weeks.

120
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,240
I'm going to be focusing on Illinois and Texas.

121
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:05,260
Illinois enshrining the right to abortion in their state constitutions so they saw no changes in the legality of abortion.

122
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,480
Texas, however, had a trigger ban,

123
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:16,330
which immediately created harsh penalties for providers and doctors or anyone else providing or eating and getting an abortion.

124
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,940
So that's criminalized and also totally outlawed.

125
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:27,400
They have no exceptions for rape or incest and very minor exceptions for the health of the pregnant individual.

126
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:34,390
Teens and adolescents face additional barriers to accessing abortion, including parental consent laws,

127
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:40,780
the inability to make school without administrators contacting parents logistical barriers like transportation,

128
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:46,630
car driver's license and economic barriers, including cost and insurance.

129
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:53,590
For example, Texas had outlawed Medicaid funding for abortion prior to their complete outlawing of it,

130
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,200
and before the constitutional right to abortion was overturned.

131
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:03,190
Minors living in states that restricted abortion were more likely to have an unplanned or mistimed birth,

132
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:08,530
which disproportionately affected black adolescents. But despite all these barriers,

133
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:13,059
research estimates that anywhere from one fifth to one third of teens who had an unwanted

134
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:17,650
or mistimed first pregnancy were able to receive an abortion prior to this decision.

135
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,380
So the public health relevance.

136
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:26,810
Several large medical and public health organizations have stressed the importance of access to safe and legal abortion,

137
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,250
and they've also opposed laws mandating parental involvement.

138
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,490
Prospective studies have followed women from early in their pregnancy through whether or not they got an abortion,

139
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:44,330
and then beyond those who tried to obtain an abortion but were denied one due to restrictive laws or limits on gestational age,

140
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:50,330
faced more anxiety symptoms, lower self-esteem and lower life satisfaction in the long term, in the short term.

141
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,129
And then in addition, their families felt those additional consequences.

142
00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:00,740
As in the long term, the existing children of women who were denied unwanted wanted abortion had lower average

143
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:05,200
developmental scores and also were more likely to live below the federal poverty line.

144
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,879
And research prior to the 2022 decision showed that at the state level,

145
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:17,000
the number of restrictive policies on abortion was associated with maternal mortality

146
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,230
so that more restrictive policies meant more maternal mortality in that state.

147
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,540
So focusing in on maternal mortality in the US.

148
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,530
The US has the highest maternal mortality rate among high income countries.

149
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,940
And this is really driven by our wide and further widening disparities.

150
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:39,410
Actually, in the past decades they've been getting worse, which is especially concerning.

151
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,980
In 2022, the maternal maternal mortality rate for black women was nearly three times that of white women.

152
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:52,130
55 deaths per 100,000. So why are the racial disparity so large?

153
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,439
One part of it is the long history of structural racism in our country that's disproportionally

154
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,300
relegated black Americans to lower socioeconomic classes and disinvested in their communities.

155
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:10,190
Both of those factors have been related to maternal mortality, also due to real time racist behaviors from medical professionals,

156
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:14,629
it's been found that implicit biases held by professionals lead to poor communication,

157
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:23,420
to patients of color, as well as diagnosing and adequately treating pain, preeclampsia and other complications associated with childbirth.

158
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:30,120
So my aims and hypotheses with this project will be to document the maternal mortality

159
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,470
among teens and adolescents in the two states before and after the overturning of rule.

160
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:40,020
My hypothesis is that fully restricting abortion will lead to greater increases in maternal mortality.

161
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,629
So Texas will have greater increases during the study period.

162
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:49,350
But only my second aim is to examine racial differences in maternal mortality before and after.

163
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,860
And for hypotheses is that maternal mortality among teens and adolescents previously

164
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,390
established that black youth and other youth of color are disproportionately impacted.

165
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,800
Further hypothesize that restricting abortion will contribute to this inequity.

166
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,850
So racial disparities will be greater in Texas than in Illinois.

167
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:18,260
Here's my conceptual model. So abortions can lead directly to maternal mortality through unsafe abortion attempts.

168
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:25,070
Prior to 1973, there was an estimated just over 100 deaths per year due to uncertain, safe abortion attempts.

169
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:29,569
But that's almost definitely undercounting the actual number. However,

170
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,229
most of those deaths will be through the additional number of pregnancies carried to

171
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:38,630
term as the number as like pregnancy technically has a higher death rate than abortion.

172
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,960
Legal and safe abortions are way safer than pregnancy and all of its complications or childbirth.

173
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,930
And then I think the number of increased pregnancies carried to term will interact with race

174
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:57,380
through those systems of racial oppression to cause an even greater increase in maternal mortality.

175
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,940
So this study will be based on difference in difference estimation,

176
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:09,659
which is a quasi experimental design that's useful when attempting to compare outcomes before and after events like a policy change.

177
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:15,630
And it's also useful when randomization isn't possible, and those are both really primary considerations for the study.

178
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,560
I'm looking at the policy change on June 24th, 2022,

179
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,020
and I can't randomize people to different states or tell them whether or not they can get an abortion.

180
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:33,480
So one of the requirements of this model is that you have multiple timepoints points before and after the change in question.

181
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:41,070
So before I'll be looking at the full three years, 2019 to 2021 and after I'll be looking at 2023 to 2025.

182
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:47,850
The study design is also really useful because you're comparing the changes in the outcome rather than the outcomes directly.

183
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:51,690
So that accounts for like the state level differences that might be impacting it.

184
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:57,370
So like we're only looking at changes in Illinois versus changes in Texas rather than the states themselves.

185
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:03,599
So they could be a little different. And then because my study period overlaps with COVID,

186
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,900
I'll also be including a variable in my regression to reflect the availability of prenatal and child health care services.

187
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:17,939
And then just the outcome I'll be looking at to really give a formal definition on maternal mortality is the definition of an individual or pregnant,

188
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:24,780
or within 42 days from the end of pregnancy for any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management.

189
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,930
And then the maternal mortality ratio is the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 births.

190
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,540
And I'll be looking at maternal mortality ratio.

191
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:45,210
For the data collection in order to collect data on the birth and maternal deaths among teens and adolescents in Texas and Illinois.

192
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:51,750
I'll submit an application to the National Center for Health Statistics for use of their national vital statistics, system.

193
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:57,570
Mortality and mentality files are tracking through their mortality files or open use.

194
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:03,329
But because I'm looking at teens and adolescents, and because those deaths aren't super common,

195
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:07,800
I say it'll be restricted use because of confidentiality concerns.

196
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,500
So submit a request to get the mortality files and then the neutrality files.

197
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,580
The birth files are always restricted use, so I would need to submit a request for that.

198
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,950
And then for analysis, the data will be analyzed in R by creating the data estimation model.

199
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:30,950
The comparison group will behave in adolescence in Illinois because they didn't see a change in the legality of abortion.

200
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:35,360
Where is my intervention group will be teens and adolescents in Texas because they

201
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,060
did experience the change with the enactment of their trigger bans on June 24th.

202
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:48,500
I'm sort of like this first. I'll pull both groups and add a group indicator variable to the model.

203
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,960
Then I'll add a time variable and an interaction term between those two variables.

204
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:03,740
And the coefficient on the interaction term represents the difference between the changes in maternal mortality ratios between Illinois and Texas.

205
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,120
So that coefficient will represent the true policy effect.

206
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,370
And then finally, I'll also create the ID models that are stratified by race.

207
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,640
To start investigating any potential racial disparities.

208
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,559
And while this won't provide any information about statistical significance,

209
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:29,600
it allows me to examine the potential existence and magnitude of these disparities and could provide the basis for future research.

210
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:50,950
Thank you. Oh, sorry.

211
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:59,080
Oh, Jackie, it's just like Indiana. Are you going to account for the change in traffic?

212
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:11,860
No. That's a great question, but isn't really in my study design I have in my limitations,

213
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:17,440
like spillover effects, like people from Texas might have the ability to travel really far and got one.

214
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:25,629
And people might be coming into Illinois to receive abortions. So I think that's just a limitation to keep in mind with the study.

215
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:39,360
But that's a great question. Where are you?

216
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:46,590
So when you were describing your outcome, um, I'm wondering if,

217
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:54,240
if the data that you're going to be used that you're going to use will capture deaths due to unsafe abortions.

218
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:59,310
Because if you're looking at deaths per like birth, um.

219
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,940
And then you would also be missing out on.

220
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:08,510
Um. Maternal deaths where a live birth didn't result.

221
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:16,220
So I'm wondering. Right. Well, I'd my first doesn't necessarily need to result for the death, like the maternal death.

222
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,220
And then they just. It's over the number of live births. Oh, I see.

223
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:27,510
That's okay. Okay. To get sort of a sense of how many pregnancies, I guess, births there were in the state.

224
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:33,450
Okay. But it could be. Yeah. It could be really early in the pregnancy, and a person dies and that will count.

225
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:38,640
Okay. If they knew they were pregnant. Because that's how they'll classify the death.

226
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:42,260
Yeah. There's a little box on that. Okay. If it was related.

227
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,470
But that is also definitely open to a lot of misclassification here.

228
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:57,220
Yeah. Yeah. Does it have anything on pregnancy complications?

229
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:02,110
Mortalities, obviously, as the end result. But are there any other pregnancy complications?

230
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:09,350
I'm just thinking about quality of life long term. So somebody might survive birth and the child might survive if that's the pregnancy option.

231
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:16,230
But a lot of other things can happen at the end point. And I recognize sometimes we narrow scope because we have a time limit.

232
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:20,430
So that's what we do. But is that something that the data set has? Is that something you'd be interested in looking at?

233
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:28,180
It's definitely something I like personally interested in, but this is just based on my mortality files, like the data.

234
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,229
Um, but I think that's like a super important public health impact, which is like sort of the foundation for the study.

235
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:38,070
But no, I wouldn't be capturing any like low pregnancy complications.

236
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:26,150
I know. In all this.

237
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,819
You're get everyone else. I have the most boring flight in all my energies.

238
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,310
Black and white for boring. Okay, I got it. One financial.

239
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,190
Okay. Good morning, everyone.

240
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:56,890
My name is Nikki, and today I'll be talking to you guys about passive feeding, maternal stress and infant growth in disadvantaged populations.

241
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,010
So a quick look at the agenda. First, we'll talk about the background and significance of our project.

242
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:09,610
We'll talk about breastfeeding as an intervention. We'll go through some current research and gaps in the literature.

243
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:19,150
And then we'll move into my research proposal population methods, the statistical analysis, and expected outcomes and contribution.

244
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,420
Okay. So first, I know we've talked about this a lot in the past, so bear with me.

245
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:32,800
We all know that prevalence of obesity is increasing. It's about 42% in adults and 20% in children.

246
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:37,630
Visceral adiposity has been found to be associated with type two diabetes.

247
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,620
And Type two diabetes contributes to a million deaths annually.

248
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,300
This is actually the ninth leading cause of mortality in the United States,

249
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:51,910
and prevalence is climbing for this condition in adults, children and adolescents as well.

250
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:58,210
So it's kind of a big deal. Nobody likes this type of insulin multiple times a day.

251
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:04,240
And so that's the public health issue that we're going to be talking about.

252
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:12,040
And also, I think it's well known that those who identify as non-Hispanic black or Hispanic or having family

253
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:20,230
income less than 350% of the federal poverty limit bear the brunt of the burden for these conditions.

254
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:28,010
So this is just to give you a visual. You've got youth obesity trends on the left and then adults on the right.

255
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:32,750
In 1971, the prevalence of obesity for youth was about 4%.

256
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:40,100
And as we talked about today, it's about 20%. So you're probably wondering what does this have to do with breastfeeding?

257
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:43,700
So breastfeeding is actually considered an intervention.

258
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:51,980
It's been linked to reduce risks for some of these conditions, these metabolic metabolic conditions like obesity,

259
00:30:52,370 --> 00:31:00,199
insulin resistance and type two diabetes, specifically infants who are exposed to gestational diabetes in utero.

260
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:07,550
They have higher risks for these conditions. So breastfeeding might be even more beneficial for that population.

261
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,100
All right. So current research.

262
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:22,450
Most of the research up till now has focused on human milk composition, prenatal diet and maternal BMI as factors related to infant growth.

263
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:27,309
And so a lot of the infant interventions in this space have looked at weight loss,

264
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:33,010
which we know is not that great an intervention because of some of these social determinants of health.

265
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:43,120
And it's just not feasible for a lot of people. So fewer studies actually consider these factors like lack of access to nutrition, nutritious foods.

266
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,830
What if a mom can't change her diet in one day time and resources?

267
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:54,460
What if you know someone is stressed out and they, for whatever reason, don't have time for breastfeeding?

268
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:59,250
Or they don't have a place to park or whatever the case may be.

269
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:04,350
So breastfeeding as well differs across some of these factors.

270
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:11,770
Stress level and income affects the prevalence of breastfeeding, initiation and continuation.

271
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,100
And breastfeeding is a perfectly mature initiation.

272
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:24,890
It also differs across race and ethnicity pregnancies about 90.3% for Asian mothers and 73.6% for mothers.

273
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:30,740
And then preference also varies by state. The highest prevalence is an organ at 95%.

274
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,340
The lowest prevalence is in Mississippi at 65%.

275
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,310
So for this research proposal, we're actually going to be looking at responses.

276
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:48,600
Feeding evidence suggests that responses meaning we offer an alternative option for promoting positive infant

277
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:54,300
outcomes for caregivers who are unable to breastfeed or who cannot adjust their lifestyle or nutrition.

278
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:58,050
And you're probably wondering what is responsive feeding? What does that mean?

279
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:06,680
Basically, that means that the mom is or the caregiver is able to recognize and trust in their infant's own

280
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:16,050
ability to regulate his or her hunger and satiety so the baby knows when he or she is hungry,

281
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:23,310
is able to signal that somehow. And then once they feed and are satiated, then they're also able to stop feeding themselves.

282
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:31,260
And so for this project, we're going to explore the relationship between breastfeeding intensity and there are different levels of that.

283
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:38,550
You've got the lowest level would be formula feeding. Only then in the middle you have mixed fed and then exclusive breastfeeding.

284
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:47,160
So we'll explore that and its relationship to infant growth with the goal of identifying socially conscious modifiable factors.

285
00:33:48,030 --> 00:34:00,300
The primary aim will be to identify feeding behaviors associated with reduced risk of infant adiposity for these three levels of rescue.

286
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:07,740
And then we'll also examine relationships between stress, breastfeeding, intensity and infant growth outcomes,

287
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:14,520
because there have been studies indicating that there could be a relationship between these three variables.

288
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:21,599
But the evidence is conflicting. So here's a quick conceptual model.

289
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,409
You'll see on the left we've got the breastfeeding intensity that is the primary

290
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:31,950
exposure of interest and then infant adiposity and growth is the main outcome feeding.

291
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:37,200
So you'll see we'll be evaluating as a mediator and then maternal stress.

292
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,320
We will also evaluate as a confounder and this is very simplified.

293
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,430
There are many other variables that impact all these.

294
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:53,540
As well. Okay. So our study population, what we plan to do is enroll mother infant dyads in Jackson, Mississippi,

295
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:59,870
will recruit them from the population of pregnant individuals at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.

296
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:07,790
This is the largest Medicaid provider in the state and will also recruit individuals from local obstetrics officers.

297
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:12,530
We hope that this will provide a diverse sample from the mothers.

298
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:20,690
We will collect survey data on demographic factors, breastfeeding, intensity, stress and beliefs and behaviors around infant feeding.

299
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:25,670
And so the first two factors will be subjective.

300
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:30,410
The last two will be as well, but we'll use validated surveys.

301
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:37,610
So we've got the perceived stress scale in the infant feeding questionnaire that will be administered from the babies.

302
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:41,090
We'll collect weight and length data as measured by pediatricians.

303
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:47,660
And this will be a longitudinal study with measurements taken at multiple time points for a total of three years.

304
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:55,130
We'll need RB approval from the state and then informed consent and parental permission as well,

305
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,580
since we're dealing with human subjects and with the babies.

306
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:10,840
So for statistical analysis, the first thing we'll do is look at descriptive statistics and differences in the exposure breastfeeding intensity.

307
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:18,700
Like I said, I categorize about exclusively breastfed and formula fed across different demographic, maternal and infant characteristics.

308
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:26,530
Infant growth and adiposity will then be assessed using W.H.O. standards for weight for lengthy scores,

309
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:34,810
and we'll look at the outcome as a continuous measure and dichotomous to less than or equal to 85th percentile and greater than.

310
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,989
For this analysis,

311
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:46,540
we'll need to do a mix effects linear and logistic regression model because we've got data collected at multiple weights and the mixed effects

312
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:55,990
model can handle that and we'll do unadjusted and adjusted for covariates and stress will be evaluated as a confounder within these models.

313
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,730
And then finally we'll look at it, mediate a mediation analysis for feeding style, categorize to responsive or other.

314
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:08,350
So there are actually multiple other feeding styles,

315
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:18,130
but since our primary exposure of interests or one of our primary exposures of interest is responsive feeding, we're going to dichotomous.

316
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:27,010
So what we expect to see in the study is an inverse association between breastfeeding intensity and infant adiposity for breastfeeding.

317
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:33,280
Low risk events are positive. We think that this will be compounded by stress with higher levels of stress be

318
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,930
associated with both reduced breastfeeding and with higher risk of infant adiposity.

319
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:45,700
And then we expect mediation by responsive feeding, which means that there may be we think that there will be an attenuation of the

320
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:51,430
relationship between lower levels of breastfeeding and higher risk of infant adiposity.

321
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:58,630
And then finally, we hope that this research will provide support for maternal child health programs,

322
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:03,460
specifically around stress reduction, infant feeding education.

323
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:10,600
We want to teach moms how to feed their babies, what signals to look for when their babies are hungry or satiated.

324
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:18,880
And then also around breastfeeding, initiation and continuation, because evidence does suggest that breastfeeding is good for babies.

325
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,190
However, we know that it's not always possible.

326
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:29,260
So future research and this is one of the limitations, should actually consider biological and objective measures for stress and feeding,

327
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:34,780
because we know that even in validated questionnaires that there's a potential for response bias.

328
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:41,440
And so it's important to consider that in the future. Having said any questions.

329
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:05,120
When you look at the mixed feeling, how is that categorized like a baby breastfeeds all except Black Friday when they babysit on a date bottling?

330
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,500
Is that next or is there like a certain percentage of each that have to have it?

331
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,150
There's a couple of different ways. So it would be like an ad hoc questionnaire.

332
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,390
We would ask, Do you exclusively feed your baby only breast milk?

333
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:23,350
And some people do, yes. And then other people say, well, sometimes I put cereal in the milk or sometimes I use formula.

334
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,290
So there are a couple of different ways you can do it.

335
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:31,780
You can either say if they answered yes to any of those types of questions, then they would be considered mixed fed.

336
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:38,890
Or there's also a way to do like a numerical continuous.

337
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,580
Scale and then have cut offs. So it really depends.

338
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:49,580
But the way in my study, I think just for simplicity in like my personal lack of knowledge around.

339
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,430
Some of this information.

340
00:39:51,430 --> 00:40:00,670
I think I would just do a simple questionnaire, I guess for those then that would be considered mixed bag and then formulas that would be more.

341
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:18,590
We're not a pediatrician, so. The expectation of the.

342
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:28,100
I. Yeah.

343
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:38,990
So with responsive feeding, the idea is that for breast mothers that breast feed they rely on, they rely more on the babies.

344
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:46,050
Signals to feed because they don't know how much they're actually feeding the baby with formula feeding.

345
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:51,930
Um, a lot of times the mother may rely on the amount of formula that they're feeding the baby,

346
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:57,600
and so they may think, Oh, I need to feed my baby this much formula every day, no matter what.

347
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,760
Or, you know, if the baby cries, they may automatically think, Oh, the baby's hungry.

348
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:09,540
So, uh, and then also they make over under feed the baby if they base their feeding around just the amount.

349
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:16,380
Things like that. So the mechanism I guess is that with responsive feeding, you pay more attention to the infant's cues.

350
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,650
And this is tricky, too, because infants have different cues.

351
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:26,040
Some have to learn to read those cues and learn what they even are.

352
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:34,590
Some moms may not be aware, but they read the cues and then hopefully that would be the baby, the proper amount,

353
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:41,640
and that would result in a growth trajectory that was more in line with W.H.O. standards and isn't.

354
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:45,840
Um the thinking is that isn't over that 85th percentile.

355
00:41:54,780 --> 00:42:22,829
I really like, you know. Yeah.

356
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:27,930
It is very tricky. This is has been used for a very long time and, um.

357
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:35,590
You know, the WTO does have standards. There are other ways to measure, like DEXA scans.

358
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:43,480
Yeah, you can do that. I think I didn't have a technical background on that, so I did think wrong to do that.

359
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:49,180
But then at the same time, it's tricky for babies because babies are supposed to have.

360
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:56,980
You know, I had a positive. But then the other it's very tricky because.

361
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:08,510
You want babies to get the right amount of feeding so that they are growing and their body is able to metabolize nutrients efficiently.

362
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:12,559
And so that's really the thinking behind this.

363
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:19,580
And the way that they measure that, for whatever reason is with the wavelength, which may not be the best way to measure.

364
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:23,629
But I think that is the easiest way.

365
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:29,060
And. An objective way to do it.

366
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:35,780
And then also, we know that for W.H.O., they say that all babies grow.

367
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:44,060
We know for sure what their growth trajectory should look like. And so I probably I don't have enough background in that area as well.

368
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:50,650
But but that's the thinking. Thank.

369
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:34,050
Hello. I'll wait for you to say thank you. Although you guys have clearly practiced, I don't even really need to talk it out.

370
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,360
Hi, everybody.

371
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:46,840
My name is David and I will be talking today about the built environment, social isolation and older adults disability related depression.

372
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:53,950
So for what I'll be going through today, I'll be talking about the background and significance of this issue.

373
00:44:54,130 --> 00:45:01,780
The aims of the study that I plan to do, the research, design and methods of that study, and also the ethical challenges in certain patients.

374
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:11,320
So with regard to the intersection between disability, age and place, a growing number of Americans are entering old age with a disability,

375
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:20,530
and cumulative exposure to disadvantage neighborhoods significantly affects functional decline or also mortality.

376
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:25,660
And it's worth noting that this is an intersectional issue.

377
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:34,479
This is, you know, older adults with disabilities are more likely to be lower income and also to be black because of processes

378
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:40,060
like weathering that leads to higher rates of earlier decline in people of color and lower income people,

379
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:46,360
and are also more likely to reside in neighborhoods that have been disadvantaged, disinvested and also exploited.

380
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:48,970
So all of these issues are intertwined.

381
00:45:51,370 --> 00:46:00,340
Social isolation is also a contributor to depression and depression, and in isolation, both cause and worse than pain.

382
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,050
So I've included that here because of the complicated nature of all these different variables.

383
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:11,890
I think this is also I think those tags are like a presentation of my hypotheses on how these things are related.

384
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:23,560
So I am proposing that the built environment causes people to have higher or lower levels of social support, which affects cognitive effects.

385
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:28,990
Mental health but mental health also can cause people to withdraw or engage in social supports.

386
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:32,170
So that is a sort of multidirectional relationship.

387
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:39,340
Um, the built environment can directly cause pain because the built environment can be more or less accessible to people with disabilities.

388
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:42,489
And the study is looking at specifically people with spinal cord injury for

389
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:50,170
whom pain is like a really significant part of their lives and a big issue. Um, pain can also cause people to be in a poor state of mental health.

390
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:55,209
And mental health once again can act back on pain.

391
00:46:55,210 --> 00:47:02,530
As I as I cited depression can actually cause experience higher, higher or worse symptoms of their own pain.

392
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:05,680
So mental health, in essence, also has a causal affect on pain.

393
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:14,530
And then pain itself is also related to the extent to which people will engage in social activities, tend to their social supports.

394
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,050
If people are really like an excessive amount of pain, they might not want to be engaging with other people.

395
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:24,460
They might isolate themselves. Meanwhile, social support.

396
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,560
Um, actually you can.

397
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:32,100
So oh yeah. So social isolation can also cause immersion causing pain.

398
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,480
And so in that sense, social support can also.

399
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:41,970
So this is a complicated bundle of relationships that I'm interested in, sort of disentangling your methods, and I'll get to this.

400
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:48,250
And so the conceptual frameworks that I'm interested in drawing on for this study,

401
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:52,180
I think like the three big ones, are a social relational model of disability.

402
00:47:52,180 --> 00:48:02,530
I bring sort of like a sociology of disability perspective to this research question and that is, um, sort of the idea that, um, the,

403
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:12,610
well, first of all, the social model of disability is the idea that, um, the negative effects of, of embolism, of being discriminated,

404
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:16,330
discriminated against for having a disability or for living in a society that's

405
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:20,020
not designed to accommodate people with disabilities are sort of distinct from,

406
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:26,770
uh, the, there's not a natural consequence of being disabled there, like a socially produced consequence.

407
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:30,340
Um, the social relational model of disability sort of builds on that,

408
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:35,979
while also by also acknowledging that disability can itself be directly impairing,

409
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,520
disabling, sort of distressing again for people with spinal cord injury.

410
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:47,980
Pain is part of life that is not going to go away necessarily just by making adjustments to the built environment or social supports.

411
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,300
Um, so it's important to start to acknowledge that reality as well.

412
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:57,110
So the social relational model of disability builds on the social model by incorporating nature.

413
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:01,840
And I'm also sort of drawing upon neighborhood effects literature,

414
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:06,010
which I think put most simply is just the idea that where you live affects your life chances.

415
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:14,469
We talk about that one class, and I'm sort of proposing that the neighborhood has an effect on depression and

416
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:20,980
pain in social support and also building upon life course theory by which,

417
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:30,040
as we've discussed, guides, research on human lives within contexts that sort of contextualizes the aging process by emphasizing people's.

418
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:35,320
Agency context, history, and then also the timing of events.

419
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:41,770
So the timing of the sibling events, the timing of moves, in fact, all relevant industry situations.

420
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:46,820
So what I think working at the intersection of these three frameworks gives me to this to this

421
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:53,030
project is that the natural progression from spinal cord injury to impairment and isolation,

422
00:49:53,030 --> 00:50:00,859
as I mentioned, it maintains that pain, depression, isolation are not like inherent features of being disabled.

423
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:08,120
They're like socially produced by paying attention to neighborhood context, which is modifiable by public health factors.

424
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:12,370
So what are the aims of my study? To put it as simply as I can,

425
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:24,050
I'm interested in measuring associations between elaborating lived experiences with and also modeling improvements to an accessible built environment.

426
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,700
And I see a lot of social support, pain and depression.

427
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:35,540
So there's three different tasks that I'm engaging with related to this big bundle of relationships, and I will get at how I'm doing that right now.

428
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:40,720
So, you know, the mixed methods study, you know,

429
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:47,580
talking about why and the second but so for the first part from measuring associations, the best way to do that is using a survey.

430
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:52,010
I'm working with data that's already been given to me by Dr. Philip Clark.

431
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,530
And so I'll be using survey items at cross-sectional survey that she conducted.

432
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:02,840
I think I will be using multiple linear regression. We'll see what the best physical model is.

433
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:09,290
I dive into the data, but I will also be working with focus groups that Dr. Clark conducted with the

434
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:15,769
same survey participants that sort of so it's where participants I'm looking

435
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:18,200
at particular parts of the transcript where participants are talking about the

436
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,700
built environments role in their disability related outcomes like depression,

437
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:29,629
pain and sort of to, like I said, elaborate the, the way the mechanism,

438
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:33,770
the way the associations work, like how how they're actually occurring in the lives of people.

439
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:39,589
And part of the reason that I am interested in doing mixed quantitative and qualitative methods is

440
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:45,409
because the limitations of a cross-sectional survey is part of that is you can see an association,

441
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:49,520
but you can't really very clearly see like why or how it's happening.

442
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:54,890
And qualitative research is a really strong way to get into those questions.

443
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:03,230
Also, I will be working with so an interesting feature of the study is that there are zip codes for everybody who's involved in the survey.

444
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:11,450
And so I'm still thinking about how to kind of how to do a modeling component for my master's thesis.

445
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:20,780
But what I'm really interested in, and Dr. Clark is giving me the go ahead is like modeling what based on the statistical findings,

446
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:24,420
based on the interview findings, what a better neighborhood might look like.

447
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:33,920
So producing like a model later sense. And the ethical considerations are pretty minimal because I'm working with secondary data.

448
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,700
But again, getting back well,

449
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:45,200
I have I think I stumbled into me to design a study that maximizes the benefits to participants that were involved in the initial question,

450
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,640
even though I wasn't involved with that.

451
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:56,720
And so I think using a social model of disability and also trying to produce a vision of like what would be a better living community.

452
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:04,010
Those are both in my research design, like decisions that are related to like ethical,

453
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:10,460
the ethical imperative to give back to the participants, even though it's not directly because I will never meet them.

454
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:17,000
So the timeline, this is something I want to do in real life.

455
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:24,980
So I just joined the IAB actually, that I fundamentally changed my project like a couple of weeks ago, and I joined the IAB like this week.

456
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:25,610
So that's great.

457
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:36,410
I'll be doing statistical tests and quantitative analysis next semester and recognizing that quantitative analysis is the time consuming process.

458
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:44,510
I'll be continuing it in the summer and also looking at ingenious modeling based on techniques I learned next semester in like spatial audience stuff.

459
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:51,470
And then hopefully by the fall of next of 2023, I'll be able to submit to journals, if not by the spring semester.

460
00:53:52,880 --> 00:54:02,210
That is what I've got going on. Yeah.

461
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:08,520
Where is this data from? It's a survey that Dr. Clark, I think, like, wrote.

462
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:15,920
Sorry, I don't know how to ask. Yeah, well, and so new to this project, actually, I those are questions that, like, I should know the answer to.

463
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,399
But it was, uh, yeah, I think.

464
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:24,049
I think well, actually. So it's borrowing a lot of questionnaires that have been tested, right.

465
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:33,590
So, and like validated. But yeah, that's yeah, I know she had a big neighborhood grant, but I don't know where she was a bigger like what city.

466
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,489
Oh, yeah. So it was, it was, uh, three Midwestern states. I think it was Michigan.

467
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:41,030
Indiana. So it's like a lot of different places.

468
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:46,700
Yeah, but not nationally representative. Okay. Yeah, it's sort of like results from a study of Midwestern homework.

469
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:54,870
Yeah. I think.

470
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:06,110
Establishing. Yeah.

471
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:16,430
Yeah. Oh, my. Experiences of.

472
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,990
Spinal cord injury. And.

473
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:30,830
Yeah. How does.

474
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:43,950
Yeah. No, I actually think that race should be part of this, this tag.

475
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:49,140
And that would be complicated, too, but it's important.

476
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:53,520
Yeah. And so another thing you can do is find how these relationships vary.

477
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:59,610
The, you know, how this how this process varies based on demographic characteristics and something I can't find.

478
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:07,490
But yes, that's a good point that I'll. Yeah.

479
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:11,450
This is more stuff like. Are you.

480
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:18,620
Are you transcribing all of the interview? Um. No, no, that would be huge.

481
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:32,210
Yeah, I. This is like a wealth of data that was like, I'm not, you know, I'll be coding it qualitatively, but not transcribing it when you're doing.

482
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,090
Ideas. Is that what you're looking for? You want to kind of let it come?

483
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:47,590
Yeah. Yeah. So it's. It's going to be so, uh, my priorities are going to be informed by the statistical analysis, which I have not yet done.

484
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:53,770
But how this is, I guess this is my primary ideas about what does this, what, how this is going to look like.

485
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:58,720
Right. You know, I could be wrong. Um, but basically I'll do the statistical analysis.

486
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:01,730
I'll go into the qualitative data. So it's not radically inductive.

487
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:10,659
It's not it's kind of like abducted because I want to go in with ideas about what I am expecting to find,

488
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:16,780
but trying to also look for the things that are surprising, which is one of the strings that quantitative methods add to it.

489
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:21,399
Mixed methods approach is not just confirming what I want to find, but what are people?

490
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,760
What in people's voices surprises me and focus on those facts.

491
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:43,010
WINFREY So how are you thinking about accounting for these bi directional relationships between variables in your model?

492
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,640
Yeah, analytically. The truth is, I have to consult Dr. Clark.

493
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:51,590
Uh, yeah, I'm excited for.

494
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:56,210
So, you know, I ran all these variables by her, and she was like, yes, let's keep them all.

495
00:57:56,450 --> 00:58:00,830
This is beyond my abilities to do statistically. So I'm gonna learn a lot.

496
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:05,030
Yeah. And are you so related to this?

497
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:08,480
This is it was the data collected cross-sectional or is it?

498
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:13,410
I think ever I think it's gross. It's cross-sectional. And for some of these.

499
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:20,270
So. So all you know is their current built environment, their current levels of social support, current levels of pain.

500
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,640
Yeah. And we have depression diagnosis prior to spinal cord. Oh, you do.

501
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:27,400
Okay. So I guess you can use that. I think he's that.

502
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:33,710
Yeah. So I would, I would suggest taking this and drawing it out.

503
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:43,460
Usually I don't care about formal diagonals, but like using formal diagonals where you can't have bi directional so that you have to think about you.

504
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:47,780
So what you would do is you would have mental health in two places.

505
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:54,709
Right. So you'd have to say built environment influences, social support, kind of at like time.

506
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:57,860
One affects mental health, affects social support.

507
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:05,820
Right. Like you would put it in there actually multiple times, then you'd be thinking about it in terms of the life course timing.

508
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:10,910
Yeah. So yes, you've only got cross-sectional data, but because you're using a life course framework here,

509
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:15,769
you can think about how these what you really think is happening analytically.

510
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:23,090
You be able to really do anything because you don't have longitudinal data, but I think it will help you clarify your thinking about it.

511
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:26,810
Thank you. Yeah. This is all really helpful for a project, actually. Yeah. Thank you.

512
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:35,360
Okay. All right, let's take a five minute bathroom break and then come back.

513
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,750
We've got four more.

514
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:53,830
We're halfway. Yeah.

515
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:59,350
Yeah. Think.

516
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:16,910
I know you're just here.

517
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:25,690
Yeah. Oh, I just like good fun. Oh, I get it.

518
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:35,080
Oh, you're either gonna have to go to the asylum.

519
01:00:36,850 --> 01:01:02,880
Yeah. Yeah, I did. But if I did that, I really think that I feel like a different person.

520
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:14,530
Yeah, it's gonna be like. Don't know if I know that I've been thinking about.

521
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:28,310
No. You have.

522
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:41,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

523
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:52,280
I have. I have a very good life that.

524
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:04,450
And what are some the stories.

525
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:20,910
Yeah, I thought that. Oh, yeah, that's.

526
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:39,080
I guess I want to know. Yeah.

527
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:44,430
All right. I was wondering about.

528
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:57,650
I want to know what.

529
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:37,180
How did you. You're ready to throw this been into the.

530
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:52,720
We've got. I think you guys.

531
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:01,880
I guess I know.

532
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:12,010
Because you didn't like it for a long time.

533
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:20,480
Yeah, so I don't really think.

534
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:35,450
Yeah. Sorry.

535
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:42,730
Yeah. Don't like that.

536
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:56,020
I like that. For the next year or so, I feel like everything.

537
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:17,380
And so I didn't want to. Yeah, I think so.

538
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:22,950
Oh, that's great. Yeah. Yeah.

539
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:46,490
You know, this is. Oh, my goodness.

540
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:08,720
And if. She was afraid that.

541
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:18,620
You already know. I was.

542
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:33,310
Sorry. I can't work my phone. Does anybody else are in trouble with wireless?

543
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:37,629
Don't know why. Thank you. What's that like?

544
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:41,650
Three years of trouble. Okay, that makes me feel a lot better.

545
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:46,030
All right. Okay. No calculator.

546
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,320
By the way, you guys are all going to be sorely disappointed when you see the state of my slides.

547
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:56,440
The people so far have a very nice visual. Hopefully it's a nice picture.

548
01:06:57,630 --> 01:07:01,680
Anybody else? Okay. Huh?

549
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:11,849
Oh, sorry. Sorry. Even October and November.

550
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:19,250
So that I was on the phone with my brother got last night and he was like, You're this annoying voice for sure.

551
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:23,160
He's not siblings. Where are you? All right. Okay, I'm ready when you are.

552
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:27,899
Okay, I can go now. So my name is Yonatan.

553
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:33,299
Today I will be talking about mental health in the American black population and exploration activity,

554
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:40,320
culture and utilization of mental health services. So we've really talked about it previous and earlier on in the semester, what the activity is.

555
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:44,820
But essentially it's essentially asking people whether they are born in the U.S. or overseas.

556
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:49,139
A lot of researchers break it down even further about exactly where they're from.

557
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:56,460
But for the purposes of this, I'll keep it basic. Just looking at nativity in terms of whether they are born in the U.S. or overseas.

558
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:00,030
And so this is a topic that's especially interest to me.

559
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:05,459
It's actually one of the main reasons I started studying public health because a lot of studies,

560
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:09,240
as I'm sure you guys know, the racial categories are quite broad.

561
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:15,840
So for understandable reasons, it's much easier to provoke interpretive interpretation as well as data analysis to kind of look

562
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:20,760
at differences in prevalence of cardiovascular disease between white people and black people.

563
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:27,390
One pretty big shortcoming of that is you can't get the cultural context in effect.

564
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:34,200
For example, for me, for, for example, my family, no, we actually came from overseas to America.

565
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:38,820
So when you're kind of lumping, you know, Eritrean Americans, for instance, with U.S. born Americans,

566
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:42,840
those who have been here for generations, you're kind of losing that cultural context.

567
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,899
So I think there's a clear public health relevance to this topic.

568
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,870
So go ahead and get started talking about the background.

569
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:55,290
So literature has consistently shown that foreign born black people have better health outcomes compared to U.S. born black people.

570
01:08:55,940 --> 01:09:02,250
This is also pretty consistent across racial groups. So immigrants living in the U.S. live longer than us permanent people.

571
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:08,760
And it's also important to recognize this is also self-report measures. It's not just, you know, clinical diagnoses and those sort of things.

572
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:16,530
People who are foreign born tend to rate their their mental health and physical health as much higher than that of their U.S. born counterparts.

573
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:20,280
And then children of immigrants are healthier across a range of outcomes as well.

574
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:29,790
An interesting point about this is both children who are born overseas and those that are children of immigrants who are born here,

575
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:34,380
they also have higher self-report measures.

576
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:40,709
So immigrants live longer than those that stayed in their country, which to me is just such a that's so interesting.

577
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:43,560
So what are the main hypotheses for this? Is healthy migrant hypothesis.

578
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:49,500
Those that leave their country are, I guess, systematically different than those that end up staying.

579
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:55,710
They're able to financially leave, they're healthier. So those who stayed in the country might just be more sick, they're not able to leave.

580
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:58,170
So that might be a possible reason why they're healthier.

581
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,730
A lot of literature on this is actually very interesting as well because a lot of them talk about

582
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:07,379
people who leave their countries are almost by definition more ambitious than those that stay,

583
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:13,200
which kind of sounds a bit dodgy at times. But a lot of the reason that they mention that is they're less risk averse.

584
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:23,130
I'm a more entrepreneurial. I really hate saying that word. I think a lot of those things could possibly have beneficial impacts on their health.

585
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:27,810
There's something known, a salmon bias effect, which I think is kind of a funny name, to be honest.

586
01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:34,769
But it's the idea that those who migrate to the US, who stay here for a while, they end up or it's not that they end up,

587
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:38,069
but they possibly go back to their home country if they notice that they're getting older

588
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:41,190
and age or they might have some kind of diagnosis so they know they're going to pass away.

589
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:43,530
They want to do it back at home in their home country,

590
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:50,940
which could affect which could be possibly a reason why when you look at mortality rates, those that stay in the US.

591
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:59,120
Sorry. Those that are who come to the U.S. have better health outcomes than those that have ended up staying.

592
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,719
So. And then a lot of researchers think that there's just a lot of bad data roaming around.

593
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:09,870
A lot of the data on this topic is census data. They don't think that using census data for mental health outcomes as well as, you know,

594
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:16,490
cardiovascular risk of Alzheimer's disease and those sort of things are good in terms of interpretability and those sort of things.

595
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:18,950
But another hypothesis is culture.

596
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:24,560
So culture is hypothesized to play a very key role in foreign born immigrants living longer and having better health outcomes,

597
01:11:25,070 --> 01:11:32,000
possible explanations on religiousness and close family ties. Interestingly, data doesn't really back those two claims up.

598
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:36,290
It really depends on how you define religiousness. Some surveys are like, Are you religious?

599
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:41,340
Yes or no? You can answer it that way. Some ask much more specific questions.

600
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:43,100
How often do you go to church and those sort of things?

601
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:51,530
A lot of the research does actually show that regular churchgoing does have beneficial aspects to beneficial impacts on one's health.

602
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:56,060
But then there's a lot of research that shows that religion actually is not very good for one's health.

603
01:11:56,060 --> 01:12:02,450
But so and of course, Family Ties is also isn't also fully supported by the data on a lot of the way researchers examine

604
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:07,100
this as they look at high concentrations of ethnic groups in certain areas and they look at,

605
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:11,420
okay, well, since they're very close with one another, like proximity wise,

606
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:18,020
maybe that actually has some beneficial aspects in terms of they can reach out to one another for financial help, they can mentor people.

607
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,590
Something we talked about in last week's discussion as well, the different ways we talk to people for help.

608
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:28,610
David, any policy support that you have, which is quite interesting. So it's not completely clear what role culture plays in terms of mental health.

609
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:36,080
So addressing mental health. No, there's not as much data examining mental health differences between U.S. born and foreign born black people.

610
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:41,540
And what's especially interesting to me is what role do family culture play here?

611
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:44,950
Because it's. It's elusive. Why?

612
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:48,400
If culture does play some kind of role, like how you got role plays.

613
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:52,810
But I think that becomes even more confusing when you think of it in terms of mental health.

614
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:58,630
The first well, I guess I could get to the second point first. Stigma surrounding Mental Health Service.

615
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:04,360
Speaking of mental health services among black people, this is pretty consistent among us born as well as foreign born.

616
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:13,719
So a lot of a lot of the research I found on people who sought out mental health services back in like African countries, it's just a massive taboo.

617
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:18,820
It's a stigma. They don't really talk about it in the household. If you can think about talking about it, it's not good.

618
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:23,330
So there's a lot of stigma surrounding that and then fear of treatment, hospitalization.

619
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:28,540
It's very similar to the previous point. You don't want to be you don't want to seek it out because you might get a diagnosis.

620
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:33,190
Why not take a treatment hospitalized? You don't want that your family to judge you, those sort of things.

621
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:39,160
So for my proposal, what I'll be using is the National Survey of American Life at the NSA,

622
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:43,990
which is a nationally representative sample of the US black population. I believe it's the first and the largest.

623
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:54,370
They use national multi-stage probability sampling methods. They have a sample of about 6200 participants, 3570 are African-American,

624
01:13:55,110 --> 01:14:01,630
a little over 6000 are Caribbean and remaining are not Hispanic white people with I think just about over 1000.

625
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:07,570
They did face to face interviews. Roughly 2.5 hours of the data collection was done about 20 years ago.

626
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:11,800
And then they ask a range of questions, a range of questions, assessing the following.

627
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:16,150
So mental health and the types of questions I ask, there are a lot.

628
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:19,390
I was looking through the codebook and it's a little under 2000 pages.

629
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:23,170
So the types of questions that they ask are they ask.

630
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:27,610
So they ask specific questions about whether they met diagnostic criteria for it,

631
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:36,460
if they believe they have some kind of mental health disorder with depression, anxiety, panic attacks, anorexia nervosa, so long, long range.

632
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:40,870
And then they also ask about self-perception of well-being and then health seeking behavior.

633
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:45,159
So and this one is also very specific and how you decide to define it.

634
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:48,459
So some of them would define it in terms of whether you've got a support group

635
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:52,270
or some kind of substance use disorder or use disorder in the sort of things.

636
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:58,389
Or if you just reach out to someone from your church, like the clergy member or something like that,

637
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:03,190
that's where religion plays an interesting role in this. Or if you've actually been sounds like a mental health professional.

638
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:10,530
So what my proposal aims to do is to examine the differences between foreign born, U.S. born, black people.

639
01:15:11,010 --> 01:15:14,940
So the frequency for each mental health outcome is quite small, unfortunately, because again,

640
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:20,549
I only use in a couple that there are many more cells for each one of the cells for each one quite small.

641
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:24,900
So combining them to me at least seems like the best way to yield higher power and certainty of results.

642
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:28,230
That is a possible limitation to, of course, questions.

643
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:31,680
Assessing reasons for not seeking out mental health measures is also kind of interesting.

644
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:36,330
So the way that they word some of these questions is it's so it's very much like skip logic.

645
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:40,890
If you answer, yes, I have some kind of diagnosis for this. No, I haven't sought out mental health services.

646
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:46,350
Why not? A lot of the questions, a lot of the options are, well, I think it's going to solve it on its own.

647
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:50,760
I don't want you know, there's a stigma aspect. I don't want my family to judge me on those sort of things.

648
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:54,060
So the aims and hypotheses for this topic,

649
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:59,490
for my proposal are understanding the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among foreign born in U.S. born black people,

650
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:06,530
assessing utilization of mental health services, and then also assessing the reasons why they fail.

651
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:10,740
And so some of the hypotheses that I have are pretty consistent with the literature.

652
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:15,720
Foreign born, ongoing people have a lower percentage of people who meet diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders.

653
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:21,990
The utilization of mental services will be less among foreign born black people compared to their U.S. born counterparts.

654
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:28,080
And some of the reasons for that, I think, will likely be from fear of judgment, from family and believing the problem will get better.

655
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,620
Quite so. And I should also mention this is my eyelids hopping.

656
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:37,589
So the way that I've been writing this proposal is I've been writing it as I've been making progress on my list.

657
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:40,720
So one of the main things that I've been looking at now is, okay,

658
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:46,229
I'm going to stratify by age because one of the me I used to work in Alzheimer's research over on North Campus.

659
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:51,930
And one of the main things I was tasked when I got there was kind of reading a lot about the literature on like risk factors,

660
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,700
early detection and diagnosis.

661
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:59,850
A lot of my experience is working with older participants, and that's the area that I'm probably going to look at it the most,

662
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:03,900
because there a lot of the research is mostly on adolescents.

663
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:09,450
The now has an adolescent supplement that I could possibly have, but I believe that's actually restricted.

664
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:13,770
I'm not too sure actually, but likely focus on the elderly population.

665
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,880
Yeah. It was.

666
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:26,670
Thank you for coming. Yes.

667
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:30,620
Is there any information in this, the states that are in.

668
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:35,470
What about health insurance and. How people access.

669
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:42,980
Less expensive, but still wildly expensive. That's a very good question.

670
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:53,560
So from what I've seen in the sale and sale, I do think they do have some questions about access to health coverage of some sort.

671
01:17:53,830 --> 01:17:57,190
I hadn't worked it out. I've been trying like 20 different tags at this point.

672
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:03,219
It's not one that's actually made its way, and that's actually a very good point. But when I think about it, I could definitely play a key role.

673
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:08,170
So that's not something I've looked at. But I definitely know NSA does have information on whether somebody has coverage or not.

674
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:16,450
I'm wondering if any person that you found that relates to racism, for example.

675
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:29,960
I know that use. And the question for all of us to make sure that and how we process races is very different.

676
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:36,940
So you. Immigrants, I think, work again.

677
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:48,220
And so I think the answer to your question, keeping waiting to bring it to someone, being racist to you, because for me,

678
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:53,709
there's something that happens that I didn't realize that was some of the secrets and still wasn't my preparation.

679
01:18:53,710 --> 01:18:59,310
So it doesn't have, in fact, any information on.

680
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:04,210
The difference. Why? For instance, it maybe.

681
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:10,520
Yeah, very good question. So the NSA does have a lot of questions about racism.

682
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:16,910
A lot of them are within the context of work. So whether they felt like they experienced something at work that was racist,

683
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:20,630
if they feel like they're getting increased workload because of their race and those sort of things.

684
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:26,100
Because it's in the context of work, at least within NASA, or at least I found,

685
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:33,120
to be completely honest, it's quite wrong, but I'd be hesitant to add that into my.

686
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:37,380
I definitely think it plays a key role. And to answer your question, whether I would look at it for this proposal.

687
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:43,800
I'm not too sure because initially I wanted to look at how religious belief kind of affected it.

688
01:19:43,810 --> 01:19:48,540
I ended up having to take that out because it just would not make the deck very,

689
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:53,050
very complicated because it's sometimes unclear what effect certain things are having on another.

690
01:19:53,130 --> 01:19:58,680
It's an effect modifier to mediate and all sorts of things. But I definitely think yeah, I agree with that for sure.

691
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:06,340
Yeah. Yeah, I just want. Over.

692
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:20,170
And they say, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

693
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:25,430
What's. 100.

694
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:33,350
They involved? Okay.

695
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:40,330
You know, I could definitely look into that. I was looking at h r us for a class earlier on this semester, so I took a good look at it at one point.

696
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:46,840
Um, on the website. Thank you for that. Yeah. I don't like, I don't know how many foreign born what happened there.

697
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:52,070
You know that's the. Yeah. Oh, he's.

698
01:20:54,140 --> 01:21:04,740
But I want to ask. At least in.

699
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:11,960
Know. You need to be that.

700
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:18,150
I want to see how. So even like you said, it had to do with the fact that.

701
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:25,840
Hmm. I'm just wondering what they somehow account for that.

702
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:36,610
Yes, good question. So I did briefly mentioned I didn't talk about it too much that I can even speak from my anecdotal evidence.

703
01:21:36,610 --> 01:21:40,239
I'm Eritrean, a lot of Eritrean culture. If you even think about talking about mental health in your families,

704
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:46,510
it's a massive no go on how I would actually incorporate that into my research proposal.

705
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:50,979
So the way that the one thing with a lot of the questions and I say the way that they

706
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:56,920
look at culture or the way that I would maybe study culture in the context of NSA,

707
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:01,239
I was looking at questions to ask about whether you so I don't mean to health services and a lot of the options

708
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:06,250
ask about oh I haven't because of you know family those sort of things I don't want to I think I can just,

709
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:14,739
you know, persevere on it, figure itself out, which is very much at least in areas I don't want to talk to, you know, four of 54 African countries.

710
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:19,940
But it's very much a lot of African countries kind of look at like, oh, you can just dig in deep.

711
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:24,280
You sort itself out sort of thing without addressing the underlying issues.

712
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:33,520
So that's an interesting question that I don't know how I would exactly incorporate that to this topic because.

713
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:40,110
Yeah, that's a great question. I actually don't know how I would approach that. I have to think about that.

714
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:48,360
Sorry to answer it. Very poorly, to be honest. Well, one thing that's nice about these data is that people aren't just self-reporting.

715
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:52,070
So they're actually doing these diagnostic interviews.

716
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:59,350
So you may not be consciously aware that you have a psychiatric disorder, but you're answering these questions.

717
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:05,880
And so that's one way to get around that idea of like, you have to have awareness of this is something.

718
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:39,990
Oh, no. Just up and down.

719
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:44,270
Okay. So.

720
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,060
Oh, okay. Hi, everyone.

721
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:58,830
So my topic is the affect of family socioeconomic status as high as our childhood obesity and the rotation row of dietary behaviors in China.

722
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:06,420
Yes, suffering country. So we know that obesity is a common health problems faced by the whole world.

723
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:12,149
So the most recent report on nutrition and chronic disease status of the Chinese versus 2000

724
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:17,760
target showed that more than half of the Chinese adult residents are overweight or obese.

725
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:28,230
So the prevalence rates of overweight and obese were 11.7% and 6.8%, respectively, among children, adolescents in China.

726
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:32,790
And the prevalence continues to increase. So we see that in the graph above.

727
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:43,410
It's actually from the same report, but it says that for children 6 to 17, the rate of overweight and obesity have reached 19%.

728
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:47,460
And for those under six, it's 10.4%.

729
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:50,970
And the graph on the bottom shows that for us, obesity.

730
01:24:51,330 --> 01:25:02,459
It predicted that till today, the uncertainty for children under six is predicted to have 7.3% in boys and 4.4% in girls,

731
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:09,450
which is a total of 6% and about 6.64 million people.

732
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:20,309
So this is especially the case in children because due to their dietary structures and lifestyle like heavy school work,

733
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:29,010
burden and popularization of electronic products and unbalanced nutrition and sufficient physical activities.

734
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:34,440
So if the growth trend of overweight and obesity in children is not effectively curbed,

735
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:40,350
it will greatly affect the health levels of the younger generations and will significantly

736
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:45,870
increase the risk of premature occurrence of chronic disease such as hypertension,

737
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:50,010
diabetes and the coronary heart disease in adulthood.

738
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:56,219
So another aspect of the effect of is that because of the rapid economic growth in

739
01:25:56,220 --> 01:26:02,340
China has led to the migration of a large number of rural populations to urban areas.

740
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:13,230
So in general, migrants tends to be less educated and have lower incomes also because there are two main types of kin gardens.

741
01:26:13,530 --> 01:26:17,190
So most kin gardens are province funded public kindergartens.

742
01:26:17,430 --> 01:26:25,830
So they are managed by local governments and mainly from tax and have strict resident admission policies.

743
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:30,910
So the other one is the private can garden, which owned by individuals or social organizations.

744
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:35,310
And those are funded mainly comes from like the tuition fees.

745
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:42,930
So children from migrant families tend to attend the private kindergartens rather than the province funded kindergartens.

746
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:51,210
So this provides an opportunity to reach out to children from like a diverse background to assess the obesity patterns.

747
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:57,389
So depending on the most recent 2020, oh, the most is filled.

748
01:26:57,390 --> 01:27:02,520
And then you do know, okay, list of the GDP of major cities in China.

749
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:06,230
The four cities I pick is Shanghai, Wuhan, Hubei.

750
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:10,930
And that's only the top ten area. Okay.

751
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:14,910
And for my aims and hypotheses.

752
01:27:15,450 --> 01:27:19,020
So regarding of the causes of childhood obesity.

753
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:23,190
Studies have shown that the best predictor is of yes.

754
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:29,250
And then we ask these as has affected children's dietary qualities as static behaviors.

755
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:33,690
So preschool age, which is approximately 2 to 6 years old,

756
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:44,400
that kindergarten in China has shown to be a crucial period for developing healthy eating behaviors and preventing the development of obesity.

757
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:56,500
So my hypothesis is that the directory of behaviors not only have a direct effect, obviously, but also a matter between as yes.

758
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:01,020
And obesity in children. So a recap of my claims, my aims.

759
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:08,190
The first step provide estimations of the prevalence of obesity and overweight

760
01:28:08,190 --> 01:28:12,200
among the four different cities effect of kindergarten children in China.

761
01:28:12,210 --> 01:28:17,790
And the second is to assess multiple variables that directly affect childhood obesity.

762
01:28:18,030 --> 01:28:24,480
And the third is to compare data from the two kinds of different cane gardens in the four different cities.

763
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:35,020
And the first is to explore the mediating role of dietary behaviors, to provide a scientific basis for like to prevent.

764
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:38,760
Wait interventions in early childhood.

765
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:49,290
So for my study design, I tend to do a questionnaire to investigate the parents of kindergarten children by a cluster sampling.

766
01:28:49,530 --> 01:28:55,320
According to the four different cities of choice, a random cluster sampling of six kindergartens,

767
01:28:55,500 --> 01:29:01,220
three private and three public cities, and targeted children of age seven.

768
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:11,250
And I would exclude secondary obesity, diabetes, obesity with neurological, psychological or drug included classes.

769
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:18,540
And also because there we do have annual routine physical measures of children already.

770
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:25,320
So I think this data is available and the questionnaire is for parents to fill in.

771
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:35,549
So it will include, as these variables like our general demographic characteristics such as gender and age and basic family information,

772
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:46,980
including parents jobs, education level, family income and also detailed demographic information is the checkbox for single parent families.

773
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:48,900
Household Number.

774
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:57,360
If you are living with grandparents, which is very important, and medical insurance and the children's lifestyle and eating behaviors as well.

775
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:01,890
So for the determination of overweight and obesity in children,

776
01:30:01,890 --> 01:30:12,090
I'll use the BMI score based on the sex age children growth curve, which is provided by the old child growth standards 2007.

777
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:16,620
And also the self-reported height of weight of parents will be obtained.

778
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:19,800
I used to calculate their other parental BMI as well.

779
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:26,009
So for the eating behavior, the preschool, any behavior scale would be used.

780
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:40,530
And just go has a total of 38 items and seven dimensions of which three dimensions of picky eating, bad eating habits and response to satiety.

781
01:30:41,190 --> 01:30:47,610
What you see there are food avoidance, behavior and all other for our food or rented behaviors.

782
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:56,370
So the number of item in each dimension is 5 to 7 and the response scale adopts the five point scale of like never,

783
01:30:56,370 --> 01:31:00,720
rarely, sometimes, almost always, basically.

784
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:05,940
And the higher the scale, the more serious the problem of the eating behavior.

785
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:12,750
So if we were able to get the data out, there's lots of tests that we can do.

786
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:14,129
So firstly,

787
01:31:14,130 --> 01:31:23,730
the characteristics of the participants and the prevalence of overweight and obesity will be described using the descriptive analysis and then the

788
01:31:23,730 --> 01:31:31,980
prevalence will be compared according to socio demographic factors using bivariate

789
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:36,809
analysis and also the relationship between the children and both parents.

790
01:31:36,810 --> 01:31:43,350
BMI will be examined using Pearson's correlation and adjusting for children's age and sex.

791
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:54,210
Current BMI and education level are household per capita income, and the kindergarten has a random effect general generalized and then their mix.

792
01:31:54,220 --> 01:32:01,770
The model will be used to compare the likelihood of overweight and obesity among children in private kindergarten versus the public in gardens.

793
01:32:02,010 --> 01:32:05,729
So for each age group as well as for micro groups or non micro groups,

794
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:12,630
we can also describe the prevalence of obesity and overweight by category of per annual income.

795
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:14,850
So also last but not least,

796
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:25,950
we can conduct sensitivity analysis by employing the Chinese National Reference Band to in place of the showed child growth.

797
01:32:25,950 --> 01:32:38,160
Then and then we can also do a bootstrap analysis of the meditation of a material effect of children's dietary behaviors and children's childhood,

798
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:42,120
overweight and obesity. So finally.

799
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:46,290
Well, my attention to limitations. Yeah.

800
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:52,350
So this study has all the limitations of the general cross-sectional study because the data are

801
01:32:52,350 --> 01:32:58,290
collected at the same time period and may affect the mitigation effect and the bias parameters.

802
01:32:58,770 --> 01:33:07,530
So an alternative approach might be to conduct the same study every few years or perform a series of follow up studies.

803
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:13,830
Another limitation I have is that dietary intake data are connected by self-report.

804
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:17,820
So as a result, recall bias is inevitable.

805
01:33:18,210 --> 01:33:24,570
But another approach is to recommend parents to record after a meal and come up with a general value to report.

806
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:27,059
Oh, so timeline.

807
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:35,020
So for the first of all, this is basically just developing and finalizing the questionnaire, making revisions and contacting the sex it can go.

808
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:42,280
And the fourth for the second was to make sure everyone understood the procedure of collecting data like check by double input.

809
01:33:42,730 --> 01:33:49,870
And the third month is to start data collection and collect baseline questionnaire harassment.

810
01:33:49,870 --> 01:34:00,520
And thus for this to collect data well, adjust methods and and for the fifth month we are finally finished collecting data and of all.

811
01:34:05,290 --> 01:34:08,860
We still have two questions. Yes, we have plenty of time for questions.

812
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:14,890
You're not okay. That's a lot.

813
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:26,030
Could you please explain more like how you measure?

814
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:30,790
Orientation for. Okay.

815
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:37,540
It's going more. Are you talking about the eating behavior?

816
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:41,500
Right. Like this part. So this is.

817
01:34:45,710 --> 01:34:50,870
A five point scale that's developed by Chinese scientists,

818
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:58,760
that there are 38 items in seven dimensions and three is for avoidance, very heavy, or that means you don't like fried food.

819
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:02,530
And the other four is that you eat too much. Okay.

820
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:12,890
Yeah. And, and, and those two are like the actual they combine to be the, the basic dietary behaviors of for children.

821
01:35:13,070 --> 01:35:16,820
And that's my meeting. Yeah. Variable.

822
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:20,300
So they're like this questions about parents.

823
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:24,510
Yeah. With their kids, their kid brother.

824
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:30,260
Right. I was going to ask about that five point scale to.

825
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:33,450
So that includes the food avoidance and food orientation. Yeah.

826
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:47,200
Yeah. But if you.

827
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:59,330
Did you know there? So that's.

828
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:08,040
Yes, I would. But it's very difficult to wait this.

829
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:12,509
I actually I pick my own hotel.

830
01:36:12,510 --> 01:36:16,170
I'm from Wuhan, and I know that Shanghai people eat very differently.

831
01:36:17,310 --> 01:36:21,180
They eat like they eat scenes with too much sugar.

832
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:25,410
Yeah, but yeah, that's like. I would consider that.

833
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:42,330
I have one for you. So can you explain again the difference between public and private kindergarten?

834
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:49,740
I think you said that migrants to these cities tend to be lower scores than people who were born there,

835
01:36:50,130 --> 01:36:55,230
and that they're more their kids are more likely to go to private kindergartens.

836
01:36:55,320 --> 01:37:01,950
Is that right, or did I get that mixed up? Well, actually, this is part of it actually depends on the city.

837
01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:08,700
Mostly province funded kindergartens have a more strict residence admission

838
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:16,590
policies where you can go to a if you're not in the area that's mostly white.

839
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:29,720
So sometimes so migrants to the area may not be there or like with permission or something that allows them to select on their certificate.

840
01:37:29,730 --> 01:37:33,280
They're from another state, but they are working here. So there is.

841
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:40,920
Oh, I see. Okay. And so they can they if you move to a new city and you live there and you work there,

842
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:47,190
can you petition to become a resident of the new city or it takes a while or something like that?

843
01:37:47,190 --> 01:37:50,300
It takes a while. I think so. But you can eventually. Okay.

844
01:37:50,310 --> 01:37:56,190
And are the private kindergartens expensive? Like, is is it expensive tuition to go to these?

845
01:37:56,410 --> 01:38:00,450
Yes. Like, yeah, but like not super.

846
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:05,190
Like expensive. Yes. But more expensive than going to the province.

847
01:38:05,190 --> 01:38:10,110
Funded ones that you don't pay for at all. Or do you pay?

848
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:14,520
Yeah, there's a fee for that. Yeah. Okay. There's a fee for any of them.

849
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:18,300
There's a different fee. Okay. And just one other question.

850
01:38:18,510 --> 01:38:23,309
So that the children of migrants in these areas,

851
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:29,370
like are there different percentages of children who attend kindergarten or do all children attend kindergarten?

852
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:33,870
I schooling. Oh. Oh. Okay. Okay.

853
01:38:34,740 --> 01:38:38,340
Yeah. I don't know. Anyway. Okay. It's a trend like.

854
01:38:38,670 --> 01:38:41,340
Yeah. In the U.S. you don't have to attend kindergarten.

855
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:46,290
Most states you have to start in first grade and you definitely don't have to attend preschool.

856
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:49,499
And there's no like I'm doing for kindergarten or so.

857
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:52,860
Like, elementary school is also like selected or no that's required.

858
01:38:53,070 --> 01:38:58,950
Okay. And it probably depends on the state, too, whether five year old kindergarten is required or not.

859
01:38:59,010 --> 01:39:04,590
Like there are some states where you don't have to attend kindergarten, but the state does provide it.

860
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:08,040
Anyway, so I was just curious how it was, how it was different.

861
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:11,150
I don't think it's like you have to attend like everyone school.

862
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:14,489
You just you just do. It's the oh, I'm sorry.

863
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:18,210
I don't know how to turn it off, so. Okay. I knew I was going to do that.

864
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:27,000
All right. On that note. Thank you.

865
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:34,320
So I don't know.

866
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,850
Hello, sharks, which is something I'm sure that any slobs can,

867
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:11,549
even while I'm going to be talking today about understanding the effects of social stigma and support on the

868
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:16,590
relationship between post-partum depression and infant growth and development outcomes among adolescent.

869
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:23,680
So the postpartum period is a really vulnerable time for new parents in a lot of ways.

870
01:40:23,950 --> 01:40:27,910
I'm sure we can appreciate that many aspects of their lives change essentially overnight.

871
01:40:28,210 --> 01:40:33,100
And they also have, of course, the tremendous responsibility of care of a newborn, often with very little sleep.

872
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:41,500
In addition to this burden parents face specifically physiological changes so fast significant hormonal shifts,

873
01:40:42,070 --> 01:40:45,490
feeling from delivery and challenges associated with breastfeeding.

874
01:40:46,090 --> 01:40:53,799
So all that considered, perhaps unsurprisingly, postpartum depression is very common in particularly and it disproportionately affects.

875
01:40:53,800 --> 01:41:00,280
Adolescent. Parents have estimated that rates 2 to 3 times greater than among adult parents.

876
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:05,650
So despite evidence for this vast disparity between adolescent and adult parents,

877
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:11,170
postpartum depression among adolescents is really not well characterized or understood in the literature.

878
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:18,220
And because of that, gold standards for prevention, assessment and treatment, specifically for adolescent populations are not established.

879
01:41:21,140 --> 01:41:27,560
So there's an existing body of evidence that documents the effects of post-partum depression on infant growth and development outcomes.

880
01:41:28,010 --> 01:41:35,750
And these primarily include cognitive and emotional developmental delays, as well as delayed achievement of physical growth milestones.

881
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:42,320
However, there is not a robust understanding of the exact mechanisms by which these two outcomes are related,

882
01:41:42,890 --> 01:41:51,530
particularly unlike a wider array of child development outcomes, so things like neuro motor development, language development, etc.

883
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:59,870
Additionally, some of the literature regarding the ways specifically to physical development is sparse and has recently been called into question.

884
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:07,530
Adolescent pregnancy and parenting are heavily stigmatized in the United States, which, again,

885
01:42:07,530 --> 01:42:13,259
I'm sure we can appreciate as there is evidence to the pervasiveness of the stigma in a lot of media,

886
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:20,490
in popular culture, but also in channels like educational, medical, public health, literature, policies, curricula.

887
01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:25,950
To me, the most basic illustration of this stigma is in the framing of teen pregnancy itself,

888
01:42:26,130 --> 01:42:30,750
where it's nearly ubiquitously viewed as both a moral problem and a health issue.

889
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:37,890
Even despite evidence that for some populations, early fertility patterning may actually be protective against adverse outcomes.

890
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:46,590
When asked at teen, parents often talk about schools and hospitals or doctor's offices as places where they experience stigmatizing interactions,

891
01:42:47,250 --> 01:42:55,080
which I think we can recognize to some clear barriers to educational achievement and healthcare.

892
01:42:57,090 --> 01:43:00,120
So there's also stigma associated with postpartum depression.

893
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:05,850
So this really spoke to stigma around mental illness broadly and social and cultural beliefs that

894
01:43:06,330 --> 01:43:10,350
the birth of a child should be like a purely exclusively happy and joyful time in one's life.

895
01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:18,180
This creates like a double bind, I guess, for adolescent parents in which expressing any feelings of postpartum depression,

896
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:26,010
even in search of support, may intensify as it may intensify existing stigmatizing beliefs that adolescent parents are somehow inherently unfair.

897
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:34,740
So all of that considered the specific aims of this proposed research are to understand how community medical and educational stigma,

898
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:37,649
which I'll break down a bit later, as well as social support,

899
01:43:37,650 --> 01:43:45,059
are associated with postpartum depression in adolescent parents and to characterize how race, socioeconomic status, LGBTQ status,

900
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:51,130
gender and age impacts the frequency and intensity of reported stigma related to adolescent pregnancy and parenting.

901
01:43:51,870 --> 01:43:55,649
And to understand the association between postpartum depression and adolescent parents and

902
01:43:55,650 --> 01:43:58,950
infant growth and development outcomes in the first 18 months of life for their children.

903
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:07,149
So just kind of a broad overview of some of the the research, design and methods.

904
01:44:07,150 --> 01:44:13,120
So this research will use a community engaged prospective observational cohort study design.

905
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:18,430
So we'll observe a cohort of around 100 to 150 young people over a period of five years.

906
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:22,389
And it will be used they will be collected using mixed methods.

907
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:28,209
So includes surveys, biomedical metrics, focus groups and interviews at both measures,

908
01:44:28,210 --> 01:44:32,380
and results will be validated with input from community members.

909
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:40,000
So this is my conceptual model, which I made more changes to last night and welcome emails around,

910
01:44:41,380 --> 01:44:45,400
but basically it illustrates the basic tenants of my proposed research.

911
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:51,130
So the primary relationship of interest is sigma and infant growth and development in the first 18 months of life,

912
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:55,660
which I hypothesize takes place through postpartum depression,

913
01:44:57,250 --> 01:45:02,800
social support, I hypothesize to have the potential to attenuate the relationships between stigma

914
01:45:03,150 --> 01:45:06,460
and depression and postpartum depression and infant growth and development.

915
01:45:07,180 --> 01:45:13,930
And then finally, some moderating factors include age, LGBTQ status, gender, race, socioeconomic status,

916
01:45:13,930 --> 01:45:20,650
which I believe will impact the frequency and intensity of stigma, which will then impact the relationship of.

917
01:45:20,850 --> 01:45:24,970
Directors. Okay.

918
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:30,620
So basic eligibility and recruitment eligible participants will be between the ages of 12 and 17 years,

919
01:45:30,620 --> 01:45:33,920
primarily reside within the Detroit, Michigan metro area.

920
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:37,220
Another form of recruitment will be between 4 to 6 months pregnant.

921
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,760
A recruitment will take place through targeted advertising and social media,

922
01:45:41,270 --> 01:45:45,260
as well as in-person recruitment at high school and will be guided by specific.

923
01:45:47,310 --> 01:45:51,930
Okay. There's a lot of data collection going on. I will show you a figure and just buckle up.

924
01:45:53,190 --> 01:46:00,300
So data collection will include self-administered surveys taken through Qualtrics to assess some of those moderating factors they talked about.

925
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:07,140
They'll also be used to assess postpartum depression symptoms, social support and stigma in a more quantitative way.

926
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:11,580
And then there's going to be a series of focus groups and semi-structured interviews which will

927
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:16,680
be conducted in order to qualitatively assess the lived experience of adolescent parents,

928
01:46:16,890 --> 01:46:21,570
particularly as it relates to stigma and social support. In particular,

929
01:46:21,570 --> 01:46:25,559
focus group and interview discussions will seek to elucidate the ways in which

930
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:29,910
support and social stigma are affected by postpartum depression and vice versa,

931
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:34,170
as well as social identity and others perceptions of what social identity is.

932
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:43,620
So survey focus group and interview questions will evaluate experiences of stigma by youth in medical spaces,

933
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:50,910
so treatment by providers stigmatizing or otherwise inappropriate medical information or literature.

934
01:46:51,210 --> 01:46:59,580
So educational spaces that includes discriminatory policy is treatment by teachers as stigmatizing sex ed curricula and in their community.

935
01:46:59,590 --> 01:47:07,980
So things like family and friends and neighbors. So experiences of stigma will be evaluated both at face value and by frequency and intensity.

936
01:47:09,150 --> 01:47:16,290
And then finally, the infant growth and development measures will be assessed at baseline and at 18 months through medical record review.

937
01:47:17,490 --> 01:47:20,630
So I want to talk a little bit about the steering committee that I'm proposing.

938
01:47:20,670 --> 01:47:26,910
So questions for the surveys, focus group interviews will be developed in partnership with the help of a steering committee,

939
01:47:27,450 --> 01:47:33,330
which will consist of 7 to 10 young people. And the eligibility requirements for the study but have otherwise diverse backgrounds.

940
01:47:33,790 --> 01:47:40,710
And they'll meet quarterly, depending on the phase of the study. And they will provide valuable in context and perspective to the research team.

941
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:45,480
Okay. So hopefully this makes the data collection makes more sense.

942
01:47:46,530 --> 01:47:51,209
So in year one will primarily focus on establishing the steering committee and

943
01:47:51,210 --> 01:47:55,820
building community trust and relationships and then recruitment advocacy work.

944
01:47:55,830 --> 01:47:58,440
And we start the rounds of data collection.

945
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:09,220
So once during pregnancy and then once in early postpartum and then in, we'll also collect the infant baseline measures once they're obviously born.

946
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:16,920
And then in years four and five, we'll do a final round data collection, the infant growth and development once again at 18 months of age.

947
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:24,210
And then we will engage in data analysis with steering committee validation and interpretation.

948
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:28,799
So we'll then disseminate findings both for scientific journals and back to the community

949
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:34,500
itself and provide support for a steering committee led interest in the campaign.

950
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:40,800
This is intended mostly to provide value to participants and to further sustain those relationships.

951
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:52,530
And then quickly some limitations and alternative strategies. So one limitation is related to the participatory approach being taken by this research,

952
01:48:52,530 --> 01:48:57,060
particularly as it relates to generalizability and some bias concerns.

953
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:05,370
However, in considering this, we have decided that accuracy and ethical considerations outweigh this risk.

954
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:11,340
And specifically because we're talking about stigma and adolescent pregnancy is so stigmatized.

955
01:49:11,970 --> 01:49:21,390
It's important to me that in-group members are able to interpret information for us as siders, and we hypothesize that the use of less stigmatizing,

956
01:49:21,390 --> 01:49:27,630
more culturally appropriate questions will help to reduce social desirability bias in their respondents.

957
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:33,060
Another potential limitation or concern is related to anonymity and confidentiality,

958
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:38,430
especially as there are steering committee members helping us interpret qualitative data.

959
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:45,990
So more addresses through like human subjects protection, so explicit disclosures and consent forms,

960
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:50,700
and then obtaining not only consent from parents but also from the adolescents themselves.

961
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:57,030
Even if that's I can think of the term, but whatever the equivalent of my MRU is for an individual,

962
01:49:58,590 --> 01:50:06,000
the identifying data whenever possible, and having specific extensive confidentiality procedures in place for steering committee members.

963
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:18,110
Okay. Good timing. Thank you. Yeah.

964
01:50:21,050 --> 01:50:27,680
Especially. And I was wondering, is there a currency?

965
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:40,880
Yes, that's a really good question. There are some organizations that focus specifically on providing like support for adolescent parents.

966
01:50:42,380 --> 01:50:46,390
I don't I couldn't find any that like specifically are interested in like stigma.

967
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:54,559
Some of them do that as like not their primary intention, but that's like sometimes they offer like some programing or interventions related to that.

968
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:59,360
So we'll be exploring a partnership with like established organizations.

969
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:04,550
But that's a really important thing to consider. Makes it a lot easier for sure.

970
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:10,970
Yeah. So the age range that you're looking for in was 12 to 17, right?

971
01:51:11,030 --> 01:51:16,780
Yeah. Do you feel like the stigma is going to look a bit different for a 12 year old versus the 17 year old?

972
01:51:16,990 --> 01:51:25,090
Stigma. So rather than assumptions, I feel like most people, if they looked at a 12 year old, the assumption wouldn't go to morality first.

973
01:51:25,090 --> 01:51:30,669
I think it would be like more of a sympathy kind of line versus someone who looks more like Michael Moore to a morality judgment.

974
01:51:30,670 --> 01:51:33,340
So how do you know you're going to control for age?

975
01:51:33,430 --> 01:51:38,650
In your model you put in there, but I mean, in the focus groups just talking about that, yeah, I think it's going to be different.

976
01:51:38,660 --> 01:51:43,870
So how do you think that you can account for that? Yeah, that's a really good question and definitely something that I considered.

977
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:52,390
I would expect that some of the other, like social identity components, will impact even what stigma around age will look like.

978
01:51:52,510 --> 01:52:00,240
I think that forgiving your adolescence like will be one thing that will probably impact how their experience of stigma.

979
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:02,130
Right? So it's a really good question.

980
01:52:02,140 --> 01:52:09,690
I think that is something that I'm hoping to be able to pass a little bit more with some of quantitative measures like focus groups and interviews.

981
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:15,950
I don't know exactly what that looks like yet. I feel like participatory research is hard because I feel like you pass the buck lot,

982
01:52:16,030 --> 01:52:19,269
like it seems like you're passing the buck a lot like during the planning stages with like,

983
01:52:19,270 --> 01:52:22,350
look, determine that in conjunction with community members.

984
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:26,360
I think that's something that like yeah and that.

985
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:31,760
But yes, that is an interesting thing to consider and will have to be intentional about how we approach it.

986
01:52:33,290 --> 01:52:46,940
Yeah. You have.

987
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:55,270
Would you have? And not just. But like said.

988
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:04,419
Yeah. So that's something that we'll have to account for, particularly when working with minors.

989
01:53:04,420 --> 01:53:07,780
There's like mandated reporting, things that you have to keep in mind.

990
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:13,540
So there will be procedures in place for doing like hand-offs specifically to services for.

991
01:53:14,290 --> 01:53:19,870
Yeah. Concerns like that. That's a that's a really good question. Where did you get the offered illustration?

992
01:53:21,730 --> 01:53:35,170
I did not make them. I downloaded them from my friends site and then made people bigger, a smaller system that was designed for their.

993
01:53:42,730 --> 01:53:47,950
Yes. You may have said this and I missed it, but for your stigma questions,

994
01:53:47,950 --> 01:53:53,650
are you planning to use existing measures or are you going to create your own based on what you learned in your focus groups?

995
01:53:53,830 --> 01:54:03,370
That's a good question. I think the plan at this point is to develop them collaboratively from scratch with community input.

996
01:54:04,930 --> 01:54:10,120
But that's something that I might explore a little bit more in terms of maybe doing like a combined effort.

997
01:54:10,180 --> 01:54:14,680
In your literature review, did you find existing skills like are there people who measure?

998
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:23,979
Because I assume that you're you're trying to measure the stigma associated with Teen Parenthood specifically.

999
01:54:23,980 --> 01:54:26,940
And you said like in the school context, the health care setting context,

1000
01:54:26,950 --> 01:54:34,360
are there any existing measures that were like perfectly appropriate for this population and like specifically what I wanted to explore?

1001
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:38,440
But there are like stigma measures that I think could potentially be adopted.

1002
01:54:38,470 --> 01:54:42,580
Yeah. Yeah. I just have to be more.

1003
01:54:48,470 --> 01:55:15,690
Thank you. But there.

1004
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:38,220
All right. Hey, everybody. My name's Sasha. My project and the title of my presentation today is going to be about assessing the

1005
01:55:38,220 --> 01:55:44,790
association between Youth Mental Health and cigar use in 2021 by race and family affluence.

1006
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:51,270
So this is kind of what I'm going to go over today, a little bit of background about smoking,

1007
01:55:51,510 --> 01:55:59,040
cigar use and just kind of cigars in general, a bit of background about COBRA and mental health and my existing studies currently.

1008
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:12,540
So a bit about my research design specifically going into variables in the data set and that methods what the current plan is and then my timeline.

1009
01:56:13,410 --> 01:56:18,910
So this is what I'm doing for my Illy project. So the methods part is kind of still in progress.

1010
01:56:18,910 --> 01:56:22,470
So I wrote what I have at the moment, but it's a work in progress.

1011
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:26,820
All right. So a bit of background on cigar use and health outcomes.

1012
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:36,210
So smoking is detrimental for your health. Any sort of tobacco use can cause cancer, lung disease, heart disease, stroke, COPD.

1013
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:44,970
I have a few statistics here as well. In 2020, around 12 and a half percent of U.S. adults were current cigaret smokers.

1014
01:56:45,870 --> 01:56:53,370
About two and a half million youth, which includes middle and high school students, use at least one type of tobacco product regularly.

1015
01:56:53,790 --> 01:56:58,410
And as of 2023 and a half percent of all adults smoke cigars.

1016
01:56:59,630 --> 01:57:01,500
And then for cigars and cigarillos.

1017
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:08,399
non-Hispanic black adults were more likely than their non-Hispanic white counterparts to smoke cigars in the past 30 days.

1018
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:17,340
So kind of a mishmash of data on cigars and cigarets and then talking about cigars a bit more specifically.

1019
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:25,830
And when it comes to cigars research, we mostly look kind of at three different categories.

1020
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:31,110
They're traditional cigars, which is what most people think of, which are kind of like the bigger,

1021
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:37,440
thicker ones that are a bit longer that people kind of use, really celebrating things that's traditional.

1022
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:42,570
There's also cigarillos and little cigars as well as filtered cigars.

1023
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:46,410
And those last two come in kind of a variety of sizes.

1024
01:57:46,650 --> 01:57:53,430
And there's also a lot of little cigars and filtered cigars that are basically the size of a cigaret,

1025
01:57:54,120 --> 01:58:01,560
which is kind of like part of the problem that we see with or part of like a reason I think that we're seeing this increased cigar use.

1026
01:58:03,030 --> 01:58:07,410
But anyway, those are the types in terms of measuring a cigar use.

1027
01:58:08,370 --> 01:58:16,680
The most popular method for this is kind of quantifying how often cigars have been used in the past 30 days.

1028
01:58:16,980 --> 01:58:24,570
And there's kind of like not really a cigar per year method that exists.

1029
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:29,340
There is a cigaret pack year, which is when you multiply intensity by duration,

1030
01:58:30,030 --> 01:58:34,950
but it's a little trickier to do with cigars because they don't come in standard packs.

1031
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:40,200
There's a bunch of different types, different nicotine amounts and different types of cigars.

1032
01:58:40,860 --> 01:58:45,900
But the research group that I'm currently working with is in the process of making a cigar packet variable,

1033
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:50,129
which is pretty cool, but I won't be using that for my ileum.

1034
01:58:50,130 --> 01:58:53,490
So that's us. And then Cigars versus Cigarets.

1035
01:58:54,360 --> 01:59:02,759
There is kind of some misconception that cigars are a safer alternative to Cigarets, which could be true,

1036
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:10,379
but it kind of depends on inhalation patterns cigarets are generally used or how they're supposed to be used I guess,

1037
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:16,650
or are used is people inhale them and like inhale the smoke after it sits in their mouths.

1038
01:59:17,220 --> 01:59:23,129
But for cigars, what you're supposed to do with them is inhale the smoke, keep it in your mouth, and then exhale.

1039
01:59:23,130 --> 01:59:30,080
But a lot of people who kind of do use or switch from like cigarets to cigars or like don't know what they're doing.

1040
01:59:30,090 --> 01:59:33,600
The cigars will just inhale that cigar smoke,

1041
01:59:34,410 --> 01:59:43,469
which can be as detrimental as cigaret use or even more detrimental which is concerning second part of the background,

1042
01:59:43,470 --> 01:59:46,710
which is more of like a context part.

1043
01:59:46,830 --> 01:59:51,690
I don't think actually the slide for this, but I'm doing this in the context of COVID.

1044
01:59:51,780 --> 02:00:01,739
So I'm getting data from you from 2021 because my exposure is mental health and COVID significantly impacted mental health of youth,

1045
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:04,680
especially when looking at middle school and high school students.

1046
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:09,630
Obviously they go from being in school and like socializing with people to kind of being cooped up at home,

1047
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:18,450
dealing with the global pandemic, like all this stuff happening. So that is why I chose 2021 and kind of the background of COVID.

1048
02:00:20,100 --> 02:00:25,589
So what do existing studies show and kind of this slide?

1049
02:00:25,590 --> 02:00:31,460
It will kind of illustrate where I found my. Which is what this project is trying to fill.

1050
02:00:32,060 --> 02:00:38,389
So cigar use is rising and youth in general, cigar use is also rising disproportionately.

1051
02:00:38,390 --> 02:00:47,420
And non-Hispanic black youth. Flavored cigars are increasing in popularity despite policies and different bands that

1052
02:00:47,420 --> 02:00:53,660
are kind of like either in place or like trying to be put in place by policymakers.

1053
02:00:54,890 --> 02:01:02,209
So I'm kind of debating whether or not to include flavored cigars or just like flavoring as a variable in my project.

1054
02:01:02,210 --> 02:01:06,200
But that is something that's popular in research currently.

1055
02:01:06,950 --> 02:01:13,429
Specifically like menthol flavoring and things like that. Um, so moving on and studies looking at adults,

1056
02:01:13,430 --> 02:01:20,990
there is an association between low income and increased tobacco use in households that have an income under $20,000.

1057
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:30,110
There's 32.2% tobacco use, and then households with income greater than 100,000, there's less.

1058
02:01:30,110 --> 02:01:39,770
There's about 12.1% tobacco use. It's kind of tricky to find, um, this sort of association in literature with just cigar use.

1059
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:47,209
There's a lot of focus on cigarets and e-cigarettes, so cigars are still kind of like being worked on.

1060
02:01:47,210 --> 02:01:55,040
So there's a little gap with that as well. And there have been plenty of studies that have shown an association between mental health and tobacco use.

1061
02:01:56,120 --> 02:02:05,870
But then there aren't many studies on kind of the combined, um, combination of affluence and youth and cigar use.

1062
02:02:06,860 --> 02:02:15,350
So. All right. So for my research design, I'm using and my team, which is the National Youth Tobacco Survey,

1063
02:02:16,070 --> 02:02:22,520
it's a survey of about 100 and 5060 questions that middle schoolers and high school students fill out.

1064
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:32,780
I think I'm planning on focusing on just eighth grade and 11th grade students, and these are the variables that I'm looking at specifically.

1065
02:02:33,470 --> 02:02:41,780
So for quantifying mental health and my exposure, we're using p h Q4, which is a patient health questionnaire.

1066
02:02:42,050 --> 02:02:47,960
There's four questions and I have a slide on that later. Cigar use is obviously going to be the outcome.

1067
02:02:48,650 --> 02:02:51,410
I think I'm going to be using past 30 day smoking.

1068
02:02:52,110 --> 02:03:00,410
The question that they have on the survey for this is during the past 30 days on how many days did you smoke cigars, cigarillos or little cigars?

1069
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:04,130
And then my mediators are going to be race and family affluence.

1070
02:03:07,630 --> 02:03:16,460
So this is the patient health questionnaire. This is kind of like a standardized way to measure mental health in adults and youth as well.

1071
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:21,280
So there's four questions and people answer them on a scale of 0 to 3.

1072
02:03:21,940 --> 02:03:27,460
So for anyone who can't see the questions over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by the following problems?

1073
02:03:27,820 --> 02:03:33,639
And then the problems are feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge, not being able to stop or control,

1074
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:39,130
worrying, feeling down, depressed or hopeless, or having little interest or pleasure in doing things.

1075
02:03:39,940 --> 02:03:44,980
So they answer the questions, and your total score is going to be the sum of all four of these.

1076
02:03:45,790 --> 02:03:51,130
For adults, like a normal mental health is considered a score of 0 to 2.

1077
02:03:52,090 --> 02:03:57,489
Mild mental health like detriment I guess is like 3 to 5.

1078
02:03:57,490 --> 02:04:01,990
Moderate is 6 to 8 and severe is 9 to 12. And so for my project,

1079
02:04:01,990 --> 02:04:07,750
we are also debating kind of splitting this into like a binary exposure because the first two

1080
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:13,720
questions are what they use to kind of measure anxiety and like the next two are for depression.

1081
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:21,220
So we're kind of debating splitting it up into looking at associations with anxiety and depression like separately.

1082
02:04:22,240 --> 02:04:28,390
So for affluence and other just interesting variable that I wanted to touch on since this is a survey for youth,

1083
02:04:29,050 --> 02:04:32,740
they don't really have a question that's like, how much do your parents make or what is your family income?

1084
02:04:32,950 --> 02:04:37,930
So this is kind of what questions they have that are related to affluence that we're going to use.

1085
02:04:38,710 --> 02:04:42,130
The questions are, does your family own a vehicle? Do you have your own bedroom?

1086
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:48,910
How many computers does your family own? And during the past 12 months, how many times did you travel on vacation with your family?

1087
02:04:49,900 --> 02:04:54,700
So we're kind of making up how we want to kind of split up this affluence,

1088
02:04:54,700 --> 02:05:01,740
and we're thinking we're going to just make it binary as well because it'll be a bit easier for me to do, like coding and all that with that.

1089
02:05:01,990 --> 02:05:09,970
So we're thinking high affluence, affluence and kind of combining these four questions into those two categories.

1090
02:05:11,810 --> 02:05:14,840
So her methods. This is what I have so far.

1091
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:22,790
I'm going to be using the data which is going to be a riot. My mentor told me We're going to be doing modified thoughts on regression.

1092
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:28,700
I think TV did good stuff and this is my timeline.

1093
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:36,860
So in November, my kind of plan was to finish the introduction, outline that with my mentor yesterday he okayed it.

1094
02:05:36,860 --> 02:05:42,620
So don't good about that in December the plan is to finish the draft of my introduction based on set

1095
02:05:42,620 --> 02:05:48,020
outline and then create an analytic plan to hopefully answer some of those gaps that I mentioned just now.

1096
02:05:48,980 --> 02:05:52,969
And then the plan for February is to complete the data analysis with data,

1097
02:05:52,970 --> 02:05:58,640
hopefully before spring break and then in March, finish the paper, submit it for Iley and hopefully for publication.

1098
02:05:59,510 --> 02:06:13,480
That's all I have for you guys. Yeah.

1099
02:06:20,580 --> 02:06:25,630
I'm just wondering what. I can pull them out.

1100
02:06:27,610 --> 02:06:46,820
I have a giant review. I particularly question my life left out of if anyone does have my questions.

1101
02:06:51,830 --> 02:06:57,120
What makes. It's kind of a good question.

1102
02:06:57,960 --> 02:07:04,080
It's kind of like based on how they make them. I'm not actually totally sure the difference between little cigars and cigarillos,

1103
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:10,200
but they're like similar enough that they're clumped together and like all the studies in cigarets or cigars.

1104
02:07:10,710 --> 02:07:20,340
But that is a good question. But it's normally like the three categories that I mentioned, so it's like traditional is one.

1105
02:07:20,340 --> 02:07:24,210
Then those two are kind of clumped into one, and then the filtered cigars are just another one.

1106
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:28,440
And yeah, so I'm looking this up. I have it somewhere.

1107
02:07:30,980 --> 02:07:35,580
Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, it definitely exists.

1108
02:07:35,580 --> 02:07:46,230
But yeah. The question. Yes. Cigaret and cigars.

1109
02:07:48,100 --> 02:07:56,440
The. So that's a really good question.

1110
02:07:56,450 --> 02:08:01,879
The survey has basically like a vigil, different questions on what students are smoking.

1111
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:06,530
So their separate questions aren't if they smoke e-cigarettes and if they vape.

1112
02:08:06,530 --> 02:08:09,550
And there's questions on if they're dual users.

1113
02:08:09,740 --> 02:08:14,360
So I'm probably going to be using that dual using question to kind of try to separate out.

1114
02:08:15,500 --> 02:08:17,750
So cigar users and dual users.

1115
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:26,000
But that's another thing my mentor and I were discussing because there is a lot of work mostly on adults and like poly tobacco use.

1116
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:30,409
So he's like, we're kind of debating how we're going to frame that.

1117
02:08:30,410 --> 02:08:31,700
So that's a good question.

1118
02:08:32,300 --> 02:08:42,740
But the survey does include questions on like e-cigs and everything, and e-cigarette research with youth is like really popular.

1119
02:08:43,430 --> 02:08:46,700
So I was trying to not touch e-cigs or bass at all.

1120
02:08:46,700 --> 02:09:04,520
I was like, This is going to be my little niche for this. So. What are gender differences in cigar use?

1121
02:09:04,540 --> 02:09:10,690
Is that something where there's a big difference? And if so, how will you be thinking about gender in your.

1122
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:17,500
That's a good question. It's definitely a bigger problem for me.

1123
02:09:17,530 --> 02:09:23,680
Not a bigger problem, I guess, but more males and females use them in adults and in youth.

1124
02:09:24,460 --> 02:09:29,620
We weren't really going to include that in our model, like we were just going to look at youth in general.

1125
02:09:31,390 --> 02:09:37,600
I suppose we could look at something like restrooms and say, Yeah, you should always think about it as a confounder.

1126
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:41,410
If like so your exposure is the mental health, right?

1127
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:49,690
And so you can think about gender like kind of an arrow going into both your exposure and your outlook for gender.

1128
02:09:49,690 --> 02:10:00,700
So you might want to control for that. And then I was curious about how you're looking, how you're using race and family affluence in your models.

1129
02:10:00,700 --> 02:10:05,409
Are you looking at interactions with mental health or you're controlling for these?

1130
02:10:05,410 --> 02:10:08,950
How are you feeling? It'll be it'll be an interaction.

1131
02:10:09,250 --> 02:10:14,260
Okay. So we'll look at like mental health. Yeah, I have it pulled up.

1132
02:10:14,260 --> 02:10:16,990
So like as effects modifiers. Yeah, basically.

1133
02:10:17,350 --> 02:10:27,520
So we're going to be looking at and we're going to be multiplying race by exposure, affluence by exposure, and then we'll see if we have the paradigm.

1134
02:10:27,670 --> 02:10:44,760
Yeah. Okay, let's go on. Yeah. All right.

1135
02:10:44,770 --> 02:10:51,760
Great job, everybody. And we stayed on time. I only messed up the timer one time, so that's really great.

1136
02:10:51,780 --> 02:10:58,960
Hopefully I'll be better next time. Good luck with your poster presentations this afternoon if you are epidemiology students.

1137
02:10:58,980 --> 02:11:03,570
I'll be there for the first session, so I'll try to stop by and say hi to you.

1138
02:11:03,580 --> 02:11:08,549
I don't know how crowded it will be and have a good break next week.

1139
02:11:08,550 --> 02:11:15,780
And if you are presenting next time, just make sure before class you upload your presentation to canvas so we can fold them up.

1140
02:11:16,260 --> 02:11:23,130
We'll have two more presentations next time, so we'll have to be a little faster, but we're doing all right.

1141
02:11:23,580 --> 02:11:29,650
All right. Have a good weekend, everybody. Yeah.

1142
02:11:30,080 --> 02:11:30,550
And how?
