1
00:00:09,422 --> 00:00:12,721
After watching this video you will be
able to describe the different types of

2
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,710
missing data.

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,671
So the best thing you can do with missing
data is just avoid having missing data.

4
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:22,044
And although that sounds like obvious,

5
00:00:22,044 --> 00:00:26,592
there are actually ways of minimizing
missing data within data collection.

6
00:00:26,592 --> 00:00:31,462
You can design data collection forms and
procedures to minimize missing data.

7
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:34,683
You can develop careful
methods to help with memory.

8
00:00:34,683 --> 00:00:37,046
You can train your interviewers well.

9
00:00:37,046 --> 00:00:39,538
You can carefully track data collection.

10
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:44,120
And finally,
you can plan to re-contact participants.

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,113
In any case, no matter how careful
you are when collecting your data,

12
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:51,210
there is always missing data.

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,166
So far you just deleted them.

14
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:57,558
This is called complete case analysis,
or complete case scenario, and

15
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:02,220
it's okay under certain circumstances,
as we will see later.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:08,050
Note this method is also called
listwise deletion or casewise deletion.

17
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,298
So the first thing we need to understand
is the nature of missing data.

18
00:01:12,298 --> 00:01:16,641
Since there are three different types,
missing completely at random,

19
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:20,840
missing at random, and
not missing at random.

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,678
So you have missing completely at random
when they probability of missingness does

21
00:01:25,678 --> 00:01:28,925
not depend on the value of
any variable in the analysis,

22
00:01:28,925 --> 00:01:31,470
including the variable itself.

23
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,810
A complete case analysis will
provide unbiased estimates,

24
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,961
because complete cases
are a random sample in this case.

25
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:42,920
But of course, precision will decrease
due to decreased sample size.

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,299
For example, you collected blood
samples to evaluate fasting glucose and

27
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:50,564
a batch of samples got
accidentally lost in the lab, and

28
00:01:50,564 --> 00:01:54,540
this is supposed to be a random accident.

29
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,556
You have missing at random when
the probability of missingness depends on

30
00:01:58,556 --> 00:02:02,700
observed values only,
not on the missing values themselves.

31
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,601
That is, it depends on other covariates,
but not on the variable that has missing.

32
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:10,649
A complete case analysis
will be biased in general.

33
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,508
So a better approaches to
impute the missing data or

34
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,550
weighed the observed records.

35
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,584
For example, in a study with
questions on a subject's age,

36
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:25,093
sex, and smoking, whether someone
skips the questions on smoking

37
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:30,790
does not depend on their smoking status,
but may depend on sex or age.

38
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,008
And finally, we have not missing
at random when they probability of

39
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:38,900
missingness depends on
the missing value itself.

40
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,530
Unfortunately, there is no easy remedy for
this situation.

41
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,870
A quantitative sensitivity analysis may
allow you to assess the potential of bias.

42
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,558
For example, in satisfaction surveys
missing data are usually not at random.

43
00:02:53,558 --> 00:02:59,830
Highly satisfied or highly unsatisfied
people are more likely to respond.

44
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,011
So this is an example that
I want to show you now.

45
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:06,460
This is a poll on flow
from a few years ago.

46
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,832
I ask my students if they were filling
in flow at the end of the semester.

47
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:15,507
And as you can see, most people were in
flow, together with a little anxious.

48
00:03:15,507 --> 00:03:18,960
I guess because the final
exam was approaching.

49
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,992
But there were no really students in
either extreme, either panicking and

50
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:26,000
really struggling or feeling bored today.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,432
However, there were 20 non-respondents.

52
00:03:28,432 --> 00:03:31,289
And since this is like
a satisfaction survey,

53
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:34,980
I cannot assume that
the missing are at random.

54
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,838
So assuming that they
missing are not a random,

55
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:43,090
let's first calculate an overall
score among the non-missing students.

56
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,306
I'm giving 1 point to people
who are really struggling,

57
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:50,480
2 points to people who are a little
anxious, and so on until 5.

58
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,130
My overall score is 2.58,
which is closer to my ideal of 3,

59
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,170
when everybody would be in flow.

60
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,590
Lower values will give me an indication
that there are people anxious and

61
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,464
struggling.

62
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:08,022
Higher values will give me an indication
that there are people too comfortable or

63
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:09,530
even bored.

64
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,417
So now we are going to assume
that the 20 non-respondents,

65
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:15,747
all of them were really struggling.

66
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:20,079
By assuming the worst case scenario
I can calculate my score, and

67
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,271
I know that I cannot do worse
because that's the lowest value.

68
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:26,420
I get now 2.26.

69
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,912
Now I'm going to do the opposite and
assume that the other extreme

70
00:04:30,912 --> 00:04:35,740
scenario is true, that all 20
non-responders are bored to death.

71
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,210
Then I get a score of 3.07.

72
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,257
So your confidence in your data
can be summarized as this.

73
00:04:43,257 --> 00:04:45,986
You got 2.58 from your sample, and

74
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:50,629
you don't know if there is an unbiased
estimate of the true value.

75
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:56,171
But at least you can assume that your true
value lies somewhere between 2.26 and

76
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:56,969
3.07.

77
00:04:56,969 --> 00:05:00,410
This is called sensitivity analysis.

78
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,212
That is, you estimate your best and
worst case scenarios, and

79
00:05:04,212 --> 00:05:07,670
get a sense of how big your bias can be.

80
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,570
In summary, in this video we learned
the different types of missing data.

81
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,269
In the next video we will
continue with missing data

82
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:17,632
by describing the multiple
imputation method.
