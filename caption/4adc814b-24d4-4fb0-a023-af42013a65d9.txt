1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:14,010
Okay. So a quiz is scheduled for the first reminder problem set due to I think I said it for midnight tonight.

2
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:25,379
Okay. That's okay with everyone and hopefully they'll set you up well for the quiz, which is scheduled for Tuesday.

3
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:33,110
But as long as everyone turns in their problems, I feel like I could open up the online version so it's going to do it.

4
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,230
Same as last time online. Give you a window of time.

5
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:44,400
Start and stop time. I could probably open it up as soon as this weekend if people want the extra window.

6
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,750
If they have other tests going on, it's like that. You don't have to.

7
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,810
And I can set it to end maybe Tuesday at midnight Creative Room later in the week.

8
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,910
Well, I have some other stuff planned because like on Thursday, I want everyone to bring in their page.

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,090
She just likes very short answers to their their chosen topics.

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,350
So I give you that list of 20 questions. I just want kind of that you've thought about it.

11
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:16,320
You don't need like detailed answers. But the reason being, I put you in groups to talk to each other about it.

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,630
So you probably got a Wednesday,

13
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:26,430
but I wouldn't want to go past Wednesday for the quiz because I do want people to think about this a little bit before class on Thursday.

14
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:39,460
So with that said, also because it is an in-class exercise, hopefully everyone can be in here on the 10th, which is next Thursday.

15
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:47,370
It's active. I know it's been very lecture heavy, so we'll take a break from that.

16
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,899
So again, just quick answers that you thought about those 20 questions and then you'll talk amongst yourselves in groups.

17
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,460
I'll put you in groups and then we'll kind of report out. And then after that,

18
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:07,790
hopefully I'll give you some more ideas on how to answer some of the questions and then you'll get another bit of time for the actual critique.

19
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:12,190
Let's do. So that's the assignment.

20
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,110
All right, so it requires a time of a window of time.

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,790
There are a bit more calculations, so I'll probably set it for 2 hours.

22
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,750
That's the baseline. You know, obviously you don't have to take 2 hours.

23
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:32,780
And again, because we've covered a lot of material and be good to kind of be familiar with the notes, too.

24
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:41,060
So you kind of have a sense of where to look for for stuff that you might need to look up just so you have time.

25
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,620
What else can I tell you? So it's some multiple choice.

26
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,790
So true. False, some short answer and then some some problem solving.

27
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,670
Not too many problems. But again, they're going to be kind of in line with what we've done in class or on the problem.

28
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,240
So pay attention to units.

29
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:11,350
I didn't try to too tricky on the units for the quarters, but just make sure you make note of that.

30
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:24,219
What else? You know the questions. Getting to your question, you just say not to worry about it.

31
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,980
Is everything going to be at MTV or is that going to be something in the phone for some?

32
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,810
Oh, unless otherwise stated. Yeah. You can assume MTV.

33
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:44,310
If not every stated in the question itself. Yeah.

34
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:52,650
I don't know if this is really much of a question or just stating my anxiety, but you've already written the quiz, right?

35
00:03:52,860 --> 00:04:00,750
Yes. Okay. Are these would you say these problems are similar to in complexity to the problems?

36
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,710
Because the problem should be simple, simpler than the problems.

37
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,110
The problem is sort of a deep dive. This should be more of a, you know, hopefully more straightforward.

38
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:18,030
Okay. That's why I said pay attention to the units. But, you know, the problem is it does throw on some some units, loops there, things like that.

39
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,680
Yes. Where does the material start? The coverage of the question?

40
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:34,030
Let's see. So I try to make it so it starts when we start with the occupational sort of focus.

41
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:44,520
So the four right here should be and there.

42
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,410
Nothing too in-depth from today. But there are a couple of points.

43
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:54,580
I might even just point out to you that something's relevant to this lecture for that is because this point.

44
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,629
Yeah. Let's see.

45
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,970
What else can I tell you? Yeah. It's quite a bit of material, I understand.

46
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:11,200
So it's a little bit longer period for records and we'll see how it goes.

47
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,590
And over. Here you go. All right.

48
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:27,380
Okay. Well, let me know at the end of class if you have more questions. Yeah.

49
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,040
So say we're just kind of wrapping things up for the occupational.

50
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,359
Unit and kind of thinking about statistical considerations.

51
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,879
So some of this we're going to recap the things we've already addressed and just kind of reiterate how our statistics

52
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:52,080
might play into this word or sort of cross the T's and dot the I's and cross a few concepts related to this.

53
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,319
So first couple of loose ends.

54
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,309
So we kind of went through a fast last time on some of the details.

55
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,170
So I just want to touch on that real quick.

56
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:11,490
Then we'll go into a bit more on sampling strategy messages, things like that, and then how you use statistics in compliance is good to know.

57
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,700
Even though we've talked about, you know, compliance should not be our main goal.

58
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,450
It is an important goal, but we should go out in front of that and and be better than that.

59
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,470
But so compliance is a starting point. One first comment.

60
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,450
So on air changes per hour, it was brought to my attention by one of the students.

61
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,590
Thank you. That had sort of a brain lapse while I was up here talking.

62
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,750
So it was, you know, through volume by your airflow.

63
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,650
And I threw out the time component. So basically there's 60 minutes in an hour is why that matters.

64
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,299
Was it coming on the air changes per hour slide last time.

65
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,300
So it was 200. Was that through volume 20 was the.

66
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:04,010
Air flow. And then just make sure you get that time unit. So again, the units trip me up this time.

67
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,450
So that's just a quick note there. All right.

68
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:18,950
So just want to touch base on this again. So I went through this very quickly way back when we are I think it was actually last unit.

69
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,500
So it's good that I'm reiterating this.

70
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:29,530
When we talked about occupational health standards, we went into some detail about the topic and I went kind of quickly through this part.

71
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:38,710
So mixtures is a big deal because when not a lot of times exposed to just one thing at a time, we might be exposed to multiple things.

72
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:45,640
We study this in the environment in my epidemiology studies, but it's also been for much longer period of time.

73
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:51,520
It's been thought about in occupational because you might have an industrial process, you have multiple things going on,

74
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:57,370
multiple solvents, different solvents, other chemicals for other things at the same time.

75
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:06,310
So when you thinking about this with regards to the TLB, you want to first think about are the health effects expected of these various chemicals?

76
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,600
Expect to be the same, kind of the same. We're going to see systems that are impacted.

77
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,640
Are they going to be different? And then if they're the same, are they going to have independent effects?

78
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:22,090
So there'll be different forms, additive effects of the same system or organ.

79
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:30,550
Or is there somehow expected to be synergistic effects where the sum is greater or the whole is greater than the sum of the parts?

80
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:38,630
And there's some select examples of that in history that we've we've observed.

81
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:45,410
So the first way to do this is if there's additive effects.

82
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,670
So again, having a similar toxic effect or a similar target organ.

83
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,170
You just do a mixtures analysis in the TLB.

84
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:02,870
So it's just simply taking the fraction of the be of the first chemical plus the fraction of the TLB of the second or the third.

85
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:11,750
So on in some of those. And if that's some of those fractions is greater than one, then based on additive mixtures, you'd be above the top.

86
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:19,880
If that is less than one, then you're still going to tell the even when considering additive effects of multiple chemicals.

87
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,270
And this can be done for either a long term,

88
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:31,280
a time weighted average or time weighted average or short term exposure limit as t0 or even the ceiling one of.

89
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:46,250
Yep. That is different from concentration of the chemicals, closer damage on the body and from the same without different results and same mechanisms.

90
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,210
And so that's where it's a bit of a. So that's a bit of an art form there.

91
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:56,780
So no, because we're talking about the TV they're going to point you to, you know, what are the health effects listed for?

92
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:03,769
It'll be for the various chemicals. And if there's overlap, then you might want to assume that they're completely different,

93
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,650
like ones along in ones, you know, just dermal or something, you know,

94
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,420
then you might be able to do it independent, but, you know, erring on the side of being protective,

95
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:19,160
I'm going to tell you, you know, when in doubt, treat it as that at least, and be safer.

96
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:25,430
We haven't got these here just yet, but we're going to be a more safe approximation of go through synergistic and

97
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,739
just assume them working on the same mechanism of being the same target tissue. Synergistic.

98
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,110
Then we would have to be more of an additive in this case.

99
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:38,870
So that's, you know, multiplicative and there's not a ton of good data out there on a lot of those.

100
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,589
But yeah, I mean and then what is that relationship is hard to model as well.

101
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,650
So that gets a little bit trickier. But but yeah.

102
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,240
So you want to limit exposure as much as you can. That's the bottom line here from my perspective.

103
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,440
So at least if if it's a doubt, at least assume additive most,

104
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:01,070
it's very clear that they're completely different things of metabolism in the same set for 50 isoform.

105
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:07,219
Yeah so you'd want to assume maybe at least additive they're synergistic make it tricky because they don't even give you guidance

106
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:13,790
on how to do that with regards to it'll be you know D multiply it they don't even say so you know that might take some.

107
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:19,040
Extension on the experts part to do that.

108
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,740
But so that they do, they're very clear about the effects doing it this way.

109
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:34,340
And then for independent effects, again, if you can assume that the effects are completely separate, then you just do independent.

110
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:40,660
So there's a ratio of one variable less than one, and that's completely separate.

111
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:45,460
Then it's a core statement that's second chemical over its job.

112
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:53,900
So you just look at them all separately. And if no individual chemical is above its individual, tell me then you're well, you're in compliance there,

113
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:58,640
but if any one of them are greater than that, then you focus on that one chemical.

114
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,140
But again, that's a bit of an art form to determine whether it's independent or additive.

115
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,230
And then to your question on synergistic it can take different forms and.

116
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:20,140
Like I said, you could do kind of a user to find what you think is most appropriate to account for the multiplicative blur or something.

117
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:27,590
But, you know, in any event, you're going to want to really reduce both of those exploring it as much as you can and hopefully even account for it.

118
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:35,920
If you were to multiply them and still people at the top, but they don't have a specific method for doing.

119
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,250
Some examples carbon to ethanol, liver, liver toxicity.

120
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:52,450
And you'll notice that the two best examples we have are kind of more of one chemical exposure at work and one kind of lifestyle situation,

121
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:57,459
you know, drinking alcohol and carbon tetrachloride or smoking cigarets and asbestos.

122
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:02,380
Both of those in human studies have been shown to have more than additive synergistic effects.

123
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,570
So that's something to watch out for. The other is confusion.

124
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:14,290
I think I covered this last time we talked about it, you know, where it might not be a toxin of that work itself,

125
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:18,160
but it might increase the toxicity of another chemical at that site.

126
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:25,060
So there's a couple of examples there as well. So again, additive, independent or synergistic?

127
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:31,480
They're very clear on how to do the additive independent, but not sort of the synergistic.

128
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:39,370
And so like if like I said, this is where you kind of have to use a judgment as far as whether they're similar outcomes or not.

129
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:47,200
So something like cholinesterase inhibition, I might, you know, something that's CNS, I might say that's close enough.

130
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,780
It's both nervous system and go ahead and assume at least additive for those.

131
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,050
So for example, here, this is straight out of a book.

132
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,830
So let's say a worker's airborne exposure to solvents was monitored for a full shift.

133
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:09,110
And when one short term shift, the results are here.

134
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:17,860
So you'd look at what you have and you do this separately because you have basically two different elements, right?

135
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,020
You have a short term and a time weighted average heat hour.

136
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:30,200
So just eyeballing it, you can see if we assume independent effects, they're all individually below.

137
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:38,630
However, because these are all solvents, we might assume they all have some sort of CNS or related nervous system impacts.

138
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,410
So we're going to assume that activity in this case groups.

139
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,580
And they also in this. They also irritate the respiratory system.

140
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,720
If you look at these specific ones. So we're going to go ahead and consider this.

141
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,650
So on the color shift, it's a simple equation.

142
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:08,580
Just take those ratios 80 over to 50 plus two or 24 over 200 and you should get 0.87, which again is below one.

143
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:16,200
So technically your full shift is not exceeded. Of course, we'll talk about that more as this lecture goes on.

144
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,760
But by the book that's below, we take those short term samples.

145
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:30,210
Over here, again, individually, they all go there. Tell me why when you compare them all for their short term exposure limit.

146
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:37,890
Those ratios add up to 1.53. So on the short term, you're going to be exceeding the TLT.

147
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,030
So that would be something you would want to definitely address.

148
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:48,740
Now, again, if for me and I have something that's point 87 or 87% of the time, you were going to do something about that as well.

149
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,320
But this is the 1.5 is definitely. Urgent.

150
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,990
Any questions on that? So you might see a basic one like this on the quiz, just to let you know.

151
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,730
I'm not going to assume synergy. Synergy, you know that.

152
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:12,550
I get some interesting answers, probably. Since nobody knows how to do that.

153
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,839
For the other one, I think we touched on very briefly before was unusual for schedules.

154
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,280
And this one gets kind of,

155
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:28,459
I think back in the day that some of these discussions got kind of heated because a lot of work schedules go over the 8 hours,

156
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:37,340
40 hours per week and you'd have the perspective of the workers might be way different than the perspective of the employer on how that should happen.

157
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:46,190
Right. So people who, you know, want there to be more work and maybe less exposure controls,

158
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:57,170
they want to count for as much body repair metabolism as possible to make it so the body can withstand longer and longer exposure times.

159
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:04,110
So that's where some of these different approaches come in. So the pharmacokinetic model might be used by people that really know.

160
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:10,549
They want to show that longer shifts are not going to require lower and lower exposure

161
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:16,550
levels versus some of these other ones that it's a little bit more straightforward,

162
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,480
mathematically, potentially, and potentially more protective.

163
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,440
So we don't really have time to go in depth on these at this point.

164
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:36,230
But, you know, there are ways to account for longer work schedules, but there's not always consistency on how people do it.

165
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,360
And again, depending on which perspective you have, there might be different ways to calculate it.

166
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:52,320
Some of them are as simple as taking the ratio of how much over that you are and then basically lowering the wheel by that much.

167
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:58,740
Others, like I said, are going to build in some some repair mechanisms and metabolism to it,

168
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,810
to say that the body can withstand more than that just simple friction.

169
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,520
Okay. So back to statistics now and you get a simple again on the quiz.

170
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:21,559
It's a simple approach for that. So we talked about, you know, negatively skewed, positively skewed normal distribution.

171
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:30,830
And this is one week late, but very normal distribution that that Twitter kind of has before you onboarded.

172
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:41,030
All right. So going back to the first part of this unit, when we talked about managing occupational exposures,

173
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,349
we had our our system here that we talked about, again, trying to go above and beyond compliance.

174
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:53,360
But compliance is a starting point. And one of these flowchart points was our exposure assessment.

175
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,730
And we've really been focused in on this for the last few weeks, this exposure assessment piece,

176
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:07,430
which within that you have these different steps workplace information,

177
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:15,950
workforce information agent or chemical information that we establish are similar exposure groups that we talked about briefly.

178
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,940
And then for each of those, you define your exposure profile for each of those groups.

179
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:25,370
And that's using a lot of the approaches we've been talking about, you know, the technical sampling component of this.

180
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:33,460
And then you compare that profile with the. Appropriate occupational exposure.

181
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:41,980
And you see that we try to build in some accommodation for uncertainty there as well and then you make some sort of decision.

182
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:46,150
Is it acceptable exposure, unacceptable or.

183
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:54,820
A lot of times it's not super clear. And you kind of reiterate and, you know, do some of these steps over again to get a better, better view.

184
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:03,400
So that exposure, similar exposure groups is a concept that's meant to save time and money.

185
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,110
So you don't have to go out and try to sample every worker, every shift.

186
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,460
You're trying to get some sort of representation where you can group people together.

187
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,670
See, you have to have a subset of those measured.

188
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:22,510
You can extrapolate that information to the broader population. So this is what we've been talking about.

189
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:28,240
So certainly with the acceptable exposure, a lot of times we're talking about some sort of established exposure limit.

190
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,590
And then we have to define how do we want to be in relation to that defined criteria if it's the exposure limit?

191
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:42,850
Or does our organization have a goal of being less than half of it to be less than one term?

192
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:48,790
A lot of companies will do that. They'll take it to a more protective level.

193
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:56,530
And making some of these decisions does involve some statistics, the sampling strategy itself.

194
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:03,400
You know how long you want to sample for. You know which groups?

195
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:09,840
How do you define the groups? How do you describe their exposure profiles in the groups and how many samples do you collect?

196
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:15,240
Those are all statistical related issues that we talk about and quality control as well.

197
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:23,420
You see a lot of statistical concepts there. They're samples.

198
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:29,600
How long you sample for? How many? I mean, you collect again some statistics.

199
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:37,080
Statistical confidence in your decision making is always good. So obviously you want to know how to do that.

200
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:48,750
And then your exposure controls statistics can also come in handy there if you want to show that you're significantly reducing that exposure.

201
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:54,510
You might do some tests. Statistically to show that reduction in exposure.

202
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:02,920
So lots of ways. Basically, this is just to illustrate. There's a lot of ways in which statistics can help you out here.

203
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:10,630
So this is a slide I showed before, earlier in the semester. So here we have the concept of similarly exposed groups.

204
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,940
And this can be done, observationally or statistically in how we define these groups.

205
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,100
A lot of times it's it's a combination of those where you kind of do the

206
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:26,050
observational and then you try to validate it with some measurements and statistics.

207
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,810
So again, this is where we saw these general profiles were wanting to look like they're the same.

208
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,920
They do the same job.

209
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:40,330
Potentially, we're going to put them in there as maybe this person is doing a different job or they do the job in a different way.

210
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:46,390
Something about this makes their profile different, so they're in a different situation.

211
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:56,570
So again, are used quite a lot when you have a lot of employees that might be exposed.

212
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:05,290
So you want them to be similar enough that monitoring of the exposures randomly within that group provides useful data for the entire group again.

213
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,860
So you don't have to go back and measure every one of those groups of that group.

214
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:17,690
We know what percentage of them and what percent of days we need to sample to get a good view of what that exposure potential is.

215
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:26,690
Because if you think about, you know, you have hundreds of employees doing various things in each of those tasks.

216
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:30,680
You have dozens or maybe even hundreds within those. And this is.

217
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:35,430
Advantageous to do it this way if you want to do it appropriately.

218
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:44,810
So again, observationally, they might be grouped, you know, just on first cut based on what they do.

219
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:51,080
But as we've seen different tasks or different ways of doing things, there are different shifts.

220
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:59,510
There's a lot of reasons why that may not be the best way to want to follow that up with some television.

221
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:09,720
So to derive this. There's been a lot of work statistically on this issue.

222
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,950
Again, because people are doing this and if they're only sitting there,

223
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:23,600
sags observationally and not validating them and if they got them wrong, that can really lead to some incorrect conclusions, right?

224
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:29,140
If you're not accounting for the variability within that ACG you might be coming up with.

225
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:40,910
Decisions. So this is kind of probably too much from a book, but it's just showing basically five people within this CG.

226
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:46,110
Just to show that even within a similarly exposed group, every person might have their own exposure profile.

227
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:52,260
And it's talking about, you know, if they happened to randomly within that ACG sample person one,

228
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:59,820
they'd only have a 0.1% chance of exceeding that we'll based on that sample result.

229
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:07,390
Whereas if they randomly get selected person number five, that probability would be much higher at 20% chance.

230
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:13,290
So again, you'd like to see that as a little bit more compact on the distribution.

231
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:19,680
But exposure is can be kind of unpredictable and it's inherently variable.

232
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,790
And so this one's showing each person's average exposure.

233
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:33,610
If you randomly selected one and their average with that probability would be if you grouped them all together, it's a 2% chance.

234
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:42,719
But again, you might be underestimating this person. They might not be properly designated in an ACG because they might be overexposed,

235
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,990
but because you want them in with this group, then they weren't the one sample.

236
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:53,460
They might not be identified as such. So hopefully it's kind of confusing like that, but hopefully that concept makes sense.

237
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:00,070
So just as an example of how people have tried to get a grasp on this.

238
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:05,680
So you should have seen how much Steve Rappaport materials in the class to.

239
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,490
So that was the adviser of Professor Zellers who used to teach this.

240
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,850
He had like three or four lectures on this, on this type of stuff.

241
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:17,410
So I boil it down to a couple of slides for you. You're welcome.

242
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:26,230
So he did a lot of good work, though, on sort of the statistical aspects of occupational health, occupational exposure, science monitoring.

243
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:35,890
He did come up with this this metric, the R 95, where it's kind of complicated to say, but it's the ratio.

244
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:40,090
So you have a mean exposure for each person within an ACG.

245
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,330
And that spread between the lowest and the highest accounting for some outliers.

246
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:55,420
That's why it's 95%. That ratio is is a significant signifier of how tight that distribution is between people

247
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,410
versus if you have a lot of variability between people in their exposure profiles,

248
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:07,840
that ratio is going to be much higher. So they through some trial and error and some empirical work in actual fuel sampling,

249
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:13,299
the they thought they came up with the value to that ratio of two they thought was a

250
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,920
pretty good threshold of determining whether the ACG was properly grouped or not.

251
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:26,480
So. But then they went to an industry and did a big broad study of, you know, observationally to find us.

252
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:34,710
Took a bunch of samples and then compared exposure profiles within each of those subjects and came up with

253
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:42,149
some observations that a lot of times some exposed groups are not very similarly exposed at all and again,

254
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:46,260
can result in some very. Poor decision making.

255
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:57,900
So then you might have to also rely on similar types of statistics to, to statistically your period to your workers as to observationally.

256
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,440
So this is just a figure from one of these papers.

257
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:11,069
On the left, you have different workers, their distribution of exposures and the overall mean and you see some variability.

258
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:17,640
But that ratio within the 95% of the high and low is 1.8.

259
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,790
So it's it's pretty good. You know, they look fairly similar.

260
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,060
You go over here, you have a ton of really low ones. You have the sort of medium one and then you have the super high one.

261
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:31,739
So this one had a ratio of 25, which is well above two.

262
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:39,720
And so this one is thought of as not a good grouping of these different individual workers because the variable is too high.

263
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:48,690
So if you happen to sample this person, you're going to make conclusions that are not going to be very relevant to these folks and vice versa.

264
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:55,820
Sample this person. This person might be way overexposed because we're not going to do anything about that exposure if you think they're all low.

265
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:05,220
And then, you know, they did the testing on a whole bunch of different industries and towns and they plotted it.

266
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:15,940
It's kind of hard to interpret, but basically these are this is plotting that 95 ratio for a bunch of different settings.

267
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:26,490
And they found that only a very small percent, about 20% of those sieges fall under that ratio, too, whereas 80% were above two.

268
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:32,580
And even, you know, 20% were greater than 50, which is a very high ratio.

269
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:42,569
So that's all to say that observationally derived messages really should be tested and validated

270
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,740
before making conclusions for group based on randomly selected people within that group.

271
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:53,890
That makes sense. All right. We got new questions on our 95.

272
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,450
So you're welcome. All right. So how many samples collect?

273
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:06,370
So another application of statistics here. And when we go out and sample power calculations, you guys done this in statistics or anything?

274
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:17,709
Epidemiology. Some people may have seen this before, but this is just a basic example of a sample size calculation based on your alpha.

275
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:25,510
So that's like your your p value and your beta power and that's going to calculate how many

276
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:31,090
samples you want to take for a given difference between groups or some user defined metric.

277
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,799
If your effect size is larger that you're looking for,

278
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:41,410
obviously you need less samples because you don't need to differentiate between very close numbers.

279
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:51,970
If you're effect size you're looking for is very small. You're going to need a much larger number of samples for the field industrial hygiene setting.

280
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,500
They do have a rule of thumb. And if you go ask people in the field, you know what, how many samples you need,

281
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:05,360
quite a lot of people are going to say 6 to 10 just because they heard it somewhere and they're not going to know they didn't do the calculations.

282
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:11,620
It's just sort of the the word on the street. But just know that that is a true rule of thumb.

283
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:18,550
And that's what I mean. That's like why? But it assumes that those similarly exposed groups are properly identified and grouped.

284
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:24,069
And then also just know that if you're taking that few samples,

285
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:30,670
you might be missing some peak exposures or settings where higher exposed may be possible.

286
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:40,030
And thus could be put. This is where the number came from.

287
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:46,300
So the key factor here is a value talking about reducing that variability.

288
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:53,080
And you see you get a diminishing returns based on this basic calculation.

289
00:31:53,830 --> 00:32:01,719
Once you get to 6 to 10, you continue to get better on that key value reducing that that uncertainty.

290
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:11,040
But it's not the gains aren't great. So. You know, given that there's a lot of effort and cost that goes into sample collection,

291
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,880
you know, people are are happy with that and probably think that's too bad.

292
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,170
But that's. This is where the 6 to 10 Wolf comes from.

293
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,750
And that's assuming time weighted average long term shift like.

294
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:33,760
Values. Again, those are going to have a different level of variability than your shorter term samples.

295
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:50,170
If you have shorter term samples, that is going to be based on what the variability is and again, what the effect size is that you're looking for.

296
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,860
So this is an interesting table showing.

297
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:01,970
So this is now 4.5 to the power of 90% where this is your effect size.

298
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:07,480
So it's the mean exposure divided by your PRL or your occupational exposure limit and

299
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,770
then your variability in that distribution based on geometric standard deviation.

300
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:18,450
And this shows that if you have a big difference between your exposure level and the appeal, you don't need that many samples.

301
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:25,810
You know, as the variability goes up, you're going to need more samples, but it's still perhaps manageable to treat about 10% of the appeal.

302
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:34,180
However, if you get up to 75% APL and you know you have quite a bit of variability,

303
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,810
you're up in 300, 400 samples are going have to collect just to come up with a reasonable average.

304
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,330
So that's that's a bit troublesome.

305
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:56,050
So that's good to keep in mind if you have a highly variable exposure, a short term acute concern and you might be close to PR,

306
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:04,719
you know, you might want to look into direct reading approaches, controlling the exposure.

307
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,080
So you're down. So it's a more manageable assessment situation.

308
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:15,250
Or you know, on the flip side, if you're three times higher than the peel and it's only six samples with you.

309
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:22,219
But that's not a good situation either. Okay.

310
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:26,540
So let's sample a number of samples. Quality assurance, quality control.

311
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,060
So this we didn't talk about a whole lot. You get a little bit of it.

312
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:38,930
Do you go through those methods and they report out, you know, your coefficient variability or whatever it might be, but it's very important.

313
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:45,350
So a lot of what's reported to us is based on quality control, statistical concepts,

314
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:51,200
and you should be known actually before you even go out sampling, you want to make sure it's acceptable.

315
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,740
If you don't want to get your results back, you realize, oh, we said, you know, there's aspects of this method.

316
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,160
Aren't going to work for us. But this includes sensitivity, that accuracy.

317
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:09,610
So that should be listed as well as the precision. So the accuracy is going to be how well it does compared to a known amount.

318
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:16,360
The precision is how repeatable that is. If you do it multiple times, does it give you the same answer every, every time?

319
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:23,980
And that sensitivity is related to that detection, which is very important to know how how much to sample.

320
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:32,230
So you're in that range, that measurable range for your method so that to make sure that you get useful data.

321
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:46,210
We talked about Elodie briefly last year, just kind of more on the implications of the how you treat the Elodie and Kathleen average.

322
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:51,370
But again, it's the lowest mass that can confidently be detected above background.

323
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:59,530
And they do this by using repeat measurements of a point sample or something spiked at a very low concentration.

324
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,490
And they actually take that repeatability that that measure of precision or repeatability at that level.

325
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:10,390
And they calculate the standard deviation and they just basically multiply it by three.

326
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:17,460
And that's based on the normal distribution. Three standard deviations gives you 99.9% or whatever.

327
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:21,879
And that's where this Elodie comes from. So it's actually a for QC concept.

328
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,490
It's not necessarily. What they're saying is based on the standard deviation.

329
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:32,300
And that gives you the confidence that it's above just noise.

330
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:42,079
And that's a different concept of quantification. So a lot of times if you're reading papers about exposure, they use these terms interchangeably.

331
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:48,709
But technically, the two different things the quantitation gives you more even more confidence.

332
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:57,300
That's above background. And it's. Just admitting the fact that if you're really close to the detection, your precision is probably poor.

333
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:04,380
So it takes at times term that standard deviation to extend because you might be even more confident that it's it's definitely above.

334
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,790
And this figure is showing kind of what we had talked about before. There's different things you can do with plurality.

335
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,250
Sometimes people throw those values out that's going to overestimate your your average exposure.

336
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,540
Sometimes they put them at zero. That's going to underestimate your average exposure.

337
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:32,040
It will be over to things like that are much more common. Give you some reasonable way to account for as we go through.

338
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:44,220
Questions on. Sensitivity. It's a song.

339
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:49,770
What's this on the quiz? You're supposed to ask that after every slide. Teachers love that.

340
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,180
All right. I don't think that it has, but some concepts related.

341
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,840
Or you might be not calculations, but you have access to the facts.

342
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,510
You'll be okay. Accuracy. So this is a prepared stands of no concentration.

343
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:15,930
So when you send your sample back to left, hopefully they know or they've done the work where they have basically the spike, the same media.

344
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:23,610
So if it's a filter, they've spiked that filter with the same chemical with a known concentration and analyzed it to show that their instrumentation,

345
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:27,840
their methods can give you that concentration that they they know that they spiked.

346
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:32,009
So then when they get your unknown sample, that gives you confidence.

347
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:38,790
And then the value that they report to you as close to the truth on that particular filter.

348
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,240
For this, you also need to know that recovery.

349
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:51,600
So we talked about this with vapors desorption efficiency when you collect the vapor and the sorbent to do the solvent desorption.

350
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,670
Usually it's less than 1% might be, you know, 70% to 55% or something like that.

351
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:01,910
You need to account for that as well as the calibration.

352
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,079
So usually don't do standards at several different concentrations and run them with

353
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:12,000
the batch and the receiver will spike the concentrations or they like to see a nice.

354
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:20,860
The reported correlation coefficient R squared usually point 99 of those calibration standards and

355
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:26,820
that can give you when they take the peak from that instrumentation and related to that calibration.

356
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:33,889
And that gives you the number for that sample. We didn't talk about points.

357
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:40,280
Usually another rule of thumb when doing field sampling is one out of every ten samples you collect, you should do a blank.

358
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:44,570
So you take that out. You. I showed you those cassettes, for example.

359
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,630
It's filter stuff that was caps. You'd want to take the cap off.

360
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:54,980
Maybe not for very long and put it back on. Just you want to treat that sample just like you treated all the other samples.

361
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:59,509
It goes to the same locations. It's shipped the same way, store the same way.

362
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:04,880
Just to make sure nothing in that process is causing contamination in your real samples.

363
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:10,460
So 10% is usually the rule of thumb depending on the situation.

364
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:19,310
And then in the laboratory they hopefully have blanks as well because there could be interference and contamination introduced in the places.

365
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,150
Think already mentioned the like personal care products and stuff that's been here that.

366
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:37,600
I don't know. But, you know, we measure parabens and things in the labs and they've noticed that people will be aware of human stuff.

367
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:46,000
It will see a lot of interference. So you have to make sure people don't work deodorant and stuff in there with certain chemicals.

368
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:54,010
So what goes into some of the stuff with actually they can do control charts to look for drift over time and make sure,

369
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:58,540
you know, if I'm using this method today, is it going to be the same as a batch that comes in two months from now?

370
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:07,450
So over time, they the plot, the blanks and calibration standards just to make sure it's stable at the time.

371
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:13,520
And then ideally you'd also participate in external QC.

372
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:21,940
We've done this with biomarkers. There'll be a consortium for a lot of these organic chemicals with similar to place in Germany that does

373
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:28,960
this report out of the results for the various chemicals to make sure we're within the acceptable range.

374
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:35,550
He questions on accuracy.

375
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:43,680
So obviously, if you're going to go to all the trouble of taking samples, you know, to as much as you can to make sure they're accurate.

376
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:53,200
I mentioned precision. So the big measure here a lot of times reported out in methods for field sampling and things, even for biomarkers.

377
00:41:53,650 --> 00:42:00,340
Kaufman Coefficient variation. So that's your variation over your mean times 100.

378
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:10,660
And that could be for a population or a sample. Another term for it is relatives derivation, which can get confusing.

379
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:18,590
People use those terms interchangeably. And so with your labs, you know, before and after years, never.

380
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:28,600
You want to be familiar with that? Those kids, you know, if they're doing it within a run between batches between.

381
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,420
Days and things like that. So they report these for various aspects of the.

382
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:42,890
Oh. Do that for repeated a known concentration.

383
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,330
Another thing you can do. You know, I talked about blank samples.

384
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:51,350
You know, so that that helps. Um, sometimes people will.

385
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:57,170
Wilson you can sample with no concentration as well to do their own external QC.

386
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:01,670
I'm not sure labs like that, but it can help as long as you know what you're going to do with that information,

387
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:05,899
because you know, there's nothing worse than going to trouble doing that.

388
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:13,549
And you get your results back from a method. You just spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a QC that you don't like.

389
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:22,490
Then what do you do? Um, so that gets us, but usually we like to see a CV of of less than 10%, and that depends on the context.

390
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:26,870
So a lot of these nice methods will see, you know, 10% around there.

391
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,580
Certain types of biomarkers might be greater.

392
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:38,930
Or to a lot of the fancier new homing stuff, it's going to be much greater because they don't have the precision for every do every single things.

393
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:50,450
Okay. So compliance. This goes back to 1977.

394
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,830
It's a classic. So this is nice guidelines from it.

395
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:59,179
You know, 77 is a wash act was 1970.

396
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,770
So it took them well to get up and running.

397
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:09,110
We have all these new standards out by OSHA and they put out this book talking about how we go about sampling and making decisions

398
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:16,670
with regards to the what we find with that sampling from both the perspective of the compliance officer working for OSHA,

399
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:23,110
as well as an employer who's trying to protect their workers. So like I said, it's good to know this stuff.

400
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,410
But again, we kind of want to in modern times, we want to get out in front of this.

401
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:33,450
And what is good is good stuff to know. All right.

402
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:39,600
So here is the original flowchart for what happens.

403
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:45,120
A lot of words here, but it's pretty simple. Pretty intuitive, I think.

404
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,980
So you started there on the left, is the chemical released in the worst place? Workplace error, yes or no?

405
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:57,989
Of course, we know that even if it's not there, there could be other outs. But a lot of the standards are for airborne concentrations.

406
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:06,690
So if yes, we want to do we think that employee may be exposed greater than the action level, which is typically one half the appeal?

407
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:13,530
If no, just know whether there's future changes in the due process in the future planned.

408
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:19,770
And then you want to reassess if you think it might be above the action level, we go and measure those high risk employees.

409
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:26,300
You know what a judgment in here. How do you define high risk? Maximum risk employee.

410
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:32,960
And then this is spitting out the concept of similar expose groups way back in the olden days.

411
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:40,760
And then if you're above the people, obviously you need to there's a whole cascade of things that go on, you know, by the employees.

412
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:47,450
You have to institute controls. You have to re monitor and regulate until you get a little of that actual.

413
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,700
And so there's different things you have to do based on how you are in comparison

414
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:58,290
with the action level and in comparison with the comparison with the peer.

415
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:03,540
Again, this is the the original way they approached it.

416
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:09,690
So, you know, if you're at this stage, I think they still do a lot of this the same way again.

417
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:15,890
You know. With our more modern management managerial approaches.

418
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:25,470
Hopefully it doesn't come to us. So that maximum risk employee, how do you decide who that is?

419
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:33,239
That takes some of the expertise we've been talking. Well, I don't find where the chemicals are in the processes and things that might do that.

420
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,800
And then you collect that airborne exposure from their breathing zone.

421
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:41,970
And that will tell us, you know, if that truly is the maximum exposed person,

422
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:46,320
if they're below the wheel, well below the wheel, that makes us feel better.

423
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:53,850
If they're above the wheel or really close to it, then you got a lot more sampling to do based on some of these principles.

424
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:04,050
You can do random sampling as well, but then you have to just realize that you might be missing if you just pick somebody completely out of the air.

425
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:08,730
They might not it might not be representative of those high risk.

426
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:15,659
So they have statistics for if you do need to do random sampling,

427
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:22,920
how many people do you need to sample in order to assume that you've captured at least somebody in the top ten percentile of exposure?

428
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:31,710
And that's what this competition to table is showing us. So instead of making people do statistics, they show us things like this.

429
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:44,290
So if you have, you know, a small population of ten, 19, you might have to take 9 to 18 samples to make sure you identify that one person,

430
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:49,060
which, you know, if you have ten employees, one person is that 10% of their top ten percentile exposure.

431
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,829
It doesn't get it's not quite as bad once you get to higher numbers based on

432
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:59,230
the statistics and probability of the number of samples you need to identify.

433
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:09,000
Those. That might be enough. So this is again pretty old concept, but I think still used.

434
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:18,290
Four short term exposure level samples. Again, the approach is a little different because of the added variability.

435
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:28,309
And if you're doing a non that's ideal, you know more about the process that you don't have to do a ramp that would save you a lot of time.

436
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:31,940
But again, if there's uncertainty, then you resort to a random sampling.

437
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:39,260
And so they have guidelines on this as well. So short term exposure level, you know, refers to 10 minutes.

438
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:45,140
But if it's, you know, particularly toxic or it could be toxic, you might go to 10 minutes for 5 minutes.

439
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:50,990
So, you know, there's only 30 to 15 minute windows within a eight hour shift.

440
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:55,100
So how many of those do you need to sample this table from?

441
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,610
That original last document tells you, you know, depending on what you want to find,

442
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:04,640
you want to find the top 10% or top 20% and what kind of alpha confidence level.

443
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:11,540
And then it will tell you, you know, ranges from nine samples to 19 out of those 32.

444
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:20,570
Based on what you're trying to detect, it becomes more, of course, once you get into smaller time durations because there's more of them.

445
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:26,840
So statistically, you need to sample more to confidently know that you at least capture one.

446
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:32,990
Again, that's for short term. Questions on that.

447
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:39,280
I don't think that. Be mad that I wasted your time.

448
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:51,910
All right, so. Usually we're dealing with eight hour time weighted average levels for our samples.

449
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:59,710
So that is. How do you do that? How do you approach an eight hour sample you can collect with it compared with APL pill?

450
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:05,530
Again, this is for compliance methods. So there's two perspectives.

451
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:12,010
One is from the employer, one is from the compliance officer. And this is where hypothesis testing, like we learned in your intro stats class.

452
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:19,290
It's two different ways of thinking. So your null hypothesis as the employer is that you have noncompliance.

453
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,770
So you have to assume guilt to prove innocence.

454
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:33,940
So your alternative hypothesis is that you're in compliance from the compliance officers point of view of their knowledge that they're in compliance.

455
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:42,190
They have to prove that they're non-compliant statistically. So that changes sort of that bar of the level of evidence needed.

456
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:50,020
And that relates to, again, your your basic hypothesis testing for statistics and type one and type two error.

457
00:50:55,560 --> 00:51:00,330
So what you do is you simply click that eight hour time would average concentration.

458
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:13,469
You simply divide it by a we'll give you your chi here so that for a fraction of your measured level over that time weighted average we'll see

459
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:22,710
starting point and again this these were devised for the course appeals but you can use the same concept for till these or other things as well.

460
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:33,030
If there is not a good feel for that particular chemical and then with that you add or subtract depending on who you are,

461
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:42,900
if you're the employer or the compliance officer, you either add or subtract 1.64 or five times that coefficient of variation from the method.

462
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:46,250
So that's going to tell you about the variability of that.

463
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:53,220
Basically the confidence you have in that measured level, that is, you know, how much variabilities and errors is.

464
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:57,909
Built in there. So that's from the methods.

465
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:07,510
So, you know, you look at saying that they should have the CBDs of T listed for that relatively narrow distribution.

466
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:17,530
And like I said, it's usually somewhere between five or 15%, which would be 0.05, 4.1 for this component of the equation.

467
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:30,340
And if you recall that 61.645 is from the Z, the normal distribution where if you recall, we talked about this, this is basic statistics.

468
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:37,300
So we want to show you just the one tail at 5%, 95% or 5%.

469
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:42,640
That's where you get that mean plus 1.645 standard deviations.

470
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:51,340
And that's where the focus and variation come. So again, this is just review the once one sided test.

471
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:59,129
Versus two sided, one sided. Because usually in statistics I'll take it mostly to cite it to us,

472
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:02,970
right to the can't really assume directionality, but in this case we have one sided.

473
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,629
Okay. And we talked about the different strategies we get to estimate the time weighted average.

474
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:19,250
You have a single sample serial samples, partial serial samples, and then a bunch of grab samples.

475
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:22,130
So this is general guidance.

476
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:30,260
You can assume a normal distribution for this first three, but if you have to do grab samples and you're taking a bunch of them, you.

477
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:36,120
You go and assume a lot of normal distribution. Okay.

478
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:47,790
So you do this. Um, you took that fraction plus or -0.6, four, five times the coefficient variation, and they show a map like this.

479
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:53,070
So say a noncompliance exposure, they're calculating that lower confidence level.

480
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:57,060
And this is showing that that lower confidence levels above one.

481
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:04,400
So it's deemed non-compliant, whereas this one is a lower confidence level that doesn't go up.

482
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:11,010
It doesn't is below one. So this is kind of a possible overexposure and that's from one perspective.

483
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:24,130
Whose perspective is this, do you think, using the LCL? Employer pertains to noncompliance.

484
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:31,720
Actually, it's flipped. So this is going to be it's harder. It's actually harder for the compliance officer to prove that they're not in compliance.

485
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:35,780
You know, from that perspective, because that's the alternative.

486
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,880
So they basically have to show that that LCL is greater than one,

487
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:45,110
that there's no possibility, statistically not likely, that they're within compliance, that.

488
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:57,020
Whereas here the employer, you know, they can show that they're definitely in compliance at the upper confidence level of this bill.

489
00:54:57,290 --> 00:55:01,820
And they're like, yes, we are in compliance, statistically speaking.

490
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:07,940
And then they can also have a greater. So those are the two perspectives.

491
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:21,570
And using either LCA or UCL. So again, noncompliance, possible compliance and compliance.

492
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:28,320
Just in words I just showed. The U.S.O.

493
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:37,410
So again, the compliance officer is looking at that LCL.

494
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:46,650
If it's greater than when they can go ahead and issue a citation, if it's unclear, then they'll probably be more sampling.

495
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:57,360
And. If it's less than one, then there's the employer, on the other hand.

496
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:03,120
Look at that. UCL if it's greater than.

497
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:08,750
Lesson one customer. Sorry. Excuse me. This time.

498
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:11,960
The lecture. Every time. 4:00. That's the time.

499
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,860
Just like a brain shuts down. So apologize.

500
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:20,449
So at that upper conference, there was less than one. We would go ahead and conclude compliance.

501
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:25,670
And then there's some gray area that is greater than one and so forth.

502
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:30,110
So this is another one that's probably better done on with an example.

503
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:42,210
So here's an example showing a possible period for a known Please point or five where measure concentration is .04.

504
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:54,290
For our time weighted average, we simply take that ratio of 1.5, 6.8 and from the method we know that our CV is 29% 4.09.

505
00:56:54,950 --> 00:57:00,260
So we enter that in the equation. This is from the employer's side.

506
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:06,650
So we're using the UCL and we're adding 1.6, four, five times the CV and we have 0.95.

507
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,450
And so once that upper confidence level is below one, they can conclude that they're in compliance.

508
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:15,550
That's right. Everybody off. All right.

509
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:22,179
Alternatively, from a compliance officer, we've got a different level.

510
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,370
So it's not point for for instance, point six,

511
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:35,350
navigation comes out of one or two and instead of adding or subtracting using the LCA and here we come up with 1.05 and that's the LCA.

512
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:44,350
Also, you could put the samples out of compliance so you can see those levels were very different and depending on which side you're on,

513
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:48,910
the conclusion can swing drastically.

514
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:54,100
Any questions on that? Yeah.

515
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:57,520
Why? Why is there a one sided t test?

516
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,969
The standard you have to. 233 because they're giving the two different perspectives.

517
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:13,070
So it's. They're using the one tail because they're using the UCL, LCL to say anything that direction.

518
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:16,520
From this point we don't care about, we're only concerned about this.

519
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:26,059
Does that make sense that it's one sided test where you're assuming that compliance is only one direction and there's not compliance on both sides?

520
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:35,120
And two, I'm not doing a very good job explaining this, but it's the one situation where it can make sense because it has to be in one direction.

521
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:42,920
I mean, they could say no, you know, that point of 95%, they could change that.

522
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,390
You know, what is it, 95%, not 97.5% or 99% confidence.

523
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:52,399
But but the one side makes sense just because it is what it is.

524
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,780
And from the employer's perspective, they want to be below compliance perspective.

525
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,940
They're trying to prove that statistically that they're both.

526
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:07,070
So it's in one direction from the perspective of the person doing the testing or the hypothesis.

527
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:16,360
The reasonably coherent whole that although it's a bath, I'm sure this is 1970 statistics.

528
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:30,130
What kind of bias are you concerned about? Well without having kind of a unified doing this to one side or the other.

529
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:37,310
I mean, this is pretty basic. So it's like, you know, it's it's a clear recipe and people in the field can do it.

530
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:43,280
So that's probably a lot of it is they want it to be transparent and doable.

531
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:48,560
And so, you know, he'd be more worried about who's collecting the sample, how that sample collected.

532
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:52,670
Is it representative of if you're trying to find a maximum risk person?

533
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:57,890
So I'd say a lot of it, more of it would probably be concerned about this rather than the statistics of where is the

534
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:03,799
sample coming from for this data and how which is that data versus the actual test itself?

535
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:08,860
Because that's come on the books, the government published it. So that's kind of other stuff.

536
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:18,050
But again, it's good to know. I'm not sure I would use this as my baseline if I was in charge of health and safety at a facility.

537
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:23,660
I want to go above and beyond for sure. That's helping.

538
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:29,060
I'll give you an example here in a minute. Sorry, I have a better way.

539
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:34,370
All right. So again, this is what the this is kind of like a cookbook.

540
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:38,780
We'll tell you what you can do in the field. It said what type of distribution to assume.

541
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:42,169
But again, for any given instance, you might want to look at that distribution,

542
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:48,230
use your statistical knowledge to make sure you have the proper distribution for a given statistical test.

543
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:57,400
So we've talked about the water water distribution a lot and this class is just another representation of this huge.

544
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:02,530
Once you lock transform those values, it becomes not normally distributed.

545
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:06,849
Um, again, just reminder,

546
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:12,940
your meeting is always going to be less than your arithmetic mean if you have a skewed distribution or a lot normal distribution.

547
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:21,640
That's why we like to use the median for the geometric mean and our measure of central tendency to misrepresent the information.

548
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:36,620
Okay. So again, we this is just to reiterate who covered this a long time ago, but.

549
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:42,510
You know, if you have an oil and you have a given exposure distribution,

550
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,820
we want to make sure we have as much of that distribution as possible below that.

551
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:51,900
So, you know, for compliance, they use that 95th percentile like we just showed.

552
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:58,200
But for other things, you might want to aim for other marks on that distribution.

553
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:05,339
To do that. So there's different descriptors that can be helpful for that. Here's an example and it gets kind of confusing.

554
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:08,910
So, you know, I started from the 95th percentile.

555
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:18,090
Somebody says, Why don't we use the 95th percentile of the 95th percentile, the upper 95th confidence level of that 95th percentile value.

556
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:24,270
You know, it's just basically pushing it further and further on the extreme of that tail to be more protective.

557
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:31,380
So yeah, they kind of pick just a number, the different number, at least at the 95th through the 95th.

558
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:36,750
It's a little. Makes my brain kind of explode a little bit.

559
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:42,750
But. But that's just one example of how people have approached this to be to push the envelope a little bit and be more protective.

560
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:49,190
This is just to reiterate that we did a lot of this.

561
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:57,799
You know I'm sure you enjoy on the problem sets the plots of the particle size distributions but you can do that

562
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:05,510
with any normal distribution for quick eyeballing of of things that you want to know from the distribution.

563
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:10,220
If you have a plotted so similarly you know,

564
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:15,830
if we have our exposure concentration instead is like normally distributed, we can play it like we did before.

565
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:25,050
Make sure that's on the scale. And then you have your stretched out tails on your probability, cumulative probability.

566
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:34,040
You wanted to find different points of distribution for calculate the median or the geometric mean geometric standard deviation,

567
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:38,450
just like you did with the particle size distributions.

568
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:47,420
And you know, whether or not you actually use this could be depending on the situation if you're presented with a figure some kind of handy just

569
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:54,110
to be a of all things but you know sometimes people are more comfortable just using software to calculate things that's fine to.

570
01:03:55,640 --> 01:04:03,350
It can you can vary, but it's always good to kind of look under the hood and know how these things work.

571
01:04:04,370 --> 01:04:10,730
So if you recall so we talked about compliance just now, I keep referring to that's not necessarily where you want to be.

572
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:20,270
It's good. First pass, extreme situation. What we want to do is have a better overall system for managing exposures and

573
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:27,350
identifying things that need to be recognized and evaluated and ultimately control.

574
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,400
So this is from the earlier lecture pre call. We have this flow chart.

575
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:39,770
We spend a lot of time on this exposure assessment piece and that's the exposure assessment people that we just talked about.

576
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:43,430
And then you have to recall our exposure.

577
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:51,230
That's really small. I could do it up here, but three callback to that first lecture on occupational health.

578
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:57,430
You have these exposure so similarly exposed groups exposure risk creating.

579
01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:08,830
We talked about you know greater than the original 55% of the oil, 10 to 50% of the oil, less than 10% and less than 1%.

580
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:13,390
So if you're less than 1% of the oil risk premium zero, you're in good shape.

581
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:17,470
And that's based on the 95th percentile as well.

582
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:24,040
But, you know, if you're out there, you want to continue to work your way as much as you can for every different agent,

583
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:29,350
every process you want to work your way up this to to keep everything in check as much as possible.

584
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:41,800
Another way they do this and apply this instead of the, you know, the 1970 statistics of UCL and LCL is Bayesian decision analysis.

585
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:49,629
So this is use that utilizing both your qualitative exposure assessment and the quantitative

586
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:55,420
data you're able to collect and combine those and gives you decision probabilities.

587
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:00,220
Again, all of this is based on the 95th percentile of that exposure distribution.

588
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:04,920
And you want to make sure it falls within you.

589
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:13,630
It basically tells you how likely it is to fall within any one of those five bands for your risk categories.

590
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:23,830
So. You have your qualitative data, you identify, you know, based on modeling or expert opinion,

591
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:32,380
how likely you think that exposure has to be in any of those four exposure categories based on its relative position to the OEM?

592
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:45,730
And then you use your. Sample collection statistics from the samples you collect to to make that more refined.

593
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:51,280
And then you can refine that distribution to make your final decision.

594
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:59,920
Question is, you know, what is happening with the numbers and the scale and categories of exposure?

595
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:03,460
Yeah. Example where you go from 180 to 12.

596
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:12,240
Okay. So that's a great question. Great question. So again, it's less than 1%, less than 10%, 10 to 50, 50 to 100 greater.

597
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:16,240
So this is actually just an example of, say, we have qualitative data.

598
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:23,860
And based on our qualitative data, I'm going to say I'm thinking there's 1% chance it's less than 1.1% or less than 1% of the oil.

599
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:32,410
Based on that modeling or where we use, I think it's 80% chance, it's less than 10%, 12% chance.

600
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:35,800
It's between ten and 1550 100 greater than 100.

601
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:40,120
So going it this is again, just a hypothetical example right here.

602
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:47,170
This is not this is just yeah. Idea of five numbers and you start with the five categories.

603
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:49,540
You've, you know, you'd have some zeros in there.

604
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:54,160
But based on modeling, we need a bunch of iterations, a bunch of different assumptions for your inputs.

605
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:58,210
This is what you came up with and you go out and collect data on the process.

606
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:02,050
Use these as your priors. And I think it's an analysis.

607
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:08,170
Combine it with your collected data and you'll have a more refined post, your answer.

608
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:14,050
So the reason people like this in the field is it can help you to not have to collect as many samples.

609
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:19,240
You get more out of the quantity of data to collect and also helps to keep in

610
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:22,930
check that your expert opinion or models that we talked about could be wrong.

611
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:26,620
So it's kind of a nice, sweet bounce back there almost.

612
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:31,410
Yeah. And then I give you a distribution kind of on your output.

613
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:38,260
So here's an example from the book. The text is a little blurry, let's say, from your professional judgment or modeling.

614
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:44,380
In this case, we separated by, you know, 3%, 1760, 73.

615
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:48,790
They went out and collected their data and that's where their monitoring data fell.

616
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:55,870
And then they use that Bayesian analysis and refined it to show, you know,

617
01:08:55,870 --> 01:09:03,700
most likely almost 80% chance they're not double to 2% chance that they're above the wheel.

618
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:07,419
So they might want to do something there to shift this distribution downward

619
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:14,460
by instituting more controls or practices to help you shift that downward,

620
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:21,250
because they're in pretty good shape here. Yeah, most likely they're level to 10 to 50% of your oil.

621
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:27,910
But, you know, you might not be comfortable with this this little bit that that could be over.

622
01:09:28,090 --> 01:09:35,590
So, you know, people like this in the field because it does get more mileage out of your deal that if you collect a little

623
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:42,810
more confidence and a little bit more of user friendly on the output rather than just listen to them.

624
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:53,440
So advantages, you know, gives you more of a view of what's going on in a reasonable parameter space.

625
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:59,320
It can include a lot of this other stuff we've been talking about sampling data, plus some of the qualitative information.

626
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:06,940
A lot of people find it easier to understand just that probability within each of those bands compared to just a single number output.

627
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:15,370
Like I said, a lot of people like what some say 20 on the sample field work and we talked about

628
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:19,840
all the problems with expert judgment potentially helps address that as well.

629
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:25,890
I was asked age they are currently.

630
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:29,130
I don't know. They don't say how long this is going to be offered, but there is a free course.

631
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:34,830
I mean, I've thought about do I just take hours of my course and throw it out the window and include this?

632
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:41,250
But yeah, so this is offered by some of the experts in the field that you can go with at 3 a.m. for a long time.

633
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:50,370
And one guy is a consultant, but they're really well-known in industrial hygiene for applying Bayesian statistics to you, to what I just talked about.

634
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:56,400
So there's this free course if anyone is interested over break or have at it, but I just thought I'd throw it out there.

635
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:58,770
So the summary for today,

636
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:09,840
hopefully just a little bit more clarity on how to six factors into this stuff and how it's relevant to a lot of different areas.

637
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:19,540
Talked about how you apply it to. Compliance, but the more modern approaches, hopefully we get to that more systems based approach.

638
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:24,550
So you do. Sophisticated decision analysis.

639
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:31,209
Resources. I'm always torn whether I should when I should tell people about this.

640
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:34,480
But there is a this excel.

641
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:42,700
I don't know what it is. Basically, somebody went into Excel and made all this stuff, uh, they call it that,

642
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:46,570
where you put in your sample data here, and I'll give you all this, all this stuff.

643
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:51,549
So I apologize. I didn't tell you before the problem.

644
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:57,340
So that was strategic on my part because again, I want you to kind of get your hands dirty a little bit on this stuff but you know,

645
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:02,800
use with caution always good to maybe do a separate calculation to cat to validate that the.

646
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:10,330
The spreadsheets, correct me with that, but might be useful to you at some point.

647
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:17,760
And there's some sample problems, but we're out of time. So what's on the quiz?

648
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:25,950
Well, they say mixtures of mixtures. Maybe something on the UCLA, also something basic about that concept.

649
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:31,920
I would think would probably be the main things from this one. The questions.

650
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:39,259
All right, so I'll plan opening the quiz tomorrow when we get till Wednesday.

651
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:42,740
Hopefully that accommodates everybody to give them more time.

652
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:48,120
And there. That's what passed this one.

653
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:53,610
You know, this unit was like, if somebody wants to take the college exam, at some point,

654
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:59,860
they're going to be pretty set on the exposure evaluation, the chemical exposure evaluation component of that.

655
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:03,750
That's what the goal kind of it's the technical aspects of that piece.

656
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:13,830
But we'll switch gears again next week. So please come to class next Thursday and we'll discuss the future choosing among peers and go from there.

657
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:15,960
All right. Thanks. Good weekend.
