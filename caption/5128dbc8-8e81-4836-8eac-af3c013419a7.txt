1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:13,160
Okay. No I'm continue with some of the the first parts are hopefully it can get from you.

2
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,890
So basically I want to explore some of the questions.

3
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,340
How should it be answered? What sort of really it has to be possible?

4
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,950
And I eventually went back and looked at everyone.

5
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,150
So one more time and it was sort of rational.

6
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:44,790
I think that's the particular numbers I've been. I, for one.

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,620
And know this a few. I think we all know that.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,790
And anyway, so Lauper for course,

9
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:10,139
or I hope you all say I have tried to write as many comments as possible so that

10
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,880
you were understanding the students were understanding the basis of my point.

11
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:24,900
But I am always happy to discuss anything you said I overlooked or I misunderstood, or I did not write.

12
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,110
Feel free to stop by my office.

13
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:36,060
Our services there for five or scheduled separation meetings if that time doesn't work for you.

14
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,920
But what I want to really discuss is this course.

15
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,440
But this question, we have two parts, actually.

16
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:59,660
The first part is talking about what study design I seem to like to have with the study design talked about for then for the rational part.

17
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:06,150
What's the kind of miss possible?

18
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:15,910
And the answer, I always say if that question is missed by most of the students or didn't, I didn't get to.

19
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,590
Complete or correct answer from most of the students.

20
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:34,750
I want to take that responsibility and we have now to explain some concepts clearly and to but I did have some very close to complete.

21
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,120
So I decided to not taking the second part into the equation.

22
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:48,830
So only based on the first part. Although I have seen some and all your rational need to be these.

23
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,390
It's only for me.

24
00:02:50,630 --> 00:03:02,420
That's what's it from my first round of review and I put that it's also for you to think about and to for me to know how that path has to be done.

25
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,649
So, so of course, the results of that course.

26
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,830
I have room for two. Good.

27
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:29,210
I actually accidentally gave two additional audition that made that happen that that's so what's important to let me quickly see.

28
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:36,710
q5i think the some of you did a really a perfect and nice description for the.

29
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:51,640
The process and then clinical aspects pretty much was typical but then forgot the first part.

30
00:03:52,090 --> 00:04:05,620
So there are nine major steps you want to if you want to cover in this course, I will come back to talk about that if I have time for these nine.

31
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:13,330
You start with the rational development which you actually involve and many different things that you can see.

32
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:18,280
Column six of epidemiology molecular, uh, you know,

33
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,960
understand your medicine or these to determine if it's cost effective or feasible to develop a vaccine.

34
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:34,239
Rational development of antigen, I think probably I will let you talk in one second.

35
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:42,100
This is our second speaker. I just to mention the exam forces.

36
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:49,390
Oh, huh. Oh, you really don't worry that it's okay.

37
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,430
I think I pretty much done.

38
00:04:52,480 --> 00:05:03,300
I say the nine steps in that sort of think or you could go to find out the wife's name and then we will find that time to talk about this,

39
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:12,850
the therapy effects and the indirect effects of the rational, because I think it's important part of the course.

40
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:19,570
So we're spending some time, as I say, in the in the allowance.

41
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,450
So now I'm going to introduce our second speaker.

42
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:40,330
So then you can think it's really my great pleasure to invite to learn come to give a talk on his beautiful work.

43
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:51,490
I want to say after you publish a paper got people will write to me even or I want to offer free access to some of the their platform, their work.

44
00:05:52,540 --> 00:06:00,620
So I'm really proud of the work you have done and I'm so grateful that you are willing to come to share with them,

45
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,359
share your outstanding work with our students,

46
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,270
because we just had some very sensitive session with Addison, um,

47
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:23,410
covering all the new technology for vaccine development and your whole career for an excellent example.

48
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,400
So think of all the different programs towards now you want to interact show.

49
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:38,140
Yeah, that's fine. And also you know, ethical protecting and so yeah, that's good.

50
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:45,850
They have some background. Um, no, I'm going to look at this.
