1
00:00:03,934 --> 00:00:08,569
This simple toy example, considering what would

2
00:00:08,569 --> 00:00:12,660
be the causal effect of a binary treatment.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,742
On average or at the individual level, for simply

4
00:00:17,742 --> 00:00:25,252
eight individuals helps me introduce to you the concept of confounding.

5
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:30,820
That is in order to be able to establish a cause effect relationship,

6
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:36,676
we would like it to be the case that those who had treatment 1 and those who

7
00:00:36,676 --> 00:00:42,635
had the treatment 0 were comparable in their counterfactual outcomes.

8
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:47,855
Remember, their counterfactual outcomes response

9
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:52,150
types act like pre-exposure covariance.

10
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,701
These are the archetype of the confounding.

11
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:04,394
That is, if that were the case that the outcomes of those who had

12
00:01:04,394 --> 00:01:08,831
treatment 1 would be similar to the outcomes if the whole

13
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:13,280
population had been given treatment 0 and the reverse.

14
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,411
That's when we could study causal effects by simply comparing

15
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:23,250
the subgroup of exposed and the subgroup of unexposed, and

16
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,119
just comparing the mean of the outcome in these two groups.

17
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:34,365
However, as in this example, this will often not be the case.

18
00:01:37,677 --> 00:01:42,821
In our example, these two treatment groups were

19
00:01:42,821 --> 00:01:49,094
not comparable because all of the individuals of the always

20
00:01:49,094 --> 00:01:54,376
cured type were all assigned to the treatment 0.

21
00:01:54,376 --> 00:02:01,413
And this made the it look that treatment 0 was more beneficial than treatment 1.

22
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:10,895
However, is it possible that within strata of other observed variable,

23
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:16,794
we will call them C in this course, those who receive treatment 1 and

24
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:20,984
those who receive treatment 0 are comparable.

25
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:26,188
For example, it could be that the physician who is assigning

26
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:30,984
treatments uses a biomarker, say your blood test, for

27
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:35,983
which this blood test that indicates who is gonna be always

28
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:40,794
cured takes a level, say, above a certain threshold.

29
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:44,619
So if we knew what that marker is that

30
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:49,846
the physician is using to assign treatment, and

31
00:02:49,846 --> 00:02:54,945
if the physician is not using this threshold and

32
00:02:54,945 --> 00:03:00,172
this variable exactly so that there is still some

33
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:05,271
variability in the level that these covariates

34
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:09,606
C takes between treatment and control,

35
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:15,343
then we can hope to assume that the effect of treatment

36
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:21,109
A on the outcome is unconfounded given covariates C.

37
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:25,986
And we can actually represent this statement statistically

38
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:30,007
with this conditional independence statement.

39
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:34,702
Their response types while subscript A are independent of

40
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:39,312
treatment assignment A conditionally on covariates C.

41
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:44,854
So if we are willing to assume that conditionally on covariate C,

42
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:52,315
the response types, the potential outcomes are independent of exposure assignment,

43
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:57,255
then the treatment groups are comparable within levels of

44
00:03:57,255 --> 00:04:02,194
discovariates and we can show that we can actually recover

45
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:06,782
from observed data the mean of our counterfactuals.

46
00:04:06,782 --> 00:04:09,908
Here's the proof.

47
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:15,263
On the left hand side of these equations we see the mean

48
00:04:15,263 --> 00:04:21,456
of the potential outcome Y under treatment status A equal 1.

49
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:25,172
That is if everyone in our population has

50
00:04:25,172 --> 00:04:29,884
been treated with A = 1 conditional covariates.

51
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:35,028
And by leveraging this conditional independence

52
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:42,620
assumption you can actually rewrite the term on the left, allowing for,

53
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:48,138
adding as a conditional statement,the treatment.

54
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:54,417
Turn the steps, that is dropping the subscript and simply saying,

55
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:59,925
look, we can recover the mean of the potential outcome Y and

56
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:04,775
everyone being treated with the conditional mean of

57
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:09,733
the outcome in the group of treated that is obtained,

58
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:13,727
thanks to the assumption of consistency.

59
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:17,191
Similarly, we can show the same for

60
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:21,813
the scenario in which everyone was untreated or

61
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:26,100
treated with the treatment level equal 0.

62
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,958
Then by combining these two results, we can show that the difference

63
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:36,705
in the mean of the counterfactual is that conditional on

64
00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:41,755
the confounder C had everyone been treated compared to if no

65
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:46,603
one has been treated can be recovered by the difference in

66
00:05:46,603 --> 00:05:51,653
the conditional mean of the observed outcome in the group of

67
00:05:51,653 --> 00:05:56,501
the treated, whose level of the covariates is little c,

68
00:05:56,501 --> 00:06:00,541
minus the mean of the outcome among untreated,

69
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:04,304
who have the same level of the covariates C.

70
00:06:04,304 --> 00:06:09,023
We can, therefore, compute the causal effects from the observed data.

71
00:06:09,023 --> 00:06:12,991
But, as I said, we need to make this assumption,

72
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,681
this conditional independence assumption.

73
00:06:16,681 --> 00:06:20,706
So in practice, to make this assumption reasonable,

74
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:25,519
we need to try to collect as many variables as possible that affect

75
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,907
both the treatment, assignment, as well as the outcome.

76
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:38,100
Sometimes we don't know whether a particular variable affects

77
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,876
both the treatment and the outcome.

78
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:44,760
Still, we might want to control for it.

79
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,383
In practice, all these variables we need to adjust for

80
00:06:48,383 --> 00:06:53,998
are called pre-treatment variables and should be controlled for in our analysis.

81
00:07:01,114 --> 00:07:07,682
Note that we shouldn't be adjusting for every type of variables.

82
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:11,836
We should only be adjusting for confounders,

83
00:07:11,836 --> 00:07:16,426
which by definition are three treatment factors.

84
00:07:16,426 --> 00:07:20,501
We should always be careful in not controlling for

85
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:26,324
past the treatment variables that block part of the treatment effect,

86
00:07:26,324 --> 00:07:31,964
rather than helping us to reveal what's the true treatment effect.

87
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,893
So once we have identified which factors we should control for

88
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:44,754
in the analysis, and later on we are gonna use the tool of direct

89
00:07:44,754 --> 00:07:49,804
acyclic graphs to understand how to identify those covariates,

90
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:53,419
we can move on with our statistical analysis.

91
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:57,166
And also, now I want to review a couple of strategies,

92
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:02,476
of which many of you might be familiar already, of confounding adjustment.

93
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,769
Let's consider the simplest way to adjust for

94
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:14,084
confounding, direct regression adjustment.

95
00:08:14,084 --> 00:08:18,240
Note that direct regression adjustment can also be given

96
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,350
a statistical interpretation like an associational interpretation

97
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:28,124
rather than a causal interpretation and we will start with that.

98
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:31,652
Let's say that your outcome is continuous and

99
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:36,988
you have an exposure of interest A and a set of confounding variable C,

100
00:08:36,988 --> 00:08:41,509
and then you assume that the relationship between A and Y and

101
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:45,591
C and Y is linear and you specify the regression here.

102
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:51,255
We can always interpret the parameter beta 1 provided that this model

103
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:57,699
is correctly specified without further assumption as an association as term.

104
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:00,840
So how would we interpret beta 1?

105
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,617
If we randomly select two individuals from a population and

106
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:10,391
both have the same value of C, but the second individual has

107
00:09:10,391 --> 00:09:15,261
a value of A one unit higher than the first, then on average,

108
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:21,121
the second individual will have a value of Y that is beta 1 units higher.

109
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:28,703
Note that this interpretation remains true even if there are a measure confounders.

110
00:09:28,703 --> 00:09:31,818
So what would be our causal interpretation?

111
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:36,646
If instead we believed and we did our best to adjust for

112
00:09:36,646 --> 00:09:42,338
confounders such as the conditional independence assumption

113
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:47,184
between Y subscript A and A holds conditionally on C.

114
00:09:47,184 --> 00:09:51,880
Then beta 1 will take the interpretation of the causal

115
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,782
effect whereby if we intervened increasing A by 1 unit,

116
00:09:56,782 --> 00:10:01,192
we will, on average, increase Y by beta 1 units.

117
00:10:05,342 --> 00:10:10,074
An alternative technique to estimate causal effects

118
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:14,288
is the one called marginal structural models.

119
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:18,967
A marginal structural model is a model for the counterfactual outcome and

120
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:22,074
it's marginal with respect to the covariates.

121
00:10:22,074 --> 00:10:26,457
In fact, as you see from the model right here, it's a model for

122
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:31,591
the counterfactual, so it's a structural model because it's modeling

123
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:37,082
the mean of the potential outcome Y had everyone been exposed to level it away.

124
00:10:37,082 --> 00:10:41,616
And on the right hand side, we see that only we adjust for

125
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:46,359
the variable A rather than adjusting also for variable C.

126
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:50,006
Since we are only adjusting for A, this is a marginal model.

127
00:10:54,524 --> 00:11:00,511
So how do we recover a causal effect using this type of model?

128
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:08,847
As I said, in order to be able to compare two groups and

129
00:11:08,847 --> 00:11:14,889
compare two treatment and exposure groups based on their outcome,

130
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:20,295
we need to make the assumption that these two exposure groups

131
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:26,549
are balanced according to their response types or balanced according

132
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:32,298
to the covariates C that act as proxies of their response types.

133
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:35,463
How do we obtain this balance?

134
00:11:35,463 --> 00:11:40,480
Rather than by stratifying according to the covariates C

135
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,750
like the previous method did, we are re-weighting subjects so that,

136
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:53,857
for example, if we were giving treatment equal 0 to people who were healthier,

137
00:11:53,857 --> 00:12:01,067
we were taking the healthier people in the unexposed group and down weight them and

138
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:06,639
take the healthy people in the exposed group nd up weight them.

139
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,175
So in order to observe this imbalance,

140
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:16,122
we need to fit a model for the probability of

141
00:12:16,122 --> 00:12:21,489
being exposed given your confounding level.

142
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:29,013
So we will first estimate the inverse probability of treatment weights,

143
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:35,079
W, which is 1 over the probability of having the treatment

144
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:40,198
level actually received given covariate level.

145
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:44,907
For treated subjects, this weight takes value 1

146
00:12:44,907 --> 00:12:49,951
over P of a equal 1 given sequel C, and for controls,

147
00:12:49,951 --> 00:12:54,224
it's gonna be 1 over P of a equals 0 given C.

148
00:12:59,123 --> 00:13:02,383
So after we have constructed these weights,

149
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:07,358
we will proceed fitting an outcome regression model, say, again,

150
00:13:07,358 --> 00:13:13,365
a linear regression model if our outcomes continues conditional on the exposure,

151
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:16,224
but not on the observe the population.

152
00:13:16,224 --> 00:13:21,843
Rather, a new population obtained by re-weighting everyone

153
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:26,726
according to their infers of their propensity score.

154
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:28,542
What is the propensity score?

155
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:33,849
Is the probability of having the treatment level

156
00:13:33,849 --> 00:13:40,974
that has been observed conditional on their covariates styles.

157
00:13:40,974 --> 00:13:46,198
If there is no measure confounding, the regression parameter beta

158
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:51,891
1 from this weighted regression will be interpreted as a causal effect.

159
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:59,372
Here is SAS code that shows how a marginal structural model analysis would proceed.

160
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,498
If we have a binary exposure,

161
00:14:01,498 --> 00:14:06,347
we would fit a logistic regression model for A conditionally on C and

162
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:10,868
we would output the predicted probabilities from this model.

163
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:15,838
We would then construct the weights, which would take

164
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:20,593
a certain form if the person is exposed to April 1 and

165
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:26,772
would take another form instead that the individual is unexposed.

166
00:14:26,772 --> 00:14:30,002
Once we have constructed these weights,

167
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:34,617
we can then proceed the fitting outcome regression model,

168
00:14:34,617 --> 00:14:38,415
saving your model, adding a weight statement.

169
00:14:38,415 --> 00:14:43,447
And note that we need also to obtain robust standard errors using

170
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:49,224
this repeated subject case ID, because every subject is re-weighted so

171
00:14:49,224 --> 00:14:52,500
some people count double or three times.

172
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,672
And so we create an extra correlation in our

173
00:14:55,672 --> 00:15:00,001
data like if it was a little bit like a longitudinal study.

174
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:03,157
So we need to accommodate this and

175
00:15:03,157 --> 00:15:08,465
inflate our standard datas because of this weighting.
