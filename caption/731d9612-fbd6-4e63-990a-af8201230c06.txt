1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,030
The rule of rescue.

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:12,440
And this is the idea that what people want is to be rescued when they're in a dire situation and they don't want to anticipate something.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,990
You know, when I go exercise, I'm sweating and I'm taking time out of my day.

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,340
And, you know, I'm sitting there thinking, is this going to really help me in the long run?

5
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:29,120
Because this is taking time and it's hurting. And, you know, it's an abstraction and it's all deferred to the future, the benefit.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,710
But when you're sick, you want something right away. It's a very natural human response.

7
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:41,860
But but putting a little bit in the context of prevention, we keep talking about trying to prevent climate change.

8
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,549
Everything that I've been reading about it suggests we're doing a pretty terrible job of it.

9
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:57,350
I just heard somewhere that where in the last 800,000 years, the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere has never been as high as it is 800,000 years.

10
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:03,529
I don't remember that long personally, but I mean, that's that's an amazing statement.

11
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:10,490
So one obvious question with climate change is if we're not doing a good job of preventing it, can we treat it?

12
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,760
Are there technologies that could actually help us to reverse some of the problems we're already

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:23,420
beginning to see so that there is an entire area of research and study called geoengineering,

14
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:37,550
and that it addresses taking an active intervention approach to climate change, not trying simply simply to reduce CO2 emissions of carbon emissions,

15
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:46,430
but also trying to increase the uptake of CO2 either by natural sources or by manmade sources.

16
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:52,430
So increasing CO2 absorbed in the ocean, increasing CO2 uptake by plants.

17
00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:00,640
You know, I think most and even in the even at U of M so, you know, these these researcher,

18
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,030
scientist and engineers are studying geoengineering around the world,

19
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,320
including at U of M, we have a program called Beyond Carbon, Beyond Carbon Neutral.

20
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:16,910
And so, again, the idea is not simply to level off carbon emissions, but also go further and bend the curve down.

21
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,709
I think most scientists and engineers are humble enough to be very,

22
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:28,760
very cautious about any proposed solution at such a at such a scale as our world

23
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,790
and trying to predict its efficacy and trying to predict unanticipated impacts.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,640
So. I think it's you know, they did like the bumper sticker says, you know, we have no Planet B, right.

25
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,900
So I. I think it's worth. It absolutely is worth pursuing.

26
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:57,540
Yeah. But I hope that those who are pursuing it continue to be humble in that pursuit because, you know, again,

27
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:11,220
unprecedented scale of engineering, the very definition of unprecedented means that we don't know what might happen that we did not expect.

28
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,999
So it's it's scary. It's scary.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,610
But people are taking. Taking that challenge to heart and are studying it.

30
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,700
Well, it's good. I mean, I think about how many problems we have solved our way out of with technology.

31
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,310
Uh, I don't know that this one has much of a shot of that or not, but, you know.

32
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,520
But your point, though, I think this is very American, right?

33
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,020
And I think it's true with precision medicine.

34
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,020
We think we don't have to worry about these problems because we we're always inventing to find a solution.

35
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,990
And, you know, we have a lot of answers to a lot of these problems.

36
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:54,129
They're much more basic, right? They're much more about preventing things from happening than having to develop the technology.

37
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:01,240
But we are hugely optimistic people about the importance and what technology can accomplish.

38
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,270
And so we often overlook some of these really basic things.

39
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,639
Right. You know, you look at you look at how we design our cars and seatbelts.

40
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,150
You know, it's all about the person clicking that seatbelt, right? First and foremost.

41
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:19,360
But we want to some people want to, you know, just figure out, well, they'll make the cars that are so much safer, I won't have to worry about it.

42
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:24,340
Right. So. Well, the airbag, that's that's one thing. And we have we do we do invent new technology.

43
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,090
Yeah, but there's a lot we can do without having to go there first.

44
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:35,080
Right, right. So are there any analogies to, you know, drawing strong straws in the wind or something here?

45
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,900
Is there any analogy between the precision medicine and the big climate change problem?

46
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:47,780
Is there any way to draw lessons from one for the other? I think certainly the preventative aspect, I mean, you know,

47
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,080
you were mentioning that things like giving a patient a scale to go home with and having them.

48
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,370
You know, we understand why people gain weight. Calories in minus calories out.

49
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:07,479
That that is a incredible way to prevent lots and lots of disease, preventing smoking, you know, regular pap smears to prevent cervical cancer.

50
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,540
Those are all kinds of things that that we sort of know work.

51
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,759
And but but I think that again,

52
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:19,809
that sort of there is a lot of cutting edge research being done on what to do with the very late stage after that has happened.

53
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:26,170
And I think it's often it's harder, particularly in our country, to get people excited about doing these very basic things.

54
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:33,249
It's also much harder, and I imagine it's the same thing that I imagine if you develop the technology that allows you to sequester that carbon,

55
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:42,340
that will be a very valuable technology and that you will make a lot more money doing that then you will, in doing some very basic preventative.

56
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:52,210
And we see this all the time in medicine where say, for example, that a drug is found that would would work just as well as a very expensive drug.

57
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,460
If the drug is much cheaper and is a generic drug and no one can patent it,

58
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,720
there's got to be no one to fund that clinical trial to show that it works as well.

59
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:08,230
And there's going to be no one showing up at the doctor's office saying, hey, you should prescribe this drug instead of that one.

60
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:16,120
So I think it's very much it is a reactionary situation when we know that much of what probably the most straightforward,

61
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:23,769
effective technology that we've heard, effective approach that we have proven evidence would be the simpler and earlier intervention.

62
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,240
I think it's very similar with, you know, the human body, I think is very much like the the world,

63
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,909
meaning that it's it's it is evolved into a very narrow range of conditions.

64
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:40,780
And then when things go to the extremes, that's a very hard area to be, you know, changing things in that perspective.

65
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,979
And I think it's similar to climate that, that when you had that with human health,

66
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:50,620
that that's something much easier to prevent than it is to deal with at the very very late stages are going to be interesting.

67
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:56,530
I don't know if anyone has compared the economics of energy production to health care.

68
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:03,610
So one of the key contributors to the US is CO2 emissions.

69
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:11,110
Not increasing as fast as they had in the past has been the availability of inexpensive solar panels.

70
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:21,819
Now that's great, except that those solar panels are made inexpensively, you know, offshore, right.

71
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:36,309
So, you know, the, the, the, the, the availability of this less expensive import has had the benefit of decreasing our CO2 emissions.

72
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:43,510
I don't know what the comparison is to health care in terms of, you know, drugs and therapies, right?

73
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:48,550
So if something else is developed elsewhere and is cheaper,

74
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:54,520
it my guess is that there are barriers to its entry into the US or maybe it's developed very

75
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,319
expensively in the US and so we just don't we don't have access to the cheaper things.

76
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:10,590
So I think the kind of the economic kind of landscape plays a factor in, in the availability of these types of it can continue.

77
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,799
Medical care system doesn't follow those normal principles of economics.

78
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,550
Okay. So almost everything we do in medical care is cost increasing, not cost.

79
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,299
Saving. It's the technology goes in the reverse direction.

80
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,490
Right? Right. For a whole variety of reasons about how we finance medical care.

81
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:34,580
You know, some of the things you talked about. But but also, you know how people don't capture the benefits of lowering costs.

82
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,850
They get the benefits of raising costs.

83
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:44,470
And and also a lot of what we've done in medical care hasn't done things like eradicate disease, hasn't done things like get rid of CO2.

84
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:52,480
They've allowed people who have chronic conditions to live better quality of life and live longer with with with disease.

85
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,700
Okay. But they they aren't they don't embrace the disease.

86
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,660
Right. So in some ways, that actually that increases costs as well. Right.

87
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,910
Because people are living longer, but they're they need a lot of medicine and other things to help them live longer.

88
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:10,629
So I actually published a paper 30 years ago in which I talked about the coming year of cost

89
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:16,390
savings in health care because of all the new technology and said that in every other industry,

90
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,240
wherever we look, we see cost savings through technology.

91
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:27,280
And we all know that by the cell phones or laptops that we have or the great TVs and compare them with what they used to cost.

92
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,210
And it hasn't happened in health care.

93
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:36,790
It's it's really almost shocking because it seems like it should be such a big market and there should be so many people interested in it.

94
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,330
But so much what we're talking about when we think about personalized medicine is not only how expensive it is or isn't,

95
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:50,320
but whether it's going to be paid for by an insurer. And of course, you've spent a lot of your life in that field.

96
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:57,190
And one of the big issues in public health since I got into it 40 years ago and certainly well before that,

97
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:05,140
is why is it that we're the only nation, the only developed nation on earth that doesn't have health care for all of its citizens?

98
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,999
How are we ever going to get there? Yeah. Do you have any thoughts on whether we ever will get there?

99
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,230
And if so, how ever a really long time. So I don't know that I want to go to the ever part.

100
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:26,410
You know, it's so every other country in the world really has been very clear about what they believe about health care.

101
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:34,210
And they believe that people should not face barriers to getting medical treatment because of cost.

102
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,580
They believe medical care, health care, a certain basic level of care is a social good.

103
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:46,659
In America, we've really never had that discussion. And in fact, we have very conflicting views.

104
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,620
And you see that played out in the political arena all the time.

105
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,290
There are many people in this country who believe that medical care is a market good.

106
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,910
It is not a basic you know, it's this question is medical care, is health care a right?

107
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,280
And we have not confronted that issue.

108
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:15,220
And we do seem to have some tolerance for people dying as a result of lack of medical care that is less tolerated in other countries.

109
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,530
If you look at public opinion, you know, people say people should have health insurance.

110
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,829
You know, that is but but we also don't want to tax ourselves for that.

111
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:28,899
Right. We also don't want to. We don't. So, you know, one of the challenges with the Affordable Care Act, for example,

112
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:34,450
was that it tried to get more people insurance by raising taxes to some degree,

113
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:39,780
but also by having this individual mandate, this idea of individual responsibility, like you drive a car,

114
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,269
you should you should have auto insurance, you have a body, you should have health insurance.

115
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,790
Why people should have insurance. And people you know, consumers hate that.

116
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,850
You know, Americans don't like to be told what to do and we don't like to pay taxes.

117
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:58,240
And so we're very conflicted about these issues. Certainly, the Affordable Care Act reduced the numbers who are uninsured.

118
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:04,510
Mm hmm. But even that was not even intended to be as sweeping as other countries.

119
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:11,560
Could we get there? Perhaps. You know, there's there's a lot in flux these days in this country.

120
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:17,030
There are a lot of people talking more about Medicare for All. I think it'll be a long journey if we get there.

121
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:22,690
I even though some of the polling data says people like this idea of Medicare for All single payer.

122
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,510
They like it in abstract forms.

123
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:30,430
They don't like it when they get told, well, here's what it would actually take in your taxes to actually accomplish that.

124
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,490
Here are the limitations you would have as a result of that.

125
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,930
So I don't think we're there yet. I think we're having that conversation and that's good.

126
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,850
I think we need a lot more public engagement. I think it'll take a long time to get there.

127
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:50,570
How much of a contributor to that mindset do you think comes from the perception that, uh, the,

128
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:56,900
the health care that you would get in a, in a system where health care was seen as a right is more austere?

129
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:05,980
I mean, I have a friend who had an accident in Germany, and he described his experience in the hospital as being very austere.

130
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,040
No air conditioning, flickering fluorescent light. Yeah.

131
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:16,240
His wife had to, you know, he he he he was he had a wound and he was wound was bleeding.

132
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:22,830
Yeah. The nurse. Gave a washcloth to the wife and said, you know, clean up your husband.

133
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:32,099
So I'm wondering how much first of all, how much of that is kind of just like a myth and how much of that really factors

134
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,750
into people's reluctance to pursue those types of health care systems in the U.S.?

135
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,650
Yeah. So, you know, as Ken said, you know, if we actually look at the data of population health,

136
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,650
we don't fare very well in the US compared to other countries.

137
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:52,049
So, you know, whether it's more you know, there's less bells and whistles, it's, you know, less, you know, luxurious care or whatever.

138
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,630
In other countries, it doesn't actually factor into improved health.

139
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:02,150
We have some really good data to show that the quality of medical care for people in most in need is very good in these other countries.

140
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,240
Right. But and I think it's something you said they do make tradeoffs.

141
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:12,230
Right. So in other countries, they they want to make sure people have basic medical care, primary care.

142
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,200
They want to, you know, get them into the system. But if you have something elective, there are waiting lists.

143
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:23,459
Right. And, you know, there are shortages. And so people don't get everything instantaneously.

144
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,840
They don't get this high tech eye and care as quickly as we get it in America.

145
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:34,440
And Americans aren't particularly tolerant of waiting. You know, I think Europe and this is so cultural, right?

146
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,940
So in in Europe, they're used to they've lived through wars on their shores.

147
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:45,060
Right. They understand what shortages are. They understand tradeoffs in a way that Americans, I think, just don't.

148
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,879
And so, you know, in America, if you say something about making you know,

149
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,110
you talked earlier about making decisions about what gets paid for based upon,

150
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,410
you know, how much does it contribute to quality of life and how much does it cost?

151
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:05,820
If you say that in America, you're accused of wanting to ration health care and rationing health care is a dirty word in this country.

152
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,350
Have you practiced in other countries? Have you looked at medical care systems elsewhere?

153
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:16,110
No. But this you know, you bring up all of these really good points that and I think the other thing is Americans

154
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,360
have no idea what health care costs because they don't pay what health care costs.

155
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,100
But then there's also this bizarre practice of, you know,

156
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,479
a hospital may have a contract with an organization where they only pay 20 for their patients.

157
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,310
They pay 20% of the charges.

158
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:41,790
So it's fine to say we're going to send a bill to Blue Cross for $15,000 because we know we're all going to get paid $3,000.

159
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,890
But that same $15,000 bill will go to someone who doesn't have insurance,

160
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:56,190
who is the kind of patient who certainly can't pay a $15,000 bill and costs of the exact same thing very dramatically across the country.

161
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:01,950
That's not something you don't have unlike any other business. You don't know what it's actually going to cost before it's done.

162
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,510
And I think particularly in, you know,

163
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:12,209
the if you are injured and you get admitted to the you go to the emergency room and you get admitted to the hospital and you're in there for a week,

164
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:16,440
you know, that's tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. And people have no clue.

165
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:22,770
They think, well, I will be taken care of. You know, I don't want other people to have this, but I certainly expect it.

166
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:26,069
And I think that's I think that's the real challenge. And it's the same thing.

167
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,410
I mean, it's very easy in cancer.

168
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:35,910
It's, you know, if there's one of 100 patients are going to benefit from the drug and we have to screen everybody to find that,

169
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:42,720
you know, should we be doing that, too? Should we screen every patient to find the one person who may benefit from the drug?

170
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,630
Well, if you're that patient, the answer is yes. You definitely want to know.

171
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:52,770
But if we're looking at that from a population standpoint or if a payer is looking at that, you have to make a very different argument.

172
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:59,909
Or if it's we're going to do testing for one of two, we're going to do a test that we want Blue Cross to cover for $5,000.

173
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,590
And we're going to give one of two really expensive therapies that is Blue Cross Blue Shield.

174
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,050
Make sure that then why are we paying for that?

175
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:13,620
If, on the other hand, the question or the proposal was we are going to do a $5,000 test that says you either get a therapy or you don't.

176
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:20,129
Right. That is something that insurance would would much we consider much stronger, you know, much more strongly.

177
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,230
And I think we focus so much on, hey, the patient is going to benefit, so let's do it.

178
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:32,370
And I think that that really is I mean, you see that just sort of in the care that people get in different health care systems even.

179
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,239
You know, I think we practice incredible medicine at University of Michigan,

180
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:44,850
but there are other systems that do things better because they've decided that we're as we think this is of value to us to do this for every patient.

181
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:49,770
So we're going to cover that cost of doing that. And the benefit may not be an improved outcome.

182
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,479
Maybe all the you know, we're going to get better.

183
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:58,170
We're going to be better at understanding disease process, we're going to write better grants and we're going to drive market volume.

184
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:06,420
But I think that particularly in precision medicine, there's not a lot of focus on do we improve outcomes, do we decrease cost?

185
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:15,890
And that as someone who's sort of been in this space both from the here at Michigan as well as in a commercial side that you know,

186
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,210
you can we already ration health care in.

187
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:26,510
The US because people can't afford to have their therapy or their surgery of choice with unless it's covered by insurance.

188
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,799
So you're already having your therapy or your your health care rationed.

189
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,400
And so if you're thinking about how to do this, you have to the you know,

190
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,700
the process is what do I have to do to get insurance to pay for this test, this procedure?

191
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:49,100
And so I think the people that are on this sort of business side, that that's their only focus is we have to get this covered versus the patient says,

192
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:55,250
I want this, do this, and the doctor and me says, we should be doing this for every patient because it's going to benefit somebody.

193
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,240
Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's this whole issue of rationing health care.

194
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,590
So fascinating because in other countries, they do it explicitly.

195
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:09,260
Right. So in Great Britain, they have a panel called Nice, the National Institute of Clinical Effectiveness.

196
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:15,170
They review procedures, drugs and make an explicit decision with public input.

197
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,150
And in America, we're entirely opposed to that. But we do it all the time.

198
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,190
We just do it kind of in secret. Right.

199
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:29,120
Because every if you read your health benefit coverage, it says your health plan will only pay for what is medically necessary.

200
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:34,430
Now, who decides what's medically necessary? Right. And we don't have that public debate in this country.

201
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:40,280
And, you know, we like to live with a lot of myths, which is that we can pay for everything, for everybody.

202
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,430
You know, maybe we think we can live forever. I don't know.

203
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:48,590
But, you know, other countries seem to have a more realistic view that there are tradeoffs that need to be made.

204
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,909
And we just don't like tradeoffs in this country. And I think that's, you know, going back to your question,

205
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:59,840
I think the challenge with providing universal coverage is it necessarily involves tradeoffs.

206
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,389
We pay more in taxes, we pay more in some way. We have fewer benefits.

207
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,630
I mean, there are there are very clear ways to get to universal coverage.

208
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:14,210
We just don't seem to like the tradeoffs involved. Well, it's the old you can pay me now or you can pay me later.

209
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:21,290
And I was thinking when Scott was talking about whether the insurance covers it or not, frequently in emergency situations,

210
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:28,819
people end up getting those bills, don't have the insurance coverage and not not an infrequent number of cases.

211
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,080
They end up filing for bankruptcy. And one of the fascinating things to me,

212
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:40,220
I believe I read somewhere that the medical costs were responsible for about a third of bankruptcies before the Affordable Care Act.

213
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,680
Before the Affordable Care Act. Yes. And the Affordable Care Act has actually reduced that quite significantly.

214
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,309
And if people lose coverage in the current political environment, who knows what the future holds?

215
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:52,670
But it could go back up. But yes, but the interesting thing about it,

216
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:59,719
I remember reading a book that was very influential in my thinking where a guy was if the journalist was going across,

217
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,930
I think it was a half a dozen different countries. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

218
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:09,499
And he had a bad shoulder. Yes. And the question is how he was going to be treated in each of these different countries.

219
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:15,559
And one of the really interesting aspects of when he talked to people in the other countries and talked about medical bankruptcy,

220
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,400
they'd scratch their heads. What are you talking about? Yeah, there was no such thing.

221
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,630
They never heard of the concept.

222
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:26,450
And yet we had this large percentage of people who are forced into bankruptcy because they can't pay their medical bills.

223
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:35,540
Yeah, we got a lot to work on, folks. This is one thing I've always liked about public health is we have a lot of

224
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,080
challenges in front of us that are always going to be challenges out there.

225
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:46,280
But we've also had a lot of huge successes actually in each of the areas that you work in, we've seen some great successes,

226
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:52,219
and I think the people who are watching this particular discussion are going to be

227
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,450
the ones to make some of those changes occur and hopefully make some improvements.

228
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:02,120
Yeah. So with that, I want to thank each of you for what I think has been a very stimulating conversation.

229
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:07,640
You've really offered us a great number of insights and certainly perspectives on these difficult issues.

230
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:16,070
And I hope I hope for the sake of the people out there watching, that you now have a sense of some of the issues for the future of public health,

231
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,530
and that you take the insights and perspectives you've heard from our colleagues here into

232
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:26,150
account as you consider the impact of public health in our country and around our world.

233
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,350
Thank you.
