4
00:00:23,876 --> 00:00:35,948
It is my honor to host this lectureship and I would like to begin by saying a few words about David Schottenfeld on who's honor this lectureship is endowed.

5
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:46,600

00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:57,954
Trained in internal medicine, medical oncology, epidemiology, and preventive medicine, Dr. Schottenfeld is a giant in the field of cancer epidemiology.

7
00:00:57,954 --> 00:01:03,913
He joined the University of Michigan in 1986 as Chair of the epidemiology department,

8

He served as director of this very program, the Summer Session in Epidemiology, between 1988 and 2004.

10
00:01:18,485 --> 00:01:24,408
His scholarly contributions to the field are reflected in over 300 publications,

11
00:01:24,408 --> 00:01:32,434
including 10 textbooks and monographs, some of which are considered “classics” in field of cancer epidemiology.

12
00:01:32,434 --> 00:01:40,134
Professor Schottenfeld is the recipient of multiple awards including the Academic Career Award in Preventive Oncology

(Applause)

34
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:35,028
Thank you. great to be here great to speak to live human beings.

35
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:47,028
Always great pleasure to be back in Michigan I did as Eduardo said I'm a graduate of proud graduate of the school in 1995 benefited from fantastic training here.

36
00:04:47,028 --> 00:04:53,028
Including from Dr. Schottenfeld, who was a great role model of professionalism and gentility and class.

37
00:04:53,028 --> 00:05:01,028
So I really appreciated knowing him I didn't work directly with him but I was influenced by him and very honored.

38
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:11,028
Therefore, to speak in this symposium. I was also influenced greatly by other faculty other than my advisor, Sherman James

39
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:17,028
Including this guy Jim Koopman back when I was a student at school, just looked like this like that.

40
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:22,028
Oh, the building, you see, there can have all this new stuff that has come since.

41
00:05:22,028 --> 00:05:30,028
And I took this class in my last year. the philosophical basis of epidemiologic analysis which is a great title for a course, you know.

42
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:32,028
I wish I could teach that course I don't have a chance to teach that.

43
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:46,028
But it was great to take and the lesson I take from this is, don't pay any attention to the student evaluations at the end of a course. because we we did not appreciate really what we were getting and we didn't

44
00:05:46,028 --> 00:05:52,028
appreciate Dr. Koopman. We thought he was kind of weird and scary, and you know we just do.

45
00:05:52,028 --> 00:06:03,028
He. He tried to get us to think hard about things and to challenge our training, and to think critically, and that wasn't a very comfortable thing for students, so we tended not to appreciate it very much but 30 years.

46
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:06,028
Out. Now I see that this is the foundation for what i'm going to talk about today.

47
00:06:06,028 --> 00:06:12,028
They're thinking critically about the tools in our field. and the philosophical basis for the tools in our field.

48
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:17,028
So this is exactly what got me going in the field, and I can appreciate that now in a way that I could not appreciate it.

49
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:21,028
When I took the class, so that's a lesson for you just ignore what students say.

50
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:29,028
They don't know. I mean you you should Listen to what students say 30 years later, not at the time. that they finish the course.

51
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:39,028
Okay, one of the things that you said to us one of the kinds of statement provocative statement that you would say that they got me thinking, and i'm still wrestling with it is 1 point he said he was so angry because

52
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:45,028
statisticians had ruined epidemiology. it's, you know, shocked us at the time.

53
00:06:45,028 --> 00:06:48,028
But now thinking about it, you know. What was he trying to say?

54
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:52,028
And what is the relationship between statistics and epidemiology?

55
00:06:52,028 --> 00:06:56,028
Well, how how do quantitative sciences engage with the world, and try to?

56
00:06:56,028 --> 00:07:02,028
Make public health discoveries. they need random samples because you can't observe the whole world right.

57
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:06,028
So you have to try to grab pieces of the world and observe them.

58
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:09,028
And then think about the data being generated by probability distributions.

59
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:23,028
You know your chances of seeing this or that and and and grabbing one kind of person or another, and then thinking about those distributions in terms of their measures of central tendency or means, they're spread and then looking at

60
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:31,028
correlations and associations between variables specifying models which are ways of smoothing over that those relationships.

61
00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:41,028
And then eventually hopefully coming to some kind of a causal inference and saying, You know, if I intervene in the in the world on variable A. it's going to have this impact on variable B that's that's usually where

62
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:47,028
we want to get to these statistical models that we estimate are just ways of smoothing over the data.

63
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:58,028
The the actual data look like some kind of scatter like this and There's some kind of tendency between the exposure of interest, and the outcome was very hard to convey that information to somebody.

64
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:01,028
You can't you have to show them the picture you can't really do inference on this.

65
00:08:01,028 --> 00:08:13,028
If I want to make some difference between the parameters and my data set that I'm estimating and parameters in the superpopulation of the source population to give rise to these data want to make some inference is hard to do it on the on those raw points so I engage in

66
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:19,028
some kind of fantasy to smooth over that. I say something hypothetical like.

67
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:24,028
Suppose everything in the world is a straight line it's a ridiculous statement that everything is the world industry is a straight line.

68
00:08:24,028 --> 00:08:29,028
But if it is a straight line, then I can represent that relationship with just 2 parameters instead of all those dots.

69
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:38,028
I just have to know the 0 and beta one, and I know exactly where that line is, and then I can think about perturbing that line in some way. right?

70
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:41,028
So the adjustments we make to that model

71
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:49,028
To that crude model. I just ways of dealing with distortions of some kind that represent some kind of impropriety. right?

72
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,028
We want to improve the interpretability somehow, or the precision.

73
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:54,028
So we wiggle that line now here's my big animation.

74
00:08:54,028 --> 00:09:04,028
Yeah. very fancy. Okay. So there are a number of targets we can have for this kind of inference.

75
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:09,028
We could be interested in the real world, you know, So that surveillance descriptive studies.

76
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:15,028
If I want to say you know how many cases of Covid are there right now in Michigan, you know that's a statement about the real world right now.

77
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:18,028
So I need some kind of data about that it might be some models about that.

78
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:31,028
But i'm talking about the real world. I could and and you know i'm gonna describe that with like the Verb, too, and the present tense like there are this many cases I could be interested in the real world in the future which is something like

79
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,028
clinical prediction, or these models they did of Covid Rates.

80
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:37,028
You know what will happen in the future. This is the real world but just in the future.

81
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:41,028
So i'm gonna use the future tense for that you know i'm gonna say there will be this many cases.

82
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:45,028
That's my prediction, and then there's a hypothetical world in the future.

83
00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:51,028
This is causal infancy, ideologic studies. This is where I have to shift to the conditional tense. Right?

84
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:55,028
I have to say there would be this many cases if we did such and such.

85
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:58,028
But there would be this other number of cases If we did this other thing right?

86
00:09:58,028 --> 00:10:03,028
So that's all we don't have really very much of a subjunctive mood left in English.

87
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:07,028
So we just use the conditional vertense with this word.

88
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:11,028
Should you know or would you know there would be this, and this would have happened.

89
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:19,028
And this is the way we can convey this kind of hypothetical statement in English that we're not talking about the real world anymore. we're talking about.

90
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:27,028
You know, if the moon were made of this cheese this is how high the tide would be, You know, like it's it doesn't have to do with the world we live in it has to do with under some

91
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:35,028
hypothetical circumstances. What we would observe most of the papers that you'll see in Aje Academy from Number 3, right?

92
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:38,028
Obviously number one and number 2 are important, but that's not what most of us do for a living.

93
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:40,028
Now, what are these proprieties that you might want to adjust?

94
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:49,028
For what are the things that we're talking about confounding by a selection bias, information, bias. These are things that we want to wiggle that line to try to take account for it. We have confounding bias our

95
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:53,028
estimates, not really the causal effect we need to.

96
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:57,028
Yeah, I mess with that a little bit in order to remove that bias and have a better estimate.

97
00:10:57,028 --> 00:11:04,028
So these are the structurally the things we're most interested in when we do that, we're we're not, you know.

98
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:08,028
Once we move away from the crew data and we're doing adjusted data.

99
00:11:08,028 --> 00:11:14,028
We're no longer talking about the real world anymore. we're talking about these conditional worlds like if something were true.

100
00:11:14,028 --> 00:11:18,028
That's not true. Then we would see this other thing right the thing we see is the crude data.

101
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:26,028
The other numbers that we get are things that would happen under some circumstances that are not true, but might be useful in some way.

102
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:29,028
So here's a quick example. This is from my friend the picture in Box Book.

103
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:32,028
He had an online book before it was hit him an online book.

104
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:36,028
Now everybody sat around my book, but he was, you know, way back in the 1990 S.

105
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,028
Had This online textbook is an example from that textbook.

106
00:11:39,028 --> 00:11:44,028
So looking at mortality rates here in Miami, in Alaska for white women in 1970

107
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:52,028
And the thing that immediately jumps out, of course, is that Miami is a much more dangerous place to live than the last right.

108
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:56,028
The death rate in Miami is 9 per 1,000 per year in Alaska.

109
00:11:56,028 --> 00:12:05,028
It's less than 3 per 1,000 per year so i'm not moving to Miami because you know I would be subjected to a much higher death rate, and that would be, terrible But if you look at this a little bit more

110
00:12:05,028 --> 00:12:13,028
closely, and you look at the age beside mortality rates you see that they're not really very different right.

111
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:23,028
So if i'm a particular age if I say well, i'm in the 45 to 64 group, and then I see that you know, for the number of deaths that are shown here this trivial difference between the death rate in that

112
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:34,028
age group between the 2 places. So then, i'm not so concerned Conditionally, I was concerned marginally, but now I'm not so concerned, and conditionally so obviously you can see that this is a kind of a distortion of

113
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:37,028
the data to the different age structure in the 2 populations.

114
00:12:37,028 --> 00:12:48,028
Right. We know perfectly well in our every training that 2 populations have a different age structure, and therefore they can have very different overall mortality, even though they have similar 8 specific mortality. right?

115
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:54,028
So we have a tool for dealing with that we have a kind of a fantasy that we engage in, where we say.

116
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:57,028
Well, suppose you know it's not a fair comparison to look at these crew.

117
00:12:57,028 --> 00:13:07,028
Death rates. Suppose these 2 places have the same age distribution so we pick some a distribution like the distribution of the United States, and we say, let's say that Miami had the same age as to the United States, and

118
00:13:07,028 --> 00:13:12,028
Alaska did. and then we can adjust for those things because we consider age distribution to be a nuisance here.

119
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:15,028
It's not really what we're interested in it's not our focus.

120
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:19,028
We have a normative understanding that well, old people are more likely to die.

121
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:25,028
The young people, and we accept that we're not gonna they could big deal about that, because we consider it to be unsurprising.

122
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:35,028
So we just want to get that off the table. We just wanna remove that from our field division, so we can see what would happen under circumstances where that distortion is removed. Right?

123
00:13:35,028 --> 00:13:44,028
The adjustment distorts the data. But it did give us another number, that even though it's not the real world might be more fair, more interesting, make a better story in some sense.

124
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:54,028
So the standardization is trivial I'm sure you all learn it in your first semester. course here we apply the same set of weights for the United States to both Alaska and Miami and we recognize

125
00:13:54,028 --> 00:14:06,028
that this is not the real world anymore right they don't really have the same age, age, distribution. But we asked this hypothetical question, What would we observe if they did? it's a fiction, But a convenient fiction

126
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:09,028
because we judge and see way that it's a fairer comparison.

127
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:22,028
And when we do that, Algebra then we get about 7 deaths per 1,000 in Miami, and about almost 7 deaths per 1,000 in Alaska, and we see that there's no big difference between right so this is

128
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:26,028
what Cdc would report not The crude this is not really.

129
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:34,028
It's not really true that 6.7 people die per 1,000 Alaska, and that 6.9 per 1,000 dye in Miami.

130
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:41,028
Neither of those is a true statement, but it is a way of comparing the 2 in a fictional world in which the institutions are the same.

131
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:47,028
That is, we considers me more informative never forget that it's it's fake right.

132
00:14:47,028 --> 00:14:56,028
Never forget that it's an imaginary world so here's an example, a concrete example of how you can get lost in that for a long time.

133
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:59,028
All the Federal statistics use the 1970 census as the standard right?

134
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:04,028
There's a census in 1,970, and they use the age distribution of that census and the age adjusted everything.

135
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:08,028
1970 cents is, and it got older and older, and the population changed over time.

136
00:15:08,028 --> 00:15:16,028
And finally, by the year 2,000 the country looks so different and it's age distribution and it's ethnic distribution somewhere that they said, Okay, forget the 1,970.

137
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:22,028
Population. Now we're gonna recast everything in terms of the the 2,000 census.

138
00:15:22,028 --> 00:15:26,028
So this happened under George W. Bush. So one statistical artifact.

139
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:37,028
That's interesting is that when you look at disparities on the ratio scale, that when the baseline risk goes up the ratio scale, disparity has to go closer to the null so as a result of

140
00:15:37,028 --> 00:15:47,028
that switch in the population standard. Suddenly racial ethnic disparities decreased by you know, 20% or so under the presidency of George Bush.

141
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:52,028
And he got to say my administration reduced racial disparities in health by 20%.

142
00:15:52,028 --> 00:15:59,028
Right, which you did by changing the age, stand right. In fact, nobody died any less under George Bush, and probably a lot of people died in George Bush.

143
00:15:59,028 --> 00:16:08,028
But he got to it. report statistics that had a lower racial disparity, because the population was older and the baseline risk was higher.

144
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:19,028
So that's just a reminder of the fact that this is all make believe it's not for real when you're interested in health disparities and and health inequities you have to distinguish between those 2

145
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:24,028
because the disparity is just a mathematical statement right it's just, you know.

146
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:28,028
More people die of shark attacks in Miami even in Kansas.

147
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:33,028
Well, that's true, you know but it's just the one number is not equal to the other number.

148
00:16:33,028 --> 00:16:43,028
But that's not necessarily an equity you know like you might say, Well, it makes sense that in Kansas there's not a lot of shark attacks, you know like it's not necessarily an affront to your

149
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:54,028
ethical sensibilities that that exists you have to make a distinct Yeah, you have to distinguish between the things that you want to change because they're unjust, and the things that are on equal for reasons that are not

150
00:16:54,028 --> 00:17:02,028
a nuisance to you. right? so. you could have all kinds of inequalities, and you have to make a judgment about each one.

151
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:10,028
4 people die younger than rich people. Lower social class infants have lower birth, weight smokers get more lung cancer than non smokers.

152
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:16,028
Women live longer than men, you know. I might consider it to be underfront to my sensibilities that women live longer than men.

153
00:17:16,028 --> 00:17:19,028
But other people might not find that to be so disturbing you know.

154
00:17:19,028 --> 00:17:24,028
So it's a subjective judgment about which of these things is acceptable.

155
00:17:24,028 --> 00:17:26,028
Which of these things is unacceptable in an ethical sense.

156
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:32,028
Inequities are all about what should be the case. you know. Should it be the case that women with longer than men?

157
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:43,028
That's that's an ethical judgment that's not statistical judgment. So that's the difference between the inequality and the inequity yeah, adjustment often obscures these things in ways that take for

158
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:52,028
granted certain things as acceptable or unacceptable and we have to critically challenge those things and think about whether that's the imaginary world we really want to talk about.

159
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:56,028
So I was reading a news magazine, and I came across this figure a couple of years ago.

160
00:17:56,028 --> 00:18:03,028
This shows, test scores for kids in different states, and the adjust the crew than the adjusted test score.

161
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:09,028
And you see immediately that there's some states you know that I do in reality.

162
00:18:09,028 --> 00:18:18,028
Do. Okay, but when they adjust the test score then suddenly they're doing really badly right, and other States where they're doing really badly.

163
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:22,028
But when they adjust the test score then they're doing just fine, you know.

164
00:18:22,028 --> 00:18:25,028
So, makes you wonder like, what is this adjustment all about?

165
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:29,028
And what are, what are, what nuisance are they trying to get rid of?

166
00:18:29,028 --> 00:18:35,028
There. So this you know, this is a a survey that's given by the national assessment of educational progress.

167
00:18:35,028 --> 00:18:38,028
Yeah. and This is reported by the urban. Yeah.

168
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:50,028
The urban institute and they say well fundamental problem here is that we, I want to judge how well schools are doing in educating kids, and it's not fair to a school that they're these demographic differences.

169
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:53,028
You know some districts are poor and some districts are rich.

170
00:18:53,028 --> 00:18:57,028
Some States are poor, some States are rich, they have different demographics, you know.

171
00:18:57,028 --> 00:19:02,028
Some States have more African Americans, some have no african Americans and so forth.

172
00:19:02,028 --> 00:19:08,028
And So We're just going to adjust for all these things demographic differences model because the teachers and the schools have no control over that.

173
00:19:08,028 --> 00:19:11,028
It's not their fault right so they had this huge model.

174
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:16,028
I looked at the appendix of this paper, and the model has, you know, 100 variables in it, or something.

175
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:20,028
But what's really doing most of the work there is race and social class, you know.

176
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:24,028
So Louisiana, in in reality is penalized.

177
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:35,028
Does it have a lot of poor black kids and when you adjust for that, and give them the distribution of 4 black kids that they would have, you know, at at at according to the United States distribution.

178
00:19:35,028 --> 00:19:39,028
Then they actually look like they're doing much better and Hawaii has the opposite situation.

179
00:19:39,028 --> 00:19:42,028
They don't have any port black it's a very few few.

180
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:45,028
And so what you adjust for that, then they should be doing much better than they do.

181
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:49,028
So these adjustments go in different directions so you might say well, that's a more fair way of looking at that.

182
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:54,028
But you have to realize that the premise here. is that like poor black kids are inedigible like.

183
00:19:54,028 --> 00:20:00,028
Well, it's not you know it's impossible to imagine that they could be educating those people because it's just, you know.

184
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:08,028
Take that off the table, as part. of the disparity That's just a given that you couldn't possibly have a high test score through a black black kid. so we'll just you know given that let's see how the schools are

185
00:20:08,028 --> 00:20:17,028
doing. You know that that is a kind of a terrible statement that that model is making about what we can consider acceptable and what we don't consider acceptable.

186
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:21,028
And yet they buried into this picture that we're looking at. That's exactly the assumption that you're making.

187
00:20:21,028 --> 00:20:25,028
So you have to be a little bit concerned about what's on the table, and what's off the tape?

188
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:30,028
I was blown away in 2,008 by this paper that came out of statistics and medicine like one, and colleagues.

189
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:34,028
That actually formalize this in a causal framework.

190
00:20:34,028 --> 00:20:39,028
I'd never seen any other paper do that before. and honestly There's not very many papers since this paper is not cited very much.

191
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:50,028
It's not very well known, but they put this all together, based on an Iom definition of healthcare disparities that said, Look, we're interested in, you know, the history of medicine, considering racial disparities.

192
00:20:50,028 --> 00:21:00,028
They're interested in differences in quality of healthcare that are not due to access where they're clinical needs of preference or appropriate as an intervention, because they want to know like you know are you

193
00:21:00,028 --> 00:21:07,028
giving patients. the right you know blood pressure. medication or something like that if the patient can't get to the clinic That's not the doctor's fault.

194
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:12,028
So they say we're take that off the table you know those access issues, those preference issues that's not our concern.

195
00:21:12,028 --> 00:21:16,028
Right now we're only interested in the things that are due to the clinical care, Right?

196
00:21:16,028 --> 00:21:21,028
So that definition is inherently causal, because you have to know what difference is due to one thing versus due to the other.

197
00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:27,028
I mean, how much should the difference in care? is due to the fact that people couldn't get to the clinic versus how they were treated in the clinic?

198
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:31,028
So you have to have a causal decomposition of that process.

199
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:37,028
It's also valuable because you have to say like well. It's not their fault about this, but it is their fault about that, and I can consider this. acceptable.

200
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:41,028
But I don't consider that acceptable Once you start doing that it's all about your values. You know.

201
00:21:41,028 --> 00:21:44,028
Should these people die more than those people? should these people get this service.

202
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:51,028
This is all a subjective, ethical decision about what you think should be in your imaginary world.

203
00:21:51,028 --> 00:22:00,028
So they propose this statistical model, where you have to distinguish the covariance into allowable versus not allowable categories.

204
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:12,028
The allowable covariates are the ones that are considered justifiable to cause a difference, you know, like volition preference things like that, and the remaining Covariates are not allowable

205
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:20,028
this is like outside of the the agency of the individual, of the clinician or the patient, you know.

206
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:30,028
So if if I say i'm obese because I like to eat well, that's my preference, you know, and no clinician can be blamed for that or no health system being going for that, you know but if I say i'm

207
00:22:30,028 --> 00:22:36,028
obese, because healthy food is not available in my neighborhood, and so I'm forced to eat food that is not healthy for me.

208
00:22:36,028 --> 00:22:41,028
Well, then, I don't have agency in that situation and then suddenly that becomes not allowable, you know, So we have to.

209
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:50,028
We're making like a moral judgment about like whether it's your fault, or someone else's fault right? once we're start blaming people for you know conditions.

210
00:22:50,028 --> 00:22:56,028
You know how much of this condition is your fault when people die of smoking related disease because they were smokers?

211
00:22:56,028 --> 00:23:00,028
Is that their fault? or is that the fault of marketing is the fault of neighborhood?

212
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:11,028
Problems of smoking and and cope needing to have a coping mechanism because of stress like it is a very complicated question about what's allowable, what's not allowable and ethical situation there.

213
00:23:11,028 --> 00:23:15,028
So a lot of practical problems in defining this demarcation between these 2 sets of variables.

214
00:23:15,028 --> 00:23:21,028
And Obviously it's going to depend on what question You're asking the one model to the next one paper to the next.

215
00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:23,028
You're going to change your definitions of what's in each group.

216
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:29,028
So access Related factors are allowable when you're studying the patient clinician interaction.

217
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:32,028
But they don't become allowable when you're studying the the

218
00:23:32,028 --> 00:23:35,028
The effectiveness on some health system in its entirety. Right?

219
00:23:35,028 --> 00:23:45,028
So you You know this is all contacts, context, specific but statistical adjustment here functions as the way by which you blame people blame institutions.

220
00:23:45,028 --> 00:23:52,028
You know this one is your fault. this one is not your fault. All about the apportionment, the statistical apportionment of blame.

221
00:23:52,028 --> 00:23:56,028
Right, Cisco, just since become a kind of moral app solution.

222
00:23:56,028 --> 00:23:59,028
Right. Oh, that that one's Okay, it's just not your fault.

223
00:23:59,028 --> 00:24:10,028
This one. Yeah, you that ones are new. these adjustments not only create imaginary populations, but they can create imaginary populations that can't exist.

224
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:20,028
You know like that are logically impossible. and one of the important points of this drawn article that's a little bit hard to understand and read.

225
00:24:20,028 --> 00:24:34,028
The article is that if you had allowable variants that affect not a variables that affect non allowable variables, then you would condition on those things you would adjust for them the way that we typically do but it's not necessarily the case that

226
00:24:34,028 --> 00:24:37,028
the allowable variables affect the non allowable variables, and not the other way around.

227
00:24:37,028 --> 00:24:45,028
If the not allowable variables affect the allowable variables. then you can't actually use standard statistics to get this estimate.

228
00:24:45,028 --> 00:24:54,028
You need a marginal disparity which standardizes over the intermediates, and you can only do that with Can you ever do this thing? That's in the middle of the slide?

229
00:24:54,028 --> 00:25:11,028
Thank you. Yeah. walking the text there you have to use like Robin's G formula methods in order to condition well, not condition on in order to standardize for these intermediate variables without conditioning on them

230
00:25:11,028 --> 00:25:15,028
that would give you the wrong answer. Right? So not too many people know about this.

231
00:25:15,028 --> 00:25:20,028
I mean, you look in the literature. Not too many people have cited the drawn article, and not too many people are aware of this distinction.

232
00:25:20,028 --> 00:25:24,028
I can only think of a couple of papers that do.

233
00:25:24,028 --> 00:25:34,028
This one is Hopkins is a guy named John Jackson and he he's very aware of this and his papers reflect this distinction, and he talks about this a lot, but he's like one of the only ones you know

234
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:44,028
it's pretty rare that people take into account of that It can certainly be true, like you can imagine situations where one would, you know one direction will be true in the other direction would not be true.

235
00:25:44,028 --> 00:25:53,028
And an important point of the drawn article whether they give examples where, if you analyze the wrong way, you'll get the opposite disparity right, and they consider this an example of Simpson's paradox you know

236
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:56,028
where the marginal and the conditional are an opposite size of the novel.

237
00:25:56,028 --> 00:26:05,028
So you thought black people were going worse. and then you do this conditioning, and you know the right way instead of the wrong way, and then turns out that white people are getting worse or something like that.

238
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:11,028
Like you can get the opposite answer, because you adjust if it is the wrong way, so it can be very consequential in in their examples.

239
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:23,028
We don't know how consequential it is in the real world you know because people don't right so it's it's kind of remarkable Okay, i'm gonna go through what do I have about half an

240
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:30,028
hour. I'm gonna go through 5 papers very quickly that represent these kinds of you know examples of adjustment.

241
00:26:30,028 --> 00:26:37,028
Now practice. some of these are reasonably good papers. Some of these are bad papers. Most of them deal with racial disparities.

242
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:40,028
Except for the last one, it was just so dumb I had to put it in, even though it was some racial disparities.

243
00:26:40,028 --> 00:26:51,028
But just to kind of quickly. I hope I can get through all 5, and just quickly give you a sense of how things can go wrong, because people are not thinking about this distinction between the real world and the and the imaginary world.

244
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:58,028
And they forget that they are making an imaginary statement you know if the moon were made us, was Jesus what would happen?

245
00:26:58,028 --> 00:27:06,028
Well you know like it's not so this thing that you're saying is not really that applicable to the world that I live in.

246
00:27:06,028 --> 00:27:12,028
Okay, So the first one is on racial disparities and asp. So you have these authors writing and 27 team.

247
00:27:12,028 --> 00:27:24,028
They say, Okay, African Americans have greater burden than as like compared to white subjects interested in Sweden airway, inflammatory phenotypes and African American kids versus white kids treated or not

248
00:27:24,028 --> 00:27:36,028
treated with inhale ported right? So they define this this eocenophilic type as greater than 2% eosenfills in the speedum, and or less than 2% as an

249
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:41,028
inflammatory thing is that this is not their invention like this is a thing that exists in the literature.

250
00:27:41,028 --> 00:27:47,028
So they use this outcome to talk about you know what inflammatory type. Are these kids?

251
00:27:47,028 --> 00:28:01,028
They're about 200 and 64 African American kids out of the 1,000 little more than a 1,000 people in the study, and it's very clear that the African American kids are sicker than the white kids right They have

252
00:28:01,028 --> 00:28:08,028
worse forced, expiratory volume. They have a higher it, greater proportion with uncontrolled asthma.

253
00:28:08,028 --> 00:28:16,028
Right. So very clearly they're not comparable in the sense that they have more severe disease markers and disease.

254
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:25,028
Okay, So They're interested in are the easiest synthetic subtypees in parliamentary subdives different between the 2 populations, and the answer is, No, they are not different.

255
00:28:25,028 --> 00:28:31,028
You can see here is a picture of populations in which they are not different. Right?

256
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:35,028
They have the inhaled port of the St. Right, positive and negative subjects.

257
00:28:35,028 --> 00:28:44,028
Stratified here. it's not silly there's not really that many people that are not on inhale cortical steroids here. but they do the stratification for whatever reason and there's not a difference

258
00:28:44,028 --> 00:28:48,028
right, and that could be the end of the story. except Then they wouldn't get into a high impact factor journal.

259
00:28:48,028 --> 00:28:56,028
They wouldn't get a fancy press release or anything that would be not very exciting to say we looked at this, and there was no difference like that would not be considered news to anybody.

260
00:28:56,028 --> 00:29:00,028
So what do they do? They make a logistic regression model They adjust for a bunch of things and lower.

261
00:29:00,028 --> 00:29:07,028
And behold, here among the kids on inhale critical steroids, you see

262
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:12,028
This difference just squeaked in below point o 5 there, thank God!

263
00:29:12,028 --> 00:29:23,028
Because then they got right into that fancy journal. So they make the statement that you know the black kids are 60% higher. more likely to be in this.

264
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:26,028
Es and asphilic inflammatory. some type.

265
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:29,028
After adjusting for age sexy topics that is Pmi.

266
00:29:29,028 --> 00:29:31,028
So what are they saying? They're saying Okay, you know in the real world?

267
00:29:31,028 --> 00:29:42,028
These things are not different. But if we lived in an imaginary world in which these kids were not more severely sick, then they would have to have a higher Es, and they would have a higher prevalence of this inflammatory

268
00:29:42,028 --> 00:29:52,028
subtype in order to fit the data, if they were not sicker. they would have to have more of this other phenotype like That's the state There's nothing to do with the world that We live in nothing to do with the

269
00:29:52,028 --> 00:29:56,028
world that kids live in. But it's a statement about what would happen if they all had the same Dmi.

270
00:29:56,028 --> 00:30:10,028
And they all have the same force. Secretary Pot. Right? Okay.

271
00:30:10,028 --> 00:30:24,028
So the principle finding reported is that there are race, related differences in ethnicity like airway information and asthmatic patients treated fall statement is the conclusion of the paper, but it's a false state because There aren't

272
00:30:24,028 --> 00:30:27,028
any differences. there would be differences if all the kids were equally sick.

273
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:33,028
But they're not the only potential limitation they could think of as well.

274
00:30:33,028 --> 00:30:40,028
We we picked race by asking the kids what race they were, instead of like looking at their genetic race, which is a crazy statement as well.

275
00:30:40,028 --> 00:30:46,028
But of all the things you could say that went wrong in this paper that's like the last thing I would think is actually a problem.

276
00:30:46,028 --> 00:30:57,028
So there are state of conclusion. African American subjects extended greater use of it, like airway inflammation, which might explain the rate of asthma, or which again, has nothing to do with the real world.

277
00:30:57,028 --> 00:31:07,028
Right. They don't actually exhibit greater ecosystems types.

278
00:31:07,028 --> 00:31:12,028
Okay. The press release, of course, is even more divorced from reality than the published paper, as well as paper is subject.

279
00:31:12,028 --> 00:31:16,028
Peer review. The press releases. You know they can say anything they want.

280
00:31:16,028 --> 00:31:24,028
So in the press release. They say African Americans are less responsive to asthma treatment and more likely to die for the condition because they have a unique type of airway inflammation, right?

281
00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:26,028
It meant from being a 60% more prevalent to being unique.

282
00:31:26,028 --> 00:31:31,028
Only African American kids have this thing right, which is even more false.

283
00:31:31,028 --> 00:31:35,028
And and then they say, you know, this suggests that maybe Ics is not the right therapy for them.

284
00:31:35,028 --> 00:31:45,028
They need other therapies. you know it makes me think there might be some drug company sponsoring here, or something, cause it's a strange statement, because they didn't study the effect of the therapy.

285
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:50,028
They stratified on therapy. But the conclusion has nothing to do with the analysis is conducted.

286
00:31:50,028 --> 00:31:54,028
Now, why did they adjust for those things? What are they trying to get rid of like, I guess?

287
00:31:54,028 --> 00:32:07,028
Confounding right. So you know, if you had a confounder, if you had a confounder, that was a cause of the exposure with your exposure, your race, if you had a confounded that was a causer was

288
00:32:07,028 --> 00:32:11,028
correlated with the exposure, but not affected by the exposure, and also calls at the outcome.

289
00:32:11,028 --> 00:32:21,028
Then you'd want to condition on that and get the effect of you know, setting the kids to be black or white like you would in a randomized trial of of the exposure.

290
00:32:21,028 --> 00:32:25,028
So that's the idea. Presumably they say that these things are confounders in their model.

291
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:37,028
Okay, but obviously, can't adjust for things that are affected by the exposure in generals same problem that the drawn paper talked about in the sense that you know the the things affected by the exposure are part of the mechanism by

292
00:32:37,028 --> 00:32:41,028
which the exposure has the effect that they have Yeah, I was interested in the effect of smoking on lung cancer.

293
00:32:41,028 --> 00:32:50,028
I'm interested in like a trial where I set people to smoke versus. I said, People not just smoke, and if I adjust for the intermediates on that pathway like how much tar is the depositing your line. I said Okay, let's compare

294
00:32:50,028 --> 00:32:55,028
smokers and non smokers, with the same amount of tar in their lungs, you know.

295
00:32:55,028 --> 00:33:04,028
So I find some non smoker from I don't know Delhi, or something, you know, who's breathing in particular matter of 600. so they look like a smoker and I can bear them to a Michigan smoker, or something and

296
00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:09,028
I said, Okay, now, I have a comparable smoker non smoker and smoking doesn't do anything for lung cancer.

297
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:18,028
Well, that would not be a useful statement. about the real world right because i'm getting rid of the mechanism by which the exposure as a fact.

298
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:30,028
Now, i'm not so concerned about age and sex here. But you know if if this is a study about race effects, you know, through differential treatment, you know, black kids and like kids might not have the same environment.

299
00:33:30,028 --> 00:33:33,028
That that differential environment is gonna affect Bmi enforced expiratory volume.

300
00:33:33,028 --> 00:33:43,028
How severe their asthma diseases right so saying like Oh, but if they weren't white, they weren't black kids they wouldn't have this you know, synthetic subtype Well, they also wouldn't have more

301
00:33:43,028 --> 00:33:46,028
severe, uncontrolled asthma you know but you're adjusting that way, taking that off the table.

302
00:33:46,028 --> 00:33:52,028
So that's part of the mechanism by which they end up with the outcome that they have it's It's crazy.

303
00:33:52,028 --> 00:33:55,028
It doesn't make any sense logically these are not confounders.

304
00:33:55,028 --> 00:33:59,028
The intermediates. at least the the measures of disease of area.

305
00:33:59,028 --> 00:34:03,028
Okay, that was kind of a stinky paper so you know I don't love that one.

306
00:34:03,028 --> 00:34:06,028
But here's like what I consider to be a reasonably good paper.

307
00:34:06,028 --> 00:34:22,028
These are they seem to know what they're doing and this seems is a good journal, and I think this is a perfectly legitimate analysis here, and they're interested in in disparities in cervical cancer and

308
00:34:22,028 --> 00:34:32,028
the misclassification of the the denominator population who's at risk, and they observe the previously published surveillance of circle cancer mortality inequalities and not taken into consideration the race

309
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:41,028
specific prevalence of his directive. And basically if you have population of people without a cervix, then they're not really at risk for ever getting cervical cancer.

310
00:34:41,028 --> 00:34:48,028
So when you compare the disparities, these offices saying you shouldn't really have those people and denominator, this is just a big racial disparity, and who's got a hysterectomy.

311
00:34:48,028 --> 00:34:58,028
This thing is very misleading. So they used, brfss or some other source of data about his directly prevalence to try to remove those people from the population.

312
00:34:58,028 --> 00:35:04,028
Denominator, and in black women in the age standardized rate, then changed from

313
00:35:04,028 --> 00:35:08,028
It it about double, you know, So it makes a big difference.

314
00:35:08,028 --> 00:35:11,028
A lot of people actually in the denominators who are not at higher risk.

315
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:16,028
And it changed quite a bit for ways. So the overall racial disparity here changed by, they say, 44% right?

316
00:35:16,028 --> 00:35:25,028
So that's kind of interesting you know like I I think this is a useful analysis in some ways, and they seem to have done a good job of it.

317
00:35:25,028 --> 00:35:33,028
But they never consider the ramifications of defining hysterectomy as a permissible covariant in the sense that Oh, yeah, well, that's just the way it is you know black.

318
00:35:33,028 --> 00:35:44,028
Women get much more historically. than white. women and given that that's the reality like, Let's you know, just take that off the table, and just accept that I mean that's part of the same racial discrimination as Well.

319
00:35:44,028 --> 00:35:49,028
Why should black women get more his directives than white women like It's not necessarily something you want to take off the table.

320
00:35:49,028 --> 00:35:52,028
Not to mention the fact that it actually does prevent the outcome.

321
00:35:52,028 --> 00:35:59,028
I mean not like i'm suggesting that everybody should get a hysterectomy, so they don't be like it does have an actual causal effect on the outcome.

322
00:35:59,028 --> 00:36:09,028
So it's not just a nuisance like it it is a mechanism by which the outcome is prevented, or, if still have a survey's not prevented.

323
00:36:09,028 --> 00:36:14,028
So it definitely shifts attention away from something that is part of the problem.

324
00:36:14,028 --> 00:36:19,028
I'm not saying that what they said was wrong i'm just saying that it's it's not the whole story, and you might be interested in other parts of that story.

325
00:36:19,028 --> 00:36:22,028
As well, which the papers kind of lead you away from.

326
00:36:22,028 --> 00:36:26,028
The the adjusted analysis leads you away from so high risk.

327
00:36:26,028 --> 00:36:28,028
His directory rate in black women is not an artifact.

328
00:36:28,028 --> 00:36:31,028
In fact it out, but a real part of the complete picture of racial disparity.

329
00:36:31,028 --> 00:36:37,028
Obviously, I like, I said. I want to give more people hysterectomies to avoid circle cancer.

330
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:48,028
But it is actually a real thing. it's not it's not spurious. the point is tangible implications of his directing policy for simple cancer at real clear racial disparity in both outcomes may get

331
00:36:48,028 --> 00:36:52,028
a real component of the overall disparity, not just a statistical nuisance.

332
00:36:52,028 --> 00:36:58,028
Now once again, Press really gets this confused and so you read the headline.

333
00:36:58,028 --> 00:37:05,028
It's a certical cancer death rates are much higher than font, which No, it's not what the paper said They said the disparity was higher than what was thought.

334
00:37:05,028 --> 00:37:12,028
The death rate like It's not like there are more people dying a cervical cancer than you realize right by taking people out of the nominated.

335
00:37:12,028 --> 00:37:17,028
You don't actually make more people die of a disease like It's not actually the case that the death rate is higher.

336
00:37:17,028 --> 00:37:23,028
Press release. To put a new analysis reveals risk of dying from serverable cancer is higher than thought.

337
00:37:23,028 --> 00:37:29,028
So not correct. right prevention of circle pants by his directivity is is real prevention.

338
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:36,028
It's not spurious. prevention and so you have all these headlines that come on circle cancer, death rates shockingly underestimated.

339
00:37:36,028 --> 00:37:42,028
It's not true right again if everybody had his directivity Then the circle cancer definitely would be 0.

340
00:37:42,028 --> 00:37:46,028
So it's not the case the def rate is underestimated so it's completely confused.

341
00:37:46,028 --> 00:37:52,028
But that's you could say it's not the office fault, except that, like they probably read the press release before it went out.

342
00:37:52,028 --> 00:37:57,028
But okay. third example, this just happened a couple of weeks ago.

343
00:37:57,028 --> 00:38:01,028
So some New York times. columnist. I mean I don't know anything about this guy.

344
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:09,028
David Leon Hart, apparently writes about covid a fair amount in the New York Times, and you run an article saying it's kind of interesting. at the beginning of the pandemic There was This big Excess of

345
00:38:09,028 --> 00:38:20,028
minority deaths from from covid 19 and that's really changed, you know, in the vaccine era as more and more people got vaccinated, and the vaccine holdouts tended to be older white

346
00:38:20,028 --> 00:38:27,028
people. this has shifted. So he showed the data here in which he showed that you know Whites used to be in the red line here.

347
00:38:27,028 --> 00:38:39,028
You know, kind of low compared to black desk at the beginning of the pandemic by the end of the pandemic they're at the top there in terms of the mortality.

348
00:38:39,028 --> 00:38:43,028
Rate. So you know, he thought that was an interesting observation.

349
00:38:43,028 --> 00:38:49,028
He talked about the political, the underlying political context in which he thought that this was happening.

350
00:38:49,028 --> 00:38:54,028
He showed it here for the higher day rates among people 65, and older.

351
00:38:54,028 --> 00:39:05,028
And he says the main corporate is politics. About 60% of Republican adults are vaccinated compared to 75% independence and 90% of Democrats. And so he sees this correlation between race and and political

352
00:39:05,028 --> 00:39:08,028
affiliation. And so this is this point of this article.

353
00:39:08,028 --> 00:39:16,028
So reasonable to me. And then there was a an online attack against this article.

354
00:39:16,028 --> 00:39:24,028
First from someone named Cape and Jetalina, who publishes a blog called your local epidemiologist, and she says this is misinformation.

355
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:31,028
The contact missing here is simpson's paradox for an association between 2 variables emerges disappears or reverses. When the population is divided into the subgroups.

356
00:39:31,028 --> 00:39:35,028
We have to take into account and founders. And she said, The issue here is age, right.

357
00:39:35,028 --> 00:39:40,028
If you look at the age of adjusted rates, the whites are not going to be on top anymore.

358
00:39:40,028 --> 00:39:44,028
You have to do the H. This is what we did with the Miami and the Alaska.

359
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:49,028
Example, said, You have to age adjust this these crude rates, or he did do an age stratified.

360
00:39:49,028 --> 00:39:52,028
And just you know, above 65 and below 65, he said.

361
00:39:52,028 --> 00:39:57,028
That's not enough. if the age adjusted rates and the New York Times is wrong.

362
00:39:57,028 --> 00:40:06,028
This is misinformation, and then they're followed just an absolute like war on Twitter of people who are out for blood.

363
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:10,028
They just wanted the head of David Landhart Greg Gonzalez from Harvard.

364
00:40:10,028 --> 00:40:14,028
This is your responsible wrong misinformation full stop no excuse. Why does this happen?

365
00:40:14,028 --> 00:40:18,028
No one's actually checks this man no one checks his analysis inexcusable.

366
00:40:18,028 --> 00:40:21,028
Someone else's undergrad level science reporting is someone.

367
00:40:21,028 --> 00:40:26,028
Please get this garbage out of the new York times somebody who's handled is data driven Md.

368
00:40:26,028 --> 00:40:31,028
Says I second the call for retraction it's time to take David Landhart off the covid beat.

369
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:35,028
He's not enough harm, and obviously he's not an expert clearly beyond his expertise.

370
00:40:35,028 --> 00:40:40,028
Get someone who knows what he's talking about right so Landhart responded to this on Twitter.

371
00:40:40,028 --> 00:40:46,028
Which I think is a bad idea i'm on twitter I think it's, you know something is gonna destroy humanity.

372
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:53,028
But he did respond on Twitter, and he basically took a kind of documentical approach, saying, You know, I stand by what I said.

373
00:40:53,028 --> 00:40:57,028
I think jennifer leno's point is also down like if you age adjust that's also interesting.

374
00:40:57,028 --> 00:41:01,028
You know it's another way of looking at the problem it's, you know, blind.

375
00:41:01,028 --> 00:41:04,028
Then describing the elephant like there's another look at this, where you age adjust, and that's also interesting.

376
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:15,028
But I don't think that what I said was wrong and I certainly don't think it's misinformation, and I don't like the fact that you know everybody starts yelling this information when you have you know one picture and by the

377
00:41:15,028 --> 00:41:24,028
way he was showing the real world. Not you know. What would it look like if the ag distribution of blacks was the same as the You know he wishes the actual data in the real world.

378
00:41:24,028 --> 00:41:29,028
Where people live. The Twitter mob was still unsatisfied.

379
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:35,028
They were still out for blood. Yes, the difference between a journalist and a researcher, the difference between novice and an expert that PHD.

380
00:41:35,028 --> 00:41:40,028
Is important, Mister Methodology, David Duran, on this one to track the story.

381
00:41:40,028 --> 00:41:45,028
We need experts Writing about. Covid response is an example of hubris and greg.

382
00:41:45,028 --> 00:41:48,028
Once all this again. David Stock used to come to Simpson's paradox.

383
00:41:48,028 --> 00:41:51,028
You were wrong, have the common decency to say it? Your analysis was flawed.

384
00:41:51,028 --> 00:41:54,028
People have pointed out it's a first year public health student this day.

385
00:41:54,028 --> 00:42:00,028
Now You're doubling. down and this left is after me shick is is deeply disingenuous manipulative right?

386
00:42:00,028 --> 00:42:02,028
They're just like they're mean like people are mean on Twitter.

387
00:42:02,028 --> 00:42:07,028
I don't know it's really a nasty world out there.

388
00:42:07,028 --> 00:42:14,028
Amazing thing about this story, I mean So my perspective on this is basically land, hard's, perspective, which is yes, the age is just.

389
00:42:14,028 --> 00:42:24,028
The rates are interesting and are informative but you know people live and dying the real world, you know this group world, and like, you know, that's that's i'm a journalist like i'm to describe the real world not

390
00:42:24,028 --> 00:42:31,028
imaginary world of the or whatever like. That's not the one i'm interested in the amazing part of this story.

391
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:35,028
Oh, sorry! Let me defend a little bit more the the crude analysis.

392
00:42:35,028 --> 00:42:40,028
There's 2 more arguments here for Why you would not want to further adjust.

393
00:42:40,028 --> 00:42:47,028
One is the same argument of adjusting for intermediates right like you're saying that because of racism we have more covid deaths among blacks, right?

394
00:42:47,028 --> 00:42:50,028
Why do we have shorter life expectancy on blacks because of racism?

395
00:42:50,028 --> 00:42:58,028
So you're saying like Oh, let's imagine a world in which racism doesn't cause any mortality differences, so that the age distributions were the same in that world.

396
00:42:58,028 --> 00:43:03,028
And we there's no racism causing mortality differences. Does racism cause any Covid 19 differences?

397
00:43:03,028 --> 00:43:11,028
That's a crazy hypothesis to entertain you know like It's not necessarily the most sensible one you'd be interested in.

398
00:43:11,028 --> 00:43:17,028
Second reason is, once you leave the real world, and you start working in the imaginary world.

399
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:21,028
Which one do you choose? Which imaginary world do you want to work in like?

400
00:43:21,028 --> 00:43:24,028
He said, Oh, you have to adjust for age. Why stop there?

401
00:43:24,028 --> 00:43:32,028
You know. The argument was that the life expectancy for blacks is lower than whites, which is true, but it's hugely different by state.

402
00:43:32,028 --> 00:43:38,028
You know I have a graph here from a paper of mine from 2019, and you can see that New York and as almost completely eliminated.

403
00:43:38,028 --> 00:43:47,028
It's racial disparity and mortality pretty high back in 1,969. It was one of the highest States. and now it's only one year different.

404
00:43:47,028 --> 00:43:51,028
You know which it should be 0. but it's making a lot of progress compared to other states.

405
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:57,028
Illinois is still above 6 years gap. difference in life expecting blacks and lights.

406
00:43:57,028 --> 00:44:03,028
Huge difference between being from New York and being from illinois So why aren't we adjusting for state right like that?

407
00:44:03,028 --> 00:44:13,028
If you're adjusting for age, one that just and then maybe you should, just for vaccination status or political party, or any other covariance like, how do you know when to stop what's the rule for i've

408
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:19,028
adjusted for enough things. and now I Have the truth and any other model is misinformation like that you're You're on very slippery ground there.

409
00:44:19,028 --> 00:44:23,028
You have nothing to nothing to go on in terms of when your adjustments are now.

410
00:44:23,028 --> 00:44:32,028
Okay, What I started to say was the amazing part of this story for me is that Landhart was completely vindicated by actual analysis of the data. Right?

411
00:44:32,028 --> 00:44:40,028
All of this, Twitter Storm happened in the first couple of days after his articles published, when people sat down and actually downloaded the data from Cdc.

412
00:44:40,028 --> 00:44:43,028
Wonder, and actually did the age adjustments. They found that land.

413
00:44:43,028 --> 00:44:52,028
I was completely right that even in the age adjusted numbers the mortality switched so that whites have higher, more talent. Age adjusted mortality than blacks.

414
00:44:52,028 --> 00:45:00,028
In the most recent months right. He was completely correct in his statements there, and none of the great critics had actually done The age adjusted analysis.

415
00:45:00,028 --> 00:45:08,028
They had just screamed and yelled that if you had done this, you would have seen something else, and i'm not where the next of them went back and apologized to him, or so never mind.

416
00:45:08,028 --> 00:45:14,028
There was one apology I saw by andy Gelman at Columbia, who kind of you know.

417
00:45:14,028 --> 00:45:22,028
Wait. He's got a blog and he waited on the side of the Twitter mob and said, Yeah, this looks pretty bad for the New York Times, and then, June fifteenth, you published another blog.

418
00:45:22,028 --> 00:45:28,028
Entry, in which he said, you know I got that completely wrong I'm so sorry I should not have said that you know this is wrong.

419
00:45:28,028 --> 00:45:35,028
And anyway, so he we at least have the dots to.

420
00:45:35,028 --> 00:45:43,028
Okay. Another example. number 4: talk here. I still have some time Okay.

421
00:45:43,028 --> 00:45:52,028
Good. Another very controversial topic in the news is police shooting black citizens right?

422
00:45:52,028 --> 00:46:03,028
So I think you know the black, wise matter movement, and many other contemporary social movements have it. Its premise that this is a big social problem, and we hear about some serious cases.

423
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:09,028
You know of this kind of police violence that many people considered to be appoint.

424
00:46:09,028 --> 00:46:12,028
And this is a lot of concern about this.

425
00:46:12,028 --> 00:46:23,028
So the most prominent black economist in the country is probably a row and Fryer and Hopkins, but I know it to Harvard, and he published a paper in 2,016 as an Nb.

426
00:46:23,028 --> 00:46:34,028
Er report, and it finally came out in the journal article in 2,019 takes a long time in economics, you know, in epidemiology we ask people to do a review in like a week or 2 weeks. but in economics. they have like a year to do

427
00:46:34,028 --> 00:46:38,028
the review. So it took a while for this to get it to print, but it's printed in 2,019.

428
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:43,028
And he said that yeah, there's some racial differences he did a very detailed data collection in in Texas.

429
00:46:43,028 --> 00:46:55,028
Using police records and all kinds of other source of data is actually really an amazing work of, you know, like getting hold of really interesting data and and analyzing it.

430
00:46:55,028 --> 00:47:02,028
And he said, Yes, there were some racial differences in police treatment of suspects people that they stop to responses. to 9.

431
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:06,028
1 one calls, and things like that like they, you know, retreated more disrespectfully.

432
00:47:06,028 --> 00:47:15,028
Whatever black subject repeated more disrespectfully. But there was no difference, he said, in in in shooting, like fatalities.

433
00:47:15,028 --> 00:47:21,028
Of police shooting. black subjects like you said black subjects are shot less by police than white subjects.

434
00:47:21,028 --> 00:47:27,028
Based on his analysis, which really shocked people and got a lot of headlines like this about

435
00:47:27,028 --> 00:47:30,028
There's no racial difference in shooting and of course the right wing.

436
00:47:30,028 --> 00:47:35,028
Pressing this up, and a lot of people took this and really ran with it.

437
00:47:35,028 --> 00:47:41,028
The interesting thing about his analysis here, is in the red box at the top of the side.

438
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:49,028
He conditioned on encounters with the police, and what he said was, well, of course, actually, in the real world, the police shoot more black people.

439
00:47:49,028 --> 00:47:58,028
This just because the police encounter more black people that's not the police's fault that you know when they go after a suspect the suspect has to be black that's just you know they're doing their policing and

440
00:47:58,028 --> 00:48:01,028
the high crime neighborhoods, and whatever, and they run into more black people.

441
00:48:01,028 --> 00:48:08,028
And first they shoot them, but that that is not fair to blame that on them you have to condition on the interaction.

442
00:48:08,028 --> 00:48:14,028
So Okay, you're there with the police they stopped you or They responded to a call, or whatever, and you and the police are there now.

443
00:48:14,028 --> 00:48:20,028
Given that you're in that interaction. what's the probability you'll be shot by the police, and then condition on that interaction.

444
00:48:20,028 --> 00:48:27,028
The black house ratio is lower then for once right and that's the column at the right hand side there with the odds.

445
00:48:27,028 --> 00:48:37,028
Ratios are like 1 6 8.7 4 and depending on the adjustments that you add in here right so clearly a you know a white disadvantage here, but conditional i'm being stopped and it's

446
00:48:37,028 --> 00:48:51,028
a long paper It's like 30 pages long and he has some discussion about why he does this conditioning, and he basically says, Look, I don't know what is the racial disparity in police stopping people or responding to you

447
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:56,028
know black people versus white people, or you know pulling people over from the tail like being out or like.

448
00:48:56,028 --> 00:49:00,028
There's no way for me to know whether there's racial disparity in that he says

449
00:49:00,028 --> 00:49:10,028
It's been reported in literature as anywhere from blacks being 300 times more likely to be stopped to 50% less likely to be stopped.

450
00:49:10,028 --> 00:49:21,028
So I have no idea what the truth is and so he says solving this is outside the scope of this paper. So i'm not gonna try to deal with any racial discrimination, and getting stopped i'm only interested in

451
00:49:21,028 --> 00:49:26,028
what happens once you got stopped, whether you're more likely to be sean or not, and he says the data suggests the following rough rule of Tom.

452
00:49:26,028 --> 00:49:30,028
If you assume that police are non strategic and stopping behavior.

453
00:49:30,028 --> 00:49:36,028
You non strategic for him. Here is a euphemism for racist, right?

454
00:49:36,028 --> 00:49:43,028
So if you assume the police are racist and their stopping behavior, there is a bias right, and police shooting.

455
00:49:43,028 --> 00:49:49,028
However, if one assumes that police are stopping individuals they are worried we'll engage in violent crimes.

456
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:57,028
You're like, Oh, the police just stop suspicious people right and once they stop those suspicious people there's no buys in that like at least not who's suspicious.

457
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:59,028
Then the evidence for bias is exceedingly small.

458
00:49:59,028 --> 00:50:04,028
Right meeting, you know the headline there's no bias in shooting right?

459
00:50:04,028 --> 00:50:08,028
Because he's assuming the police are rational and they're stopping people who are going to commit a crime.

460
00:50:08,028 --> 00:50:12,028
But please know who's going to end the crime we don't have any reason to believe that the racist and making that decision.

461
00:50:12,028 --> 00:50:15,028
But let's see if they're racist when they shoot people right?

462
00:50:15,028 --> 00:50:22,028
So. that obviously a very problematic set of decisions there.

463
00:50:22,028 --> 00:50:34,028
The analysis. A bunch of people jumped on this right away and immediately saw the problem in particular is like 5 papers by Knox and Mumolo.

464
00:50:34,028 --> 00:50:38,028
I think. is it Penn now? and Mamelo is at Princeton?

465
00:50:38,028 --> 00:50:50,028
If I have that right, they're political scientists and they immediately solve the the fallacy of this analysis, and if you do any causal analysis like with mediation or whatever you're gonna immediately recognize as well, that if you have racism

466
00:50:50,028 --> 00:50:54,028
that's unmeasured variable here it's affecting your probability.

467
00:50:54,028 --> 00:51:02,028
Game stopping you're probably getting shot right then you're gonna condition on this collider, and you're gonna create a correlation.

468
00:51:02,028 --> 00:51:11,028
There that's gonna pollute your exposure effect this is going to buy us your exposure effect because you're gonna bring in all that unmeasured bias from the condition. it's a well known collider

469
00:51:11,028 --> 00:51:17,028
stratification bias problem in epidemiology and Knox and Mammal are just pointing out that this is obviously what's going on here.

470
00:51:17,028 --> 00:51:21,028
You can't condition in this way and they're in their papers.

471
00:51:21,028 --> 00:51:25,028
They're very nothing a logic technical papers about how you should analyze this.

472
00:51:25,028 --> 00:51:28,028
And so when they end up saying it's not point identified, you can have a back for where this is.

473
00:51:28,028 --> 00:51:33,028
But you know they they show that it's pretty clear that police are shooting by people like There's not.

474
00:51:33,028 --> 00:51:50,028
There's not any doubt about the way this is really going that the rolling fryer paper is is not valid like It's just not acceptable you can take that and face down fryer's response to

475
00:51:50,028 --> 00:52:01,028
maximum low is mostly to ignore it just Doesn't it meant that those critiques are written Then came a critique along the same lines by a Nobel Laureate James Heckman. and Then you couldn't really Ignore

476
00:52:01,028 --> 00:52:12,028
Heckman. So you had to make some response here. So Heckman writes in typical sort of the common economist language, The absence of considered analysis of the process by which end of Janet endogenity of interactions might do

477
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:16,028
selection bias and vogue needed to basically saying the same thing.

478
00:52:16,028 --> 00:52:21,028
I said, on the previous slide, he doesn't use dags but he's making the same argument that this stopping is endogenous.

479
00:52:21,028 --> 00:52:28,028
It's affected by variables that are gonna be correlated with the exposure, and can't this analysis is is a no go.

480
00:52:28,028 --> 00:52:35,028
You can't. use this to decide that there's no racial disparity or no racial bias in the shooting of black subjects.

481
00:52:35,028 --> 00:52:44,028
So. he has to respond to this, and his response is to completely back off the claim in in the journal article like, So in this journal, what is that?

482
00:52:44,028 --> 00:52:52,028
Journal Political economy, he writes a response in which he says We don't say anything at our paper about racial lines.

483
00:52:52,028 --> 00:52:55,028
We just report the conditional disparity condition on Dame Stop!

484
00:52:55,028 --> 00:53:00,028
This is the disparity. Never say it's racial bias. We never say there's no racial bias in being shot.

485
00:53:00,028 --> 00:53:05,028
We make no planes about racial bias whatsoever, and we could never make a thing about racial bias on the basis of regression.

486
00:53:05,028 --> 00:53:09,028
Models like this, so you can't criticize me because I never save those things.

487
00:53:09,028 --> 00:53:19,028
And then he goes and writes articles in the Wall Street Journal, in which he says exactly that there's no racial bias in shooting, you know. and, as I said, the right way Media goes nuts with this and goes even further

488
00:53:19,028 --> 00:53:29,028
you know, and says the racial bias. the police shooting, says Harvard Professor, you know, and this is like the favorite article to to bring out on brightly talk shows and things like this.

489
00:53:29,028 --> 00:53:39,028
And anyway. so this is all an argument about adjustments like this is super consequential for the great movements and and issues of our day.

490
00:53:39,028 --> 00:53:43,028
Covid mortality and and and police shooting us civilians.

491
00:53:43,028 --> 00:53:50,028
It all gets down to the issues of like Jim Koopman's philosophy class from 1,994 like, What are you gonna adjust for?

492
00:53:50,028 --> 00:53:54,028
Why are you adjusting for that? And what world do you want to report on here?

493
00:53:54,028 --> 00:54:03,028
The real world or some imaginary world and which you know there's no racism as a an assumption that I want to test and see if there's racism in this other thing like you have to make conscious decisions about what we're

494
00:54:03,028 --> 00:54:14,028
doing what you're reporting and you also have to Count on the fact that the media is going to go berserk and say crazy things that don't have anything to do with what same okay, last example and I just have to include

495
00:54:14,028 --> 00:54:20,028
it because it's just the most outrageous to me we've known for a 1 million years since you know Jerry stamler's inter salt study.

496
00:54:20,028 --> 00:54:32,028
You know, and all kinds of other studies that salt is bad for you, because it raised your blood pressure. And if you have high blood pressure, you die like That's you know It's one of the things in epid We actually know about secrets

497
00:54:32,028 --> 00:54:39,028
calls lung cancer, and you know a high salt diet makes you be hypertensive and makes you have a stroke, you know.

498
00:54:39,028 --> 00:54:45,028
So this is no surprise to anybody anymore. So these authors do a new analysis, and they say, Wow! interesting.

499
00:54:45,028 --> 00:54:52,028
It does turn out that sodium consumption is highly correlated with blood pressure. As you move up and quintiles of sodium consumption.

500
00:54:52,028 --> 00:55:00,028
Here you definitely, you know, increase in in blood pressure so that part's true. Now let's look at sodium consumption with respect to mortality.

501
00:55:00,028 --> 00:55:09,028
No completely. No. So all this sodium that increases your blood pressure doesn't do anything for more talent right. it's fine.

502
00:55:09,028 --> 00:55:18,028
Eat as much salt as you want you know 3 cans of Campbell soup every day is perfectly fine, Because, look, there's no there's no effect on mortality here.

503
00:55:18,028 --> 00:55:24,028
So obviously when I saw this i'm like let me look at what that's in that model. You know what's in that model blood pressure.

504
00:55:24,028 --> 00:55:35,028
All models are adjusted for blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah! right So again it's a you know sodium raise your blood pressure which makes

505
00:55:35,028 --> 00:55:43,028
you die. But let's assume that everybody who eat sodium has the same blood pressure, and then see if it costs me to die.

506
00:55:43,028 --> 00:55:48,028
No it doesn't so I guess it's fine in the imaginary world, in which sodium wouldn't affect blood pressure.

507
00:55:48,028 --> 00:55:54,028
Unfortunately, that's not the world that I lived in so I don't care about that result of that paper, you know, so like.

508
00:55:54,028 --> 00:56:00,028
Where are the where are the reviewers? Where are the editors?

509
00:56:00,028 --> 00:56:04,028
Where like, how can this happen? This is a good journal it's an Aj. journal.

510
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:14,028
It's probably got an impact. factor of 10 or something like this is crazy, but people are just do you know Eppie is like a rote activity.

511
00:56:14,028 --> 00:56:24,028
Now like Well, i've got a model i've got to put a bunch of covariance in it, so I can get accepted like It's just nobody's thinking about what they're doing and Why, so my

512
00:56:24,028 --> 00:56:29,028
summary slide. What is the ideology of this statistical pathology?

513
00:56:29,028 --> 00:56:33,028
We learn techniques and graduate school, and then we apply them in a road fashion.

514
00:56:33,028 --> 00:56:37,028
We're too busy to think about the logic and justifications routine operations, right?

515
00:56:37,028 --> 00:56:39,028
It's just like, Okay, I need to have a crude relationship.

516
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:43,028
I need to add a bunch of covariance there's a bunch of covariance.

517
00:56:43,028 --> 00:56:54,028
My p value of some point 5. Yes, okay i'm in doing the Journal of Medicine like it's you know you have to think about this imaginary world that you're creating is that interesting to talk about is that relevant

518
00:56:54,028 --> 00:57:04,028
for anybody. I think about the fact that that's not where people live we're customer to think about adjustments as removing bias, so it's become assumed that an adjusted result is always more true than an

519
00:57:04,028 --> 00:57:15,028
unadjusted result. But That's not true right the famous argument to Jay Jaya Pearl and Don Reuben, about this, you know, because Don Reuben said dumped everything into the

520
00:57:15,028 --> 00:57:19,028
density score. And you did, Rubin said. Sorry, Judea Pearl said.

521
00:57:19,028 --> 00:57:24,028
You could actually get into some trouble doing that and revenue was like 9.

522
00:57:24,028 --> 00:57:32,028
I don't believe that so I I do believe that you can get into some trouble by dumping covariance in your mouth.

523
00:57:32,028 --> 00:57:39,028
Several examples. Highlight. that media coverage of papers removes caveats and assumptions, and thereby creates a very misleading account of the research.

524
00:57:39,028 --> 00:57:43,028
You know. Rowan Fryer was very careful in his paper because he had reviewers and editors to worry about.

525
00:57:43,028 --> 00:57:48,028
He's very careful in his paper to say conditional on interactions.

526
00:57:48,028 --> 00:57:55,028
This is the conditional disparity, right? They were conditional odds, ratios, which is not a great idea.

527
00:57:55,028 --> 00:58:03,028
But shooting was relatively rare, thank God so you know it's not terrible thing to do, but in his paper he studied correctly.

528
00:58:03,028 --> 00:58:06,028
The newspaper articles. Do not say you're correct they just say, look!

529
00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:16,028
We show that beliefs are not racist I that that's not the description of what happened, and that's on the meeting, and for statistics are now you'd be seen as objective with the logic of adjustment is

530
00:58:16,028 --> 00:58:23,028
rooted in subjective, ethical judgments right you don't get to just be a data nerd and just, you know, run models.

531
00:58:23,028 --> 00:58:37,028
And just think, you're in this objective world of the truth right? You have to make value judgments about what things are unacceptable, and what things are acceptable in a moral sense in an ethical sense you can't get out of

532
00:58:37,028 --> 00:58:47,028
that the obligation to engage in that discussion. So the famous George Box quote we all talk about is all models along with some useful, but you have to think about useful.

533
00:58:47,028 --> 00:58:58,028
For whom useful? for what purpose? We have the era of epidemiology, you know, in the old days of Mcmahon, and Queue and Mauser and bond and stuff.

534
00:58:58,028 --> 00:59:05,028
There was epidemiology, and then along came Rothman and Vietnam, and then we got modern epidemiology.

535
00:59:05,028 --> 00:59:07,028
So it was much more statistical, you know. And then along came Robbins and throw that away.

536
00:59:07,028 --> 00:59:11,028
And we got this kind of postmodern epidemiology.

537
00:59:11,028 --> 00:59:20,028
Everything is the g formula and target trials and stuff like that. So we're sort of in this era of postmodern epidemiology, which is very counterfeitual, you know very hypothetical

538
00:59:20,028 --> 00:59:23,028
in the sense that you know you make a lot of assumptions about.

539
00:59:23,028 --> 00:59:25,028
If this were true, and if this were the model, this was the dag.

540
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:34,028
This is what you get. we're ready now for the next era of epidemiology, which is going to be zen epidemic.

541
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:44,028
I. and this this guy wrote 30 years ago when I began a study of Zen, I said, mountains are mountains, waters are waters using the crude data.

542
00:59:44,028 --> 00:59:55,028
Now, after I got insight into the truth of zen's modern epidemic through the instructions of a good Master Janie Robbins, I said, mountains are not mountains waters, are not waters he's in the

543
00:59:55,028 --> 01:00:01,028
counterfactual world now. but at the end of his career he says, I have attained the abode of final rest.

544
01:00:01,028 --> 01:00:10,028
That is enlightenment. Now he's reached enlightenment, and you can finally get back to the crude data and say mountains are really mountains.

545
01:00:10,028 --> 01:00:13,028
Waters are really waters. Okay, Thank you very much.

546
01:00:13,028 --> 01:00:19,028
Have a published citation for this talk, which is in that one medicine journal in 27, and

547
01:00:19,028 --> 01:00:33,028
Happy to take questions for about a minute. it's okay

548
01:00:33,028 --> 01:00:40,028
Any questions.

549
01:00:40,028 --> 01:00:47,028
Okay, thank you so much. J. it's hiring What is it even mean?

550
01:00:47,028 --> 01:00:52,028
Lots of questions.

551
01:00:52,028 --> 01:00:57,028
In social This becomes even more comfortable like, if you think about exposure.

552
01:00:57,028 --> 01:01:22,028
Variables. they go back and forth in in the room, and as I was listening, I bought it of the work in recent where we are always happily, just for Sds right causes.

553
01:01:22,028 --> 01:01:35,028
Of that is every justice. Yes, because that's an allowable when it does get complicated.

554
01:01:35,028 --> 01:01:50,028
Oh yes, yes. Differences in source.

555
01:01:50,028 --> 01:02:11,028
Or removed from the real world about that there but but I haven't. I think we didn't know about it, because you know, that's desperate.

556
01:02:11,028 --> 01:02:15,028
Yeah, yeah, it's a fantasy yeah I mean this is a long discussion.

557
01:02:15,028 --> 01:02:25,028
So I don't think I can answer that in 1 min like That's a sort of a discussion that can last a career, you know, and I hope that we have this discussion for the rest of our career, but you know I think that we

558
01:02:25,028 --> 01:02:31,028
have to. I don't wanna be neilistic about saying let's just give up, and you know become like, and send masters like I.

559
01:02:31,028 --> 01:02:36,028
I think we should continue to do epidemiology, and we have to continue to do quantitative epidemiology.

560
01:02:36,028 --> 01:02:46,028
But I think we can lean in the direction of keeping in mind. what is the real world, what's the imaginary world, and what assumptions we make who we wander into that imaginary world.

561
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:59,028
And I think there has been a big movement in social epidemiology because of these kinds of issues, a big movement toward the study of more concrete policy manipulations instead of grand statements like you know, real Wilkinson kind of thing like

562
01:02:59,028 --> 01:03:03,028
you know, if there were no inequality, this is what the mortality would be like.

563
01:03:03,028 --> 01:03:07,028
That is as you say a fantasy and so there's I think that i'm more modern social epidemiology.

564
01:03:07,028 --> 01:03:12,028
That's really much more focused on you know if we had an earned income tax credit.

565
01:03:12,028 --> 01:03:15,028
And we applied it in this situation with these rules.

566
01:03:15,028 --> 01:03:19,028
You know how many more suicides would would be prevented.

567
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:31,028
You know they're they're much more narrow questions about specific realistic policy interventions, and I do think that those are both more realistic in terms of believing the answer and also more policy relevant because then you can hand

568
01:03:31,028 --> 01:03:37,028
that result to a policymaker, and you can say this is the thing you should actually do. Whereas, if you have them a Wilkinson plot, you know.

569
01:03:37,028 --> 01:03:43,028
And say like there should be no inequality Then it's not really, as you say, not really clear how to get there.

570
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:50,028
So I that's sort of the broad outline in my answer

571
01:03:50,028 --> 01:04:13,028
One more So you know that's the ultimate analogy of drug

572
01:04:13,028 --> 01:04:29,028
Always strike regression.

573
01:04:29,028 --> 01:04:35,028
The big advantage stated by Rosenbaum Group in 1,984.

574
01:04:35,028 --> 01:04:38,028
About theensity scores was completely around this issue of balance.

575
01:04:38,028 --> 01:04:44,028
Checking they're. they're promised about printing scores was not that it would do a better job of adjusting than regression models.

576
01:04:44,028 --> 01:04:52,028
But only that you'd be able to check that covariant balance in a way that would alert you to the fact that you have some lack of overlap or something like that.

577
01:04:52,028 --> 01:05:04,028
So. yeah, I I agree that that's the strength of that model I I still agree with today at Pearl that you can get into trouble by putting some covariance there and looking for balance. and those could various if those are colliders or other things you should

578
01:05:04,028 --> 01:05:08,028
not be adjusting for. so you have to be sensible about your covariate adjustment.

579
01:05:08,028 --> 01:05:14,028
Set. but I completely agree with you that prevention scores have this advantage that they allow for the the balance checking.

580
01:05:14,028 --> 01:05:24,028
Now that said look in the actual literature. This is another example of like learning techniques, and then applying them in a wrote way, forgetting what their actual promise or or right rational is.

581
01:05:24,028 --> 01:05:33,028
Look in the applied literature at parentheses square papers, and how many actually assess balance, And you'll find it very, very few report any balance. check it.

582
01:05:33,028 --> 01:05:36,028
Just. I put this in a printing score model, and so therefore this must be the right answer.

583
01:05:36,028 --> 01:05:59,923
You know, so it's a there's still a big propriety in the application of these methods in comparison to the way they're originally intended by their office
