1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:13,050
I think that's just we can't just talk about for these customers like allergies and looking at it.

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:21,750
Yeah because we can't get in the door in the morning.

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,530
Everyone's happy one day and happy Halloween.

4
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,350
So we're sorry off today.

5
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:38,930
I'm going to give you a quick presentation about a volunteer and possible internship opportunity is at Hope Clinic, which is in Seattle locations.

6
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:45,270
You know, a little bit more about it. This whole thing is really unique and their integrated care model.

7
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:53,459
So they have the small building. You'll be surprised how much services they offer and there's pretty small building, but they have a medical center,

8
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,290
a dental center, an eye care center, a behavioral health center and education center.

9
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:07,340
All in one building is very easy because they really try to address whole person care and very much patient centered care.

10
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,679
So if you go in for a nutrition appointment and you don't have health insurance and someone sees you and they're like,

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,530
Oh, it seems like you need to see a doctor. They can set you up with a medical point and like while you're there,

12
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,910
instead of having to refer you to a medical clinic or somewhere else in the community,

13
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,780
just because there's a lot of research to show that if you do have to refer someone to like a different office,

14
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,909
they're like, you use a lot of people in that process just because they have to find transportation

15
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,450
and may not be accessible to her and it may not be a safe environment.

16
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:45,150
So yes, the whole thing is a really cool place.

17
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:55,290
So like I said, it's located right here. So if you're going down 94, it's like exit one and three, which is the main once again to ABC.

18
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,380
So from here it would be in probably about a 15 minute drive commute.

19
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,070
There are no examples of the services they provide.

20
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:16,319
So if you aren't here and turn with their food or nutrition program, that could be anything from their food pantry.

21
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,870
They do a farmstand with all produce.

22
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:29,940
They do walk up groceries, they do delivery, they do hot meals, they do a baby care, which is like giving out diapers and infant formula they have.

23
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,550
Like that's related to much.

24
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:42,750
So I'm going to talk a little bit about my summer internship because Dr. Paul and I did not know that they had a summer internship,

25
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,680
but essentially I volunteered there kind of periodically between fall and winter semester, and they contacted me.

26
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:59,620
I believe it was late March, early April, and was like, Hey, because of your resume, because it takes crayons, you know, we're looking for an intern.

27
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,990
Do you want to intern? And so I met with the manager and I kind of talked with her.

28
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,360
And apparently they do this every summer.

29
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:16,889
They bring on like 2 to 3 interns just to kind of like do targets that they want to do, but they don't really have enough time to do so.

30
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:22,050
Unfortunately, it is unpaid, which is how you try to express their intentions.

31
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,869
But they were very flexible.

32
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,690
So they were like basically like you choose when you out, work your hours, what day do you want to come in and willing to work?

33
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,990
So it's very nice, like one sense of like if you do want to work during the summer, this can be a good, flexible internship.

34
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,610
For me personally,

35
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:46,860
I found it was a really good networking opportunity and I worked with registered dietitians and Food Gathers and those registered dietitian that

36
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:56,020
they hired at hoping to sound able to get a lot of good experience and networking opportunities and a community based registered dietitian area.

37
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,290
Here's some examples of some of the project that I did over the summer.

38
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:08,640
So the pictures you see is they want it. So basically like they bring on the old teens to both their meals for them every night,

39
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:15,500
which is anything from like churches to like student orgs and stuff like that.

40
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,740
And they noticed that like their meals are trying to get repetitive.

41
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:25,290
The same thing every year is like, you know, breaded chicken sandwiches or chili.

42
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:33,240
And there were other like a lot of vegetables being added and like their only vegetables would be in a salad, which a lot of people don't like.

43
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,610
So they wanted me to kind of figure out a way to make meals more diverse.

44
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:49,180
So I created this little handbook on using the dietary guidelines as a kind of like basis of how like, what can you do to make your meals diverse.

45
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:55,080
So like, let's say you wanted you concerned about saturated fat, what do you do to lower that or sodium?

46
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,220
Or there's also a part or just talk about how to incorporate more vegetable into your everyday cooking.

47
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:09,120
And also just some sample meals like pasta and chile and vegetables broken with that that you could experiment with.

48
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:18,240
Part of that project was actually meeting with all the meal teams as well and talking with understanding their struggles when it comes to cooking,

49
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:25,589
like for example, cooking for like so they serve about 100 people every night for dinner and cooking

50
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,120
rice for 100 people is pretty awful if you know how long the rice cooker.

51
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:39,689
And that's when I found out that you can actually make rice and it cooks really well and it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan like if you like,

52
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,220
cooked it in like a giant pot.

53
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:53,120
So, you know, if you're cooking for 100 people rice like me and some of my other projects, so I, I was organizing the community garden.

54
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,660
We tried to grow vegetables and produce. It was kind of a hot mess.

55
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,680
But, you know, that first year and they put me in charge, I didn't know what I was doing and I didn't know I was in charge,

56
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:17,550
but I was we so I that with our program manager at food gatherers and we were talking about ways to improve our nutrition program.

57
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,090
And one of the things that food gatherers has is a food policy.

58
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,670
And so we were proposing a food policy for hope planning.

59
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,230
And basically what food policy is, is when you're getting a lot of donations,

60
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,160
it's good to have like a policy about we're trying to go for like, you know, and pantries.

61
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,439
It's really hard because it's very stigmatizing having USDA brand foods because they're

62
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,640
not recognizable like you don't find them at like Kroger's or Meyers and stuff like that.

63
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:51,270
So private policy is saying like, hey, like we would really love brand name items if you can like donate them.

64
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:59,850
It can also be helpful if you're trying out for like more whole grains or more diverse vegetables or anything in that realm,

65
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:09,030
I gather is and as a whole thing, we're very particular about making sure not to use words like healthy or nutritious for foods,

66
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:13,559
because our goal was just to get a lot of food and have accessible in the pantry

67
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:20,100
and not like try and stigmatize foods and then making the pantry more efficient.

68
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:25,560
This is also part of my networking with food gatherers, and so it was just kind of like,

69
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:32,580
you know, what nutrition, education, it and how can we let people know more about hope?

70
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:41,920
Hank Azaria. Shopping through the pantry. And that's a little tricky to do that, but we try it.

71
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,580
And then, yeah, the last part of my internship was actually acting as kind of mock party.

72
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:55,559
So me and the newly hired registered dietician, we would sit during, like pantry appointments or baby care appointments,

73
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,470
and we would just be like, Do you have any questions about nutrition?

74
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:05,520
It was part of a project where we wanted to get a sense of what nutrition related questions individuals

75
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,030
have in their community so that we could tailor our nutrition education more towards those questions.

76
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:19,410
So next class, when you have Dr. Cole for maternal and child nutrition,

77
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:25,390
you learn a lot about like food preferences for young kids and like picky eaters, which was my favorite class.

78
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:31,500
But that was a lot of questions that we got at the Baby Care was like, How do you deal with picky eaters?

79
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,700
And so it's like, okay, well,

80
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:39,570
maybe we could create like a one page or a handout on like picky eating and like how to encourage food choices for young children.

81
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:46,030
So that was kind of the goal. So.

82
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,720
Yeah. So like I said, I started by volunteering here.

83
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,500
I was actually recommended by Dr. Cole, who I then reached out.

84
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,600
A lot of what you'll be doing is kind of like organizing food donations, restocking shelves.

85
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:09,489
You can help with pantry appointments, so you'll be like help guiding clients through the pantry and helping just,

86
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,360
you know, putting stuff in their bags if they have any questions, stuff like that.

87
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:23,920
Um, and you got to be like the farmstand too, which I've heard is by, it's pretty cool.

88
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,990
They like music and they have a bunch of our stuff here too.

89
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:39,489
So yeah. So if you are interested, the link on this slide is the link to this page.

90
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:44,440
And if you scroll down you'll see like the pie and you click on like the basic volunteer application and you can

91
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,409
start acting for I think it's an online form that actually gets sent and I don't know that that's the form.

92
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:57,330
I think we had a different process last year. I think that's all there is.

93
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:05,250
Any questions you. I just want to put a plug in Hope Clinic.

94
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,630
It's a amazing clinic embedded in the community.

95
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:20,940
And it's I mean, these are whole clinic is a great example of a clinic that is so effective, embedded in a community.

96
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,530
And prior to COVID, we had students we'd have two, three,

97
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:32,130
sometimes four students volunteering in their farmstand every semester because they loved

98
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:39,690
interacting with community members and just learning sort of the whole process of a.

99
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:49,240
Community and neighborhood embedded clinics. So I strongly recommend if you are interested in getting some volunteer experience.

100
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:56,230
It's not something you have to do weekly. You know, some students might have only been able to go every two weeks, maybe monthly.

101
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:02,920
But I strongly encourage you that if you want to get some volunteer time over the next year or two,

102
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,370
especially if you live near, that's a great, great opportunity.

103
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:16,750
Millions. So yeah, where things especially if you're interested in community based nutrition,

104
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:23,490
they do a great job on how to interact with individuals to have a very strict policy of,

105
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:29,409
you know, when you're with clients like you never can look down upon them.

106
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:37,270
You can never top down like you being really encourage you to engage with your clients and you'll see that it's just in the atmosphere.

107
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:46,420
There just is such a nice community that people who are coming in to go to the food pantry or for arm or even the Farmstand.

108
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,900
They're just so open with you because they know, like when they come to help, like it's going to be an open environment that's safe for them.

109
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,790
I remember I had this really funny interaction with this one woman who came in and she really wanted peppers.

110
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:07,070
And so I was like, Oh, like, why do you want peppers? And she's like, I really want makes the peppers.

111
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:12,370
And so we had a bunch of zucchini at the time. I was like, you know, you like slices zucchini horizontally, like stupid.

112
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,269
I like zucchini both. And her eyes were so wide.

113
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:24,540
She's like, What? I'm like, Yeah, it's like the same thing, but it's like with a zucchini, and she's like, Oh my God, she's like, like for zucchini.

114
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,170
So, like, I'm going to try it like tonight.

115
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:34,990
So it's a really cool atmosphere to really get a good sense of what community basic like health care can look like.

116
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:47,100
Yeah. Sorry. I have a question. Is knowing a different language particularly helpful if maybe you're interacting with community members who speak?

117
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:53,310
Like, for example, only Spanish? Yeah. So knowing a different language is definitely helpful.

118
00:12:53,400 --> 00:13:00,660
There is they do a lot of translating. So like the poster I show you, I showed you in this one.

119
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:10,740
Yeah, I actually have it translated to Spanish. I think Mandarin because of all the other languages.

120
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:19,500
But I mean, yeah, I got one family over the summer when I was working at the farm stand who only spoke Spanish.

121
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:25,470
So I had to bust out those rusty Spanish skills and attempt to guide them.

122
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,060
But yeah, so, like, it depends on what you can do, right?

123
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:40,160
So like having different languages is really helpful. I would, I would say is not very common in FC, but it's definitely helpful for themselves.

124
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:47,820
They love to make sure that any education materials they have out that is translated to as much different languages as possible.

125
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,140
Did they ask on the application if you if is.

126
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,579
I can't remember. I mean, I would certainly if you're interested and you apply,

127
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:05,110
I would certainly somewhere hopefully there's a place where you can indicate that you can speak multiple languages.

128
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,559
I mean, that's an asset, right? Yeah.

129
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,670
And I definitely like letting them know who I like.

130
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,259
This is one of those things where, you know, like, I didn't know what my internship was going to be and they didn't really know either.

131
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,970
They were just kind of like, Hey, like we want our emails to be different.

132
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:26,860
Like, what can you do? So it was a lot of like I basically built my own internship around it too.

133
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,570
So if you go into like, hey, like I am an MPH Nutritional Sciences student,

134
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,799
I'm really interested in community nutrition and like you can really do almost

135
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,430
any project you want that you think would be beneficial for them because they,

136
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,450
they love having students, they love having like student projects,

137
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,340
and they're really willing to help support any of your like community nutrition projects.

138
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:56,170
Alison Did you also get clients who were like wanting your opinion like, oh, do you have ideas?

139
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,700
What I can do with this? Like, did you ever provide these recipes to clients as well?

140
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,450
Like, what can I make with the food that I'm getting? Think.

141
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:14,410
Yeah. So that's a huge part of just food pantries in general is how you address like items that people don't normally know how to cook.

142
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:22,590
And so what we did, I hope planning at the end of the summer was creating a cookbook that client submitted recipes.

143
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:29,739
And I think we got over like 200 recipes. And that's part of like how clients are so comfortable engaging with Hope.

144
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:37,870
Clinic So we basically made a cookbook of things found in the pantry, made by clients and are distributing that.

145
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:42,639
But yeah, no idea. Our questions are like, what is this like?

146
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:48,310
Oh, it's like this. It goes really well and like stuff like that. And I'm a huge fan of like, you know,

147
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:54,910
not necessarily giving out recipes but figuring out how to take an item and use it and do people everyday cooking.

148
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,380
So I love doing that with people, but that is a large part of it.

149
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:05,020
For more of the nutritional side of it, you know, like I said, we really don't want to stigmatize food.

150
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:11,800
So we were kind of the process of how to come out with kind of like just an infographic for volunteers to be like, hey,

151
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:18,610
like when you're walking like clients do a pantry, you know, we don't want to say like there's good foods in batches.

152
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:24,310
You want to spotlight certain diets and stuff like that. It really just let them choose what they're comfortable with.

153
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,800
By I know a lot of it's like I don't know what they said.

154
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:34,060
Like, for example, we get canned pork a lot and no one knows what to do with cardboard.

155
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:41,620
Part of it is they don't want to eat it because they don't like pork for whatever, like whatever the reason is.

156
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,360
But part of it is like. Whether you can park for it.

157
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:55,880
Questions for Jack. Thank you so much.

158
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,270
I like your outfit, by the way. I'm a good one.

159
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:16,240
Thank you, too. So this you know, it's I mean, I know you guys are busy in your first semester,

160
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,969
but it's important to know what volunteer opportunities there are while you're here for the next two years.

161
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:31,090
Because especially those of you in dietetics and I think I've mentioned this before, the Academy in applications and so forth,

162
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:37,930
it's it's something that those of us who write letters for recommendation for both scholarships as well as dietetic interns,

163
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:50,320
internship opportunities, we can comment on your, you know, your diversity in your resume that in addition to maybe working a part time job,

164
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,559
maybe some of you might be interested in getting some research experience.

165
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,100
But also they also work in the community doing some volunteer.

166
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:01,989
And again, it may be just once a month, but if you do it once a month, over a year,

167
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:10,630
it shows consistency and you're getting experience, right, even if it's in the month.

168
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:17,739
And so it's important I feel it's important for you guys to just know what your options are.

169
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:25,090
And that's why I bring folks in this class citing the fact that it interfaces very nicely with community nutrition in general.

170
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:40,590
So. Okay. Okay.

171
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:46,530
So today we're going to take off where Janine left off with labeling.

172
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,600
I will say right from the get go. I don't have the experience she does and food regulation.

173
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,989
But the topics that I have here,

174
00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:03,870
I feel like I can explain so that you guys at least understand the bases where the numbers are coming from and the labels and so forth,

175
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:12,960
because the nutrition facts label, allergen labeling and then next class, we're going to be talking about front of package labeling,

176
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:21,600
maybe topics that you that come up when you're interacting with clients, patients, community members and so forth.

177
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,760
Before we get started, I just wanted to touch base.

178
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:36,040
There's a reading today that I want to make sure that if you didn't get to it today, please read it for Wednesday.

179
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,730
It's really relevant for our discussion on Wednesday, so please make sure you get to that reading at the top here.

180
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:53,110
Sarah Phinney from Food Nutrition Services USDA is going to be visiting on the seventh to talk about school lunch program.

181
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,350
That was a shift from the original calendar.

182
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:06,250
And also, just to let you know, a major due date for your community assessment report for Wednesday instead of this coming Monday.

183
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:11,470
I may be out of town this weekend, which means I'm not going to be on email as much.

184
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:20,440
And I was concerned that with the assignment being due at 10 a.m. Monday morning, there might be some last minute questions.

185
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,450
So we're just going to make it due Wednesday at 10 a.m.

186
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:33,970
And then that way, if you have any questions over the weekend, just bring a monday to class and I'll be able to help you.

187
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:40,900
It's not to say you can't email over the weekend, but I just may not be as responsive the weekend,

188
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:47,320
so I haven't changed the due date yet on canvas under the assignment, but I'll do that today.

189
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,930
Okay. We're going to see how far we get. Thank you.

190
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:06,760
Today, some you may not get all the way through. And if that's the case, we'll just pick up where we left off on Wednesday.

191
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:16,660
Actually, before I get started, I just thought of one other thing. The grading rubric for the Community Assessment Report is now on course resources.

192
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:24,720
The reason why it took me so long to post it is because I had to make some changes from last year.

193
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:35,290
Some of the requirements from last year are now optional this year, and so because of those changes, it required of me to update their grading rubric.

194
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,760
It's pretty standard. Basic.

195
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,820
It follows the instructions, pretty much so.

196
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:49,750
But I do encourage you to check it out. One thing I just want to highlight, when you get to the nutrition data section,

197
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:58,510
there is an optional food access, which I actually hope all of you at least get in and look at.

198
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:10,360
It's using the USDA Food Environment Atlas, so it addresses food systems, food access, actually a very important indicator or indicators.

199
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,910
It says on the instructions that you only have to find one indicator.

200
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,110
Those of you who choose to go the optional route for extra credit,

201
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:28,630
it's actually pretty straightforward once you get in to the Atlas to find an indicator.

202
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,770
So what I did was if you find as one indicator, you get one extra credit.

203
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:37,150
If you find two indicators, you can get two extra points total.

204
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:42,400
So I just want to let you know, I didn't actually discuss that in the instructions,

205
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,740
but it's laid out in the rubric where it shows where the extra credit points are coming from.

206
00:22:48,130 --> 00:23:01,000
That with the Food Atlas of Food Environment Atlas, you can get up to two extra credit points by presenting two different indicators food access,

207
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:10,430
food system indicators, which may not seem like a lot out of 50 points, but generally students do pretty well on their assessment report.

208
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:17,590
So two credits of the food access and then you can get two credits,

209
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:24,990
extra credit points for including poverty, which is in your instructions to the poverty.

210
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,150
One is from your demographic and economic section.

211
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:34,190
So those can actually contribute a fair amount. And so I just want to clarify that.

212
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:41,079
Okay. Food labeling, this is Ginny.

213
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,710
We laugh at this in this one slide.

214
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:51,700
Yeah. The five mandatory components of labeling that have to be on a food package.

215
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:56,259
There's a whole food industry guide that just addresses these five.

216
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,639
Everything from depending on the size of the package, where it goes.

217
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,730
Does it go here? Does it go this way? Is it at the bottom?

218
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:10,070
Is it at the top? Product identity, net weight, nutrition, facts and so forth.

219
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:17,150
I'm only going to cover nutrition facts just because a lot of the other has to do with just positional.

220
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:21,940
There's exemptions depending on the size of the product and so forth.

221
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:27,790
But if you are all interested, there is this document here.

222
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:32,590
This is one of those guidance documents for industry.

223
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:45,580
So instead of actually going into the actual regulations, which can be make your eyes blur up a bit, it's just all very legalese, right?

224
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:53,439
But sometimes you have to I had to one time for flavored milk in the school lunch program.

225
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:00,010
I had to get into the federal regulations. And, you know, you guys do need to know how to do it, and I'll go over that.

226
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:07,390
But the nice thing about these industry guidance documents is they take the regulations and say it in more.

227
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,750
Layperson language. So it's actually quite useful.

228
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:20,400
So again, this whole five mandatory components of a product you can find in this industry guide.

229
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:27,960
A lot of that has not changed. And what I will be focusing on is just the nutrition facts label as well as food allergen.

230
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,900
So how many people use the nutrition facts label? Hands up.

231
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,610
Who uses them? A lot of us do.

232
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,280
First, we are in nutrition, right? Most of us are in the Department of Nutrition.

233
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,490
It might not be surprising that we use the nutrition facts label.

234
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,020
Anybody want to own up what they look for on the label?

235
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,430
Alone up sometimes. I'm looking for dietary fiber and sodium.

236
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,970
Yep. I'm looking. I have no allergies, so I look to see an allergen statement.

237
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,550
Yeah. Powdered sugar?

238
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,290
Yes. Not sugar and sugar, especially now that we have that on the label.

239
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:16,330
What else? Yeah. When I was helping with my grandmother's nutrition, potassium and sodium for kidney patients.

240
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:22,360
Yes. Yeah. And that's a new component on our new labels is the potassium, which is so important.

241
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,649
My dad had the same cause.

242
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:30,250
He went into kidney failure, ended up ultimately having a kidney transplant, but he had to watch its potassium for a number of months.

243
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:38,020
Yep. I was going to say sometimes if I'm like looking to try a new product, like compare protein and sugar.

244
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:47,170
Yeah. Yeah. So there's nutrients that all of us have personal interest in, what have you that we keep track of.

245
00:26:47,590 --> 00:27:03,800
So it's useful. So this is the original nutrition facts label that was on products on the left.

246
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:09,200
That was a Facts label that came out in the mid-nineties.

247
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:16,010
It did not get updated again until 2016, which it's really a long time ago.

248
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:26,600
We had new, you know, as of the end of 1998, 99 into the early 2000, we had or maybe it was 2000.

249
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:34,280
The National Academy had updated many, many, many of the nutrients, nutrient requirements, dry ice.

250
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,860
That's where the dry ice came out of as the late nineties, early 2000 and so forth.

251
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,000
So we, we, we had this one for quite a while.

252
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,739
And then in 2016, we got an update and again, utilizing the new scientific evidence,

253
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:59,290
also taking into account concerns about how readable and how usable it is for the layperson.

254
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:00,680
Okay.

255
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:09,830
So so I just want to go through a little bit and then we're going to take it apart in terms of the numbers, understand where these numbers come from.

256
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:19,639
Okay. So what was updated is updated serving sizes, which we're going to spend just a little bit of time on.

257
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,860
So we'll circle back to that. They enhance the prominence of calories.

258
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:39,719
Dropped calories from fat. So if you go back to the old one, you can see that there is a calories from fat over on the top right column.

259
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,380
There you can see it. So why did they drop it in the new one?

260
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:53,390
Is that from when people really thought that, that was just like the worst thing that ever happened within our food system.

261
00:28:53,390 --> 00:29:01,790
Correct. And then, you know, we realized that, you know, there is healthy fats and fats that we should be consuming.

262
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:06,090
So we really don't want to be focused on calories from fat per say.

263
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:13,970
So that was dropped, added, sugars was added and then they updated the micronutrients.

264
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,540
So vitamins C and A were dropped. Why?

265
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:34,280
We get plenty of it. We get plenty of it. Yeah. And instead, potassium vitamin D were added because these are are now considered a concern.

266
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:44,420
So and as Melissa highlighted, the potassium is a concern for those who are in renal failure.

267
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:54,770
But potassium is also a concern. So for people who are in renal failure, the concern is too much potassium for those of us in general.

268
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:02,150
Potassium intake needs to increase in order to be preventative for cardiovascular disease.

269
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,590
Right. Lower sodium increase our potassium intake.

270
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:14,090
So it depends on the individual whether what what potassium means to them in terms of how it's useful.

271
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,790
And then notice that the footnote is shorter.

272
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:23,180
If you look at the old one, that one just made people's eyes glaze over, even use it, and it takes up a lot of space.

273
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:30,200
So here it just lets folks know that it's just based on a 2000 calorie diet, which.

274
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:37,830
I don't know that that's all that useful, except for maybe people like dietitians and nutritionists to be able.

275
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,420
So let's focus a little bit on serving size.

276
00:30:47,570 --> 00:31:00,610
So it's kind of a weird thing anyway. So serving size is defined as the amount of food that is customarily eaten at one occasion or time.

277
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:10,140
What do you mean by. Yeah.

278
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,170
That's suggesting how much you should try to eat out once.

279
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:20,490
Like, I don't know, I think of a lot more ways. Maybe like a snack.

280
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,250
For me, one is probably the portion that you wish you had.

281
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:30,560
Yeah, that's a good suggestion.

282
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,600
And that's actually been a pretty.

283
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,679
It is actually not, Melissa. I'd say that that is not what it stands for,

284
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:44,640
but that has been a critique that it should represent the recommended intake, not the what it actually is.

285
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,230
Yeah. Is it how people express that when I was in a box out of single serving.

286
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,390
So the serving size is based.

287
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:03,570
So when we say that there's one serving and it says maybe two thirds of a cup, one cup.

288
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,660
Where is that number coming from? Two thirds of a cup.

289
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,680
One cup. That was what's the basis for that is what you were getting.

290
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:16,740
It kind of is the basis from not just the dry from it.

291
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:24,390
Yeah. So you're in line with Melissa in terms of should that be the recommended amount or the dietary guidelines?

292
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:31,529
So yeah, I'm pretty sure that the serving size is just regulated by whatever the company wants to put on it, isn't it?

293
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:38,040
Isn't it? There's not like a set standard. So you're on the right track.

294
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:47,720
This is actually the amount that is customarily consumed in the United States.

295
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,860
So I don't know what this food item is. It's two thirds of a cup.

296
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:56,660
And it's got calcium, vitamin D and it might be lasagna.

297
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:00,960
We'll say assume it's inside. So two thirds of a couple of design.

298
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:08,120
Yeah. How much do we recommend that people consume lasagna?

299
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:15,140
Is there a recommended amount? There really isn't.

300
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:21,320
And this is not to both you and Melissa talking about recommended amounts.

301
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:27,110
If we think about legumes and fruits and vegetables doesn't we don't have a problem with

302
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:32,750
coming up with we don't have any issue coming up with the recommended amount of potato chips.

303
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,950
I want a small thing of potato chips with my tuna fish sandwich.

304
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,580
What's the recommended amount? Insurance.

305
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,420
Well, in moderation. I have some.

306
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,240
But what is that. Is that a half a cup. Is that and chips.

307
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:57,970
So this is the issue that the FDA has had with setting the serving sizes in these labels.

308
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:06,100
We can't use the recommended amount even though this always comes up when the label is being is up for discussion.

309
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:11,340
Why can't we use the recommended amount? Because there's a many, many, many foods which we don't have a recommended amount.

310
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:14,530
We don't recommend drinking soft drinks.

311
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,730
It doesn't hurt to have one every once in a while, but we don't recommend it.

312
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:24,840
So the amount the serving size up here are two thirds of a cup of lasagna.

313
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,770
I don't know this is on you, to be honest, but that is the amount.

314
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:35,560
Okay, where do we know? How do we know how much folks in the United States are consuming of foods?

315
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,680
With surveillance system tells us what people are consuming.

316
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:55,080
And yes, and Heinz. So it's from NHANES that we get the amount of food customarily eaten at one time.

317
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:07,740
That's the basis of the serving sizes. And in fact, the FDA has a whole long list of guidelines that companies use.

318
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:11,890
So if a company is selling a muffin, what's a serving size?

319
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:16,380
They go to the FDA industry guide of their call.

320
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:24,480
The amount of food customarily eaten at one time is called reps are a.

321
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:31,170
C. C s. So they establish standards for serving sizes.

322
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:36,030
These are called reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion.

323
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,790
Conrad said. I don't want to say the whole thing out.

324
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:48,729
So industry companies selling muffins, they go to the guide to see what a serving size is for a muffin.

325
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:53,170
Presume it's one, but it's probably weight and so forth.

326
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:58,540
What's a serving size for a bowl? A box cereal?

327
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:08,140
Again, FDA has a standard that the company would go to to see what a serving size is so the serving sizes are.

328
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:15,350
These are a case that's developed by the FDA based on NHANES.

329
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:19,800
Based on what people are actually consuming. Okay.

330
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:30,620
In the U.S. And then based on what we typically consume in the U.S., then the nutrient content is based on that serving size.

331
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:36,110
Okay. I was thinking about potato chips and how they come in different sizes.

332
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:43,430
So how do they account for like the different sized chips and then creating a serving size based off of that?

333
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,460
Yeah. So if you take it in the cup, how much can you really break apart and actually fit into the cup.

334
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:59,570
Right. So I haven't looked at potato chips, but again, it would be based on what is customarily consumed on the NHANES survey.

335
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,180
So my guess is with that, I don't know. That's a good question.

336
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,670
I have to take a look at what's on potato chips. There's a caveat.

337
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:13,729
Does the additional explanation with potato chips that I'll get to in a minute when we talk about soft drinks,

338
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:18,620
because there if you go into a convenience store,

339
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:24,890
you see small bags of potato chips, then slightly bigger bags of potato chips and then really big bag of potato chips.

340
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:29,420
Well, those first two bags may actually be considered one serving.

341
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:34,160
One's a little bit different than the other one's bigger. And I'll explain that in a minute.

342
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:38,840
But yeah, we'd have to take a look to see.

343
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:44,450
In the table for potato chips what the serving size is.

344
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:48,649
It may be based on the weight, but not if it's based on weight.

345
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:54,770
They would have interpreted what people put in there and hence dietary recall.

346
00:37:54,770 --> 00:38:06,040
They would have converted that maybe to weight. And no one has gone into the change recently that I noticed that a lot of foods that if it even whiffs

347
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:12,260
of something it could potentially be eaten all at once it'll say like serving size two thirds of a cup,

348
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:16,460
150 calories, entire package, 350 calories.

349
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:20,569
So let me yeah, let me show you something exactly changed.

350
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:31,590
I'm saying. Yeah, like, so the recognition is that there are foods that are consumed and treated like a one serving.

351
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:37,430
Yeah. And but folks don't realize that there's higher calories associated with that.

352
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:41,540
So let me show you an example. Just to follow up.

353
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:50,690
If the used National Food Consumption Service to determine typical serving sizes for almost 140, just slightly less than 140 food products.

354
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:56,450
And just point out that.

355
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:04,999
All my regulations can be found in this code of federal regulations.

356
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:16,720
So this is the codification of laws, rules, regulations related to a host of things in the United States.

357
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,660
Title 21 is rules that pertain to the Food and Drug Administration.

358
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:30,760
Chapter one He applies to food and drugs.

359
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:36,910
Chapter B applies to foods for human consumption.

360
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:42,910
And then we have part one, two, one. That's all regulations related to food labeling.

361
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:52,799
So when you go into the FTA, if you have any interest in food labeling and you get in, you will see title, you'll see the codes.

362
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:59,700
After FDA has done a really nice job of letting you know where in the code of accurate federal regulations is that

363
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:08,550
actually laid out and discussed and I've had to use this a lot when I want to find out where is this number coming from.

364
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:13,710
And so you can find that information through the federal code of Federal Regulations.

365
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:19,710
And so I just wanted you to be aware that this is actually a useful resource.

366
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:24,780
Okay. And again, in the food labeling website of the FDA,

367
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:33,300
they do a nice job of letting you know which codes and which subsections and so forth, so that you can access it through here.

368
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:37,800
Okay. Okay.

369
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,890
Back to the question of serving sizes.

370
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,980
Actually, hold that thought for just a second.

371
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:54,420
Serving sizes increased from the 1990 mid-nineties, when the first Food and Nutrition Facts label came out.

372
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:02,310
So the important point is, is that serving sizes have been updated to reflect what the U.S. population is consuming.

373
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,640
So you can see here, originally a serving of ice cream was a half a cup.

374
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,470
Today, the main intake of ice cream at one sitting is two thirds of a cup.

375
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:23,450
So that is now our serving size for ice cream. And it's important because, again, there's a calorie difference.

376
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:30,620
So updated serving sizes was an important part of the changes in 2016.

377
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:49,630
Okay. Getting back to this one serving. Products that here we have a 12 ounce bottle of soft drink and a 20 ounce bottle of soft drink.

378
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:54,860
Both. Have been shown in and hence.

379
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,960
Survey's to be single serving.

380
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:06,260
Amounts. Likewise with potato chips.

381
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:14,660
The little bag and the medium bag have been shown to be consumed in a single serving sitting.

382
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:22,990
So there are products that. Are consumed often as a single serving.

383
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:30,520
These are the new regulations. A single serving container is a product that is sold individually.

384
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:42,370
It's key. It's sold individually, and it contains less than 200% of the applicable serving size.

385
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,570
So the actual serving size for soda is 12 ounces.

386
00:42:49,440 --> 00:43:02,940
But as long as this single serving as one bottle is less than 200% of 12 ounces, it's considered a single serving portion.

387
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:18,430
Okay. And so it's labeled as one serving, except obviously there's going to be an adjustment of 20 ounces versus 12 in terms of the nutrient content.

388
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:27,460
You won't see it on soda because there's not enough room.

389
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:34,990
But for packages that have a sufficiently big enough size, they will show a dual column.

390
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:39,470
One is a single serving size.

391
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:42,250
The other is the whole package.

392
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:50,250
To let the person know that if you consume that whole package, this is what you're going to have for calories and nutrient content.

393
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:57,730
So that's why we're seeing it. So that's new for 2016 is the dual columns.

394
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:09,000
Think that's all I wanted to say about that and so many have their hand up for.

395
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:26,270
Okay. You. So there are mandatory nutrients that have to be included on the nutrition facts, labels, and then there's voluntary.

396
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:31,840
The underlying ones are mandatory. The others are voluntary.

397
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,870
Did I say that right? The underlying ones are mandatory.

398
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:38,740
The others are voluntary.

399
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:48,750
And I was trying to think the other day when I had I had something that had an extensive list of nutrients.

400
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:56,069
So that's the manufacturer choosing to let the consumer know that this product actually

401
00:44:56,070 --> 00:45:02,130
has quite a few nutrients above and beyond what's required or mandated by the FDA.

402
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:10,440
A good example of that is like boxed breakfast cereal often will have a pretty long

403
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:16,320
list of nutrients just because they have a tendency to be enriched and so forth.

404
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:26,680
Okay. So I want to focus on this column in blue that are called the Daily Values.

405
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:34,360
What are the daily values? When you think the daily values represent, what are they?

406
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:44,330
We call them the daily values. Yes. Does the percentage of calories go towards your overall daily calorie intake?

407
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:51,410
So it's calories, but we have daily values that are specific to nutrients and then food components.

408
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,680
So you're on the right track? Yeah.

409
00:45:54,200 --> 00:46:07,150
You have to deal with the the macronutrients like 40 to 65%, usually carbohydrates, 20 to 35 to beat about the other.

410
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:11,880
Yeah, you're on the right track. So let me take a step back.

411
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:17,000
As Elizabeth was pointing out, in terms of the nutrients,

412
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:25,190
these are the amounts that are not I'm not talking about the percentages you actually see here.

413
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,179
Well, those are the percentages that are based on the daily values.

414
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:37,040
But the daily values are all these grams mg that are associated with each nutrient and food component.

415
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:44,270
And that's the daily value. And as Elizabeth was pointing out, she was talking about from a calorie standpoint.

416
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:49,160
But this is the actual amount of the.

417
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,750
Well, those are the actual amounts. I'm sorry. Take a step back here.

418
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,069
All this is why it's so confusing on the left.

419
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:07,610
All the amounts associated with the nutrients and the food components are the actual amounts in that food for a given serving size.

420
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:14,290
Okay. On the left. On the right is the percent of daily values.

421
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:18,440
Yes, go ahead. Sorry, I think I didn't explain it well and I could explain it down.

422
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,230
So I just I just got myself confused.

423
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,060
But I guess what I think of when I look at this is like, for example, sodium,

424
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:33,350
you see 850 milligrams and then like going across, you see that that 37% of your daily value.

425
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:41,750
That's like if you consume excuse me, consume that serving, you are consuming 37% of how much sodium you should have in a day.

426
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,100
So it's based on recommended, which is what Melissa was getting at.

427
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:53,780
So it's based on the recommended intake levels. The problem is, is because it's the label, we can't look at it by gender.

428
00:47:53,780 --> 00:48:00,560
We can't look at it by light stage because remember, the drys are broken down by gender, life stage and so forth.

429
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:06,710
Here's the label that's applying to everyone in the, you know, in a to everyone the public.

430
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:15,440
So daily values are reference amounts of nutrients that to consume or not to exceed.

431
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:20,910
So there are some nutrients there that we want folks to get less of.

432
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:27,240
And there's some nutrients we want the public to get more of to conserve for consumers.

433
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,730
So the actual daily value of the reference amounts,

434
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:43,500
the percentage is how much of that nutrient is found in the food that contributes to your overall daily intake.

435
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:48,990
And again, that's using the dry eyes as the reference, right?

436
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:56,400
What I want to show you is where the daily values are derived from because it's not straightforward.

437
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:06,290
So the top portion of the nutrition facts label are called daily reference values.

438
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:10,490
So I mean, there are so many different terms and acronyms here.

439
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:16,040
We're going to have to keep it straight and I'll try to do the same. Are you messed up once on the last slide?

440
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:26,959
So the derivatives refer to the nutrient values in the top part of the label and then the reference daily intakes,

441
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,320
the R.D. EIS refer to the micronutrients.

442
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:44,299
Okay. So the FDA took information from the Academy's diaries and the dietary guidelines and

443
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:50,510
called them something different to daily reference values and reference daily intakes,

444
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:55,820
all under the umbrella of daily values. Oh, my gosh.

445
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:58,580
But anyway, we'll get through it. Melissa.

446
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:05,820
So these grades, because when you look at this, like you said of the academy, it pays for gender, age group.

447
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,310
So what do they base it on? So let me show you. That's why I wanted to go through this.

448
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:18,880
So for adults and children. So this is the this is the daily reference values.

449
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:22,410
These are the actual standards set by the FDA.

450
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:26,240
So we're talking about the upper portion of the label.

451
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:31,760
I'm only going to focus on adults and children four years and older in the pink bracket.

452
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:38,150
But this note that we have drives for both infants because there are some products that are

453
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:45,110
specific to infants as well as children one through three and pregnant and lactating women.

454
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:53,420
Okay. So we're going to focus on adults. So here we have the food components from the top part of the label, the upper part.

455
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,960
And you can see that they have actual.

456
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:03,220
Values. That's the basis that's being used.

457
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:16,060
These are the derbies right here. And so the percentages on these here are based off of these values.

458
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,940
So I want to show you where these values came from.

459
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:27,760
You are never going to get into this kind of minutia with somebody from, you know, a consumer or a client.

460
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:31,230
But you guys need to know where these values are coming from. Okay.

461
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:39,730
Just so you know how this played out. So if you look at the top there, let me see what example I have.

462
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:46,250
I guess I go through all of them. So fact is based.

463
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:53,270
Let me take it. Fat, protein and carbohydrates are based on the MDR.

464
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:59,240
Have you guys learned about the MDR? I didn't cover it in this class, but have you learned about the MDR in another class?

465
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:07,970
If not, let me just show you real quick. The MDR is another DRI from the academy.

466
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,880
So you guys learned about we talked about the days that year, adequate intake.

467
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:17,780
I know there's a lot of abbreviations, but you guys do need to start getting comfortable with these abbreviations.

468
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:24,350
I didn't go over it, but I typed in This was your notes when we covered it way back in the beginning of the semester.

469
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:32,000
Range of intake for macronutrients are called the MDR and they stand for acceptable macronutrient distribution range.

470
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:44,570
That's the range of a macronutrient as a percentage of total energy intake that's considered to be associated with reduced risk of chronic disease.

471
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:53,689
So the MDR for fat is in general, scientific evidence indicates that total fat intake,

472
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:59,660
that's 20 to 35% of a person's total energy intake as a healthy range.

473
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:04,970
Likewise, carbohydrate and protein. Those are the MDR.

474
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:14,410
Okay. That's the basis for total fat, carbohydrate and protein.

475
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:20,260
I think total fat was. I can't remember.

476
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:24,850
Did they do that? Oh, they did. The upper limit of the aim there for total fat.

477
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:30,550
35% carbohydrate is mid-point.

478
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:35,200
And protein is on the lower end.

479
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:42,670
Okay. So that's food for the macronutrients.

480
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,270
Fiber is 14 grams out of a thousand calories.

481
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:53,880
And so forth. Cholesterol is based on an earlier version of the dietary guidelines.

482
00:53:55,110 --> 00:54:00,540
We don't actually have recommendations for cholesterol anymore because the academy

483
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:06,870
basically is saying people should be consuming as little cholesterol as possible.

484
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:12,660
But that's what the FDA is using is this max of 300 milligrams.

485
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:15,150
And it's from an earlier dietary guideline.

486
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:22,110
Sodium is based on both dietary guidelines and the ice, and then the added sugars is based on the dietary guidelines.

487
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:27,990
So this is the basis for here.

488
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:36,440
So let me just show you an example. Total fat again.

489
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:43,460
30. The Facts label, the nutrition facts label is based on a 2000 calorie diet.

490
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:47,690
So 35% times 2000.

491
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:58,850
Kelly calories gives you 700 kill calories, 950 calories of fat per I mean nine calories per one gram of fat.

492
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:08,740
You 78 grams. That's the RV and jump ahead.

493
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:14,300
78 grams. That's the Derby for Total Fat.

494
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:20,090
I. Added sugars is 10%.

495
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:33,220
Again, it's the same same kind of map. So that gives you an idea of where the information is coming from, from this table here.

496
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:43,340
And so the percentages and the interest, in fact, label are based on all these numbers.

497
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:58,790
Okay. So, for example, appearances, this product has eight grams of total fat that the RV for total fat is 78 grams.

498
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:03,380
That results in a percent daily value of 10%.

499
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:12,500
So we're going to see where we're going with all this added sugars.

500
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:19,640
There's ten grams of added sugars. The DRP for added sugars was 50 grams.

501
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,780
That results in a 20% daily value.

502
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:36,809
And so, again, the whole purpose for these last few slides is for you to understand where those percentages,

503
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:41,840
the percentage of daily value is coming from. I know.

504
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,880
And please make sure I do get glazed over with all this.

505
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,420
But it's important for you guys to know where it is coming from.

506
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:52,910
And then the next point I wanted to cover is just the micronutrients.

507
00:56:52,920 --> 00:57:00,240
That's a little bit more straightforward because that's coming solely from the D, the dietary reference intakes from the academy.

508
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:03,570
So this is the table that they used.

509
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,790
And again, we're just interested in adults and children.

510
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:14,430
What they did for the micronutrients is they took the highest recommended level.

511
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:26,290
For either women or men probably ended up being men and that became the RDA for labels.

512
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:32,940
And so it is based on the Academy's. Dry eyes.

513
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:42,290
There's so many abbreviations crazy. But these all represent the highest recommended intake level.

514
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:54,890
So for example, calcium, there's 26 to 160 milligrams in this product, the RTI.

515
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:02,020
Is 1300 milligrams, so that results in 20% daily value.

516
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:11,710
Yeah. This may go back to like earlier in the semester, but most of these values are this standardized more towards like the white male.

517
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:16,810
Like, I mean, I know that's where a lot of our research comes from anyways, just in medicine.

518
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:28,630
So the basis for the actual recommended intakes for the E.R. and the RDA on the RDA are specific to gender and life stage.

519
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:32,950
So if they have enough information for nutrient requirements.

520
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:39,820
For women, they will. But these nutritional fact values.

521
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:43,040
Well, so these. So these are.

522
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:55,940
These are taking probably I'm assuming it's the RDA is more than likely because men may require more.

523
00:58:57,050 --> 00:59:04,400
It's probably coming from the male RDA is because they're taking the highest amount

524
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:09,530
and it may even be for some of them the amounts are highest for older adults,

525
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:14,910
so that may be what they're using. I haven't actually sat down to go through to see where it's coming from.

526
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,090
It would be an interesting exercise to see.

527
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:25,220
But yes, that's the important point, is just to know where that's coming from from the standpoint of the FDA,

528
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:29,390
because this is just an approximation of a 2000 calorie diet.

529
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:35,760
It's just interesting to think about some health disparity aspects to just in terms of the label.

530
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:46,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay.

531
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:57,870
Well. And the thing is. If. So if you were.

532
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:01,560
So let's just for argument's sake, say the calcium does reflect.

533
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,190
Actually, the calcium could be coming from post-menopausal women.

534
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:13,750
It's true because I don't know that I have to look again,

535
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:21,879
but I don't know that 1300 milligrams unless it's coming for men who are older and therefore they want them also to increase the

536
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:28,120
calcium intake that this actually could be coming from older women because of the current concerns of post-menopausal bone loss.

537
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:31,150
And so that 1300 may not be.

538
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:37,070
Yeah. It's just not an accurate representation of the whole. No, it's not.

539
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:41,740
It's not. But again, they have to. It's tricky. How how do you do this in a label?

540
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:47,360
How do you get represented? You know? Um, how do you do that?

541
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:57,940
So their, their justification is just that they went with the highest amount that was an RDA value or any value, and that's what's being used.

542
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:12,259
But what I was going to say is if this was derived from men's RDA and women's is lower than the way to think about this is

543
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:19,520
just that this product that has 260 milligrams of calcium is going to end up with an even higher percentage of daily value.

544
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:24,829
Right. That's not something that a consumer necessarily needs to know.

545
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:29,780
But if you're working with them in your mind, that's the kind of math you can do in your head.

546
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:34,850
Yeah. If they're over, like ingesting micro nutrients and that kind of stuff.

547
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:38,180
Just being aware of that, especially with the our eyes.

548
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:43,130
Well, say that again. I mean, if they're overconsuming micro nutrients and that.

549
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:50,900
Wow. So if these are the RDA is they're not going to be oh well the where where this could be over consuming is.

550
01:01:54,970 --> 01:02:02,560
Most consumers are not going to be focused on the amounts unless it's like sodium.

551
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:11,200
How do I want to say this? Where I would be concerned is if this was a five year old child and the parent

552
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:17,020
wanted to make sure that they were getting adequate one of the micronutrients.

553
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:23,680
We know this is going to be more than what a four year old or five year old is required.

554
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:28,809
And that's one of the reasons why it's more important to focus your education

555
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:35,650
notes on the percentages as in terms of what foods are higher in a nutrient,

556
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:39,850
what foods are lower, and there's a cut point that's easy for consumers to use.

557
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:44,440
Getting wading into the minutia of the actual numbers.

558
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:52,060
Most consumers are not going to do, especially if they're trying to think through, Oh, is this too much micronutrient for my child?

559
01:02:53,890 --> 01:03:00,640
They're not likely. So let me show you.

560
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:03,520
This is just an overview of what I just said.

561
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:12,640
So this is an example of how to use the percent daily value that if a daily value is 5% or less, it's low.

562
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:25,870
20% or more is high. So for the nutrients up above, we might want low values for saturated fats, for sodium, for cholesterol.

563
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:31,480
So you're going to be educating that for those nutrients, for cardiovascular concerns and so forth.

564
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:46,800
Strive for 5% or less. And then for nutrients where you want to promote like dietary fiber and vitamin D and so forth, you want to see 20% or more.

565
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:51,450
That's the kind of education that you'll want to focus on.

566
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:55,889
Yeah, I think answering your question without actually knowing what I was asking,

567
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:59,550
but yes, I knew what you're getting at because the problem is, is that.

568
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:07,060
Yes. That's how the FDA set it up is in terms of there are the eyes.

569
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:11,980
It's the highest or it's the highest dry value from the academy.

570
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:16,330
That's not a concern for the general public.

571
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:22,820
For the general public. So that's a better way of thinking.

572
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:26,390
I think it's easier to think about it from the percentage. Yeah.

573
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:34,090
Yeah. We doing for time here?

574
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:51,920
I think that's all I needed to point out here. So again, just thinking through if you were conducting some kind of education session in a community,

575
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:57,920
what aspects what features of the nutrition facts label would you want to focus on?

576
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:00,920
But what might you focus on?

577
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:11,360
You don't have to have all the answers, but also recommending if you're consuming, make sure to main for less than this amount of sodium.

578
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:19,700
Yeah I telling people like the general amount of sodium because there's a lot of products with way too much sodium.

579
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:28,099
Right. People don't know. And among adults, some of those, especially those who have already been told they have a high blood pressure,

580
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:33,920
may they may already have heard that we should be aiming for 2300 milligrams or less.

581
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:42,530
So there are occasions where somebody may actually have milligrams in their head of what they want to strive for staying under or near.

582
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:46,070
So certainly highlighting the sodium.

583
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:52,280
What else? And that actually may be true for potassium.

584
01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:57,740
Right. If somebody is in renal failure, they may know actual numbers for potassium.

585
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:05,870
Um, yeah. Clear portions of what a portion looks like in terms of the nutrients.

586
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:11,329
Right. It's important for them to know that this label here reflects two thirds of a cup.

587
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:15,890
So if they eat twice that much, they need to know that all the numbers.

588
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:21,820
Right? Yeah. Because sometimes that's not evident.

589
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:28,600
Go ahead. We talked about this in macro a lot, but like the difference between carbohydrates and fiber,

590
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:33,819
like it's considered a carbohydrate, but like those who are eating low carb diets may not be getting enough fiber.

591
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:36,850
So just emphasizing the importance of getting enough.

592
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:40,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was just like, underneath that.

593
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:47,950
Right. Carbohydrate. Yeah. Category. And the same thing with like added sugar, like five grams of sugar, but ten of those are added.

594
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:50,980
So like what that really means, right? Yeah.

595
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:54,910
So I'm not saying that you can't use the numbers, it's just.

596
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:11,270
I. It would be a difficult conversation to have if you were concerned about talking about the label from the standpoint of.

597
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:24,370
From it. You know, if this was a child and trying to think through, are they getting too much?

598
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:33,639
This is just one food product that they're consuming. Now, if they were consuming, let's just say I'm going to be let's say this was a box of cereal.

599
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:37,900
And the mother says they're in a cell. They're eating a cereal every day for every meal.

600
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:45,310
Then over time, we might and I bring this up because kids, especially toddlers,

601
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:52,000
have these food jags or these food where they just will eat only certain foods.

602
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:59,229
And that's it for a long period of time. And my mother tells the story that all I would eat is bananas and cottage cheese for about three weeks.

603
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:03,840
That's it. That's all I would eat. And then finally I moved on.

604
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:12,639
But, you know, if for some reason there was some issue where a child was just consuming the same food and it was fortified,

605
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:19,000
and then you might be consumed concerned over time if there was excessive nutrients.

606
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:31,270
But in this case, it's I think what's the most useful is just educating families on using the percent daily values and so forth.

607
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:35,560
Any other thoughts about what you would cover in an education setting?

608
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:43,149
Yeah, I do really think bringing up the five in 20% level is like that's something I never knew before.

609
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:50,950
And I think that would be just knowing high risk is low and just your daily food consumption to begin with.

610
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:51,310
Yeah,

611
01:08:51,730 --> 01:09:03,520
the Supreme Court and we did an education thing in Flint when the the whole lead in the water crisis occurred because they wanted to promote iron,

612
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:08,470
they wanted to promote iron, vitamin C intake.

613
01:09:09,010 --> 01:09:15,370
And so we had materials that were developed that included the facts, the nutrition facts label.

614
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:20,799
And so we had people come in from the community to just review the curriculum.

615
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:26,920
And one of the things that came up is one woman said, I look at the nutrition facts label and I just glaze over.

616
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:31,389
She said, I know I can look at calories, but I don't know what to do with the rest of the values.

617
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:37,630
So that was an interesting insight when she looked at all she saw was numbers and she said, I didn't know what to do with it.

618
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:46,270
So that's why I like this, as you say, 5% or 20%, that kind of education.

619
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:48,879
And that's what we had focused on. And that's what she said.

620
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:56,620
It was great because I was able to just narrow zero in on those percentages and look for certain percentages.

621
01:09:56,620 --> 01:10:04,569
So yeah, yeah. I was going to say too, kind of like I can understand if you're not used to reading all of this that you really overwhelming.

622
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:08,200
So if you're meeting with someone and they have like specific health goals,

623
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:13,359
giving them like one part of the label to look at so it doesn't feel is kind

624
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,480
of like too much information and you're not really sure what to do with it.

625
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:22,010
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I also prefer the absolute numbers versus the percentages.

626
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:26,349
Like if you're working with someone like my dad's in terminal cancer right now,

627
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:29,800
they really want me to have like 80 grams of protein every day and keep it straight.

628
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:34,239
So we're just working on that absolute number versus what percentage of whatever

629
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:40,900
that is right now is just what it labels and reading actual numbers and some folks.

630
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:47,080
So having the absolute numbers is new and that is important because as you know,

631
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:52,120
as you all have highlighted, there may be people who actually need to know absolute numbers.

632
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:58,870
I have to keep track of calcium. So I look at calcium, the milligrams of calcium in products.

633
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:04,599
And so and it was added to this for this very reason for those consumers that do

634
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:09,759
need to keep track of absolute numbers and don't rely on the percent daily value,

635
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,719
they need to know the actual amount. So thank you for highlighting that.

636
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:18,400
We've kind of been dancing around that point, but not really making it explicit.

637
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:27,100
Would you say like for the normal consumer, like unless they have like a specific thing to look at, like, I don't know,

638
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:35,559
like I feel like, like we all talked about like it's it's very daunting to look at this and edit like what the value of it really is.

639
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:40,990
Like, other than like, I don't know. I don't know. I just feel like there's, like, so many numbers and.

640
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:45,569
It could be like a lot for just a normal consumer.

641
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:52,200
So how important is it really that like eye for a child, like you're responsible for so much of a chat, like to keep a child safe,

642
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:57,600
but then to have to look at how much iron they're getting, how much, whatever they're getting, like that could be a lot, you know what I mean?

643
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:01,800
I don't know. I just feel like that's what we're kind of getting at. It is overwhelming.

644
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:16,230
So if you were to just do three touch points for education material for, let's say, parents, caregivers, what theory would you highlight?

645
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:23,130
What do you think are the three most important points they should know from the nutrition facts label?

646
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:32,279
Yeah, I would mention the high, low values looking at added sugar and then looking at the portion size instead of the calories.

647
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:38,730
I think that's a big thing. Okay, so portion size calories, the high, low value.

648
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:45,640
And then the added sugars. Anybody have any other thoughts?

649
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:54,220
It's important when you develop education materials for the public or consumers caregivers.

650
01:12:54,250 --> 01:13:00,870
You don't want to overwhelm them with too much information. So two or three really important nuggets is what you want to strive for.

651
01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:06,900
I'm going to say I got it. Like depends on what people are looking for in terms of like how.

652
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:14,429
But I feel like the saturated, saturated fat, like if you look at total thought and then having the breakdown not just might be good

653
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:19,350
if you're trying to stay away from that because like even if you look at calories,

654
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:23,640
it's not going to tell you like how much how many of those calories coming from fat versus protein.

655
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:30,000
So I think that we have audiences of caregivers of children.

656
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:38,280
We have audiences of people who may be following a particular diet because of cardiovascular risk.

657
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:48,150
And we have folks that may be following a diet because of other chronic disease risk or they may already have the disease.

658
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:55,110
And so you have multiple audiences. So that's another important point, is knowing who your audience is right now,

659
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:58,830
there will be times where you have to provide education material that is general,

660
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:05,610
but there will be times where if you can dig a little deeper and find out who your audience is, you can tailor it because you're right.

661
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:08,059
There are certain there's different aspects.

662
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:15,330
So if you think about, what, three sources of information do I want them to get from this it this dependent on the audience?

663
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:21,850
Yeah. Any other thoughts about the nutrition facts label?

664
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:29,410
Yeah. I'm just saying, personally, I have two friends with type one diabetes and they're very much aware of these

665
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:34,710
about carbs and protein relative to nutrition facts because that matters for them.

666
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:39,260
So thank you, Mike. Does that apply to the general election, you point out?

667
01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:42,850
Oh, we want to aim for this amount of protein and carbs.

668
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,630
Right. I'm not sure you can provide examples.

669
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:54,280
You know, you could say if any of you have any chronic if you're at risk for any chronic disease,

670
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:58,690
you might consider, you know, monitoring saturated fat and sodium.

671
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:06,920
Or if maybe you are or somebody else in your family has a risk for diabetes,

672
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:13,550
you might be monitoring the added sugar carbohydrate dietary fiber content.

673
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:17,520
Yeah. Yeah.

674
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:21,060
I think I would also emphasize I'm checking on the sodium.

675
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:31,650
The sodium, because I think for children, the food that you eat at the early stage would affect your preference for food for a very long time.

676
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:37,020
Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And that's an important point for caregivers,

677
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:50,130
especially with toddlers and starting out with the foods that infants are consuming when they should not be putting any sodium in foods for infants,

678
01:15:50,430 --> 01:15:56,520
but certainly for toddlers and children, they should be selecting foods that are lower in sodium.

679
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:05,130
Right. Yeah. All right. I'm not going to get to food allergens, but we I will just cover that on Wednesday and Wednesday.

680
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:08,130
I will also touch base with I didn't have time today,

681
01:16:08,370 --> 01:16:17,489
but I will touch base about some just some very easy fixes that came across both with the background

682
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:25,230
section in your drafts that I will just share with you on class on Wednesday and then yeah,

683
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:36,890
so Calgon Halloween, you and I will see you guys on Wednesday when you're working.
