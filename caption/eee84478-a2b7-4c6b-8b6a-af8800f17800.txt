1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,970
This is each MP 26 login and probe it models part three.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:17,959
So I'm going to have a very simple example here with six observations that's totally made up data about professors and whether or not they get tenure.

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:26,840
So that's a binary outcome, yes or no as a function of just one variable, which is the number of published papers they have.

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:34,159
Obviously, tenure decisions depend on far more than this, but let's just keep the problem simple for the moment.

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,319
We have six observations, and instead of just being a simple coin flip,

6
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,830
we want to make this more interesting and allow the probability to depend on the number of published papers.

7
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,700
So we see here in our made up dataset that we have three people who did get tenure.

8
00:00:52,720 --> 00:01:00,850
Three people who did not. And the variation in the number of published papers goes from two to about 20.

9
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,570
Now, if we ignore the number of published papers for the moment and just think about this as a binary outcome,

10
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,350
we can write the likelihood function in the following way.

11
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,649
The first person did not get tenure, so we call that one minus P.

12
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,600
The next two did get tenure, so that's probability P and P and so forth.

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:28,270
And if we combine like terms, we get a likelihood function that's p raised to the third power, one minus P raised to the third power.

14
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,340
We don't care about what order these faculty came up for tenure decision.

15
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,580
So there's no choose part. It would fall out any way.

16
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,080
If we go through the usual steps of optimization, we can take derivatives.

17
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:46,420
After taking the logarithm this anyway, we would come up with a p out of 0.5.

18
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:53,690
But we want to make this a function of the number of papers published.

19
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,330
But we also want to avoid the problem of predictions outside the range zero one.

20
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,900
So we have to come up with a new way of thinking about this,

21
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:14,180
a new functional form such that we can rewrite the probability P to be a function of covariates and yet somehow not go outside the zero one.

22
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,470
There's there are two standard ways to do this. One is a logit, one's a probit.

23
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,430
And what they effectively do is they the.

24
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:31,000
Big Bend, the prediction curve, so that it's forced to be between zero and one.

25
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:41,140
So remember, in the low birth weight example, instead of the two descending lines, one for hypertensive and the other for non hypertensive mothers,

26
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:50,470
those were straight lines and they just ran off the bottom of the graph and were not contained by zero one.

27
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:58,870
What Logan Probit do is they have a different mathematical functional form that bends that curve and keeps it within zero one.

28
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:09,760
So let's go through loads. At first we're going to write the probability as a function of X with a following formula.

29
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,910
It's going to be one divided by one plus E to the minus x beta.

30
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,570
Remembering that Expedia's the linear index, including constant term and lots of other variables.

31
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:32,200
So let's pause for a moment and think about what this means and how this has a particular shape to it.

32
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:39,220
By the way, there are two ways of writing this. I typically write it one over one plus E to the minus x beta.

33
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:46,180
If you multiply both numerator and denominator by E to the x beta, you get the second formulation.

34
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:52,750
They're numerically identical. E raised to the x rated divided by erase x beta plus one.

35
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,830
I prefer the first one because it only has one Expedia in it instead of two.

36
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:10,790
But it all works out the same. Let's use the first formula and think about what happens when Expedia takes on several different values.

37
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,020
First of all, zero. Suppose the linear index is zero.

38
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:23,980
That that once you add up all those terms, you get exactly zero e to the -0 is the same as E to the zero.

39
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,220
Anything raised to the zero power is one.

40
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:34,030
So that term would simplify to one. Then we have one over one plus one is a half.

41
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:41,680
So that's a very important thing to remember, that whenever the linear index is about zero,

42
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:47,110
the predicted probability for a logit model will be about 50%.

43
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,360
What happens, though, when Expedia gets really big or really small?

44
00:04:53,390 --> 00:05:00,440
First, what happens if it gets really big? So then we have e to the minus big number in the denominator.

45
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,740
Well, E to the minus big number is going to be a really tiny, tiny, tiny fraction, but positive.

46
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,090
So then we have one over one plus a tiny bit.

47
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:16,400
That's almost one. It's almost 100%, but just slightly below.

48
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:24,730
In fact, you can never, ever. Get anything that's outside of that's bigger than one.

49
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:37,370
No matter how big Expedia gets. Similarly, if Expedia goes to negative infinity, then we have E to the minus negative infinity, which blows up.

50
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,780
That's positive infinity to the big number gets really big.

51
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:49,809
And then you have one over a big number, plus one is close to zero, but you can never get below zero.

52
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:55,600
You can never get a negative number with that formula. So you're always bound between zero and one and you get that shape.

53
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:03,820
So let's use that formula and plug in the numbers from the ten year example.

54
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:15,940
So we're going to specify the linear index is having a constant beta nine and a variable P, which is the number of papers published.

55
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:22,870
So we have each the minus beta naught minus beta one times p.

56
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,820
Think about the likelihood function as being the product of six probabilities.

57
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,440
Probability for each of the six professors who are going up for tenure.

58
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:48,600
We're going to write the first probability as one minus P, that is one minus one over one plus E to the minus bit and on minus two, beta one, y two.

59
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:55,459
That's because the first person published two papers and so that is their predicted probability.

60
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,970
If we knew what beta naught and beta one were, then we could.

61
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,030
Plug that into the formula and get a specific number. I don't know.

62
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,760
Maybe it's 8%. Maybe it's 12%, some number.

63
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:15,190
The second person did get tenure. So we write that is P or one over one plus even minus six beta.

64
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,580
We plug in beta not and 12 beta one.

65
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:31,330
We get the second term. We can keep going and plug in 21, nine, 20 and 16 with either the formula for P or one minus P.

66
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,200
So then you get that expression for the likelihood function.

67
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:42,220
It has six terms. Three of them are of the form one minus the probability of tenure.

68
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,870
Three of them are of the form probability of tenure. They all have a beta or not.

69
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,000
They all have a beta one multiplied by the number of papers that the person published.

70
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:58,690
So that's a a nonlinear function. It depends on beta naught and beta one.

71
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,150
And we could use maximum likelihood. To solve that.

72
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,730
And that'll be the topic of the next class after this. We're just trying to set up the problem here.

73
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:21,450
Next, we're going to do the same sort of thing. But with the probe it function now the probe, it's a little more complicated.

74
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,770
At least the formula appears more complicated.

75
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,750
So let me try and walk you through what this means.

76
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:40,920
Again, it's going to be the the probability P as a function of X, the probability that the outcome Y equals one as a function of X.

77
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:49,530
And this is often written as capital fee, the Greek letter fee of x, beta y fee,

78
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,200
not exactly sure, but that's what's commonly used for the normal distribution.

79
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:05,040
And the Probit function assumes that there is an underlying distribution of the errors that is normally distributed,

80
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:11,400
whereas the logistic function assumes that the errors have a logistic distribution.

81
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,200
So how are those two different logit and prove it?

82
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:22,270
They're almost the same. In fact, if we go back a couple of slides show you the to see DFS.

83
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,220
May I look at them? I see essentially the same.

84
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,780
I cannot tell the difference between those. They're basically the same.

85
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,510
They're slightly different, but they're very, very close.

86
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,710
Let's take a look at this. Integral. Looks really messy.

87
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,270
Let's talk through what it means.

88
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:52,210
If you remember the formula for a normal distribution, this will look very familiar e to the minus t squared over two.

89
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,770
Or think of it as E to the minus t squared.

90
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,530
That is a basically a PDF.

91
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,049
It's bell shaped. It's centered around zero.

92
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:13,850
T equals zero. If you integrate that bell curve, you will get an area of one under it.

93
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:19,210
If it has the proper normalization and turns out it's one over square root of two pi,

94
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:24,700
that's what gets you an integral of the PDF to get you an area of one.

95
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,120
And that's what you need to make this a proper CDF.

96
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:36,309
And it's a good time to just point out that this formula here, the integral, is a CDF.

97
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:46,090
It is a cumulative distribution function because it gives the cumulative probability of something happening,

98
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:51,790
something being true from minus infinity up to basically x beta.

99
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,510
Oh. So. So this probability is a CDF.

100
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,450
It is related to the normal distribution.

101
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:13,450
And we're always going to write this not as the integral form, but as capital fee of X data.

102
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,630
So let's go back to writing out the likelihood function.

103
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,460
We're going to write this in terms of fee, which actually makes it a little easier.

104
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,290
So it's going to be one minus fee of beta, not plus two beta one.

105
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:35,020
That's the the expression for the probability of not getting tenure for someone who has published two papers.

106
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,850
Times Capital five beta not plus 12 beta one.

107
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:44,560
That's the the expression for the probability of getting tenure.

108
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:51,339
If you have 12 published papers and so forth, the next person, it's a probability.

109
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,060
P So it's capital fee. They have 21 published papers.

110
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,670
Next person did not get tenure, so it's one minus fee. Nine papers and so forth.

111
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,770
So the big picture structure here is like the logit.

112
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:11,739
We have six terms. Three of them are one minus the probability.

113
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,570
Three of them are just the probability.

114
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:25,180
And they depend on they depend on the linear index, the constant, be it or not, and beta one times the number of papers published.

115
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:36,880
So again, we've found a way to write a likelihood function the both the logit and the probit.

116
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,459
The expression for PS bounded between zero and one.

117
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,400
They can never be below zero. They can never be above.

118
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:54,820
Once we've solved that problem, the likelihood function is this product of probabilities of one term per observation.

119
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,790
And it turns out that we are multiplying together a bunch of CDOs.

120
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:09,639
There's another way of writing the likelihood function that we're going to be using

121
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:15,430
a lot because this data set that we just use for tenure only has six observations.

122
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,380
Not that hard to write out each term.

123
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:25,239
But again, more commonly, we're going to have hundreds, thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands of observations.

124
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,170
You don't want to write out the likelihood function with, I don't know,

125
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:36,160
50 covariates and just be a mess and pages and pages to try and write out the whole likelihood function.

126
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:41,480
So we need a shorter way to do this and we'll typically do something like what's on this page,

127
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,960
or we have capital pie, which means product of a whole bunch of things.

128
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:54,100
And we're actually going to write this with two terms per observation.

129
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,590
So there's the probability that Y equals one, and there's a probability that Y equals zero.

130
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,350
And you say, Well, wait a minute, each observation, they either got tenure or they didn't.

131
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:12,790
They either were readmitted or they didn't. They they either were admitted to the hospital or they weren't.

132
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:19,020
They either have insurance or they weren't. You can't have both. Well, we're going to do a hopefully clever thing here.

133
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,390
We're going to use these exponents.

134
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,139
In in the following way,

135
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:30,450
we're going to write an expression for each observation the probability that Y equals one and the probability that Y equals zero.

136
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,959
And then we're going to raise it to either Y or why?

137
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:44,730
-1 to 1? Minus Y. Remember that the the outcome wise either equal to zero or it's equal to one.

138
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:52,020
So. If you raise something to the zero power.

139
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:59,820
Then that whole term, no matter how ugly it is, that whole expression reduces to the number one.

140
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,800
And so the exponents here are either one.

141
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,210
And zero, or if y equals zero, then it's zero and one.

142
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:22,530
In other words, the exponents kick out one of the two expressions for probabilities that's appropriate for that observation.

143
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,850
So the first person in the tenured dataset did not get tenure.

144
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:36,159
So why is zero? So we would write an expression here for the probability of getting tenure if that's what had happened.

145
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:44,590
But then we're going to raise it to the zero power, which means basically discount that part of the expression times.

146
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:51,220
The probability that they did not get ten year y equals zero raised to the one -0 or one.

147
00:15:51,230 --> 00:16:02,110
So basically the exponents keep the piece of this of this formula that is appropriate for that observation.

148
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:14,860
More generally, we can write this as a CDF times one minus the CDF rise to either Y or one minus Y to the logistic function is a CDF.

149
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:19,480
The appropriate function is a CDF. So we can also write it this way.

150
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:31,420
The product from equals one two end of one over one policy, the minus x beta brings to the Y or one minus that raised to the one minus y.

151
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:37,990
Or we can write it in terms of fee and one minus fee, depending on whether it's logit or it.

152
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,980
These are a couple of qualities that are good to keep in mind.

153
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:55,260
The. Simply because these functions are symmetric, that the underlying PDFs are symmetric.

154
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:04,980
So one over one plus E to the plus x beta is also equal to one minus one over one plus i.e. the minus x beta.

155
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,470
It's worth playing around with these formulas just enough that you can verify that and remember

156
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:16,000
that there are different ways of writing these that are kind of equivalent or one minus.

157
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:27,960
So keep that in mind. Also because of symmetry around zero fee of minus six beta is one minus fee of zero.

158
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:34,480
So that's the end of this chapter on Probit Models.
