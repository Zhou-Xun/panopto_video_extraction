1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,620
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Oh, he has Eisenhower this morning.

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,340
Trump is more. Me. You? Yeah.

3
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,640
Okay. I think one of the be solved. Oh, my.

4
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:28,250
Okay. Well, morning, everyone.

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,600
We are going to start our today's lecture about nutrition and immunity.

6
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:40,940
So housekeeping and I also mean I did finish in grade in your last home work that went out you last week.

7
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,810
I would post decorate most likely within the afternoon.

8
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:56,960
Also, as part of this class you have to write the final report for this class I at the end of the semester.

9
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,540
Then I'm planning to board the instruction next week.

10
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,770
Then you will have more or less like a month to write the report.

11
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,620
Basically some questions about on that topic that we had this course.

12
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:19,040
But for the report, I would like to have for you a more in-depth discussion about these different topics.

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,529
I will post the interactions most likely next week.

14
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:31,040
I still thinking about some of the questions and then we will discuss that next week.

15
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:40,490
Okay. Today we're going to talk about nutrition and immunity and how that affects in chronic diseases.

16
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:49,670
Now, during class, we have been talking about different selective forces that have been affecting our evolution.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,090
We know, for example, the risks of starvation.

18
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,580
We talk about the trafficking hypotheses.

19
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:10,100
Although we have been discussing about the evolution of our brain side, then the selective forces that may have resulting longer longevity in humans.

20
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:17,060
But now we are going to to talk about one of the strongest selective factors.

21
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,790
You know what you eat. What would you I mean, fighting is the strongest.

22
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:31,670
It's one factor. The half our shape, our DNA, proximity to what we feel is the burden of pathogens, infectious diseases.

23
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:42,650
Now, as you know, during history and only even before the audio,

24
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:54,000
what is because they have been a high burden of infection diseases that the sources that we have from

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,280
historical records show that have been the leading cause of death throughout human history are estimated.

26
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:10,230
For example, about 60% of that death in mid-19th century in England was due to infectious diseases.

27
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,290
Until in the terrible region, the life expectancy in Europe, in Europe was only 25 fold.

28
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:29,459
What the life expectancy at birth. And by that same time, by the end of the 19th century, only about 35% of people reach age of 40 on the euro.

29
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,690
Then, as you can imagine,

30
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:42,690
there was that high and this was mostly due in part to high infant mortality because there was the time that mortality was very high.

31
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:50,640
Then the likelihood once a person was born to read more than 40 years old was very low, more about one third.

32
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:01,320
Question, professor before the into travel industry revolution that people live up to 25 years old early.

33
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,720
Not that the average. The average. Exactly. That the the I suspect that's the average.

34
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,240
I see exactly what that what people that need more than that.

35
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:18,360
But a lot of them had illnesses and that even though that that's an average because you'll see that even by the 19th century,

36
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,810
at least one third of people need more than 40 years old.

37
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,940
And that 25 years, you know, these are now average. Okay.

38
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:34,480
Thank you. You're welcome. Now, if we compare compared to the Bible curve throughout throughout history,

39
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:45,010
there is one this one is from the UK and at the beginning of the 21st century, but comparing from different sources from,

40
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:53,260
for example, from the Paleolithic and that really and again, I want to stress here the limitations about the ritual from this area,

41
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:59,170
because that is based on archeological records from bombs remains.

42
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:09,550
Then there could be some biases about that. But still you'll see the huge infant mortality, a huge mortality in very life.

43
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,160
After that, there was still high mortality.

44
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:22,030
But what's less pronounced at that during that even some years, but still you'll see that in England in the middle 19th century,

45
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:31,299
still that survival was very similar to what was there during the LDH, for example, that what you dig in.

46
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:37,270
So even now in 21st century in some countries due to high infant mortality, infection,

47
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:43,750
diseases, we still have a long, long way to go to try to improve the survival curve.

48
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:55,320
Now that I want to read to you the puzzle you have have a very strong factor in the evolution of our genome.

49
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:08,880
Now I want to show you these two pedigrees. These are the pedigrees from Pasteur and from Darwins that you have in work with this type of pedigrees.

50
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:14,280
Basically, it's where our main characters are women.

51
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,590
These are dark field.

52
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:25,710
When we see this dark field. Because in this particular case, they are there, they die.

53
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,600
And you see here that okay, fair.

54
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,160
What do you upsetting these two pedigrees?

55
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:47,370
If I show you these two pedigrees and these are so good that I want what came to your what your first impression more women died.

56
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:58,560
Okay. In the case of Pasteur. But Pasteur he has he got four daughters and then one from then.

57
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,240
But yeah, that's a good observation.

58
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,180
But right now, beside that, beside that, my body is in fact, I mean,

59
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,610
because you see that because Pasteur has more daughters, that's Pasteur has more daughters, which.

60
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,810
Yes, yes. Yeah. You see that Pasteur. Louis Pasteur. Louis Pasteur.

61
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,260
Yes. Four daughters. That's the one legs.

62
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,270
Okay. What other impression you have from these pedigrees?

63
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:38,360
From these two pedigrees. Oh, because so young.

64
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:45,830
Yeah. Nine years old. 11, 13 and oh, two years old.

65
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:58,880
Exactly. You see further high mortality and in fact, infant mortality, at least our very young aged, you see from Buster Jean die at nine years old.

66
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:07,399
So see, love 13. I'm coming to just two years old from Darwin's pedigree.

67
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,790
And you'll see here they see how Darwin's married here.

68
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:17,090
He's 30, recalls cinema. They say this means that they were related.

69
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,440
And we observe that. And I do.

70
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:28,340
Then you all marry about one year old and Charles, about two years old.

71
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,510
They're all star. Yes. Big family.

72
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:37,909
Oh, yeah. That was very, very common at that time.

73
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:49,850
Very large families. Infant mortality, in my own case, my age, my, my, both my both lay maternal and paternal grandparents.

74
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,060
They have also big families.

75
00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:04,280
But what very common to to get this kind of mortality and you have about one kid that I you to most likely infection diseases.

76
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:18,880
Now, um, just a little bit of history I will any lesson of well that though that is still loaded by two page

77
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:25,540
eight whether sequential and distorted or something like that when most likely according to the

78
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:37,030
symptoms and the way that we wrote seen that they from tuberculosis was at that time the or and is

79
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:45,730
dead the grief that that child had was so strong that he was unable to attend her daughter funeral.

80
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,020
They are both from the historian. They were actually man,

81
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:58,330
that's what it is because I don't know you know of the history of Darwin by he before the publication went

82
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:07,420
that for you know decades of the book he already was a very famous biologist who had done a lot of work,

83
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,900
but he didn't publish that book for several years.

84
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:22,450
He had that data because but if in that therefore it wasn't got that is for him to finalize the book and to publish that or even that species.

85
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:38,229
Now they say he in Europe he had worked up in England but also in Hispanic America from colonial times and talking from the 16th century up to the

86
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:45,160
middle 20th century because of the high infant mortality was very common where

87
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,150
for two families to have at least one with their kids die to early ages,

88
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,829
there was a tradition, what was called Cat Wake or the little angel in Spanish that bellowed your or

89
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:03,590
that they lacked a little it was more like a pardon because wasn't such common

90
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:11,020
the the that kids they died early ages that there was the belief that these

91
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,660
little kids they were directly due to having to do that they might believe.

92
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:25,510
And there was more like a celebration of God it was grief it there was pain,

93
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:32,079
but also was a kind of celebration, a body with some music, food to celebrate.

94
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,360
The passing of this little dangers goes directly to heaven. But that was you go to the high mortality.

95
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,530
You can imagine that the grief of all these families having one at least one of their

96
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:49,450
kids died early ages then that was a way to cope with these with that pain I was very,

97
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,490
very accord molested in some part of Hispanic America. You can find these type of celebrations.

98
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,420
But now with reduction of infant mortality is less common.

99
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:14,080
Now that on one hand, we have these pathogens.

100
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:24,670
They are causing death. But on the other hand, we have our genome that has been selected to respond to these pathogens.

101
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:32,410
Now we have them, for example, that they confer resistance to pathogens or even we could have some genes that confer,

102
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,440
rather, since you meet sensitivity to certain pathogens.

103
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:43,030
Now what we know from that are from our own genes related to infectious diseases.

104
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:52,090
There are a few genes that confer resistance with acting thoughtfully and for example,

105
00:12:52,090 --> 00:13:01,420
are resistant against malaria are the major factor related to resistance to malaria.

106
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:07,360
Hemoglobin data on the hemoglobin B affected anemia.

107
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:14,350
Also, there are certain genes that confer resistance against leprosy.

108
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:22,750
Really? Yep. Also, they are some very rare genes and very rare are in very low frequency down.

109
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:32,080
We found this in a few families, in a few individuals that rather they are associated with with Immunodeficiencies.

110
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:40,990
And then we had these have been combined immunodeficiency that then is related to our severe infection disease because there is no immunity,

111
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,540
but they are very rare in that in the general population.

112
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,860
Then this is more or less the spectrum of genes related to number of pathogens that we observe in human populations.

113
00:13:53,660 --> 00:14:01,190
Now there are certain genes that they have Mendelian susceptibility to infections.

114
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:10,190
By Mendelian susceptibility, I mean that they are inherited along families in these.

115
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:16,700
They are highly penetrant. Do you remember what did that penetrance of aging.

116
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,940
How often? It's like the frequency at which it's passed down.

117
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,590
The likelihood of it being passed to the next generation yet more is.

118
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,480
Yes, that's right. But is the likelihood of that phenotype to be expressed?

119
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,850
Yes. Now there are several genes that they converted susceptibility to infections.

120
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:48,260
Here you'll have to guess at least of both genes and some of the clinical phenotype that you

121
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,470
call phenotype are some of the genes that are related to this susceptibility to infections.

122
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,680
These actors activated the infection and they are already in development.

123
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:09,630
Very resistance to infections for, um, for malaria.

124
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:19,080
Besides the mutation in the hemoglobin B, there are mutations in these receptor very resistance to malaria.

125
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:29,280
They are other gene, for example, that receptors are five that confer resistance to HIV infections are also related or football type of viruses.

126
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:41,520
So there even if exposed people have a specific gene that will like if you're if a person who has the CCR five gene.

127
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,740
Is exposed to HIV that still have resistance.

128
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:54,530
Yes, they are less likely. And I want here because when we talk about about genes, because we have all that gene, rather,

129
00:15:54,620 --> 00:16:05,930
what they have is a certain barrier to what that gene, particular mutation, that gene that compares very high degree of resistance.

130
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,430
So how do they test this is in humans? Yeah, this is in humans.

131
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:19,100
Now, we can we can sequence the genome for any person and see whether we have particular any pattern that we want to know.

132
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:32,210
And now it is very cheap to do it. Now you can get your whole genome sequenced for about $1,000, for example.

133
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,680
So we could find out if we have that mutation.

134
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:46,440
Well, I think what Larry's finding is a thousand or you do the whole mapping know for a single person, you think a person let's say you want to have.

135
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,460
You want to know your whole sequences and your whole genome.

136
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:55,650
1000, though, is about 1000. Or you send your your DNA to one of these commercial companies.

137
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,060
Oh, yeah. Come on.

138
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,830
Yes, it's in for large scale epidemiological studies.

139
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,450
A little bit expensive. Imagine you have a thousand individual bet.

140
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,480
$1,000. We're talking about a $1 million.

141
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:21,440
But when the in down in the nineties when there was this huge international effort to sequence the whole genome,

142
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:29,090
humans was called the international human genome. That budget for that genome was international.

143
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:37,550
You'd have to stay several countries in Europe. Australia was, I think, like a more than $1,000,000,000, that whole effort.

144
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:51,800
Wow. But after that, there was huge advance on technology or bug informatics that now is is you can get it by $1,000 lecture at home.

145
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:59,570
Yeah. Morales.

146
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:05,640
Now, why would the others see it that we were dealing with in the world is malaria,

147
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,790
and you'll see how our prevalence of malaria has changed over time.

148
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:16,320
Alley Doing it in the in the 20th century and early 21st century,

149
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:23,820
you'll see that the very beginning of the 20th century, malaria was widely prevalent through the world.

150
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,850
But now my reality is at the beginning of the 21st century.

151
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:41,190
We see that indeed did we have regions in the war world will have a high prevalence but in other parts of the world.

152
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,620
Malaria have been basically eradicated.

153
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:53,729
Now what this shows is that even now, with all the advance of medicine and prevention is still we are under observing.

154
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,910
We are as a species, the human species.

155
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,690
We are still under the burden of infection diseases.

156
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:07,400
Now, do you see the malaria, for example, in the United States and you see how map from that 8 a.m.,

157
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:14,370
1870s, they say what the distribution of malaria in the United States.

158
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:23,070
You see all the fouls. What we know is that the Midwest, even in some parts of New England, there was cases of malaria.

159
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:35,980
Mm. Now I want again to stress how malaria has the global problem.

160
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:44,890
This is example reason the number of deaths by third year in the world by malaria are still very high.

161
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:54,280
You see in Africa, almost half a million persons die due to malaria per year.

162
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:01,690
We have been seeing some decrease by this very high number of deaths.

163
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:05,590
Yep. Researchers have a short story to tell. Hmm.

164
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:13,750
You know, we meet women. Think that second hardest to fight other than your husband is hairdresser.

165
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:23,620
The other one is the car mechanics. I have. I had a very good car mechanic, but he went to Africa for a wedding.

166
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,200
He got married. He died. Oh, no. Can you imagine just having your real life?

167
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,000
I mean, right now. Right here? Yep. Yep. Yes.

168
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:45,970
Yeah. There still is a problem now. I know they are some kind of vaccine for malaria, but I don't know how effective they are.

169
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,470
But still, these are. These are a lot of our missionaries.

170
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,590
They all got something like this. Mm hmm. Some of the prevention is not really there.

171
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:05,559
The the one with the problems is that they are these very highly prevalent diseases.

172
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:12,670
They are still no, um, preventive, uh, very effective preventive approaches.

173
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:18,550
Some of the research also is trying to understand what are the our I,

174
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:29,770
let's say on factor genetic factor that will be somehow provide resistance to this type of of all diseases, at least in the case of malaria.

175
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:43,990
And this is some recent data. Uh, well, in, in Africa, more, more than half of death of children younger than five years old due to malaria.

176
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:50,410
Wow. In these places where there is this high, high prevalence of malaria.

177
00:21:50,950 --> 00:22:02,649
Now, you have been estimated that in these communities where everyone is continually rate affected by malaria, they encode genetic factor,

178
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:08,290
meaning our own genes account for about 25% of that risk of severe malaria,

179
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:16,240
meaning that we have the pathogen factors because we have differing strains of malaria, different type of malaria.

180
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:25,569
But our own genetic factors, at least in these our results from this part of the world to get about a quarter of that

181
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:30,640
risk of severe malaria is just playing by our own genes by region of our own genes.

182
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,080
I don't quite understand that.

183
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:41,110
What that means is that some people are going to get more severe malaria than others, and that is due in part to the genes of that person.

184
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:47,440
Oh, they are. They are they are so important that our because the gene that they have there by region that they have,

185
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:52,720
they are maybe more likely to receive to at least to have a moderate infection compared to others.

186
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:04,210
Now, the strongest genetic determinant that we know so far for malaria is that hemoglobin is plentiful in sickle cell anemia,

187
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,450
but that only account for about 2% of the total variation of resistant to malaria.

188
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:15,130
There are still other views that we are looking for and so far.

189
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:24,510
So far, then only a few factory addresses that have been discovered.

190
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,910
What about our own antibodies? Yeah, that.

191
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,230
That's related to our own genes because that produces antibodies.

192
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:40,940
We going to double now in of innate immunity while the immunity is determined by our genes.

193
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:54,470
Now, not all then all this part for you are going to act all of our genome and we are going to be hitting effect on our genome.

194
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:00,170
I want now here to explain a little bit about the different type of natural selection.

195
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:06,499
I mean, that negative natural selection that will tell you to not find that the selection you get,

196
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,990
rather that removal of deleterious animals from the population by natural selection.

197
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,510
Now, this is most likely the more frequent novel form of natural selection.

198
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:31,100
Imagine, for example, that in the population there is a new mutation that causes individual to die from the disease early in life.

199
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:39,530
Then because of that, the mutation is going to disappear in the population or is going to be in very low frequency in the population.

200
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:49,879
And this is what we observe for for by regions that are under negative natural selection usually works at this very rare barrier.

201
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,450
And by rare, I mean low frequency. Mm hmm.

202
00:24:54,290 --> 00:25:01,399
Now, the other type of natural selection that I find is that type of natural selection that we think most likely when we when we

203
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:10,080
talk about natural selection is that positive natural selection that is rather that increase in frequency of advantages.

204
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:17,300
And you imagine I gave this example a feeling like you said, well,

205
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:27,140
imagine that that we have a new barrier from COVID, high mortality, material mortality, highly infectious rate.

206
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,290
If there is any mutation that confer resistance,

207
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:37,910
that mutation is going to increase in frequency that this is the other type of natural selection that we observe.

208
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:44,210
Professor, can you just repeat what you just said? Yeah, what I mean is that the increase.

209
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:53,960
Yeah, increase. Because remember, alien frequencies, they change from zero if they are not present to one or 100% because there is an advantage.

210
00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:04,430
Mutation over time is going to increase in frequency from zero or very low to almost 1% to 100% over time.

211
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:15,020
How fast in time will depend on how strongly natural selection, how fast depends on the strength of natural selection.

212
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,980
So the strength is higher. Faster. Exactly.

213
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,510
Because remember, we did the exercise of old genetic drift.

214
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:28,790
Yes, I remember that just by random and in frequency can change over time.

215
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,110
But they change it slowly, but by natural selection only faster.

216
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,310
That is saw that type of natural selection. That is called balancing selection.

217
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:45,499
And the typical example is the sickle cell anemia, because remember,

218
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:54,260
sickle cell anemia confer resistance against malaria, but which is harmful because they set designer anemia.

219
00:26:54,260 --> 00:27:00,440
People with this phenotype, with the mutation they can have, they are higher or higher risk of a stroke,

220
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,760
for example, because there are problems in the flow of blood.

221
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:10,280
But in regions with high prevalence of malaria,

222
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:18,920
there is going to be a tradeoff between the resistance against malaria and the deleterious effect of these mutation due to the anemia.

223
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:29,600
Now, one way that we can identify natural selection nor any humans,

224
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:38,270
but any other species that are interested on it just by looking in these non synonymous mutations.

225
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,620
Can anyone remember what is a non synonymous mutation?

226
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:56,790
Oh, I think. And he is.

227
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:04,720
Like that. Yeah.

228
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:14,810
Isn't that just, like, one section? Yep.

229
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,840
Yeah. Let me explain. Remember that because of that genetic code.

230
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:28,730
Exactly. There are certain mutations that we can change on that DNA on the sequence of DNA,

231
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,210
but we don't have any changes in that in the protein that are called silent mutations.

232
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,450
However, there are other mutations that we have to change on that DNA.

233
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,330
And also we're going to have a change in the sequence of that protein.

234
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:54,290
Then those are called 1900 mutations. Now those mutations, because we are changing the sequence of the protein, can be an antibody, can be an enzyme,

235
00:28:54,590 --> 00:29:06,810
can be every sector in the cell membrane is more likely to have phenotypic effects, then they are more likely to be under natural selection then.

236
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:14,660
This is an example of the gene comparing humans and chimpanzee, and you see that they are saying that mutation here in the gene,

237
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:23,810
this gene has immune functions, that there are changes in the amino acid sequences from chimpanzee to humans.

238
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:36,530
These later that represent amino acids. And you'll see that we have one, two, three, four changes of amino acids comparing chimpanzees and humans.

239
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:43,549
Then that means that this is a yes diff, that this protein can be under natural selection,

240
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:49,370
under positive natural selection, because we are changing that. We are observing changes in amino acids.

241
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:56,440
Now. In fact, there was this huge study done several years ago,

242
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:04,390
and they they analyzed thousand of genes in humans and chimpanzees that sequences of that gene.

243
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,630
And what they observe is there was a bias.

244
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:22,400
But you look here in that in the blue bars, there was a bias towards non synonymous mutations in the human lineage.

245
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:30,910
Meaning if we have a line here leading to chimpanzee, a line here leading to humans,

246
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:39,460
the line leading to human that is an excess of 19 mutations that are suggestive of a positive natural selection.

247
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:50,960
I'm more interesting by looking, that is when there was more ambiance or natural selection.

248
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,720
Most of things were related to immunity and defense.

249
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:02,450
I add that to the immune system. No.

250
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:10,340
They are more than 3000 here that you see here. That is still we don't know the exact point on the jeans, but at least for the jeans,

251
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:23,120
when we where we have evidence of natural selection comparing human chimpanzees, most of them were related to our immune system Western so far.

252
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:31,180
Oh, I have a question. Yeah, it's like 19, 19, but it's not.

253
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:37,400
It's a pretty little blue and red. This one. Yeah. The blue and red don't I think.

254
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,410
Yes. The red here means say non-implementation. These, these are silent mutation.

255
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:47,390
They don't change the amino acid sequence and the blue are the north in animals.

256
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:54,770
They changed the amino acid sequence. I know. So you're saying that the blue is higher than the red.

257
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,340
There is a sign of of positive natural selection.

258
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:07,790
Yeah, but it's not so much her. Yeah, but still you'll see here the number of genes, for example, we have here for this part, that part, everything.

259
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:15,499
Also from this bar we have an excess of blue bars that if that were done in this gene for every or at least in,

260
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:24,290
I would wish for every protein in the human genome, we have at least one or two non-Syrian additions compared to chimpanzees.

261
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:30,820
So only one or two in average. Yeah, these are average average in every other bars.

262
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:34,940
So before all that is less. Yeah, less.

263
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:47,900
Okay. In the second part, I think we are going to talk a little bit about the, uh, the different type of the immunity that we have.

264
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:56,300
Then I think I now want to introduce some other topics that we are going to discuss in the second part of the class.

265
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:08,270
Basically, we have two different types of immunity, what we call that being innate immunity that is fast usually takes hours.

266
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:16,430
Two are to a start when we get an infection, then usually during hours we have these response.

267
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:27,260
Most of them are what we call myeloid cells. And the other type is that the adaptive immunity that could take days.

268
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:39,020
One of the major factors are the antibodies. One of the features of adaptive immunity that has a memory because adaptive antibodies

269
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:45,560
or the type of cell like a T cells and that are the basis of the vaccinations,

270
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:54,290
we are exposed to an empty and and then we are our immune system's acquired memory against the pathogen.

271
00:33:54,290 --> 00:34:00,530
And then when we are exposed again to the pathogens, we are more able to fight it.

272
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:08,150
That that basically that that adaptive immunity has a memory but they more times to develop.

273
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,570
Now, from the evolutionary perspective,

274
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:32,240
if we go all the way to the very bases so that different animals even in organism mechanism that the jellyfish,

275
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,060
they have immunity, they have strong immune cells, innate immunity.

276
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:52,880
Now the adaptive immunity is seen that appears in vertebrates that is called the native toms vertebrates with yo,

277
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,479
we are this kind of vertebrates because they are other bacteria like lampreys that they have.

278
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:10,610
They don't have jobs. But you see that in all the animals that we know so far, they have some kind of immunity.

279
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,559
With an. I find this interesting.

280
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:31,270
Very interesting. You just saying that you did under in this chart and the figure in this figure and if you go to on top, it feels like shark.

281
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:39,550
Yeah. These are vertebrate hoovers. And for the one that's a little slightly below, they look like the vertebrae but doesn't have the jaw bones.

282
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,290
And that is only innate, innate immunity.

283
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:51,250
Yes, exactly. That the the adaptive community thing, they appear with vertebrate vertebrates.

284
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:56,630
But but the cat the little something else.

285
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:02,750
Yes. That doesn't have. Yeah. They don't they. Yes. They don't have and they don't have either.

286
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:07,720
Active immunity is in that they have functional cells that can have some kind of memory.

287
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:13,540
But the active community as we know is in the is particular to activate.

288
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,620
Okay. So that thing doesn't have vertebrae sorry.

289
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:21,810
That kind of as well.

290
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,540
It's yeah. No it's not that vertebrae. It doesn't have vertebrae.

291
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,560
It doesn't. Yeah, it doesn't. It doesn't.

292
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,730
Okay. I like it. Mm hmm.

293
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:42,970
Okay, now I get I want to get back to this point I did at the beginning of that class all the forces that are threats to our life.

294
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:47,230
Now, at the beginning of that class, we talk about starvation.

295
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:53,230
I saw one risk for die in that all that theory or that gene hypothesis.

296
00:36:53,980 --> 00:37:02,620
Then, however, from an evolutionary point of view, I've seen that there are other other more urgent threat to life.

297
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:15,100
For example, if starvation can kill us between two weeks, depending on the variation around that time.

298
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,810
Pathogens can kill between hours and days.

299
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:31,120
Toxin, for example, then kills between minutes. Hypothermia kills again within minutes.

300
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,480
Then that the reason why. Maybe we have our body mechanism to control our body temperature.

301
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:45,729
Uh, obscene deprivation of minutes. Um, then, from the evolutionary point of view, it's starvation.

302
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:54,220
Maybe weapon. The, the strongest selective factor is that that's a means that was an important.

303
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:10,149
But if in doubt use the ability to fight against infections is the strongest right now again and this is just data from historical

304
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:30,460
times the the pandemics so far and these are game based from historical records the black death in that in the 14th century in Europe.

305
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:44,590
I mean that the earliest pandemics that we know more than half of the human population die, the estimated at 200 millions of person die.

306
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,330
That human population at that time was estimated is estimated at 400 million.

307
00:38:51,190 --> 00:39:01,780
There was other plagues or pandemics. This was in that time to the Roman Empire is called the plague or Justinian Euphemia 40 million to death.

308
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,180
About 19% of the human population at that time is smallpox.

309
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,560
1500. 12% of the human population.

310
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:15,760
And that really plagues the Anthony plague. Again, disrupting that Roman Empire.

311
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:27,850
That is Spanish flu, early 20th century. And so far, Corbet, I put here, I took the field at that time, the number of dead was up to May 20, 20, 2021.

312
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:33,040
Mm hmm. But this is the most updated the data that we have up to two years ago, three years ago,

313
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:45,790
6.6 million deaths from going worldwide by the U.S. from in a comparative point of view that is strong,

314
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:52,600
that that did this pandemic have been the Black Death? Had you read this book?

315
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:58,320
These are Italian poet vocation.

316
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:09,940
He wrote he wrote a series of book. He lived around this time the Black Death and then people because they just go out of the cities.

317
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:15,130
Um, then people with that would that means they would they.

318
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:22,510
One, for example, to live in the countryside in there in the country houses are then.

319
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:33,610
But they were expecting that by the end of that time they said that you see that this is the end that women tend to die they usually they a body they

320
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:46,210
they need to do dancing also to tell his stories then book at this point wrote a favorite of books of luxury stories about the life of that time.

321
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:54,610
They tend they are comedies about some kind of dark comedy because people were dying was a very, very dark time.

322
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,340
A lot of tough times. Dark times. Dark times.

323
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:07,600
Yes. His book, None of That Die. The book is called Pop the Book.

324
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:11,770
The also read Percussion, percussion, percussion.

325
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:17,620
Yet b0ccaciooi have to wait until.

326
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:23,120
Can I ask that later. Yeah. Okay. You are interested.

327
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:39,220
We'll catch you on your annual parcel.

328
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:42,940
And the book is called Ah. I read that book.

329
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:51,090
He wrote several books of poems. Thank you.

330
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:54,940
Well. Sorry.

331
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:02,800
No, I think I also want to talk a little bit about the Black Death List, some of the genes involved.

332
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:08,020
There was a paper that was published just last month in Nature.

333
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:15,729
What they did, they they get some remains from London and from Denmark.

334
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:21,970
Some say that part in Denmark then they weren't able to to analyze that DNA with those bones.

335
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:26,200
They got sample from before the Black Death.

336
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:29,920
During the Black Death. After the Black Death.

337
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:41,590
You see, he had that population in London. You see how it was in these thousand to the 12th century was more or less the same size.

338
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:48,790
There was an increase of population. But during that time of the blacks there you see that huge decrease.

339
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:52,820
More than half of the London population die. Wow.

340
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,080
And then after that, it was more than a hundred years that population remained low.

341
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:05,020
And after that, in that renaissance and industrial revolution, we had that huge increase of population.

342
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:15,130
Now, Ben, then about what I want to show you here is that using DNA from these remains from before, during and after the Black Death,

343
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:23,320
they were able to identify several genes that show evidence of natural selection during the Black Death.

344
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:27,070
They were gene conferring resistance to the Black Death.

345
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,420
And you see here, okay, these are the names of the genes.

346
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:39,010
They seem that they are genes are involved in immune function. But you see how the infrequency changes over time.

347
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:46,299
Blue here are sample from Denmark and red are our sample from our London and

348
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,720
you'll see that they are similar in frequency that they increase over time,

349
00:43:51,610 --> 00:44:02,040
meaning that most likely they were genetic variants, conferring resistance against the black death and they are doubt they yeah.

350
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:11,440
So decrease rather locality frequency maybe there were their genes or are these that we're comparing sensitivity to black

351
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:18,370
death meaning that people with this pattern they were more likely to get infected or to get severe cases or to die.

352
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:26,230
Now I want to finalize my part. I wanted to to also to show you these results.

353
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:34,960
And this is a paper that would publish a few months ago. And let me tell you this analysis.

354
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:45,670
We try to 25 regions in the genomes that can be related to multiple conditions.

355
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:56,799
Then we were interested in type two diabetes, birth weight, body mass index, age 18 and old BMI.

356
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,810
And usually this would be in my eyes in average 30.

357
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:07,030
Also, we were interested in the waist circumference, waist to depression, adjusted for BMI.

358
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,819
Then there was a particular reunion,

359
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:18,640
chromosome 12 that we found that was a positive here means positive association and negative negative association.

360
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:27,520
Then genes on this region was associated with higher risk of type two diabetes, but lower back weight.

361
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,840
Then that means that person with this variation in these genes,

362
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:38,860
they are more likely to be born with a low birth weight and then to have higher risk

363
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:47,860
of type two diabetes later on life they tend to be to have lower body mass index.

364
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:57,880
However, they were more likely to have large waist to depression abdominal obesity.

365
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:02,020
Now I mention these because we are wont to discuss in the second part,

366
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:08,050
the hypothesis obviate priority some hypotheses that may be in the abdominal fat.

367
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:15,670
We have immune cells. Okay, we know that we have immune cells that are that could be one of the reasons,

368
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:23,440
but the importance of that I take me more and that now lead to rather chronic conditions.

369
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:29,350
And then I want to to finish my part with these tough days.

370
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:43,479
We wound up papers that there is evidence that innate immune cells can be trained by diet depending on the diet that we have, that training.

371
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:50,080
And by training, I mean the ability to fight infections. They affect that innate immune cells.

372
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,820
Then keep these in these. Maybe.

373
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:59,559
Here we are. See how analytic sample of evolutionary mishmash become.

374
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:09,250
Maybe these innate immune cells were selected or evolve under all the type of diet that now is totally different in Western societies.

375
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:18,160
They sampled high processed food, high sugar, or for lack of exercise.

376
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,459
This eating one with a paper that you were assigned for today.

377
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:35,170
Then you'll have entry that please are period is able is a very important paper how diet can also affect our ability of our in immune cells.

378
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:42,920
Okay. Then in the second part where I went to this call about these are vanity priorities and

379
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:49,100
hypotheses or that evolutionary aspect or the relationship between literature and immunity,

380
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:59,300
then I think we can take a five minute break. I have 1054.

381
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:09,369
Let's get back up to deliver some good. Q I had your presentation together.

382
00:48:15,568 --> 00:48:19,558
Okay everyone we are going to continue with the second part thing.

383
00:48:20,728 --> 00:48:28,258
Okay. Thank you. Um, so I'm presenting on evolutionary immunology as you have probably figured out.

384
00:48:29,308 --> 00:48:39,328
So again, an adaptive versus innate immunity for adaptive immunity, that's the antigens on the, on the outside of the pathogen.

385
00:48:39,328 --> 00:48:43,708
Mature proteins are lipids are targeted by antibodies.

386
00:48:44,098 --> 00:48:50,948
And when, when the antibody targets the antigen, it increases, uh,

387
00:48:51,748 --> 00:48:57,388
response from B and T cells which allow for the death and removal of these pathogens from the body.

388
00:48:58,618 --> 00:49:05,398
And this is a memory that your body has of this pathogen, and it's usually within your lifetime.

389
00:49:05,968 --> 00:49:10,858
So innate immunity is more long term.

390
00:49:11,128 --> 00:49:16,588
It's something that we've developed throughout our evolutionary history intergenerationally.

391
00:49:17,728 --> 00:49:19,257
It doesn't really have a good memory.

392
00:49:19,258 --> 00:49:31,048
It's just kind of this generalized like low specificity reaction that activates cytokines and generally causes inflammation.

393
00:49:31,528 --> 00:49:37,677
And it's also interesting because in innate immunity, it's a lot of different kinds of cells talking to each other.

394
00:49:37,678 --> 00:49:41,788
So it's it's less localized.

395
00:49:45,008 --> 00:49:48,218
So here I have some cells.

396
00:49:48,638 --> 00:49:52,278
These are innate immune cells.

397
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:56,298
So some of them you might recognize from like other parts of the body.

398
00:49:56,378 --> 00:50:00,308
So sometimes they're like multifaceted cells.

399
00:50:00,878 --> 00:50:05,828
And then these cells and t cells, they're like very specific to immune responses.

400
00:50:07,418 --> 00:50:08,888
It's kind of interesting.

401
00:50:11,288 --> 00:50:21,788
So classifications of different kinds of immunity within adaptive immunity, we have different ways of getting our adaptive immune response.

402
00:50:22,448 --> 00:50:25,628
You have natural or artificial. That's kind of self-explanatory.

403
00:50:26,558 --> 00:50:34,868
The active disease is a triggered response, response from the disease itself, and your body's creating the antibody.

404
00:50:35,558 --> 00:50:41,948
So that takes like two weeks because it takes a while for your body to get to know that the pathogens in your body and that it's harmful.

405
00:50:43,148 --> 00:50:46,898
But it's more long, long lasting because you're creating it yourself.

406
00:50:47,528 --> 00:50:53,228
A passive type is that you're literally just getting the antibody in your body.

407
00:50:53,648 --> 00:50:56,698
So this could come from like from a natural source.

408
00:50:56,708 --> 00:51:01,148
It would be like maternal. Your mother's giving it to you like through breast milk.

409
00:51:02,078 --> 00:51:10,328
And then like passive version of an artificial is you're actually getting the antibody in a blood and it's a given.

410
00:51:11,498 --> 00:51:23,948
And then from like an active viewpoint, you like a vaccine is an artificial way of getting creating antibodies and removing a pathogen

411
00:51:24,428 --> 00:51:29,678
and then a natural active is like actually getting the disease and getting rid of it.

412
00:51:32,988 --> 00:51:39,348
So we had an article that focused on an inmate with lymphoid cells.

413
00:51:41,058 --> 00:51:45,828
This is a specific kind of innate immune cell.

414
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:53,928
And you can see each one has its own activity, so it can get kind of complex.

415
00:51:55,038 --> 00:52:01,248
I want I want to make this a point. There are traditionally the immune cells.

416
00:52:01,248 --> 00:52:10,208
They were classified in two types myeloid igniting immunity and lymphoid acquired immunity by some new cycle.

417
00:52:10,218 --> 00:52:14,628
They discovered this new type of lymphoid cells that they provide innate immunity.

418
00:52:15,228 --> 00:52:24,408
They are very interesting time and they had this kind of immunity that they can you know,

419
00:52:26,048 --> 00:52:34,548
they the eye of the eye, these are found within the lining of the GI tract, the skin lines.

420
00:52:34,608 --> 00:52:42,917
And they they like they love to coordinate with all other cells and they even talk to the adaptive immunity.

421
00:52:42,918 --> 00:52:56,778
So they're very communicative and they secrete cytokines, restore and recover based on which type you have and what kind of response is triggered.

422
00:52:57,858 --> 00:53:08,898
They identify, remove pathogens. They can also possibly sense nutrient availability and then change the innate response depending

423
00:53:08,898 --> 00:53:16,728
on what kind of deficiencies you have or what kind of nutrients are in certain areas of the body.

424
00:53:18,348 --> 00:53:27,498
It maintains the mucous lining, which makes sense because it's helping to trigger all these immune responses.

425
00:53:28,068 --> 00:53:33,108
And the fighting method is kind of archaic.

426
00:53:33,258 --> 00:53:40,098
So it's like adhering, creating physical barriers, phagocytosis, which is like engulfing the cell.

427
00:53:40,488 --> 00:53:48,678
It's not this like super, you know, precise sniper type thing that's going on with the B cells.

428
00:53:51,188 --> 00:53:54,548
So what's the advantage of the IOC?

429
00:53:54,638 --> 00:53:58,538
Well, they can just it does tons of things.

430
00:53:59,228 --> 00:54:08,858
So they can just remove aliases or see low levels of IOC and then see how it relates to other diseases.

431
00:54:09,338 --> 00:54:13,958
So the three ones I want to focus on is that Helminth infection.

432
00:54:14,468 --> 00:54:23,428
They've noticed that if you remove the IL 25, you have decreased response to this type of infection.

433
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:32,798
The loss of an ILC or lowered amount could be related to IVs and skin infections that we see.

434
00:54:33,488 --> 00:54:42,908
And then they've noticed with a vitamin A deficiency that that also you might see a different type or increased ILC response.

435
00:54:45,038 --> 00:54:50,858
So I love pictures. So I put this picture in from the article.

436
00:54:53,038 --> 00:55:08,038
So just focusing on the vitamin A deficiency so you can see like the ILC are being inhibited by the vitamin A deficiency.

437
00:55:11,578 --> 00:55:16,668
And then it's up regulating this other ILC requirements.

438
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:26,718
So the end result is you're increasing the mucus, the mucus and the outside of the cell.

439
00:55:27,498 --> 00:55:33,227
So it's kind of like your body can sense your deficient in something and then it's increasing our

440
00:55:33,228 --> 00:55:38,808
response in order to possibly protect you because you're deficient in these certain vitamins.

441
00:55:39,048 --> 00:55:43,908
Mm hmm. In theory. Mm hmm. And then the.

442
00:55:46,358 --> 00:55:57,098
Yeah, I was there for that. And then the other type is, for example, this here is like a evil infection.

443
00:55:58,308 --> 00:56:06,217
So. So your body can kind of like sense via cells, the evil infection,

444
00:56:06,218 --> 00:56:11,978
and then it upregulates the innate immune response and the responses create more mucus.

445
00:56:12,158 --> 00:56:16,838
And so we don't uptake this disease by accident.

446
00:56:18,278 --> 00:56:27,458
Um, the third type, I don't know why, but it's showing on my laptop that it's not showing here the way adipose tissue.

447
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:35,348
So there should be a cloud itself. Um, and I think it's because it's the same color as a board.

448
00:56:35,378 --> 00:56:49,158
Mm hmm. Yeah, I think that. That. Yeah. Okay. Anyways, uh, they think that, like, an increased ILC response could prevent paging of tissues.

449
00:56:49,178 --> 00:57:01,848
So we've learned, and the nutritional pathophysiology of obesity, that brown adipose tissue seems to be a more metabolically healthy tissue.

450
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:06,878
So that might be something interesting to look more into.

451
00:57:07,078 --> 00:57:14,808
Yeah. Yeah, that that's about interpreting a hypothesis I think they made in the article because like

452
00:57:14,908 --> 00:57:22,658
the idea because of the helminth that the worm is competing with the host for nutrients,

453
00:57:23,318 --> 00:57:27,758
then these cells that actually do they identify deficiencies, lack of vitamin E,

454
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:34,298
but then consequently the white adipose tissue is transformed into brown adipose tissue.

455
00:57:34,388 --> 00:57:40,238
Mm hmm. But it's on how we can simulate a hair infection without that spectrum in the hypothesis

456
00:57:40,238 --> 00:57:43,658
that maybe they then they may be at that connection that they think they made.

457
00:57:43,658 --> 00:57:51,668
That even part of the war with how you eliminate infection using metabolic syndrome prevalence is low.

458
00:57:52,898 --> 00:58:06,238
Then it would be better understanding the metabolic pathway to try to simulate an infection without invasion and get more from adipose tissue there.

459
00:58:06,998 --> 00:58:20,018
Mm hmm. So then not only does it talk amongst itself, if, like, one cell is in one area, the innate immunity talks amongst different organs.

460
00:58:20,528 --> 00:58:26,588
So like the there's this axis of axis that they notice.

461
00:58:26,758 --> 00:58:30,788
So it's like a gut lymph along axis.

462
00:58:31,778 --> 00:58:36,998
So they'd notice, like if your guts disregulated that you'll have, for example,

463
00:58:36,998 --> 00:58:51,568
like increased mucus in your lungs or if your like files dysregulated or increased to a certain amount, you might start to see got problems and so on.

464
00:58:52,358 --> 00:59:03,398
So they a possible hypothesis that they mentioned was that it could be dependent on like your diet style type.

465
00:59:03,398 --> 00:59:07,118
So like if you're eating a high fat diet,

466
00:59:09,098 --> 00:59:17,258
you uptake the light chain fatty acids via cable mike around and that's a possible factor for like bacterial infection.

467
00:59:17,618 --> 00:59:24,038
So the idea is like your upper it possibly up regulating the innate immunity to help protect you through this pathway.

468
00:59:24,428 --> 00:59:30,568
Also, like things that are high in fat like me are more likely to have bacteria in it.

469
00:59:30,578 --> 00:59:41,408
So it could be a possible like protective factor in a way to like upregulate the innate immunity prevent this infection from coming in.

470
00:59:42,248 --> 00:59:50,888
Um, we also mentioned like insulin resistance does, may possibly be doing like a similar thing,

471
00:59:51,938 --> 00:59:58,538
but overall nowadays we're seeing like metabolic dysregulation from this.

472
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,958
So like the question is, is it protective now?

473
01:00:02,078 --> 01:00:08,108
I don't know. Yeah, that that's interesting that maybe our mother di the body,

474
01:00:09,218 --> 01:00:19,988
our organism is interpreted that diet as an infection that keeps the inflammatory immune disease thing just going on ongoing.

475
01:00:19,988 --> 01:00:23,738
On the family problems. Yes. Inflammation.

476
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:31,028
Yeah. They went into super detail about that, but I didn't understand everything, so.

477
01:00:31,538 --> 01:00:39,128
And I will try. I tried to see what I could in terms of, like, diet specific responses.

478
01:00:39,938 --> 01:00:47,918
So they found like, uh, like you were mentioned before that certain diets kind of like increase the innate immunity.

479
01:00:47,948 --> 01:00:50,978
So it's dependent on like these different kinds of factors.

480
01:00:50,978 --> 01:00:58,748
So you have like the localized localization in terms of like where you're up taking the fat, where it's going.

481
01:00:59,108 --> 01:01:07,448
So like it also matters like what kind of food you're eating and where it's uptake in within the digestive system.

482
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:12,248
So like, for example, like over here in the colon,

483
01:01:12,578 --> 01:01:19,838
you might be taking like certain kinds of nutrients versus like the alien, um, also like the time frame.

484
01:01:20,258 --> 01:01:27,038
Are you constantly snacking throughout the day or are you like eating everything in one timeframe, the amount of food.

485
01:01:27,038 --> 01:01:32,498
So the more, for example, fat you eat, the more bile you're going to excrete in response.

486
01:01:32,888 --> 01:01:39,367
So it also matters how much of the food you're eating and also, as mentioned before, the types of food.

487
01:01:39,368 --> 01:01:45,058
So they found that high fat, high carbs, more specifically like sugars, um,

488
01:01:45,638 --> 01:01:53,678
cause an increased inflammatory response and they see the response in like other parts of the body, like they've got brainwave axis.

489
01:01:54,308 --> 01:01:56,558
And then, like I mentioned before,

490
01:01:56,558 --> 01:02:04,478
short chain fatty acids go directly into circulation versus like a long chain fatty acid that has to be packaged into the keto microRNA,

491
01:02:04,478 --> 01:02:09,488
then taken into the body. And you can see them kind of hanging down here.

492
01:02:09,908 --> 01:02:14,558
They're like sensing that nutrients are coming and reacting.

493
01:02:15,638 --> 01:02:16,417
So yeah,

494
01:02:16,418 --> 01:02:27,248
we are we're multiple to conflicted about the microbiome and we're going to discuss also how the microbiome can be also mediating these responses.

495
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:33,637
And just side note, we know trans fatty acids are bad to us.

496
01:02:33,638 --> 01:02:39,787
It's been shown at like an observational level and they also salt like more inflammation when you

497
01:02:39,788 --> 01:02:46,177
eat trans fatty acid as well as fruit dose kind of has this odd pathway of getting into the body.

498
01:02:46,178 --> 01:02:50,168
So they also saw increased like any immune response to that.

499
01:02:51,788 --> 01:03:00,818
So what have we evolved to do? Not eat a high fat, high saturated fat, high saturated fat, high sugar diet?

500
01:03:01,238 --> 01:03:06,028
Because obviously we can see this kind of very increase in inflammation response.

501
01:03:07,998 --> 01:03:12,317
Not be constantly in an energy positive state. So if you're constantly eating,

502
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:18,617
your innate immunity is going to be constantly oppressed and mad at you and talking to all your

503
01:03:18,618 --> 01:03:26,598
other accesses in your body and causing the metabolic syndrome and then low activity levels.

504
01:03:28,308 --> 01:03:34,028
Yeah, that's just general. So could this be a mismatch like back in the day?

505
01:03:34,038 --> 01:03:38,538
Could this increase innate immune response that protected us from certain foods?

506
01:03:38,538 --> 01:03:45,438
Now be not as great now that we're have easy access to safe foods?

507
01:03:47,628 --> 01:03:59,207
So more about different kinds of fat. We have subcutaneous fat, which is more superficial on the outside, and then we have visceral fat.

508
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:07,908
And this kind of hangs out more specifically right in front of the abdomen, but more towards the bad.

509
01:04:09,288 --> 01:04:21,348
So subcutaneous fat is less active, meaning it sends out less cytokines and it's less connected to the innate immune response.

510
01:04:22,338 --> 01:04:25,608
I just wanted a side note of some benefits of fat.

511
01:04:25,608 --> 01:04:30,587
So it's insulating its stores, it's structural and it's padding.

512
01:04:30,588 --> 01:04:34,278
So there is a benefit to fat and it does help.

513
01:04:35,268 --> 01:04:41,418
It did help back in the day when we were starving, for example, that we have this extra insulation in storage.

514
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:47,568
And then there's this idea of being metabolically healthy, obese.

515
01:04:47,568 --> 01:04:54,348
It's it's when you have high levels of subcutaneous tissue but low levels of visceral tissue,

516
01:04:54,798 --> 01:05:03,618
thus there's like a decreased innate immune response because you have less of the visceral fat that's more active.

517
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:12,888
So you might look the same as somebody with a high visceral fat deposit, but you're less likely to get metabolic syndrome.

518
01:05:14,148 --> 01:05:20,808
So that was a mouthful. In general, you're more likely to have subcutaneous fat.

519
01:05:22,698 --> 01:05:33,948
Then the more OC you're the more likely you're more likely to have subcutaneous fat and visceral fat if you're gaining weight.

520
01:05:34,608 --> 01:05:38,058
So in general, they both increase together.

521
01:05:38,388 --> 01:05:52,008
However, due to genetics and different fetal outcomes, your visceral fat might deposit a little more than your subcutaneous fat.

522
01:05:54,848 --> 01:06:02,558
So this is kind of what I said before. I didn't mention the omentum.

523
01:06:03,158 --> 01:06:12,068
And that's like it's this piece of fat that's right in front of your guidelines and reproductive tissues if you're a woman.

524
01:06:14,408 --> 01:06:25,508
Also, a side note about that tissue. They found that it communicates with the brain to kind of give you a decreased sensitivity to insulin.

525
01:06:26,468 --> 01:06:37,837
And also you see this increased amount of macrophages, inflammatory cytokines and less anti inflammatory side cytokines within fat tissue.

526
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:47,228
Meaning that's what I mean by it's more metabolically active is the tissue is more

527
01:06:47,228 --> 01:06:54,428
likely to have a response due to how the fat is stored within the adipose tissue.

528
01:06:56,648 --> 01:07:00,698
So then of course it's linked to chronic disease.

529
01:07:05,078 --> 01:07:12,428
So further things that that tissue can affect your gut pare immobility,

530
01:07:13,508 --> 01:07:21,428
your homeostasis of your bile pool, how your nutrients are absorbed, how your microbiome is imbalanced.

531
01:07:22,278 --> 01:07:27,937
And so they've also noticed that our high ratio of bile,

532
01:07:27,938 --> 01:07:33,308
which we know is like dependent on what you're eating as well as your innate

533
01:07:33,308 --> 01:07:39,127
immune response in general is related to NASH Obesity and insulin resistance.

534
01:07:39,128 --> 01:07:50,288
So the end story is that when you have high levels of fat tissue, you're more likely to have immune based diseases,

535
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:59,078
fatty liver, and you're more likely to gain weight as well as have metabolic syndrome.

536
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:12,008
You gain weight because like when your God is disregulated and when when your innate immunity is inflamed,

537
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:17,798
your brain's more likely to have dysfunctional signaling in terms of appetite and satiety.

538
01:08:19,948 --> 01:08:31,678
And just to clarify that, also more factors that influence how money that deposits you're going to make.

539
01:08:32,848 --> 01:08:40,858
So like I mentioned before, the more volume of adipose tissue you have, the more bad and sad you're going to have on fetal exposure.

540
01:08:40,978 --> 01:08:47,248
They found that like under over nutritional nutrition during gestation could

541
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:52,198
cause certain pathways to stimulate that causes an increase of fat tissue.

542
01:08:53,248 --> 01:08:59,698
Certain, like environmental exposures, like certain chemicals might stimulate this pathway.

543
01:09:00,418 --> 01:09:02,608
Genetics. I'll talk more about that later.

544
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:14,548
So like if you have an immune disease or you already have a chronic disease, you're more likely to see increase activity in the bat tissues.

545
01:09:15,808 --> 01:09:20,488
It's obviously important because during malnutrition it's the last thing to go.

546
01:09:20,488 --> 01:09:25,708
So there must be something important about that tissue in our evolutionary history.

547
01:09:26,618 --> 01:09:31,678
Yeah. I was going to ask you, what do you think of that? Why is that at all?

548
01:09:32,038 --> 01:09:36,428
Why do you have a preference? A preference? I'll explain it here.

549
01:09:36,468 --> 01:09:40,988
All right. So, yeah, sorry. There's a lot of lead out to get here.

550
01:09:42,118 --> 01:09:52,257
But the evolutionary paradox is the idea that that tissue back in the day might have been an advantage, especially with,

551
01:09:52,258 --> 01:10:02,188
like all the diseases and stuff we were eating in meat in terms of like parasites and things they found,

552
01:10:02,188 --> 01:10:06,328
especially like a link between TB, malaria, high TB,

553
01:10:06,328 --> 01:10:15,718
high malaria areas and certain demographics of people that have an increased predatory prioritization for fat tissue.

554
01:10:17,788 --> 01:10:21,088
So thank you.

555
01:10:24,608 --> 01:10:33,158
So they see in certain populations this higher increase of fat tissue in order to create an

556
01:10:33,368 --> 01:10:40,368
increased immune response to help remove these diseases that could cause death within the area.

557
01:10:40,388 --> 01:10:50,288
Because as we saw before in in the presentation, diseases that kill you right away are kind of like prioritized evolutionarily.

558
01:10:51,938 --> 01:10:56,708
So now we have like drugs, medications, high food intake.

559
01:10:56,978 --> 01:11:04,538
Our food is safe. So the that the that innate immune response might not be helping us much.

560
01:11:05,708 --> 01:11:13,898
So it's kind of this mismatch where we are actually causing decreased reproductive capabilities,

561
01:11:13,898 --> 01:11:23,618
increased mortality and decreased metabolic health just because we have so much of this fat tissue and no benefit from it anymore.

562
01:11:25,828 --> 01:11:34,468
So yeah, just keep in mind also that because this is a common theme in several of the topics that we have discussed,

563
01:11:34,888 --> 01:11:43,587
that it means much the many other systems that we have or an attitude that we have to respond to acute problems,

564
01:11:43,588 --> 01:11:49,858
for example, let's say starvation and during that period of time of infection, during that short period of time.

565
01:11:50,368 --> 01:11:59,848
But now we've had this chronic, chronic stimulation of these type of adaptations and the reality that each of them has an immune function.

566
01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:05,248
Maybe just keep you've been responding to these and now these pro-inflammatory values.

567
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:11,518
I think this graph really shows that I took it directly on paper, just like.

568
01:12:13,868 --> 01:12:19,198
There's like a point where it just switches over, like, this is no longer a benefit.

569
01:12:22,508 --> 01:12:33,488
Um, okay. So then in terms of like why would certain what kind of certain populations or the theory behind why we would prioritize that.

570
01:12:34,028 --> 01:12:51,968
So firstly, we know that like low fetal nutrition or can cause like an increased priority prioritization for that, which makes sense because like if,

571
01:12:52,328 --> 01:13:00,918
if you were in the womb and you have less resources, you want to come into the world with an advantage like increased in meat,

572
01:13:01,058 --> 01:13:09,128
innate immunity, the ability to, uh, to recover from diseases.

573
01:13:10,058 --> 01:13:21,068
Um, and then we also see like certain geographic and demographic, uh, peoples have an increased bat prioritization.

574
01:13:21,428 --> 01:13:28,598
And so they were theorizing why there would be an increased risk within these geographic locations.

575
01:13:29,558 --> 01:13:35,437
And they kind of hypothesize maybe it's a impoverished region.

576
01:13:35,438 --> 01:13:41,678
So they need this, that prioritization more in order to fight off diseases.

577
01:13:42,218 --> 01:13:45,547
Um, they mentioned like the stratification of society.

578
01:13:45,548 --> 01:13:57,308
So maybe the, the peasants back in the day were more likely to that prioritized because they're being exposed to more different types of pathogens and

579
01:13:57,308 --> 01:14:06,038
they need that extra additional immune innate immune response to survive and it might have been increased their fitness at the time.

580
01:14:06,968 --> 01:14:14,318
There's also a theory that extreme conditions such as like very hot, very cold areas,

581
01:14:14,318 --> 01:14:25,208
they might have higher levels of malnutrition or famine and that prioritization might have given them an advantage.

582
01:14:25,748 --> 01:14:28,807
Another theory is I mentioned TB, malaria,

583
01:14:28,808 --> 01:14:35,377
some of these diseases they might have caused increased that prioritization because we want the increased

584
01:14:35,378 --> 01:14:41,378
innate immune response in order to cause increased fitness within the population back in the day.

585
01:14:42,818 --> 01:14:46,388
So that of course, again, the world changes and we have the mismatch.

586
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:54,128
So. So I don't know what time it is.

587
01:14:54,718 --> 01:14:58,118
Um, you learned 26. Oh, sorry.

588
01:14:59,858 --> 01:15:10,308
Okay. Um, so I have a couple of discussion questions, but I'll go here first because he mentioned the black during his presentation.

589
01:15:10,328 --> 01:15:15,248
So I found an article on BBC and it was actually talking about that they found a possible

590
01:15:15,248 --> 01:15:23,368
link to IBS and Crohn's disease and the Black Death that happened 700 years ago.

591
01:15:23,588 --> 01:15:27,098
So it's kind of like even recently, they're still finding stuff.

592
01:15:27,128 --> 01:15:30,578
Yeah, that, that's. Ah, yeah. This is about the paper they mentioned before.

593
01:15:30,658 --> 01:15:34,748
Yeah. That thing that they found protective against Black Death.

594
01:15:35,408 --> 01:15:42,128
But now they could be related to immune diseases. Um, then again, it's a trade off.

595
01:15:42,698 --> 01:15:52,058
Yeah. At the moment, the selective force against black that was strong was any person that these resistant genes, they have a huge advantage.

596
01:15:52,418 --> 01:16:00,428
Mm hmm. Okay. If anybody wants to discuss or has questions for me to comment.

597
01:16:03,078 --> 01:16:11,118
Now please make make sure that you understand the VAT returns in hypothesis what that means.

598
01:16:11,898 --> 01:16:20,388
Why under the hypothesis, not the rest of the job will favor visceral fat over the type of fat.

599
01:16:23,588 --> 01:16:33,608
And I think the second question is also that the discussion about Helminth and this new type of security,

600
01:16:34,568 --> 01:16:41,048
please make sure that you understand you have. Then you can read that this paper or you intend you want to come on to make that point,

601
01:16:41,098 --> 01:16:56,168
since you see that in combat it has been mentioned that like Feedly, like it makes sense and like comes along comes from the same places that died.

602
01:16:56,198 --> 01:17:06,518
So it might just be like coincidental. It might not be an evolutionary benefit per se to have like that kind of response.

603
01:17:07,538 --> 01:17:12,928
I don't know. That's just like a possible downfall to the theory.

604
01:17:14,818 --> 01:17:18,118
Yeah. That I could think of. Yeah.

605
01:17:18,878 --> 01:17:27,588
Think about because this I can see sales the idea of divide these differences and the example.

606
01:17:27,728 --> 01:17:41,198
Right. I mean they are in the movies getting how how can we use that for some kind of therapies or like this?

607
01:17:41,598 --> 01:17:45,518
Uh, I, I work, and I work on that.

608
01:17:45,818 --> 01:17:51,517
How can we use those seeing that from the sales to try to, ah, this or that relationship with a paramedic?

609
01:17:51,518 --> 01:18:00,757
What did you do? How can we use that to try to prioritize road major problem.

610
01:18:00,758 --> 01:18:07,138
How deep was teacher, for example? I mean, how often do you get a helmet infection?

611
01:18:07,478 --> 01:18:11,228
Yeah, no, never heard of it before. It was pretty cool.

612
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:17,298
So yeah, right now I you know that my to tell you when I was a kid because that was common.

613
01:18:18,368 --> 01:18:21,418
Maybe any minute you might be elementary school. Yeah.

614
01:18:21,458 --> 01:18:25,958
They agreement where they went with these huge program.

615
01:18:25,968 --> 01:18:30,668
They, they remember people going to the school to give these little babies to help me them.

616
01:18:31,988 --> 01:18:32,587
But, you know,

617
01:18:32,588 --> 01:18:45,098
I don't know how common I think this professor for any for call they we practice was really our protocol for called it four days emergency protocol

618
01:18:45,098 --> 01:18:56,948
and one most important thing is animal based but to me 10,000 a year and then we go we go to a high quality only for four days that's crucial.

619
01:18:58,058 --> 01:19:05,168
And to and also in Chinese medicine this region we do a lot of therapy in this region,

620
01:19:05,648 --> 01:19:15,488
big or small and I mean fair enough it but we do a because a lot of energy channels right here and that's why the umbilical

621
01:19:15,488 --> 01:19:23,587
cords and the back to it to that the source of the the energy coming from the bag in the front is very interesting.

622
01:19:23,588 --> 01:19:30,118
So I do a lot of therapy right here and infrared therapy shines right on it for people.

623
01:19:30,118 --> 01:19:36,248
I the problem with digestion we in our medicine, there's no porn, there's no auto immune system disorder.

624
01:19:36,248 --> 01:19:41,288
We're able to fix those just by the frequency therapy in the above the goods.

625
01:19:41,918 --> 01:19:45,518
And and the other question comments.

626
01:19:46,058 --> 01:19:49,688
Mitt Romney. I can't think of anything.

627
01:19:49,928 --> 01:19:52,478
Okay, then then you have to summarize, please.

628
01:19:52,478 --> 01:20:00,428
I make sure that you understand our vet priorities and hypotheses and that it would resolve the advantages of deficit and fat.

629
01:20:00,788 --> 01:20:08,548
And now now that for now, in other times how that will be rather that this much enthusiasm.

630
01:20:09,608 --> 01:20:15,818
Thank you, Mary. Thank you. Okay they are next week.

631
01:20:16,568 --> 01:20:25,948
I feel we have demonstrated the cut in the.

632
01:20:32,348 --> 01:20:35,828
Next week is November seven.

633
01:20:36,908 --> 01:20:42,758
Okay. Next week we have I think Alison will talk about developmental plasticity.

634
01:20:42,918 --> 01:20:46,728
This is a very interesting topic because it related with allergies,

635
01:20:46,748 --> 01:20:56,378
with the with reproduction, how how our life history changes over time, over evolution.

636
01:20:57,248 --> 01:21:00,548
Then please read the papers and be ready to discuss.

637
01:21:00,998 --> 01:21:04,178
And then I will post homework later today.

638
01:21:04,208 --> 01:21:11,258
Also I will both down great from last homework. If you don't have more questions then I will see you next Monday.

639
01:21:13,508 --> 01:21:17,378
But I'll see you later on in the afternoon.
