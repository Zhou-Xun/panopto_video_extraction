1
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:10,660
Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you had a great weekend before we start.

2
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:17,400
Thank you. For those of you that completed our watches for the meeting with that student.

3
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,130
Now. The.

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,660
Available Tuesday next week at one P.

5
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:38,350
And for those of you that completed the the form is next Tuesday will be a good time.

6
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:50,170
I mean, I was I was telling the group down the Mississippi within the second year that they.

7
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,730
The label after midnight Tuesday. Next, U.S. and Puerto Rico.

8
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,430
What? And that worked for you by some.

9
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:13,410
How do you prefer? By sumo in person. I think you person or so I think I'll let you in person.

10
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,150
Okay. Then I will part with the message too. And then to.

11
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,030
But it's an important conversation, I would say.

12
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,410
And around the the U.N., I was named to the powerful group.

13
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,150
Even for those of you that don't complete that being completely formed, you're more than welcome to join us.

14
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,630
Okay. Thank you very much. Okay.

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,290
Also, today is going to be.

16
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:53,730
Oh, I'm planning to you have to take half an hour today, because I went to meet with some elementary students to discuss also.

17
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,540
So ideas about your project. Damn thing.

18
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:04,980
Let's take right now. Is high. About half an hour to discuss about the other video.

19
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:14,310
And after that I want to discuss with the students your projects and end up USD yesterday in our freedom to define.

20
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,020
But. Okay.

21
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,780
Okay. I. Do you watch TV?

22
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,860
Yeah. Okay. I always use this as a light at the beginning.

23
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,620
You have to. I've seen this.

24
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:44,440
The idea that these are the videos and also I would say the idea of these flowers and besides learning how to do research is how to.

25
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:54,840
It was like a how to do it at your local Indian and bless you.

26
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:12,120
How we try to do to find do balance between and our strategic planning to get over this your research your thesis how we like to be productive to

27
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:21,570
have this explosive productivity try to find the work life balance and of course having healthy relation when your colleagues you are your people.

28
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,860
Okay. General question, what do you think of the video? Do you plan to use your phone or.

29
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,379
That at any new tips, any new fields?

30
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:56,570
How to plan your week work. But I didn't think about putting all of my personal tasks that I want to do a little bit better,

31
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:04,920
because I think this would be better for this sector, more of my time and for me, I just have my classes and my meetings.

32
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,870
I think it would be. Personal stuff, example going out with friends.

33
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,240
So I know that actually not work now. Mhm. Or going shopping.

34
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,180
Yeah. So I think that's how we can structure our time more.

35
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,100
Exactly. You belong that time and that time is sacred.

36
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,200
Yes, I do not. When I started teaching this class.

37
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:43,360
I think you said what I find in is usually, i.e., I was taking a long time to have meetings.

38
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,590
Then we have this hour between noon and 1 p.m. to have a meeting.

39
00:04:50,950 --> 00:05:03,459
But then after watching this particular. If not this time, I implore myself, then at least there is a berry arguing either something life or death.

40
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,530
But don't expect for me to to meet with you at lunch.

41
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:15,340
The things I have long walk to grace for that.

42
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:27,550
They know. How many of you what kind of that you used for your time doing that?

43
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,840
Yes, I know. I prefer not to use Google.

44
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,100
What? Uh, security.

45
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,070
Mm hmm. Well. The.

46
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,700
I do it by hand again? Yeah. Yeah, I have.

47
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,830
Bless her for putting it all on one page. That would make my ADHD go crazy.

48
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:59,300
Some pages that are. Stuff, my school stuff, my personal stuff I need to get done for the week so I can just.

49
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,799
But guess where my blocks are?

50
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,650
And so this is like a homework block.

51
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:13,080
And I will look at that sheet and see, okay, what's coming up every Thursday I go through all the homework for me.

52
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,320
So I have a list of everything that's due up on this Sunday and I'll start going through it.

53
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,300
Full time or the household list. What errands need to get done? The bills need to get done.

54
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,570
But it was separate. But there. Okay.

55
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,310
Great. Yeah, I'll work on for the week.

56
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,340
Okay. I think that delivers both like a Google calendar for all the stuff I'm doing.

57
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,770
But then I was like, okay, I know that I have something for my ideas and something else for.

58
00:06:50,820 --> 00:07:04,370
They're going to do a Google calendar. Very cute.

59
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:11,570
I carry that with me. So if it's an assignment, as mentioned, I write it down to the appropriate date and that.

60
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:25,650
It would like to see you to the to do list because I still trying to I'm trying to get myself organized still.

61
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,989
I was thinking more of the larger task around the Google calendar like classes for certain,

62
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,170
but the minuscule things like the small little task that I can check off.

63
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,890
I'm like a satisfaction person, and more and more, I feel like I'm a probably.

64
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,680
Mm hmm. So that's in the planner. And I just go, Yup. But it was good.

65
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:52,230
And then. Yeah.

66
00:07:52,450 --> 00:08:00,220
That's a nice, that's a nice feature that you can, um, how do you do your homework or.

67
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,280
Lastly, I say, for example today by being you went to the.

68
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:20,729
Well my for this week you just see how intense the classes and then I prioritize which is going to take the most time for me to do all of the work.

69
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,960
So like my nutrition, 630 is more demanding compared.

70
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:37,790
At the same time, I don't have to take so seriously because I know other students will listen and contribute to me.

71
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:45,290
Whereas in security, I actually have to know the material to even remotely know what's going on in class.

72
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:52,780
So time variance followed up, taking six semester all in the.

73
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:04,310
Okay, fine. What do you know about the fourth? Yes.

74
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,630
And again, as I told you, our previous lecture tried to do what is best for you.

75
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,690
And in the end, I tried to apply the lens of buy some of these strategies.

76
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:24,200
Now I used my Google calendar before, I guess useful for just a piece of paper.

77
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,790
So when I was down the middle of the year, the media day by day problem was done.

78
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:34,790
The game is played in a paper shape, then get that right to do what is what is best for you.

79
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:43,910
Now I may get my takes and I will if I want to read this one, try to find your life of study work balance.

80
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,400
I always make this point because I think if I.

81
00:09:50,670 --> 00:10:00,170
I don't know if I told you before, but when I came here to the United States to do my doctoral studies, I had to the time.

82
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,910
I useful? Really? Yes. And I have a baby girl.

83
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,920
Just two of them.

84
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,460
I will be 20 years ago. 21.

85
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,299
No, you're now. My, my, my daughter's.

86
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,170
You some seen in a winning state university. I might.

87
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,520
Oh, yeah. Then for me, it was important to find this violence because it was very stressful.

88
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,900
I try to dedicate time to my wife, to my kids.

89
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,870
If we don't do that, we wouldn't try to find it. I'm going.

90
00:10:50,110 --> 00:11:07,400
A full length. I. How regarding the calendar or your timing, remember that also even for our academic war, they are tasks that maybe they can wait.

91
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,540
Maybe. Maybe they are not important. They're important.

92
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,040
But we need to do maybe the scale. Okay. What need to be done this week?

93
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:22,550
What need to be done this day? Or what can take more time to do this work?

94
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,890
Then try to produce besides avoid procrastination.

95
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,560
That's it. They. To them. Now.

96
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,650
Always. I found also these.

97
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,060
These are VI's very useful for me.

98
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,520
Try to find a day. I did Friday afternoon.

99
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:56,790
After all your classes or Sunday night before the start of the week to plan your week.

100
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,010
And in that or at least we'll have an idea what is going to happen that week.

101
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:10,060
And remember that not everything is equally important. They are from tasks that they can wait.

102
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:19,040
Ask for help. You got any study group with the OR will you be an informative study?

103
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,440
You don't understand phones. You can ask. You can go to office hours.

104
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:36,940
Try not to do everything for yourself. Think she had a really helpful method by prioritizing things.

105
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,300
Can you decline it? Delete it, delay it. Delegated.

106
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:52,889
What about? It's a declining one, right? There is a nice video in this series of is not in that list that we're going to watch that is,

107
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:58,650
quote, learning to say no, you you're more than welcome to watch it.

108
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,250
Yeah. It does get easier. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

109
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:12,320
You get. As it turns out. Yeah. Well, I remember one of our first discussion in wound,

110
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:22,240
our first class was to that we we tend to underestimate how much time is going to take a task on time to say,

111
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,830
I'm writing this abstract for this scientific meeting. The these are struggling to write it in this afternoon,

112
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:35,270
but usually more than that then they learn to say no because it is easier just to get bcbc easy.

113
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:44,940
And then you have no way to have. But. And do some planning.

114
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,030
Remember, we are doing this planning.

115
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,420
We're going to get a lot more time for ourselves, for the world.

116
00:13:51,450 --> 00:14:01,290
It's important. Your life also is your use whether you are going to be able to do more when you are.

117
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:13,580
Is there any plan B? Realistically, your time and idea is that you are going to do more and you are going to reduce your.

118
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:30,020
That comment. For me.

119
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:50,200
I tried to, like, give a. After I finish, I just like.

120
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,270
Mm hmm. Yeah. Mm hmm.

121
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:07,970
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

122
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:18,600
I feel like. And like.

123
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,960
Just. Yeah.

124
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:32,790
Yeah. I have a. You know, doesn't exactly do what you feel is working for you, but it does.

125
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:44,120
Yes. We have different ways to try to organize a time. Is I still trying?

126
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,790
And again, as I told you before, I'm trying to get a little more organized.

127
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:57,560
But yes, you will be wonderful. You. Michael, enjoy your time here.

128
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:02,090
You do that when you get it. Nice to them. I think these are important.

129
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,450
And we know what life is here.

130
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:17,399
Is that, again, you are going to find your knowledge, you're going to be able to answer from Western Europe by June.

131
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,790
It's about then. Thank you. Thank you.

132
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:27,500
Even with all these reasons. Any questions?

133
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:35,249
Comments. I don't know.

134
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:40,230
What's that? I just read plans right after I read the.

135
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:56,219
I've have actually done the work and. You made you feel really good.

136
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:01,490
This is the plan. But then you go take out. Don't do something like the end.

137
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,180
You start to delay the first two days and then you start to fall apart.

138
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:16,070
But I still get anything done. But you just I. And after I, I said, you know, but this is important.

139
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:24,630
I mean, that that that feeling was active. With.

140
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:34,139
I like that you don't do it or not. But I don't know where to start.

141
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,410
Not to stop working. Yeah. Do you?

142
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:48,270
The. But the instant gratification make me feel acutely felt.

143
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:55,950
Chill out in the pool somewhere. And so the first two days after the plan, sell is not.

144
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:09,709
I notice I always have to delay. I don't plan that two days.

145
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:14,540
I just care the most is done in two days. Not working for you.

146
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,600
Not that dah dah.

147
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:26,930
Now that you mention this immediate certificate after the fact, I don't know if happens to you even when you have to write and you say paper.

148
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,760
We are this party to the start is not.

149
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,360
Then I start thinking the phrase it as synthesis on my head.

150
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:54,010
I. Then at one time I'm thinking in Spanish on First Lady in English then.

151
00:18:54,130 --> 00:19:00,300
But but then when? When I write a few sentences, I feel that's affection.

152
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:04,180
But. But then I run by reasonable thing.

153
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,360
Okay. I love. It.

154
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:15,420
That's a B, starting with the simplest task you have when you see that you accomplished one of the tasks used to be.

155
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:25,020
I have motivation to just finish one. And if you look, I finished one, I can do the second one and the third one.

156
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,140
So this is my second debate. So I'd actually run opposite.

157
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:35,280
I've heard that if you complete your hardest task first, then doing everything later is just so easy.

158
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:46,840
But if I want to make sure it's. That's what I want to keep on progressing to maintain you know it's best

159
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:52,250
everyone like I like to when I'm focused I like to start with the hardest one.

160
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:57,459
I have the focus, for example, of the morning before sleeping.

161
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:06,400
That's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We have a lecture about how to make our routine for for writing against on tips.

162
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:14,229
What I found useful for me. Everything to do with the writing entities that we do to find what works best for you.

163
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:19,629
But I found that I have found the early mornings, late afternoon.

164
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:30,100
I just I kind of feel that in late afternoon what I'm doing and the more they said repetitive work that they find going on fast code.

165
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:38,080
So finally today you run the code. Questions.

166
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:51,450
Okay. Again. Find what WATERFORD You know, and this is important because, ah, it's difficult for us to be accountable for ourselves.

167
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:57,270
Well then ah, try to find some accountability mechanisms I did with friends, colleagues,

168
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:07,850
family like the you can try to have what they call the rating bodies with the.

169
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,709
And if any one is right in the war.

170
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,890
But they are together. And again, don't forget.

171
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:22,330
You don't forget. It is a table here. But.

172
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,920
Nearly hours. Time for yourself. And during that weekend.

173
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,370
Again. Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that you don't need to do any work.

174
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:46,940
Any questions? Finally start laughing and.

175
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:57,420
Show. But now also these things are relaxed in the word victory.

176
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:06,849
There. Yeah. Okay then homework for next class, then for next Monday.

177
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,770
We don't have any video to watch before,

178
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:17,230
but I'm going to post on readings that will be about human subject protections if you are willing to work with humans either.

179
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:27,489
Then they are sewn up. Some training that you will need to do.

180
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:36,070
You don't so you don't need to do it because at least some see you are working data analysis so that data isn't really anonymized.

181
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:44,920
Then if we then went to this, that then for next Monday, please read this before class and we will discuss it.

182
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:53,680
Anyone here is planning to work with and they might.

183
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:03,580
Okay. Yeah, because also I think that our second semester that we did is a lecture about animal.

184
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:13,310
Okay. Then message to him. Please stay here.

185
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,600
I want to just do this a little thing with that individually.

186
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,340
Okay. You have already four masters to students.

187
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,000
You have already? I think you already have a mentor.

188
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:35,069
Then feel free to leave. Thank you. You're welcome. Are Nicole?

189
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,220
At first I'm going to stay with you because I have some ideas.

190
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,720
Okay. Let me just of.
