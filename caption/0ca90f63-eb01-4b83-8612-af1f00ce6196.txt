1
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:29,709
All right. Good morning, everyone. So today we're going to talk about the exposure limits and some of the different agencies,

2
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:35,680
specifically regulatory agencies that play a role in setting standards and regulating

3
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,230
exposure to different hazards within kind of community or more public settings.

4
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:47,889
So specifically outside of the work place, next class period, next week.

5
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:53,890
On Tuesday, Professor Neitzel is going to join us again to talk about from the flip side of that,

6
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:00,310
within the occupational setting, specifically talk about some of the regulatory agencies,

7
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:10,150
some of the key standards and regulations that are in place to help promote worker safety and reduce exposures within occupational settings.

8
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:20,050
Before we jump into today's topic, I will use this as a place to kind of reengage talking about the exam, right.

9
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:31,950
So our team is scheduled for a week from today and important clarification that probably somebody would ask, but I'm mindful of it at the moment.

10
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,290
So I would point this out, having just talked about our next two class periods today.

11
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:47,800
Okay. This is where the material for the exam will end is right up to the topic of Tuesday, the class period on October 4th.

12
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:54,250
So in terms of what to study for, what to review, what to be ready to answer questions about,

13
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:05,470
you be through the class period on October 4th, talking about occupational exposure, regulations and standards and so forth.

14
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:13,640
So going back to the exam and apologies if I repeat myself a little bit, I think with this redundancy doesn't doesn't hurt.

15
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,770
Our exam is next Thursday during our regular class time.

16
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:27,290
We'll do it right here in the classroom. It'll be old school in the sense that I will hand out hard copies of the exam.

17
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:36,170
We can start right at 830. It's the exam is written for maybe like a 60 minute time period.

18
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,640
You still have the full 80 minutes of class period to complete the exam.

19
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:46,820
So in my experience in the past, for this type of an exam like time,

20
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,170
pressure is not an issue, but generally speaking, have plenty of time to complete it.

21
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:59,270
Like I said last time, some of you will complete it well in advance of 60 Minutes, maybe, you know, 40 or 45 minutes.

22
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:05,960
That's totally fine. Make sure you know your name is on it and at the end of it, on your way out.

23
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:12,320
And the only thing I would ask is that you just try to as you tidy up yourself and excuse yourself in the classroom,

24
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:18,380
try to do so as quietly as possible just because others will be continuing to work around you.

25
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:29,480
I mentioned when you when you do come into the classroom, we are blessed with lots of space in this room relative to the course enrollment.

26
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:39,800
So don't don't sit next to other classmates, leave at least a seat in between to kind of spread out a little bit for the purposes of the exam itself.

27
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:52,200
I think those were the logistics that we mostly covered last time period and where we left off and

28
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,800
then where I said we would read start today's period talking about other aspects of the exam.

29
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:06,270
So some common questions include What should I be studying?

30
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,870
What should I be reviewing? What am I really responsible for?

31
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,950
I mean, technically you're responsible for everything I think includes the reading, but that's a common question.

32
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,090
Do we you know, you don't need to focus on the readings.

33
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:29,670
I will tell you that the the focus of the exam is material that we've covered in class.

34
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:39,180
Right. It's been presented that we've discussed all of the things around how do we classify exposures, right?

35
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:47,640
All of the different classification schemes of chemical exposures, the different schemes of physical exposures,

36
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:54,299
customizable came in and talked about sources of ionizing radiation versus non-ionizing radiation.

37
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:02,550
Right. And the differences between those and how they can potentially affect our health, where we're likely to be exposed or not.

38
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:14,110
Chronic is acute types of exposures are what else types of effects, right?

39
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:20,880
Are they stochastic effects? Are there thresholds that have been identified?

40
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:30,570
Lots of different aspects, biological exposures as well. Right. We've talked through all of the different types of biological exposures.

41
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:37,860
And again, for all of these classifications, we're concerned both within kind of a community setting as well as a workplace setting and both,

42
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:45,210
you know, where are there similarities between the two and where there are very distinct and important differences between those two settings.

43
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:52,440
Part of those similarities and differences come into play when we look at the exposure pathways.

44
00:05:52,770 --> 00:06:03,120
Right? So just because something is present, you know, what's the environmental pathway that that hazard takes before it has an opportunity for?

45
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:10,050
We have an opportunity to come into contact with it, right. So that exposure can actually take place once that's occurred.

46
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,599
What are the levels of exposure you might be concerned about for these different hazards?

47
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,730
Right. In a through inhalation? Is it through contact with and through ingestion?

48
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:32,480
So we we've looked several times at that kind of exposure to outcomes in a very brief schematic model that might be a good place to study,

49
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:40,290
kind of start at the beginning, make sure you understand the concepts of source and intensity of magnitude,

50
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,610
what are concentrations that might exist and all of that.

51
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:52,590
Those hazards through different exposure pathways, both within environmental community settings as well as an occupational.

52
00:06:54,210 --> 00:07:01,370
How then does someone become exposed once they come into contact with it right through those rounds of exposure, then, you know,

53
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:12,990
a dose is received and we kind of quantify that dose and that leads to some sort of outcome, whether it be a symptom disease and so forth.

54
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:21,530
Yeah. So some of the readings involved like the exposure value is like like those exposure limit is this.

55
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,629
Should we know those? Good question.

56
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,700
Yes. So and that was something I wanted to clarify.

57
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:35,520
So when I say you're responsible for the readings, the readings are intended to allow you to go into much more depth within 80 minutes on a topic.

58
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,059
I can only cover so much and I'm trying to cover quite a bit.

59
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:48,389
You know, in terms of the brand, a lot of the readings offer not just more depth but more opportunities for application of the concepts.

60
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:52,650
Read a lot of examples and some cases, even some problems.

61
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:59,400
You know how to work through. Something that said, I am not writing a question on the exam.

62
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:06,240
Is expecting you to just randomly recall write some number or some setting.

63
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,860
It was listed in chapter three on page, you know, 24 down at the very bottom.

64
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:18,660
That's that's not my intention. So in that sense, you kind of re reinforce that, you know, what?

65
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,280
What you should know well are things that we've covered in class and that we've discussed in class.

66
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:31,500
But that's the focus of how I prepared the exam, and that should be the focus of how you should kind of prepare for the exam.

67
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,179
I'll repeat just for that and also for the recording.

68
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,870
I know there's at least a couple people that weren't here today.

69
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:57,800
There was a question last time about calculators. So there will be a little bit of math involved, but you're all really good at that kind of stuff.

70
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,250
So for most of you, it's just going to be mental math or doing simple scratch math on a sheet of paper.

71
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:09,380
You if you feel like you would benefit from having a calculator, you're welcome to bring one.

72
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:23,230
That's also an important point to clarify. The exam is closed, book, close notes, etc.

73
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:29,030
Right. So when you come to class, really the only thing you need is something to write with.

74
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:39,260
And if you prefer a calculator so it won't be an opportunity to have your devices open or access any other content during the exam.

75
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:51,080
I'm sure there will be other questions that will spark my memory of what I should have told you about the exam.

76
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,520
But let's go ahead and open it up.

77
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:59,090
What are what are other questions that people have, whether it's about just, you know, generally what to prepare for,

78
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:06,320
what to expect or logistics of the exam or specific topics or concepts that we've discussed.

79
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:15,950
I can I can go through if someone, you know, has a question about a lecture for, you know, Slide 16, we can pull it up and cover it.

80
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:30,150
Are any questions that folks have at this point? Yeah, I'm curious about kind of the layout of like types of questions that are going to be

81
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:34,920
mostly like rote memorization and like recall versus like application of the material.

82
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:43,150
Good question. I think it's going to be. A mixture of both.

83
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:50,500
And it also prompts me to repeat the format of the exam, which I'll do now.

84
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,580
Uh, it's. I've got it finalized.

85
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:59,320
It's 33 questions. Most of the questions.

86
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:05,200
I didn't count the exact number, but most are a mix of multiple choice.

87
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:11,460
Fill in the blank or some sort of, like, rank order, right?

88
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,240
Like a preferred or a priority or most advantageous.

89
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:28,870
You know, something along those lines. And then a smaller number, I'm going to say maybe six or seven, which fall under the category of short answer.

90
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:38,770
Short answer meaning, uh, a few sentences to answer the question or a few bullet points to lay out, uh,

91
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:47,110
it might say like with three examples of this and you can write a bullet or a sentence for each to clarify,

92
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:52,239
you know, none of those short answers are intended to be, okay, I'm going to write,

93
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,350
you know, a half a page worth of information, but that's not my expectation.

94
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,880
So don't feel like you need to go to go on and on. You know, most of these can be answered with a bullet or, you know,

95
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:09,160
I'm not grading on like sentence structure or, you know, use of nouns and verbs or whatever,

96
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:20,020
but just just be able to demonstrate your your understanding of the content specific to your question about the recall versus application.

97
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:28,700
Definitely a mix. I'm trying to think of, uh. But that ratio or breakdown might be.

98
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:37,430
So recall again, it's not, uh, it's not random recall.

99
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:44,900
Right. It's not something like, just kind of trivial factoid from our reading theory down in the bottom of the page.

100
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:52,100
Uh, it's recall of what I would consider, like, important concepts that we've covered, uh, in class.

101
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,510
I spoke just a minute ago about, you know, ionizing versus 1980s and radiation, uh,

102
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:05,510
as sources of exposures or hazards and an understanding what those types are and the differences between them.

103
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:17,810
Um, that's probably an example of recall rate being able to, uh, to relay that, but also application being able, be able to say what are some example,

104
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:26,840
uh, scenarios of when someone might be exposed to ionizing radiation in a community setting or in a workplace setting?

105
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:33,140
Does that answer your question? Okay. Good question.

106
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:47,270
Any others that folks have. Okay.

107
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:53,750
Well, I'll invite you during the rest of the class period if you come up with other questions.

108
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:02,150
Feel free to interrupt. Uh, I would be happy to go back and answer something that said, we're still a week away.

109
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:10,370
Right. So as you're going through material and preparing for the exam and you do come up with questions, don't hesitate to reach out to me.

110
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:16,490
Shoot me an email. Like, if it's something easy to clarify, I can just reply over email.

111
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:23,960
Um. Oftentimes it'll be something like relevant that I should share with the whole class.

112
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,350
So if someone asks me a question, it's like, oh, that's a really good point.

113
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,670
I should clarify that for everybody.

114
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:35,930
I'll send out an announcement and say, Hey, I received a question from one of your classmates and here's some important information to know.

115
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,190
Um, I'd also be happy to meet with anyone.

116
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:48,860
Uh, either in person or over Zoom if it's not easy to just have a quick exchange over email if it's easier to have an actual discussion.

117
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:55,740
So don't hesitate to reach out in that regard as well. All right.

118
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:02,810
Thank you for that. Let's go ahead and dove into today's topic.

119
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,930
So I kind of set the contrast for the next two class periods.

120
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:20,889
They're focused around standards, guidelines, regulations, and importantly with the with a very US centric focus.

121
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,330
Although I will touch on some kind of global or international aspects today,

122
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:36,940
differentiating between those within an occupational or workplace setting and then more broadly within community or more public settings.

123
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:46,990
So our objectives are to understand what those organizations are, who those agencies are.

124
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,650
Again, specifically within the U.S. services with a focus on the U.S.,

125
00:15:51,010 --> 00:16:04,180
we will contrast with other examples outside of the U.S. But those that set the standards and regulations talk about the scope of temporal trends.

126
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:11,650
So over time, right, if you go back 60 years ago, we were lacking in standards and regulations.

127
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:22,060
So as as they've been implemented, what's been the benefit or challenge of reducing exposures over that time period and understanding

128
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:28,240
what some of those trends look like within that context of implemented standards and regulations?

129
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:34,540
And then importantly, and this is where we'll back out a little bit and talk about more of an international setting

130
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:42,340
or a global health setting is understand the differences between a standard and a guideline.

131
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:49,210
And they're they're an important distinction to make, both within the U.S. as well as I mean,

132
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:56,200
and who are those organizations and agencies that set either of those standards or guidelines?

133
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:05,410
And then this is a little bit of a preface, and then I think I have the same slide towards the end of the lecture.

134
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:13,990
And I expect, Professor, I will present a slide or at least topically discuss this within an occupational setting as well,

135
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:21,220
but from a scientific perspective. It's not actually that difficult.

136
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:26,020
Scientists are really smart and they know how to study things.

137
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:32,320
It's not that hard to identify a problem to study it right,

138
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:39,790
whether it be natural sciences or social sciences or often a combination of both, and then come up with an answer or a solution.

139
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:45,340
In this case, identifying a problem related to exposure to hazards,

140
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:54,280
what can we do to set up a regulatory framework so that we have a standard that keeps people safe,

141
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,880
that is protective of their health from an exposure perspective?

142
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:07,350
The reality is down here, everything having to do with the nonscientific process.

143
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:15,270
So the process of establishing policy is dealing with the reality of it.

144
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:23,920
Right. Within an occupational setting, it's kind of the willingness of workplaces to implement it.

145
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:29,430
Right. And not to kind of skirt processes, lobbying.

146
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:35,640
It has a huge impact on what actually gets legislated, especially at a federal level.

147
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:41,910
But even within state level. And that affects both occupational as well as punitive standards.

148
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:53,880
So oftentimes we do end up with a standard that has incorporated a fair amount of the information that was determined from the scientific process.

149
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,770
But it's often been modified and limited, in fact,

150
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:04,630
so that the standard is not quite achieving what the original intent or hopefully

151
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:10,770
because of the complications of the reality of policy development process.

152
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:18,300
So as a little bit of a kind of a context will launch into this and then I'll come back to it at the end.

153
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:26,240
All right. So a little bit of alphabet soup here and some long named agencies.

154
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,890
But this is our reality.

155
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:38,750
These are the major federal regulatory agencies within the U.S. with regard to these kind of community environmental exposure issues,

156
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:45,800
one being the Environmental Protection Agency. The other being the Department of Transportation.

157
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:53,660
And another the Department of Agriculture. And one being the Department of the Interior.

158
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,820
We will talk quite a bit about EPA. They won't mention anything here on this side.

159
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:04,070
The Department of Transportation specifically regulates the transportation of

160
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:09,800
hazardous materials right on our roadways and our railways airways as it may be.

161
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:15,260
The Department of Agriculture regulates things like pesticide residues,

162
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:31,340
aspects of food safety from an agricultural perspective, the use of hormones in chickens, cows, etc.

163
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:38,900
And then the Department of the Interior regulates a lot of the land, uses, uh,

164
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,980
wilderness designation, how wildlife impact operating systems might be impacted.

165
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:58,370
A lot of what has to do with mining of raw materials or drilling for oil and gas, etc., is regulated by the Department of the Interior.

166
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:07,790
So the slide clicked click. The title didn't change much, but importantly it went from regulatory agencies to non regulatory agencies.

167
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:17,780
So there are some very formal agencies here which in the US to play important roles in providing technical assistance and guidelines,

168
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,460
but they are outside of a regulatory framework.

169
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:27,020
They don't establish standards and they don't have an enforcement capacity.

170
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,810
So one example, an important one for that is the CDC.

171
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:39,680
So the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, they do issue a lot of guidelines.

172
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:47,360
The last couple of years, right, during the COVID 19 pandemic, has been a great example of those guidelines being issued,

173
00:21:48,230 --> 00:22:00,410
a lot of scientifically based information, technical assistance and assessments within CDC, kind of specific to environmental exposures,

174
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:07,670
whether they be chemical, biological or physical, etc., are a couple of different components of CDC,

175
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:15,320
one being the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry or ETS are not pronounceable, not a very good acronym.

176
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:24,890
And then the National Center for Environmental Health, another really important single agency,

177
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:30,020
although multiple institutes under it, is the National Institutes of Health.

178
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:36,979
Right. And the maybe the more the most relevant one for today's lecture is the National

179
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:42,650
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for Tuesday's lecture focused on workplaces.

180
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,250
There's the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health,

181
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:55,370
both one of multiple institutes that's under that umbrella of our U.S. based National Institutes of Health.

182
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:08,750
But again, this is an example of organizations or agencies that do not issue standards and do not have a capacity to enforce standards or regulation.

183
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:16,490
They are simply exist to develop scientific knowledge and provide technical assistance and guidelines.

184
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:24,210
All right. This is a really busy slide. Apologies in advance.

185
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,480
And even the structure of the slide is confusing because it's not a landscape.

186
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,040
Uh, this is basically two different sets.

187
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:43,440
So the U.S. and European over here on the right, because you can piece that down below here.

188
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:48,630
It's really meant to be two columns that would just go in portrait mode that doesn't fit on the slide.

189
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,920
So it basically starts on the left and continues over here on the right.

190
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,700
We're not going to go through all of these in detail on this slide.

191
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,290
What I do want to draw your attention to are some of the dates.

192
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:06,000
Okay. So let's focus on the US columns to begin with.

193
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:11,790
Uh, 1970 is a really key time frame. We'll talk about some of the history here in a minute.

194
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:20,310
There's lots of legislative acts for regulation and setting up standards taking place here in the U.S. in the 1970s,

195
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:27,270
some also into the 1980s and maybe early into the 1990s.

196
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,590
But there was a pretty quick drop off at that point.

197
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:39,660
So over the last 30 years or so, the pace of setting standards and implementing regulations has really dropped off.

198
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:45,000
Comparing that to the European Union, just as a nice contrast.

199
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,170
Uh, you know, shows you here some, some more recent.

200
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:56,670
We established regulations and standards that have continued to take place, those, you know, well into the 2000.

201
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:08,310
So, you know, the point here is, uh, a couple of things we'll come back around to maybe why this is the case, but it's a natural question.

202
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:15,630
Uh, are the standards and regulations that were established in the 1970s still the best ones for us now?

203
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:24,390
Right after the science has continued to evolve and we've learned so much more about relationships between exposures and impact on health.

204
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:30,270
All right. So let's go through some of these key agencies,

205
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:40,230
what their primary mission is and then how some of those key legislative acts or regulation and standard setting, you know, fit into the agencies.

206
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:50,639
So the U.S. EPA is really the primary Environmental Regulatory Agency within the U.S. It brought

207
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,050
together a number of federal programs that we'll talk about some examples here in a few minutes.

208
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:05,790
But the mission of the EPA is to protect human health and to safeguard the natural environment of the air, the water, even the land that we depend on.

209
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:18,150
Right. Or for our existence. The EPA derives its regulatory authority from these this list of key legislative acts.

210
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,780
These include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, Cercla.

211
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,270
We're going to step through each of these individually here in the next few moments.

212
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,200
The Resource Recovery Conservation Act, State Water Drinking Act,

213
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:38,910
Superfund Amendment Reauthorization Act, as well as Tosca, the Toxic Substances Control Act.

214
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,540
All right. So let's step through a couple of these, some of the key important ones.

215
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:52,080
First, starting with the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act was established in 1970.

216
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:59,130
There were then subsequent amendments to it. First in 1977 and then in 1990.

217
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:05,280
There have not been any legislative amendments to the Clean Air Act since 1990.

218
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:14,700
The framework of it is that the EPA at the federal level sets air quality standards.

219
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:29,250
And then also importantly in terms of structure, is that left up to the individual states to actually implement the Clean Air Act and enforce it?

220
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:38,760
So if there is a violation that's occurring in terms of levels in the air of a pollutant that are too high,

221
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:45,330
that are not meeting the standard that happens in Michigan, regardless of where in Michigan,

222
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,080
it's up to the state of Michigan to identify it,

223
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:57,630
to implement and also enforce the standard and come up with the plan to reduce

224
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,530
the levels so that it's meeting the quality of the leading the standards.

225
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,890
This is also the case for the Clean Water Act that we'll talk about here in a minute.

226
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,650
So the Clean Air Act and its structure regulates both.

227
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:15,230
If you remember back earlier in the semester, we talked about a classification of different source types.

228
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,829
So the Clean Air Act regulates both stationary sources. Right.

229
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:27,780
So a traditional factory or smokestack power plant, etc., as well as mobile sources of police cars, trains, busses.

230
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:35,330
And it takes into account the relative contributions of each specific air pollution problem,

231
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:40,730
as well as the relative capacity of different source types to reduce the emissions.

232
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:47,060
There are and this is important to understand when we talk about air quality standards,

233
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:54,400
there are only six primary or the EPA refers to them as criteria pollutants.

234
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:10,880
They are carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, which are all gases and then lead as well as particulate matter,

235
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,660
both of which generally refer exist in a physical state, not as a gas as the others do.

236
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,780
This doesn't mean that there aren't other pollutants in the air that we shouldn't be concerned about.

237
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,090
And it doesn't mean that there's not now 50 or 60 years on time.

238
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:35,630
My math is terrible of information that we've learned about all of these other pollutants.

239
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:44,749
It's just that the scientific process combined with that policy development process hasn't

240
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:50,030
allowed for additional standards to be established for other pollutants beyond the six.

241
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:54,530
In some cases, even scientifically. It's truly confusing and difficult.

242
00:29:55,070 --> 00:30:04,610
There are a lot of regional differences and different pollutants are the source of the problem might vary tremendously spatially across the U.S.,

243
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:09,920
so that it's not easy to set a simple standard or to focus on a particular loop.

244
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:17,990
However, for these six primary pollutants, these criteria pollutants, the scientific knowledge is there.

245
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:22,100
Like I mentioned, it's been there for a long time. And so these exist.

246
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:27,830
So these regulate what the actual concentration outdoors in the air can be.

247
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,310
Levels need to be below that established standard.

248
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:41,780
EPA does regulate other aspects of pollutants and many more than those six, but not to the concentration that's in the air.

249
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:46,310
Just from how much is allowed to be emitted. Sources.

250
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,460
So a different approach to regulation.

251
00:30:50,390 --> 00:31:01,100
The 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act added the list of 189 different chemicals in the air that were identified as being air toxics.

252
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:09,860
So it doesn't set a standard for what the allowable concentration in the air is of these 189 chemicals.

253
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:17,060
But it does set standards for how much is allowed to be needed from no emission sources.

254
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:23,840
So an important distinction between the two regulating standards of concentrations in the air

255
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:31,130
versus regulating how much can be emitted from control and using control technology to limit that.

256
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:40,760
Shifting gears from the Clean Air Act to the Clean Water Act, very similar in structure and framework and in the timeline of implementation.

257
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,600
The Clean Water Act was legislated in 1972.

258
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,250
There were subsequent amendments in 1977 and 1987.

259
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:57,590
But again, importantly, no additional amendments to the Clean Water Act since 1982, not for a long time.

260
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:08,090
And, you know, its basic goal is to maintain or otherwise improve the cleanliness and the integrity of our nation's waters.

261
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:17,720
But as I mentioned, it's it's similar to the Clean Air Act in terms of its statutory approach.

262
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:25,020
Let's see some of what I have in these bullet points here. The nation's waters constitute a broadly distributed common resource, right?

263
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,460
All of which is impacted by many different polluters.

264
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:42,560
And then there are nationwide criteria defining the quality of that water and again, utilizes enforceable technology based standards.

265
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:58,480
So based on science and the ability to regulate and and set up set standards for what is allowed to be discharged or emitted from known sources.

266
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:07,340
And again, that framework, even though the Clean Water Act and its amendments were legislated at the federal level,

267
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,590
the implementation and the enforcement of it are handled at the state level.

268
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:26,000
Q Shifting gears ever so slightly, but with an important distinction is the Safe Water Drinking Act that was established in 1974,

269
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,960
but subsequent amendments in 1986 and 1996.

270
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:34,700
But none no additional amendments since then, since 1996.

271
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:48,470
This sets standards for the levels of contaminants in finished or basically tap water that's available to us for drinking,

272
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:54,770
cooking, bathing, etc., for both chemical and biological.

273
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:08,760
Possible contaminants. And again, the primary enforcement of these the authority lies within the individual states to implement these standards,

274
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,880
to permit how much is allowed to be discharged,

275
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:22,230
and then to to enforce and come up with implementation plans in the event that those standards are exceeded.

276
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:24,780
This is an important point, actually,

277
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:36,510
that applies to the place beyond the Safe Water Drinking Act is that there is a pathway for individual states to implement more stringent standards.

278
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:43,470
States can't elect to have more lax standards than what's established by federal legislation.

279
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:55,260
However, states do have an ability. It's a formal process within the EPA to actually establish more stringent standards.

280
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,700
This is the case for the state of California. I'm hopeful that all of you watch that video.

281
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:04,370
We'll talk about it in a few minutes here. But that was an example, right?

282
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:15,060
The state of California with in time across the timeline was actually ahead of the federal process within the U.S. in terms of establishing standards.

283
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:21,480
And the US EPA hasn't looked to rein in the state of California.

284
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:31,650
You know, along that path they have continued to be kind of on the forefront of both the science as well as regulation.

285
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:37,200
Shifting gears to regulating hazardous waste.

286
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:46,080
So where does the authority lie for the management of hazardous waste within the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act?

287
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:57,840
Again, similar timeframes established in 1970 excuse me, in 1970, amendments in 1976 and 1984 states.

288
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:03,300
Wherever feasible, the generation of hazardous waste is to be reduced or eliminated.

289
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:08,340
Nevertheless, if it is generated, it should be treated,

290
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:19,980
stored or disposed of so that it's minimizing both the present as well as any future threat to both human health as well as the environment.

291
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:32,430
So as you might imagine, because of that forward looking expectation or requirement, it involves complex prospective exposure assessments.

292
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:38,790
We talked about the different types of exposure, assessment methodologies or tools that are available to us.

293
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:49,740
For example, if there is a proposed hazardous waste disposal site that's going to be built west of Ann Arbor.

294
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:56,070
It's not as simple as someone saying, Yeah, we found a great spot. Everyone is okay with it.

295
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:01,080
The land is available. We're going to go after the places, build photos later.

296
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:06,630
It's not as simple as that. Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

297
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,830
There's a very detailed process that needs to be followed that requires exposure assessments.

298
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:24,390
What would be the impact? What would be the exposures to people and to the environment if that were to be built?

299
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:31,870
If that facility were to be built? Uh, on the topic of hazardous waste.

300
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,620
But then shifting gears a little bit to hazardous waste cleanup.

301
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,610
Okay. So we've already made a big mess.

302
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:48,250
There's hazardous waste that's known to exist out of sight because of some, you know, perhaps historical facilities.

303
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:55,360
This is all regulated through something that's commonly referred to as the Superfund program.

304
00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:02,350
A long worded version of that is the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act.

305
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:16,240
Uh, this regulation does attempt to recover, uh, our costs that are needed to remediate the situation from the responsible parties.

306
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:26,680
But as we've even discussed in a few examples in class, that often isn't available option because the contamination is from a long time ago.

307
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,520
It's not identified or discovered decades later,

308
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:37,630
at which point the responsible party perhaps no longer exists, whether it be a company that was in place.

309
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:47,590
Uh, and so it's, it could be complicated. It was amended in 1986, uh, by the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act.

310
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:52,300
We people do pronounce that I because of the available and it's called Sarah.

311
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:04,059
And then, you know, basically the framework for this is the Superfund program is identifying the highest priority sites based on

312
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:13,660
both the toxicity of the agents that are causing that are responsible for the distribution of hazardous waste,

313
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:24,910
but also the likelihood of exposure. Right. So if it exists, there's a lot of contamination, but it otherwise is relatively well contained.

314
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:34,270
The opportunity for people and sensitive aspects of our environment to come into contact with it or be harmed or exposed is small, right?

315
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:38,679
This would help to identify how or where it ranks on the priority list.

316
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:46,990
And there is a national priority list that is created within the Superfund program based on these characteristics,

317
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:55,360
both the toxicity of the agents as well as the likelihood of exposure that it could result in.

318
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:10,640
So specifically for regulating toxic chemicals that exist in our our our commerce here within the U.S.

319
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,080
This one is a little bit of a random factoid. I think that was our first day of class.

320
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:21,230
Does anybody remember how many identified chemicals exist in U.S. commerce?

321
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,720
I found 85,000. All right. Yeah, that's a lot.

322
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:34,580
So Tosca was legislated in 1976 for the Toxic Substances Control Act.

323
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:42,890
It directs EPA to require data from industry on not only the production,

324
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:52,130
but the use of different chemicals and how they could affect health and as well as the environment.

325
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:58,820
Tosca requires the manufacture of new chemicals for existing chemicals that

326
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:04,220
are put to a new use to detail the known information about those chemicals.

327
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:14,480
And it authorizes EPA to regulate the production of the chemicals, as well as the use and applications of those chemicals.

328
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:22,340
And with a focus on those that pose perhaps an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment,

329
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:32,270
this involves things like labeling requirements, tolerance levels, or actually outright bans of specific chemicals.

330
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:43,190
However, uh, only a handful of chemicals have actually been banned under this, under this rule under Tosca.

331
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:52,040
And there have been none since a 1991 court ruling on have proposed this phase out.

332
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:58,940
So there are some questions around the effectiveness of Tosca hospital reading.

333
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:03,830
This is an example of one where there has been more recent updates.

334
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:12,530
And, you know, in 2016, the Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act was legislated,

335
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:22,730
which updated and provided amendments to the original Toxic Substances Control Act, and it's added some much needed improvements.

336
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:37,460
For example, a mandatory requirement for EPA to evaluate existing chemicals and both with clear and enforceable deadlines.

337
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:40,580
The EPA can't just say, Yeah, we're going to study it forever.

338
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:55,940
The Lautenberg Act actually clarifies the timeframe that EPA needs to evaluate and provide information on new risk based Sandy safety standards.

339
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:06,500
So increased public transparency this has been a big issue is how available information is on various chemicals that are in all of the different,

340
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,020
you know, products that we come into contact with every day.

341
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:14,450
And then importantly, with these demands and requirements put on,

342
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:23,750
EPA is providing consistent funding for the agency to have the capacity to carry out these requirements.

343
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,790
Okay. Here's a good question from Kate.

344
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:37,610
Sorry. With Tosca, I'm wondering, is there an enforcement mechanism on the requiring manufacturers to detail their known information?

345
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:43,129
Because I'm thinking of examples like P fast where three knew about it for years and years and

346
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:47,330
years and did their own studies but didn't release any of that to the EPA until the nineties.

347
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:54,260
Yeah. And it's a great example of, uh, scenarios, right, where it might sounds good.

348
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:00,650
Um, and you talk about the chemicals that are in existence and going forward.

349
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:07,250
Right. Where it doesn't do a very good job is, is backward looking.

350
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:15,170
Right. And, uh, and even, you know, some of the hazardous waste regulation as well.

351
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:23,089
Right. It says on their yard that, you know, we're going to put the burden on responsible parties to cover the cost of remediation.

352
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:26,720
But you know what happens if those responsible parties no longer exist?

353
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:34,399
So similarly for for Tosca and subsequently, you know, it's amendment through the Life Work Act, it's a challenge.

354
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,840
And this is a good lead in. It's a good question and come back around if we don't address it.

355
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:47,420
Well, but I'm going to contrast or take an opportunity to contrast it by leaving the U.S. framework and looking at a very different approach.

356
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:57,740
So the European Union has implemented, uh, a regulatory framework, uh, called REACH,

357
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:05,090
which is an acronym that's print pronounced from the abbreviation of the Regulation on Registration,

358
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:09,680
Evaluation, Authorization and restriction of chemicals.

359
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:15,560
So as I mentioned, breaches of regulation of the European Union,

360
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:25,640
and it was adopted to improve both protection of human health as well as the environment from risks that can be posed specifically by chemicals.

361
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:35,180
Uh, it was passed in late in 2006 and then was implemented, began to be implemented starting in 2007.

362
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:41,390
So relatively recent, relatively costly as well to implement.

363
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:49,070
But uh, as a summary, you know, this is the essence of reach.

364
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:52,070
It requires manufacturers,

365
00:45:53,180 --> 00:46:07,819
anyone who imports or exports as well as the actual downstream users or suppliers of chemical products within the European Union to generate

366
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:17,870
registration documents to describe the hazards of the chemicals that they generate or encounter at any point along the part of their business,

367
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:21,140
whether it's the manufacturing or the downstream uses of it.

368
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:35,300
And then importantly, any companies within the European Union and again for the exporting or importing of chemicals to or from the European Union,

369
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:48,710
must comply with these regulations. So because of the, the global economy that exists, uh, the REACH program,

370
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:55,490
the REACH regulatory framework has an impact well beyond the borders of the European Union.

371
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:08,630
So there is an impact from U.S. companies that produce chemicals, other countries that produce chemicals by virtue of these global markets that exist.

372
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:19,160
It promotes alternative methods for hazard assessment of substances in order to promote the safe use of the chemicals,

373
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:28,520
not just in how they're manufactured, but throughout the supply chain, with the goal to reduce the use of highly toxic chemicals,

374
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:35,810
as well as reduce the number of tests on animals, specifically as another promotion or goal.

375
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:42,320
And it makes companies responsible from the get go, not retrospectively,

376
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:48,560
for the safety of the chemicals that they place in the market along the entire supply chain.

377
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:53,300
Right. So this is a very different approach than what exists in the US.

378
00:47:53,990 --> 00:48:01,490
Mostly what exists in the US is a company manufactures the chemicals, is distributed in products,

379
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:10,100
many of which we encounter every day in our everyday lives, whether we're at work or outside of work.

380
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:22,010
And it's only after decades, right, that somebody else, not the company that manufactured it or distributed its products, someone else.

381
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:32,170
Often government agencies or. Academia through funding, through research, identifies adverse health from exposure.

382
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:36,280
Right. And then looking backwards, it's like, okay, this isn't good.

383
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:40,330
Now we need to address it. How do we phase this chemical out?

384
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:46,000
So Ridge takes a very different approach to this, right?

385
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:54,819
It's putting the burden on chemicals in the first place to basically demonstrate the hazards or toxicity or safety,

386
00:48:54,820 --> 00:49:04,480
ideally, of chemicals that they are going to place into society through product, through the supply chain.

387
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:10,080
So that, in a roundabout way, addresses your your question, Kate.

388
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:12,310
I think the answer is there's there's not a good answer.

389
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:23,180
And I think the message here, or at least my message is the way that we approach things in the US isn't required.

390
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:27,850
That's not the way that we need to do it. It's arguably not the best way to do it.

391
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:33,700
And here's a perfect example of how toxic chemicals are managed within the European Union.

392
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:38,630
So it's something to keep in mind to consider. All right.

393
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,880
Shifting gears a little bit.

394
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:47,870
This is a chance to talk about some of the biological hazards that we encounter and how they're regulated, regulated within the US.

395
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,470
Are we're talking about some of the food safety systems.

396
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:58,210
So in the U.S., there's multiple agencies that actually have purview here and responsibility for food safety.

397
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:08,020
These include the Food and Drug Administration, which along that timeline, the FDA has existed for a much longer time period compared to like the EPA.

398
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:16,270
This is going back to 1930 and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has important roles in inspecting,

399
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:26,830
labeling information around meat products, eggs, imported foods and the nutritional aspects of foods as well.

400
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:36,580
And the EPA also plays a role in terms of the use of pesticides within the system.

401
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:42,040
Also very concerned about these biological hazards that I referenced.

402
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:48,670
And it's a major part both in the processing as well as domestic use and a really high priority.

403
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:54,310
And again, for the for the implementation and enforcement, this is very much happening at the local level.

404
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:56,440
We talked about, you know,

405
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:08,460
states have the authority and the responsibility for implementation and enforcement that often gets filtered down to an even more local level,

406
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:16,959
where local health departments in Michigan, those health departments are centered in two counties.

407
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,660
Right. So Ann Arbor that you have campuses in Washtenaw County or the Washtenaw County Health Department,

408
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:31,059
that the state basically transfers the responsibility to a much more local level to be able to inspect,

409
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:35,800
ensure, maintain and address aspects of safety.

410
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:47,680
Specifically the FDA. Its mission is to assure it's pretty broad, actually, to assure the safety and efficacy and security of drugs.

411
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:54,070
So pharmaceuticals, biological products, medical devices and importantly,

412
00:51:54,070 --> 00:52:01,210
the nation's food supply that we're talking about now, cosmetics and even things that products that emit radiation.

413
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:14,390
Staying on the theme of the food systems. The Food Quality Production Protection Act was legislated in 1996.

414
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:22,699
This established health based standards for pesticide residues in food uses

415
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:29,480
something called a reasonable certainty of no harm as the general safety standard,

416
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:35,630
and it eliminated some longstanding problems that existed with multiple standards.

417
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,350
Part of it being,

418
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:45,820
because of these multiple agencies that are involved in how pesticides and both raw and processed foods would otherwise be addressed.

419
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:50,810
And importantly, the Food Quality Protection Act,

420
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:59,660
it requires consideration of all non occupational sources of exposure for the setting of standards and regulations.

421
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:13,219
So it's in acknowledging that many of these pesticides are pervasive in our environment so we can be exposed

422
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:21,110
to drinking water and there's other pesticides with a common mechanism of toxicity that are considered.

423
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:31,040
Right. So it's not just setting a standard for, you know, pesticide residue on on produce that we ingest purposely.

424
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,610
Right. It's acknowledging that these pesticides exist elsewhere.

425
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:39,200
They run off of agricultural farms. They get into drinking water supplies.

426
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:44,180
We are exposed through other routes to other exposure pathways.

427
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:51,680
And so the Food Quality Protection Act requires consideration of all of those sources of exposure.

428
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:59,690
There's also importantly, special provisions for both infants and children.

429
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,760
And so it requires and we're still talking about the third point Protection Act.

430
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:10,490
It requires an explicit determination that tolerances be safe for children,

431
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:19,040
and it includes an additional safety factor of up to ten fold and to account for

432
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:24,830
perhaps uncertainty in data relative to children if there's not enough information.

433
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:32,780
It really gives an opportunity to air conservatively with regards to regulation.

434
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:37,490
It also specifically addresses endocrine disruptors.

435
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:49,340
So this is a specific set of chemicals in pesticide products that are known to have specific type of health impact.

436
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:58,490
So it incorporates provisions for end of the testing and required new authority or providing

437
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:03,170
new authority to require the chemical manufacturers provide data on their products,

438
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:08,720
specifically with regard to potential for effects on different systems.

439
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:23,010
All right. So so that was the, the broad overview of agencies and organizations within the US that have some specific

440
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:30,420
regulatory framework and enforcement capacity for the setting and implementation of standards.

441
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:39,240
We also touched on a couple of different agencies that are non regulatory in nature, right, that still provide important information,

442
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:48,300
scientific information, technical assistance guidelines that are not standards or not enforceable but are otherwise useful.

443
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:57,629
We referenced a little bit. We kind of contrasted an approach outside the U.S. with regards to the regulation of chemicals,

444
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:03,750
specifically comparing reach to two types of Tosca and the Lundberg Act here in the U.S.

445
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:06,780
That's my broad overview.

446
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:13,330
Are there questions about we're going to we're going to step into a little bit of application here and go through some examples next.

447
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:17,340
So this is why I'm pausing other questions about this structure.

448
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:24,290
Again, it's a very US centric description. I will touch on some some international aspects, but towards the end of the class period.

449
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,920
All right. With that, let's jump into and of course, you know how this works.

450
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:38,830
My passion lies around air quality issues and impact on health.

451
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:45,610
So let's step into air quality regulations as a little bit of an example of this.

452
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:52,570
There's actually a long history of air pollution control and regulation going back to King Edward,

453
00:56:52,570 --> 00:57:00,160
the first of England back in 72 when he banned the use of sea coal to help address the known the smoky

454
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:08,230
skies in London that were known to be caused from the combustion of this coal for primarily for heating.

455
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:12,750
Uh, fast forwarding a little bit.

456
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:23,729
Going from the 1200s to the 1900s, early in the 1900s, air quality with, you know, the industrial revolution and the growth of the industrial machine.

457
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:29,760
And manufacturing was pretty poor, not just in London, but probably across the US.

458
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:41,340
These are some historic photos. Detroit as an example of, uh, manufacturing of products, automobiles is where things really got started at mass scale.

459
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:45,090
Very much focus in Detroit is about violence.

460
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:49,590
This is the roots. You're complex.

461
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,100
Yes, very nearby, not quite outside of Ireland.

462
00:57:55,380 --> 00:58:03,730
And this this facility still exists today. It looks a little better in terms of the pollution contribution.

463
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:14,520
Here's an image from your city in the 1950s. This would be a good example of lots of motor vehicles and pollution resulting from that.

464
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:19,890
Here's an example that's brought in a couple more decades to Pittsburgh in 1973.

465
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:26,520
This is a good example of the manufacturing, of the refinement of raw materials.

466
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:34,050
So right. So these automobiles that were being built in Detroit were reliant upon a lot of raw materials.

467
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:47,070
Steel, for example, Pittsburgh is pretty much famous for refinement and production of steel for for many applications, not just for cars.

468
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:55,040
But all of these are kind of independent examples of sources of air pollution that pretty much went unchecked, right?

469
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:58,410
Whatever was burned, whatever was produced, it was used.

470
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:07,410
And part of it was for safety. Right. The workers that are working at the facility, we don't want them to be exposed to it.

471
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:11,280
So you exhaust those gases and you can put them elsewhere.

472
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:21,360
But as we as we learned very quickly that that was a problem, it was removing it from the site,

473
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:26,580
but it was affecting many, many people more broadly across communities.

474
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:34,860
So that Clean Air Act of 1979 and subsequent amendments issued the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

475
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:46,830
How many of them are there? Right. They exist under two different kind of paradigms, one being primary and one secondary.

476
00:59:47,610 --> 01:00:00,030
The primary reason we're having nacs with people actually pronounce that one couple of those and it's like, let it rip max to protect public health.

477
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:12,480
So this would mean direct impacts on us, right. And a focus on vulnerable populations, kids with asthma, elderly folks with COPD.

478
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:22,950
These are just some examples. There's also a secondary element to or to justify the existence of the act is one to protect public welfare.

479
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:33,030
So things like visibility or even impact on materials that can degrade from exposure to pollutants.

480
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:38,040
So we have our criteria pollutants. And I'm going to kind of go through a chronology here.

481
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:48,570
Originally, we had some that exist today that still exist today, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide.

482
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:53,700
However, there were three originally that no longer exist today.

483
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:59,220
One was a TSP or total suspended particulates.

484
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:08,040
This meant all particles in the air through studying air pollution and how it impacts our health.

485
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:17,610
We learned that we have in our upper airways a mechanism to remove those largest particles.

486
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:22,079
So it's only small particles that are actually able to penetrate into our lungs.

487
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:25,230
Right. So with that, it was revised.

488
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:36,540
The TSP standard was then changed. So this referred to particles only of ten microns or less in its diameter,

489
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:42,360
knowing that only particles of that size are the ones that can get deep into our lungs and cause harm.

490
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:47,910
There was also a separate standard. So PM10 was not removed.

491
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:54,990
It still exists. There was a separate standard added much later in 1997 for PM 2.5.

492
01:01:55,380 --> 01:02:04,170
And again, this was informed by Health Studies research, looking at associations between exposure and impact on health.

493
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:13,280
They found independently. There's something about these PM 2.5 particles, those that are much smaller that have adverse impacts on our health.

494
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:20,880
So standards exist for both now for PM10 and 2.5 in place of that original GSP standard.

495
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:29,910
Ironically, there was originally a nacs, a national nationally of air quality standards for hydrocarbons.

496
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,459
And here we are many,

497
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:41,400
many decades later really stressing about how to regulate emissions of hydrocarbons that are contributing to a total separate issue of air quality.

498
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:48,630
Right. This is our greenhouse gas source and our our global warming and climate change.

499
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:57,000
Basically, it was decided really early on. There's like hundreds, if not thousands of hydrocarbons out there.

500
01:02:57,150 --> 01:03:02,580
It was impossible to try to regulate. And so it was it was removed as a next standard.

501
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:16,350
There was also a broad category of accidents, so gases that have an oxidizing capacity with further research around exposure and health.

502
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:23,010
We learned that it's primarily the gas ozone that's the driver of adverse impact on health.

503
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:30,450
So that standard was modified from this broad category of gaseous oxidants down specifically to ozone gas.

504
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:36,860
And then in 1976, a leg was added as one of the camps.

505
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:42,110
And this was understanding, right, that we were adding land.

506
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:44,180
This is one of the primary mechanisms.

507
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:52,580
You're adding led up purpose to gasoline engine performance so that when that gasoline was combusted within an automobile,

508
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:59,000
it's now emitting led into the air and spreading it widely and resulting in large exposures.

509
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:04,730
Right. So I mentioned that oxidants were changed to ozone in 1979.

510
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:09,229
Hydrocarbons were eventually just removed as a way to comply to address.

511
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:14,840
In 1983, CSP was changed to PM10 and then added 18.5 centimeters.

512
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:22,850
And interestingly, within that get, when you actually see that, you can see it was in 1971.

513
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:26,840
All right. So touching on a couple of aspects of this.

514
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:35,210
Catalytic converters were actually implemented as an emission control technology on automobiles.

515
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:43,070
This utilized first a single bead catalyst and a dual catalyst and then a three way catalyst.

516
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:51,590
But as a way to convert carbon monoxide that's otherwise emitted into hydrocarbons and CO2 gas.

517
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:59,030
Also, it would address the conversion of the nitrogen oxides to nitrogen gas.

518
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:11,300
And so this is reducing pollutants. It's converting within the emission system, these harmful gases into those that would be less harmful.

519
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:16,850
There were amendments to the Clean Air Act, importantly, in 1977.

520
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:27,350
These importantly, address something called prevention of significant deterioration in areas that already had attainment.

521
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:32,390
There were three different classes of regions. One is class one.

522
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:37,730
So it basically said if there's a pristine area, things like parks and wilderness.

523
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:42,020
Very importantly, our national park system is included within this.

524
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:51,020
Uh, the Clean Air Act amendments of 1977 said, yeah, in the Grand Canyon or sleeping bear dunes.

525
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:59,300
You know, here in Michigan, we can't add build new sources that would impact the quality of the air in these areas.

526
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:09,610
Areas that were classified or regions classified as class two where they were moderate changes allowed and then area areas

527
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:19,640
classified as class three where major growth is allowed to occur as long as those index standards are not exceeded.

528
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:26,770
You can build and build and build and expand as long as the monitoring gets done every day in these areas.

529
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:38,890
Still demonstrates that the levels of these six criteria pollutants are at a high level within the standards that were set, I mentioned.

530
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:47,740
Those kind of secondary reasons for having a national ambient air quality standard, one of which is visibility.

531
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:54,670
Right. So it isn't looking at the Great Smoky Mountains, one of the other national parks here in the US.

532
01:06:55,150 --> 01:07:00,790
So so visibility is protected through the Clean Air Act.

533
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:13,169
So one of the early studies that really helped to inform our evolving and improvement in

534
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:17,639
standards and regulation around air quality was something called the Six Cities Study.

535
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:22,830
This looked at affects of pollution on adults in the 1970s and 1980s,

536
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:29,820
and it found a strong positive correlation between levels of air pollution and mortality.

537
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:39,510
So so those research results, that scientific information directly led to a revision of the national air quality standards by the US and Canada.

538
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:53,940
Those six cities were highlighted, or at least in color, here in the six different states in Wisconsin, Missouri, Tennessee, Ohio, etiquette.

539
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:04,290
And the study found that individuals in the highest polluted areas, which in this case was Steubenville, Ohio,

540
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:15,210
lived on average four years less than those who lived in the least polluted areas, which in this study was Portage, Wisconsin.

541
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:22,529
The study demonstrated that chronic exposure to air pollutants was independently

542
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:28,020
related to cardiovascular mortality and that if you kind of plot this out,

543
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:34,290
this was looking at this is when we began to learn that it's really fine particles.

544
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:39,209
PM It's in the air is when we know this globally.

545
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:44,340
Now decades later it is by far the single largest driver.

546
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:51,300
When we look at global burden of disease due to air pollution, the vast majority of it comes from particles in the air.

547
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:59,110
And so this plot is looking at those six cities. Here's the Portage, Wisconsin line.

548
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:02,790
And we look at the axis here at the concentration of fine particles.

549
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:09,420
So this is PM 2.5. It's maybe about 11 micrograms per cubic meter with the risk ratio around one.

550
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:13,560
And then we look at the highest polluted cities.

551
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:20,610
Steubenville, Ohio, is out here at about 30 micrograms per cubic meter, but the risk ratio of around 1.3.

552
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:31,110
Right, and are relatively linear as pollution exposure increases, that risk ratio of death increases as well.

553
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:40,190
So this was an important study. It helped to inform aspects of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act.

554
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:45,090
Importantly, this authorized the programs that control acid deposition.

555
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:51,890
I mentioned those 189 toxic pollutants that didn't limit their.

556
01:09:52,280 --> 01:10:00,020
It didn't set standards for their concentration in air, but it did regulate how much is able to be obtained from known emission sources.

557
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:08,090
Specifically, establish some permit program requirements and expanded and modified provisions concerning

558
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:13,730
the attainment of the nets and also expanded and modified some of the enforcement authority.

559
01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:22,060
The next couple of slides are not meant to go through all of the details here.

560
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:30,280
They're meant to utilize an example to detail how complicated things like to create impact.

561
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:36,250
Right. So these are the amendments we have the original Clean Air Act from 1970.

562
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:43,420
Was first amended in 1977. It was again amended in 1999 and not amended again since.

563
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,190
So within those 1990 amendments, there are these titles.

564
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:57,320
There are 11 titles within the act that address all of these different aspects of air quality regulation.

565
01:10:58,030 --> 01:11:08,380
Of the 11 titles listed. If we just focus in on little one, it was specific to air pollution prevention and control.

566
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:19,240
Four different parts to Title one. If we just focus in on Part A, there are 15 different sections, right?

567
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:25,450
So you can imagine as a as a document, as a piece of legislation, how complex this is.

568
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:29,300
And this is just an example of this amendment to the Clean Air Act.

569
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:38,470
This would be the case from a kind of a complexity standpoint, all of these different regulatory acts that we are discussing today.

570
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:44,740
All right. Really quickly on, have they been a benefit?

571
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:54,460
The answer's yes. So two levels with implementation of the max have come down dramatically over recent decades.

572
01:11:54,970 --> 01:12:01,720
Led light was banned. It was no longer allowed to be used as an additive in gasoline in the U.S.

573
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:08,680
Very quickly saw a precipitous drop in the concentrations of lead in the air within this country.

574
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:13,420
For PM 2.5 and for ozone.

575
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:18,399
We have seen decreases over those similar time periods.

576
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,059
But as you can see that the trend is not as impressive.

577
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:25,690
Right? They're much more slight in their nature.

578
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:30,550
The reason is that by controlling land,

579
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:42,070
it was basically banning its use and it was no longer able to provide fuel to gas for Esso to it was specifically through control technology.

580
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:45,580
Esso, too is admitted when coal is burned.

581
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:51,850
When we mined coal out of the earth, it's naturally enriched in sulfur just geologically.

582
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:59,680
When that coal is burned and it releases that sulfur in the form of sulfur dioxide gas when it's burned

583
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:07,600
at a high temperature by using scrubbers and other technologies like on the smokestack facility itself.

584
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:14,100
Much of that sulfur dioxide gas can be captured so that it's not emitted and not released into the air.

585
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:17,770
So this is what's allowed dramatic reduction to gas.

586
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:26,290
In contrast, ozone gas isn't emitted from any of these emission sources that we discussed.

587
01:13:26,890 --> 01:13:30,700
It's not emitted from the tailpipes of cars or busses or trucks.

588
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:42,490
It's not emitted from the factory smokestacks. Ozone is formed through chemical reactions in the atmosphere from other precursor gases.

589
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:48,970
So things like nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons in the presence of sunlight.

590
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:53,050
So through a photochemical reaction, a warm ozone.

591
01:13:53,170 --> 01:14:00,310
So this happens kind of downwind and downstream of emission sources of these other precursor gases.

592
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:06,120
Because of this, it's it's much more complicated to try to try to regulate.

593
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:14,440
It's not as simple as saying, okay, we'll just remove the ozone from the emission stream because ozone is not being emitted from any of these sources.

594
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:21,340
You have 2.5 is a little bit of a mix. There are some particles that are directly emitted from sources.

595
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:25,360
They have been addressed. It's resulted in some reductions.

596
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:34,090
But those R.P.M. 2.5 also has, by the way, ozone being formed downwind.

597
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:41,190
For that reason, we call it a secondary plume. SO2 is directly emitted from smokestacks.

598
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:50,040
It's turned off. Primary ozone is not emitted from sources, but form downwind through chemical reactions.

599
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:55,260
It's classified as a secondary to PM 2.5 as a little bit of both.

600
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:00,180
It does exist as a primary are sources that directly to the particles.

601
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:05,160
It also exists. It has contributions from secondary processes.

602
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:12,540
So there are gases that are emitted through chemical reactions that can then form part of old calculating chemistry.

603
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:20,250
Because of that kind of similarly to ozone, it's also been a bit more of a challenge to try to regulate really quickly here.

604
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:24,930
The take home message is, yes, these regulations have been effective.

605
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:34,260
This is some some quotes here from of the paper studying the reduction of acid pollution and rain.

606
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:41,490
We're seeing regulations on emission sources having direct positive impact to reduce pollutants and rain largely

607
01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:48,930
attributed to the decrease to the amendments of the Clean Air Act in 1998 regulating emissions of sulfur dioxide.

608
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:55,710
And this is another quote here that says, look, you know, it's costly to do this.

609
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:58,740
It takes money and effort to implement.

610
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:04,740
There was a lot of concern about what its impact might be on industry by putting these additional regulations in place.

611
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:06,690
But it's showing that there's a clear,

612
01:16:06,810 --> 01:16:13,590
significant evidence of a direct impact on improvement of our environment and our impact on health from the regulation.

613
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:18,720
This is looking at spatially some data going back to 1985.

614
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:21,899
This is what sulfur ion concentrations look like.

615
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:30,550
So sulfate being a large contributor to acid rain and then fast forwarding to 2003 after the 1990 contract was amended,

616
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:41,340
it was implemented and major reductions in the emissions and major improvements in acid rain from sulfur emissions.

617
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:46,290
Another study I mentioned, the six city study. There was a follow up.

618
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:52,080
It wasn't called the 5151 city study, but in essence, this is what it what it was.

619
01:16:53,430 --> 01:17:02,520
And they found that average life expectancy in all of these 51 U.S. cities increased by nearly three years,

620
01:17:04,230 --> 01:17:12,270
and it was attributed to reductions in air pollution as a result of the 1990 Clean Air Act.

621
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,990
And again, conclusion here is that, yeah, it's an investment.

622
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:24,690
There are costs involved. But this study showed that there's a direct improvement not only in our environment, but in public health.

623
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:32,969
This is an illustration of where those 51 cities were located, many more than the original six,

624
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:42,060
and perhaps a much more spatially representative study incorporating a much greater amount of the U.S. population.

625
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:49,920
And then with regard to those costs and this is a little bit of propaganda, this is a US EPA plot,

626
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:57,870
but it's actually demonstrating that we have managed right through regulation of air pollutants.

627
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:02,490
This is those six criteria pollutants and their associated aggregated emissions.

628
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:11,730
We've been able to reduce the emissions, but we've also been able to achieve this this growth, this gross domestic product.

629
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:15,150
This increased over the same time over the course of those decades.

630
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:18,960
And this is with additional challenges that have occurred over that time.

631
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,960
We're not driving less as a society.

632
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:29,580
There's an increase in vehicle miles traveled over that time frame, an increase in the population, the demands that come with it.

633
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:35,819
We've had a little bit of increase in energy consumption, a little bit of increase in CO2 emissions,

634
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:40,830
but those have at least leveled off or so over the more recent decade.

635
01:18:43,530 --> 01:18:50,190
That said, we still have work to do. I think we started the first class saying that one third of people in this country

636
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:56,100
live where their air quality concentrations above the national standards.

637
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:59,120
This is a frustrating one we talked about.

638
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:09,230
It is one of the example from our s in the news that in the US the end result from an enforcement perspective often gets decided in courtrooms.

639
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:15,710
EPA sets the standard, they improve the standard, it's updated and somebody isn't happy with it.

640
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:20,660
It might be industry that says this is way too onerous. It's a wage, it is going to cost jobs.

641
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:27,590
EPA is going too far. The lawsuit might come from an environmental health advocacy group.

642
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:35,300
It says the EPA hasn't gone far enough. These these fall short of being protective of our most vulnerable populations.

643
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:43,910
So it kind of gets us back to this science and policy. It's really easy.

644
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:48,890
Easy. It's very possible. Identify the problems that come up and implement standards.

645
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:54,230
There's lots of complications along the way that get in the way of that being easy process.

646
01:19:54,890 --> 01:20:00,049
I'm going to go ahead and stop here. We're at the end of time. There's a couple of more slides.

647
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:03,290
I'll work in some discussion next time period.

648
01:20:03,890 --> 01:20:07,219
With that, I'll go ahead and break. I can hang up here just outside the class.

649
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:15,860
And if anybody has to watch for your attention and have a good piece of.
