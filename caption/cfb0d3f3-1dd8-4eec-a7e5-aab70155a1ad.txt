Hello, welcome to this
lecture on sampling concepts.

2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:17,565
In today's lecture will talk about the two
components of sampling variability.

3
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:22,628
Our learning objectives are to
understand what these two concepts are,

4
00:00:22,628 --> 00:00:26,867
specifically the population variance and
the sample size.

5
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:28,751
Now as we discussed previously,

6
00:00:28,751 --> 00:00:32,253
sampling variability concerns
the question how different or

7
00:00:32,253 --> 00:00:36,509
alike would your results be if you
replicated your study with a new sample.

8
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:41,042
The answer to this question is impacted
first by the population variance.

9
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:46,906
Which describes how noisy or
variable the values in the population are.

10
00:00:46,906 --> 00:00:51,626
And then your answer to the question is
also impacted by your sample size, or

11
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:55,411
the number of observations that
you collect in your sample.

12
00:00:55,411 --> 00:01:01,404
Now as possible values in the population
become more variable, the samples that we

13
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:07,582
draw from the population will also become
more variable or distinct from each other.

14
00:01:07,582 --> 00:01:11,120
As an example,
suppose we have two populations.

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,052
The first population is all preschool
children who attend a Head Start program

16
00:01:16,052 --> 00:01:19,349
and they have ages that
range from 2 to 5 years old.

17
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:23,563
The second population is all
adults who live in Ann Arbor and

18
00:01:23,563 --> 00:01:26,689
they have ages that range from 18 to 95.

19
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:32,148
Now ages in adults are much more variable
than the range of ages in the children.

20
00:01:32,148 --> 00:01:36,806
And therefore, we say that ages
in the adult population are more

21
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:40,354
variable than the ages
in the child population.

22
00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:43,244
Now suppose each of us selects a randomly

23
00:01:43,244 --> 00:01:47,242
chosen group of 40 adults
from the adult population.

24
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:51,918
And each of us computes a sample
mean specific to our sample of data.

25
00:01:51,918 --> 00:01:54,967
Because each of us has
a different sample of data,

26
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:58,538
each of us would most likely
have a different sample mean.

27
00:01:58,538 --> 00:02:02,940
For example, one of the samples
might produce a sample mean of 30.1,

28
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,645
another sample might produce
a mean of 41.7 and so forth.

29
00:02:06,645 --> 00:02:11,665
You can see variability among all of these
samples producing a different sample mean.

30
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:16,296
Suppose we then make a histogram of
all of the sample means from all of

31
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:20,287
the samples based upon the samples
drawn from the adults.

32
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:25,308
And perhaps we get a histogram represented
by the picture on the right here.

33
00:02:25,308 --> 00:02:29,486
Again, the x-axis represents
the range of sample means.

34
00:02:29,486 --> 00:02:32,964
And the height of each bar on
the histogram tells me how

35
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:36,146
many samples had a sample
mean within that beam.

36
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:38,086
Now imagine we do the same thing,

37
00:02:38,086 --> 00:02:42,817
but now each of us draws sample of 40
children from the population of children.

38
00:02:42,817 --> 00:02:46,768
And each of us computes a sample
mean from each of our samples.

39
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:50,490
Again, you can see that the sample means
from these samples are much smaller than

40
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,228
the sample means from the adults, because
the children naturally are younger.

41
00:02:54,228 --> 00:02:57,786
We then do a histogram of
all of those sample means.

42
00:02:57,786 --> 00:03:02,094
And you can see immediately that
this histogram is much narrower than

43
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:05,145
the histogram drawn from
the samples of adults.

44
00:03:05,145 --> 00:03:08,640
And this represents the impact
of population variance on

45
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,176
sampling variability.

46
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:13,346
As the variability in
the population goes up,

47
00:03:13,346 --> 00:03:17,828
so does the variability among all
the different samples of data.

48
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:20,913
In the children there was less
variability in the population.

49
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:25,424
And therefore, the sample means
also varied less from each other.

50
00:03:25,424 --> 00:03:29,666
As compared to the adults who had
more variability in the population.

51
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:34,352
And therefore, had more variability in
their sample means is represented by

52
00:03:34,352 --> 00:03:37,173
the wider spread in
the bars in the histogram.

53
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:41,022
Now the second component of sampling
variability is sample size.

54
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:45,568
So if we return to the histogram
of the sample means drawn from

55
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:47,718
the samples of 40 adults.

56
00:03:47,718 --> 00:03:51,365
Now imagine each of us
were able to collect data

57
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:54,645
on 400 adults instead of 40 adults.

58
00:03:54,645 --> 00:03:57,288
We each computer sample
mean from our samples and

59
00:03:57,288 --> 00:03:59,358
make a histogram of our sample means.

60
00:03:59,358 --> 00:04:03,058
And now the question I raised to you is
how would this impact the variability

61
00:04:03,058 --> 00:04:04,831
among our different sample means?

62
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:07,160
If each of us collects more data,

63
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,824
what would the resulting histogram
of our sample means look like?

64
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:15,533
And the answer to that question is
represented by the histogram in yellow.

65
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:20,195
You can see immediately then when each
of us collects more data in each of our

66
00:04:20,195 --> 00:04:25,009
samples, each of us gets a sample mean
that is less variable from each other.

67
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:28,075
Therefore, as we increase our sample size,

68
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:32,364
we expect there to be less
variability among the sample means.

69
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:36,619
The uncertainty that we have with our
data is then quantified by the relative

70
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:39,886
magnitude of the population
variance in the sample size.

71
00:04:39,886 --> 00:04:43,377
If the population variance is
large relative to the sample size,

72
00:04:43,377 --> 00:04:47,761
then we're less certain that our results
will be replicated in different study.

73
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:52,362
In contrast, if the sample size is large
relative to the population variance,

74
00:04:52,362 --> 00:04:56,905
we are more certain that the results
would be replicated in a different study.

75
00:04:56,905 --> 00:05:01,017
Therefore, we quantify the relative
magnitude of the population variance in

76
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:04,814
the sample size, with the value known
as the standard error of the mean,

77
00:05:04,814 --> 00:05:07,774
which we'll formally define
in a following lecture.
