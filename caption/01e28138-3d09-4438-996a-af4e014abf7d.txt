1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,350
All right. Well, good to go. So the video from last week has been posted online.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,190
So if you were not able to make the session or if there was something you missed during class,

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,459
the video from our session online last week has been posted to canvas quotes.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,710
One will open today after class and is going to cover two topics that we've covered so far.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,440
So U.S. Census labor statistics, and he's in there for us, which we'll be covering today.

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:37,470
The format is we have four questions, multiple choice questions, and then also multiple answers.

7
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,800
So some questions, you have to select multiple options to have the full answer.

8
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,730
Feel free to use your notes. And keep in mind that the quiz once is open.

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,400
You have the entire time frame to take the place. But make sure you submit your quiz.

10
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:05,100
So if you were completing your quiz and then you stopped one day deadline shows up, the quiz will submit as is.

11
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,470
So make sure you're intentional about completing your choice and submitting it when you're done.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,610
And then each question is one is worth one point.

13
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,090
But for some of the questions that have multiple answers, you have to choose all of the answers to get it right.

14
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,470
And because of the flexibility you have, it only notes you have to get all of the correct choices to be able to get the answer correct.

15
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,790
Any question about the quiz and the format?

16
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:43,759
So our plan for today, we will do a brief overview of our first and then you will complete an exercise comparing,

17
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,370
enhance and buffers of data and then you will have time to work on your group project.

18
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:58,010
If your group is ahead of the game and you feel that you've assigned different tasks to your group members and you are done,

19
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:07,570
I'll feel free to call it day. And for those who will like to stay for the entire class, time won't be here, so that's fine as well.

20
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,389
So the behavior risk factor surveillance system all buffers.

21
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:24,500
You hear people refer to the system as this other system in addition to enhance or recover.

22
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:33,710
And he is last week and we talked about NHANES having data that's supposed to be representative of the entire U.S. population.

23
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:42,740
And so when we talked about the sampling strategy, we talked about the first level, which is the treble level.

24
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:49,070
And from there we went to the first level where you have counties in the counties,

25
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:55,850
the metro uselessly like counties has to do with whether the county is a larger county, it is a larger county.

26
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:05,240
The probability of that county being selected is higher in some instances that will combine multiple small counties together.

27
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:12,110
And with that design you are able to get a sample that's representative of the entire U.S.

28
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:20,060
But if Michigan wanted to have similar data to to address public health needs in Michigan,

29
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:28,220
this information is not available. Using the enhanced system is based on the entire U.S. and there's no way to breaking up into companies.

30
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:36,170
And so versus fills in that gap where we're collecting similar information, different methodology,

31
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:45,740
but we're able to then look at states specific measures or state specific health outcomes that we may be interested in.

32
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:55,130
This program was established in 1984, and when we started there were 15 states that started in the program.

33
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,980
It became nationwide in 1993.

34
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:06,980
And and sometimes when we think about some of these programs, we think maybe as soon as is rolled out, all of the state audit companies will buy in.

35
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:15,630
But some of these things take time. And so there was a time frame between when the program started and when all of the

36
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:24,590
states became part of the program before us is conducted by the CDC and that NCR s NCR,

37
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:33,680
as is also under the CDC, is a separate branch preference is conducted by a separate group at the CDC.

38
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:42,430
And so this just shows a timeline between when the program was established and how things changed over time.

39
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:51,160
So the program was established in 1984 with 15 states starting the program by 1993.

40
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,890
It became nationwide. At that time, they were completing around 100,000 interviews.

41
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,920
And then 2005, they piloted the asthma callback survey.

42
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,139
And this is a survey where in those who complete the BARBARA survey,

43
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:14,260
if they are asked about questions about whether they have asthma or whether kids in the house have asthma,

44
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:20,260
then they will call them back to ask them to participate in this other program.

45
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,820
And then there was a point where with things changing, a lot of people had in cell phones,

46
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:38,170
it became clear that using landlines to contact people to participate in a survey will be excluding a major part of the population.

47
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:46,180
And if we're excluding a major part of the population, are those individuals different from those who are completing the survey?

48
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,940
And so when you work on your final project, when you're talking about maybe some of the limitations,

49
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,950
think about how those limitations may be impacting the sample.

50
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,060
It suggests because you're getting a lower response rate or because you're getting a

51
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:07,000
low response rate that's making your final sample different from the final population.

52
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:18,460
And with that, that's why you have a problem with your data being not representative or not having some amount of bias in your sample.

53
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,990
So when you were working on your final project, think about all of those components.

54
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:29,890
You may have to check outside either in the hall or one of the conference rooms to find the key.

55
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:39,340
And so based on the pilot survey about the incorporation of.

56
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:53,610
Ella. No, that's so based on the pilot survey surveying people with cell phones.

57
00:06:53,970 --> 00:07:01,020
They found that those who primarily had cell phones were different from those who had landlines.

58
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:11,730
And so this sample, using just individuals with landlines, wasn't quite representative of the group that it wanted the sample to be representative of.

59
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,120
And based on this, they decided after the results of the pilot cell phone survey came out,

60
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:25,140
that where we flew people using landlines and then also cell phones.

61
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:33,630
And so by 2011, they were conducting more than 500,000 interviews on these participants.

62
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:45,240
So pretty intensive, widespread coverage of people in the U.S. compared to before us where you were getting around 5000 participants per year.

63
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:57,640
And so the data are collected using stand court questions, rotating core questions, optional modules in a state, I'd have questions.

64
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:07,550
So for the stand up for questions, those questions must be asked every year by all states for a rotating year as every other year optional.

65
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:15,010
These are questions that are already designed by the CDC and they are standardized questions that are available.

66
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:23,350
And then what the states can opt in. And what I do want to ask those questions we are giving you or not in India are state either questions that

67
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:29,860
the states can develop if they have public health concerns that are not part of the optional modules,

68
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,980
they can use those questions for their local area.

69
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:41,850
And so these questions, they can reach out to the CDC to help them provide guidance about how to design.

70
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,250
The question is why these the additional questions to add to the survey.

71
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:53,709
And so this is a very interactive process with the local public health officials at the state level.

72
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:59,140
And those people are kind of acting with those at CDC to help standardize the

73
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:04,300
question and to standardize the methodology associated with the survey process.

74
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,990
And so think about how this is going to affect the data that results from the survey.

75
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:18,159
So for the no core question you are, you are going to be able to find these questions across all states.

76
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:27,639
So you're looking for data. You'll find data available for all states, not if it's a question that's from the optional module.

77
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,060
You might need to be mindful that you might find this for some of the states,

78
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,040
but you'll find it missing for some of the states and then for the state.

79
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,980
Either questions you have a similar situation where you might find a set of questions for a specific state,

80
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:47,470
but you won't find that same situation for other states.

81
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:57,010
So keep that in mind when you're looking for data on purpose, why some data points might be missing and why some might be available for all states.

82
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,080
And this is just an example showing the types of questions that are included in your core modules.

83
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:16,540
So they have information about health status, exercise, demographic information, seatbelt use, cancer screening.

84
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:25,160
Those are some of the topics covered in 2014 for modules and then for the optional module for 2014.

85
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:34,190
You can see how they are different. They are asking questions about sodium intake, influenza industry and occupation.

86
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,180
So different set of questions that are available in the optional module.

87
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,100
So it's not a repeat. And keep in mind are some of the questions that I asked.

88
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,520
Those questions are then used to create new variables.

89
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:58,340
And so because this survey is telephone based, this is totally different from any where participants are asked these questions in person.

90
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:06,380
They get a chance to do a medical exam. These questions are all self-reported based on what the participant is saying.

91
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:13,130
And so they do ask people, what's your BMI for the for survey?

92
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:19,430
They will ask them to provide information that they can then calculate BMI for participants.

93
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:25,729
And so some of the questions will not necessarily have a questionnaire asking you about your BMI,

94
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:30,140
but they have information and educate yourself, calculate a number of variables.

95
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:38,850
And so participation in birthers people 18 and older are asked to participate in the survey.

96
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:45,510
Remember, when you have people as young as six months and there's no upper limit for the age range?

97
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:53,640
There's no compensation. In any case, you have people able to get their test results.

98
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:58,160
They are able to get a visible for doctor and they are custom paid,

99
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:07,830
compensated for participating in whose purpose is just based on the telephone interviews and that's pretty much it.

100
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:16,230
Participants are selected based on Grantham teacher Darley is similar to and he.

101
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:27,930
This is not a simple random sample. There's a certain amount of a complex survey design that's used and because of that,

102
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:33,090
like we talk about and he's you have to use weights to analyze the data.

103
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,130
So this slide shows a comparison of the NHIS and first response rates.

104
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:51,800
You see we have here and then we have reference in his interview and then also the examination.

105
00:12:52,370 --> 00:13:03,290
And so what we see is that over time that the response rates are reducing for all of the surveys and components.

106
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,030
But for before us, the decrease is drastic.

107
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:14,140
And this is up to 2014. So you can imagine it's been around eight years.

108
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,510
So is possible is even lower than this.

109
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:25,280
And he's is doing a fairly decent job of keeping the response rates high.

110
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:31,910
But you can see it also exhibits a trend where it's going down over time.

111
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:40,550
And then we see that for reference. We have yearly estimates before and he's we have gaps.

112
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:49,860
Any thoughts about why this may be the case? That they are not matching up.

113
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,790
Anything specific about the design related to and he that may be leading to this.

114
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,209
So remember that he is a doe.

115
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,210
They are collecting around 5000 participants every year.

116
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:29,400
They're releasing the data in two year cycles. And because of that, so you have 1999 to 2000 has been one cycle, 2001 to 2002 as being another cycle.

117
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:37,230
And because of that, so you don't have data directly matching year by year across the two survey programs.

118
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:48,420
And then the continuous and he started in 1999. That's why you have no data matching the 1997 1998 periods.

119
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,970
Even though we do have enhanced data for this year, it just wasn't a continuous any.

120
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:03,730
And then just another look at the response rate, because here we're looking at an average.

121
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:12,250
But if you're looking at the response rate by state, for example, 2017 for select states.

122
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:17,590
So for Michigan, the landline response rates, you have around 50%.

123
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,190
Cell phones, you have around 44%.

124
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:30,250
And then for other places. So Illinois, you have 21.6% for landlines and then cell phone, you have 46%.

125
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,700
So you see that differences depending on which state you're looking at.

126
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:39,610
And then there are also differences, depending on whether you're looking at landlines or whether you're looking at cell phone.

127
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:49,840
And so a summary of and he is impervious. They are both complex designs.

128
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:58,600
These are very complex designs used to identify individuals who will be eligible to participate in the surveys.

129
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:07,360
They are both cross-sectional. So we are collecting data repeatedly, but we are collecting data on a different subset of the population.

130
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:14,890
For each survey they cover some of the same information, but we have to remember that the methodology is different.

131
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:20,220
And so when we think about the types of data that we can get,

132
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:29,110
even though BMI might be available in birth and it may be available, and hence we know we we have different methodology.

133
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:37,330
And the methodology will allow you to be more confident about which one will offer an advantage compared to the other survey.

134
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:44,800
In terms of differences in his includes children as young as six months.

135
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,710
There is no upper limit to the age for and his.

136
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:57,010
We have no state level data and so we are limited by how we came from public health using state law.

137
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:07,660
What you see in Haines for any analysis and he has in-person interviews, they have exams and they collect biological samples.

138
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,130
And so this is a huge advantage over breakfast.

139
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:20,710
But birth has its own advantages as well. But first is self-reported and enhanced offers compensation for people participating in the program.

140
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:28,750
Any question about NHANES but first or the comparison between the two programs?

141
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:44,400
And so the next part of our session today, you will work on an exercise comparing and hints and buffers data.

142
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:51,840
You can access the exercise of looking at the assignment page, or you can click on this link.

143
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:59,400
And then there's also a sass output that's posted on Exercise Suite page that you can use as well.

144
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,360
Remember that each group should upload a single document.

145
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:10,860
The goal release was to be able to quickly go to the assignments and see if there are any questions that are not correct.

146
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,679
And then I can highlight that in our next section. And so, hey, you.

147
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:24,300
And we'll go over what the SAS codes are for this exercise.

148
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:36,070
But we also have the SAS output that you can use. So most times we ask people to use virtual sites to have access to SAS virtual sites.

149
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:41,760
Almost never works when you have a class and everybody's accessing it at the same time.

150
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:52,620
And so choice to avoid that we have the output that you can use, but how you in is going to walk you through what the exercise is going to look like.

151
00:18:52,890 --> 00:19:01,480
If you're doing it in SAS, if you have slides on your computer or your own time, you want to use virtual sites, that's fine.

152
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,910
If you have any questions with the exercise, please feel free to reach out to us.

153
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:11,790
But in the meantime, to be able to get you going, there's the SAS upload on the assignment page.

154
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:23,720
So. Are you ready? Right.

155
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:30,370
Are you going to keep, I think, the person that's going to let them do things.

156
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,740
Okay. And so that's my main.

157
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,210
One aspect that you use for a purpose and you don't want that for that.

158
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:50,290
So you can go ahead and get started on the first component and then when you in is ready, you want your attention to start on the right, right.

159
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:56,240
So number one, by far, we can just kind of go over what we do here and then it's going to take some time

160
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,650
for you to download and then for that to be all combined and everything on site.

161
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,740
And so before that, working on South, let's just work on number one.

162
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:16,490
And so you basically just Google surface and then go to and I want to finish this note.

163
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,910
I don't think so. Doing it. Okay. Can you.

164
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:34,730
Yeah. For you in the back. Okay. So then prevalence data and data analysis tools and then go to the trends data and then request data for each year.

165
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,780
So let me remind myself what I did before.

166
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:55,460
It's all states, D.C. territories. And then all available years.

167
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,899
And also we're looking into the opiate prevalence of obesity data.

168
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:25,820
So we're going to hear a great obesity. My categories and then from the questionnaires from 1999 to 2012.

169
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,040
So we're going to go to 1999. Go.

170
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,510
Okay. So we're trying to remember.

171
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,470
With me out of here. Oh, yeah.

172
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,440
Can you just remind me what I do from here? That's.

173
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:15,060
We looking at? Yeah. We're for download.

174
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:25,180
Each year we select 99 think we should be looking at back.

175
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,350
It's one. Yeah.

176
00:22:43,690 --> 00:23:00,670
Oh. Yeah.

177
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:07,240
And. Yeah. Yeah.

178
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,040
So we have obese level weight. So.

179
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,860
Well, I thought there's actually a way to get everything.

180
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:30,739
So we're making. So maybe they're supposed to just keep going.

181
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,640
Because I thought when I got like, oh, no, no, you know, for this.

182
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,290
No, you had to do it for a year. Oh, okay. So you do you come back.

183
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:49,690
Got it. Okay. So basically just keep going from 1999 here and then you write down out of these three numbers,

184
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:57,099
which one do you think is the the obesity prevalence, which is in percentages?

185
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:05,350
And so it's going to be this number here. And so just keep going to 2000 and so on and so forth.

186
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:08,470
So yeah, go work on that.

187
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:41,420
Oh. I can't think.

188
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,340
And the number of uninsured has been.

189
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:27,910
I think get. Audiences.

190
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:35,610
Well there. Yeah.

191
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,090
I don't know. Yeah, I don't know.

192
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:47,160
Yeah. But the problem.

193
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:56,810
Go. You're.

194
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,690
And. No, you're not.

195
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:24,700
That right? All right.

196
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:32,400
Do you want to be sure of the.

197
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:39,680
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Oh, right.

198
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:43,440
Yeah. Yeah.

199
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:55,270
Yeah. I was thinking.

200
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:22,590
Could you please? We have a lot of fun.

201
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:48,990
Oh. That means one thing that they're creating together is that.

202
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:08,660
I have. Or do you have the.

203
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:19,670
So I suppose I can I like work on a cure because if I try to go and drive, I try to lock you out of everything.

204
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,960
So. Okay, if you. Yeah.

205
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,450
Hopefully they're recorded. Something like this.
