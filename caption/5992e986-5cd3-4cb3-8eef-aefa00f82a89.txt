1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:10,210
Just like I also like I felt like I should do something about these questions, like talking to my students.

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:23,819
I will get a shot. I'm going to say something pretty personally, but I it's harder to find people, find out who's really good.

3
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:33,480
And honestly, I was just like, yeah, I guess like, definitely.

4
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:43,410
Do you think it will happen? I'm going to keep asking about all this.

5
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:52,980
I have no Myanmar accreditation. I'm asking, like, if it's cool weakness, I'm going to attend college.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,660
So I'm going to start today.

7
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,170
No, that's Thursday. Yeah.

8
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,540
Yeah. So he's going to have for people that entitled rights out of class.

9
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:18,280
Dawn It's going to be great. But no school must be like, Hey, but it's just an email asking people out to mingle with you alone.

10
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,450
Hello? No, no, I'm so. I'm all that.

11
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:29,400
I'm just not sure if I need backup.

12
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:37,559
Am I going in Miami traffic? I was initially ranking like my emotional intelligence was higher and I talked.

13
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,250
I said, but not as high as yours. But I realized I didn't have enough space to. But it's deleted.

14
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,730
How many of those? Yeah. No, I'm not sure why I said that.

15
00:01:48,360 --> 00:02:01,290
Context is not helpful, is not accurate assessment if you have different kind of PR secrets are just too much.

16
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:28,080
It's just like comical. It's just like, oh, oh, oh, that's like paragraph a half hour and myself wanted to tell you like that.

17
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,740
That's a great question. Here we are.

18
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:37,260
What do you think this whole point is? It's 128.

19
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:45,260
No, we can keep you updated.

20
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:08,760
Capacity. I think it's doing duty.

21
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:26,450
To look at the situation in Syria.

22
00:03:49,230 --> 00:04:02,110
At some point, you're going to call you to do, like an apartment.

23
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:24,820
Okay. I just wanted to say thank you so much for sharing that.

24
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,540
I want to do a show for you.

25
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,550
That's why I was on my way here.

26
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:45,030
I also would like to debate about some clothes stuff.

27
00:04:47,760 --> 00:05:01,890
I just think that it's accessible and so it would make sense to heat it up.

28
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:51,320
I forgot to say, you know, discussing the chocolates, but I wouldn't be making a reflection or recording in progress to make any sense.

29
00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:01,130
Yeah, well, that's just teacher.

30
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:11,500
She's out of town. She's approach to the world issue, which is actually looking at candidates.

31
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:24,610
Canada know because I was thinking what it was like her legacy or public purpose to go here.

32
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:35,950
It really speaks to such times over there.

33
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:46,960
And I just spoke to St Margaret's and, you know, that poster made a lot of people like,

34
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:57,910
you know, just hang in there to find out are the ones that she's.

35
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:08,520
I think that was such a direct link. People see it every day until it was like, well, I know.

36
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:15,130
It's like, okay, good morning, everybody.

37
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,930
And then we're going to continue working on homework number three.

38
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:26,620
And then you have some idea of what we want.

39
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:38,770
And so, first of all, the queen is due to in so you have until midnight to go and then it will be closed.

40
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:47,620
And the idea is there are going to be five answers.

41
00:07:47,830 --> 00:08:03,730
So the with each one is too important for so many countries and then in the end is really getting to know them in person.

42
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:17,100
The person who and first I'm on all day entries so meetings and then I look at the ones that are 80 or above and great, right?

43
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:24,910
So you kind of miss one. What is to be qualified on those?

44
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,180
And we're not selling the highest grade any.

45
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:37,070
And if there's a guy in England selling, they are the one that got some needed first aid.

46
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:44,170
And that person will get a ten, ten points on the.

47
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:53,240
Meet their mates now, which is a big deal. I mean, suppose that we got a 990 index now, then you automatically get it.

48
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:08,060
I think if you get a 95 and get some you're going to on to, you can read that.

49
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:15,530
So that just like the extra credit, I mean, do it, but it doesn't count towards your grade.

50
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:23,269
But unless he goes at the so if you do if you do it an issue around it doesn't do anything to you.

51
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,690
It does nothing. You only one gets the ten points.

52
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,690
Only one person gets the ten points. Only one person get the.

53
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:41,620
That's get that nobody gets any mark off bodies.

54
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,540
It's a good exercise. Try it.

55
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:52,590
There are two questions related to forecasting and all questions related about problem.

56
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:04,360
So understanding problems and putting them in a algebraic format that you can solve.

57
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:11,840
So that's part of what the class is, just breathing problems and try to formulate models with that.

58
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,950
All right. So let's continue our conversation over number three.

59
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:29,130
And we were dealing we're working on 11.10 and we were.

60
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:38,530
Working on that. Let me go for me. I want.

61
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,420
So where do you live in 2010?

62
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,560
And so we did for integration in two ways.

63
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:02,460
One, we use over two very visual minimizing data they emit, see.

64
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:16,420
And the second time we use their regression tools in Excel and we feed into that in both a linear train and equip narrative trend.

65
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:24,310
And we develop forecast use of the linear dynamic without the threat right now.

66
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:32,030
So we went through the concept of the concept of FAS, where they ask,

67
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:37,780
where is the proportion of the total variation that is explained by the regulation.

68
00:11:38,230 --> 00:12:04,750
So they are two seen things, right? So. So if you remember what we are doing is is is getting these built up variation is equal to.

69
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,510
Trend or regression variation rate.

70
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:19,280
Progression function. Variation loss.

71
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:32,030
And or. So the idea is that we want to explain as much as we can.

72
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:38,690
And I think that the ability that diversity, the very wealthy means that why are all these problems the same?

73
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:48,020
Right. And then we we we think that we can explain bottle B with that connection function.

74
00:12:48,020 --> 00:13:00,700
So that's important. We can be like so it's not going to be totally the same number in the time series because that Time series has said,

75
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,960
you know, there's a function of time that I can predict.

76
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:13,040
So that's the regression function variation. So these, these they increase in line.

77
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:23,550
But this is not going to explain totally what's happening because there's on top of that regression function, you have error.

78
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:29,210
So why not the distance from these points to the regression line?

79
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,059
Right. And that's what we call their variation. And we cannot predict.

80
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:43,880
And what we want to accomplish with the regression function is to make these or hopefully these explain more so they don't apply here.

81
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:49,790
Okay. So I'm basically just remaining and we hope that's going to be is mom.

82
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,629
And therefore, if that happens, then what happen is if that happens,

83
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:06,170
then you will be able to work very effectively with the regression program because it's going to be pretty much all right.

84
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:23,330
So what we do with the R-squared is we take the regression function variation divided by the total motivation.

85
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:36,990
That's what we call the Irish squared. Irish squared. So that's the the proportion of the total variation that is explained by the regulation.

86
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:44,850
So those are the areas where you have the Irish Square equal to 100% in the Irish.

87
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:51,120
What is one that means that these two numbers are the same in terms of radiation and the

88
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:59,220
regulation and they and therefore everybody of any zero error rate of radiation is zero.

89
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:03,240
I mean it perfect fit, right? That's the best you've got.

90
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:16,920
So you can predict exactly what's going to happen. Well, on the other hand, if you know this is a regression function, if there is a way zero,

91
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:23,650
which is available as it can be, it means that the regulation function is not explaining anything on the radiation.

92
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,230
Right. So. All right.

93
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:39,590
So that's what we wear. And then we said how to compare compared to models that have an increasing number and the trend on the recall variable.

94
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:51,270
So one, you know, includes all the variables and they only have, but then we have one and four variables and that is.

95
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:56,100
So the question is, should we we look at the R Square.

96
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:06,990
So here is point to the square, here is point 95 and you say, well, this is the the weather.

97
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:15,780
I think the weather I think function is explaining more of the total variation, like the higher proportion, 85%.

98
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:27,720
But you shouldn't just rely on the R to compare two different regressions in this case,

99
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:37,320
because the more variables you have in a native regression function, the higher the displacement is.

100
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:43,000
No matter what you can get, the highest point cannot go down right there as well.

101
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:52,559
Why would you go lower, stay the same? And sometimes just because of randomness, it will go up and down.

102
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,870
You don't want to put a lot of garbage in there in your regression function.

103
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:03,010
Trying to explain the variability when it doesn't do anything is just by random.

104
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:09,750
By some random fluke. You get a better R squared, right, and that you are bound to get.

105
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:23,330
So what we have is a balance measure called the adjusted squared and the of squared takes into account the increase in fit.

106
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:33,030
The increase in explanatory empowered increased in in explanation of variability but also the increasing complexity of the model.

107
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:41,240
So complexity is explained in the explanations.

108
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,730
As opposed to 24 during those days when complexity.

109
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:56,379
Up means fewer points for Diego said.

110
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,870
That is where some of the increase is the point of square.

111
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:06,520
So if you have an regression function one.

112
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:20,330
That's how far, you know, they followed. And then it was, say, x, y and and X two and three.

113
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:30,870
Right. And and you have they're going to see that because has x1x2.

114
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,750
Yes. Yes, I know. Loves them. Yes, there is one.

115
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:51,690
It's two and three. And it's for real.

116
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:59,830
So this one is going to definitely have a higher R-squared.

117
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:09,650
And, you know, it cannot go in the hours where it cannot increase from 20 times a year because he had more variables.

118
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:19,940
There most is in it. You know, the worst thing can happen is that the square is the same because it seems these export to be,

119
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:27,680
you know, not important but sometimes just these X4 might be not important just by randomness.

120
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,180
But you said from through your R-squared, you know, goes over here.

121
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,030
Right. And if that happened, you might say, oh, yeah, it this is better because this is plainmoor.

122
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,530
But at the same time, you have a more complicated equation.

123
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,360
So explain more because they are squaring both.

124
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:57,620
So that's, you know, positive. But the equation is much more complicated because we have more variables than that played out.

125
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:04,780
So they are just the Times Square is that the item is between the two and then are using Tahrir Square and then can go down.

126
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:12,700
And if you can use it at this point, it can go down. Then that variable extra that you pull it is not worth having deterioration.

127
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:23,659
Very important. Right. So let's take a look at the I used it a square being this first that just a square

128
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:33,770
is point 91 and this is in the second and just in Times Square is point 94.

129
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:41,620
Right. So the second equation, the quadratic equation has a greater than yesterday's square.

130
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:52,400
And then therefore we're going up to four times, which you start with with a with the one that just the which is the quadratic progression.

131
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,960
And we said we can use the forecast of the R here.

132
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,830
So those are the forecast that we are going to rely on.

133
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:07,790
These are going to be our forecast for period 21 and 22 and those are going to be this one.

134
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:16,700
Right. Even though, you know, the answer requires you to give or forecast,

135
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:26,110
if you are going to forecast for real, you will use these these two objects in the lower one.

136
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:33,050
These ones are not going to be, you know, when I use that,

137
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:40,390
because those correspond to the linear three in five so that we know that the corresponding

138
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:46,760
trend and we're not going to use it going to show you what a regression function.

139
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:53,350
So this is how we normally. Right.

140
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:58,880
So that's that's what we did last night. And it was.

141
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:09,400
All right. So let's not waste your time into saving lives.

142
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,810
And we are going to now go to Rob Island.

143
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:28,900
1129 because 1111 1113 are exponential is moving and all.

144
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:38,270
And then you know how. Let's practice one more regulation and 1129.

145
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:47,749
If I open. The problems here.

146
00:22:47,750 --> 00:23:08,870
1129. We are going to use health claim data and we are going to use the regulation to see whether I think the trend models or the data set,

147
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:17,720
what is the estimated regression function compared yet deals with areas where value for this model to that of the linear trend model.

148
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:27,620
What is implied by that in a comparison, prepare a line graph comparing these what I think trend for these you say in your data, so on, so forth.

149
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,280
So if we are going to repeat what we did with the day other,

150
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:43,360
the problem 1119 I think would be and so we are going to do the linear trend because they ask us to,

151
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:49,819
to compare that with a linear train, then we're going to do the quadratic train and, and so on.

152
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:55,250
But at the end we are going to compute loads of multiplicative seasonal indices.

153
00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:03,430
So let's, let's go for this. So health claims going to be.

154
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:26,920
We flew in to. You're telling me that I'm going to download you?

155
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:32,750
I'm going to just copy the data. The data here.

156
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,780
Little chrome is very soapy.

157
00:24:53,800 --> 00:25:00,770
Lovely. And the. Probably 1129.

158
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:20,030
Long Beach is. Rebirthing them to.

159
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:32,030
Otitis media. The first thing we're going to do is we're going to load the data and see how we looked.

160
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,620
So we're going to look through the kind of theory of claims.

161
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:43,800
So this is going to be and to.

162
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:55,920
The idea first and then the love these by and go into insurgent.

163
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:05,370
It's why these are going to be my.

164
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:14,479
The plot I am choosing on it.

165
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:27,720
You see, those are the health claims for a period of 24 months and it is going from it.

166
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:35,660
You see it goes from 10,000 and then goes up and then it goes down the slope and then down the slope.

167
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:41,270
So there seem to be not only ten, right,

168
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:51,620
but this also looks like there is some three of these sitting here some cycles, only some seasonality in the in India.

169
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:58,160
So we are going to try to forecast we're going to try to produce a forecast and thinking about the growing trend,

170
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,910
we're also the seasonality, the data.

171
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:07,430
And we want to, you know, figured out how the seasonality goes.

172
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:18,350
Eyeballing the seasonality, one thing that you can do very quickly is right click on these data and fill out in timeline.

173
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,050
There's a timeline that is linear and you see how it's going, right?

174
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:35,630
You see that that line going on. So I'm going to send their line and this is one that we are going to estimate right now.

175
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,950
We could have just done that with Excel.

176
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:46,330
The money that we we're not going to see around one that they might lose like they are square and the media.

177
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:54,090
So I am going to first produce the linear trend so each time.

178
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:05,870
In. He's lying.

179
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:12,050
I want to make sure that the rest of the labels.

180
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,460
So I'm going to wrap the next.

181
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:24,030
And we have the. Right. And the.

182
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,010
You. You can immediately way.

183
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:44,030
Okay. So we have that linear trend and so we are ready to use our regression function as we did before as and maybe to the R&D.

184
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:47,490
And I'm going to go in beta now. It is.

185
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:58,410
And then I'm going to go into regression. A.

186
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:07,430
And then I am going to highlight the way range is claims, right?

187
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:22,040
So I'm going to throw in claims here to throw in and then Andrew and for me to shift and just keep on the last number here.

188
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:35,180
And so that's my that's my way to still be in this sale drawn here.

189
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,770
I narrow it down.

190
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:45,320
Do 24. And then the output range.

191
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:53,240
Oh, I need to say that my series label version has labels so you understand the first line.

192
00:29:53,990 --> 00:30:06,890
First row is is things that not number and then the output range and the output range those people describe is what it is bringing them on.

193
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:12,770
And people think that's what we have.

194
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:19,620
So we have is that the intercept is 11 six things.

195
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:30,650
One points to the side media so they can control the problems from one thing into the next is to 55.7.

196
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:42,650
So they they on average the claims grow to 55 to 55 claims per month.

197
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,940
Right. That's, that's what is implied.

198
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:53,180
So let's actually develop our linear plan.

199
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:59,270
You show sorry, could you show the Y, the X and Y range and function?

200
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:05,060
Sure. So you mean integration?

201
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:12,080
So just like for you. You could choose somewhere to go.

202
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:21,620
Yeah, but it's like, so small. I can't. I mean, median in the city is like, okay.

203
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:33,530
It says wide ranges from the two to the 26, not just once on the X ranges from a C to 26.

204
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:38,940
Okay. Thank you. You.

205
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:53,740
Right. Is not something you love to.

206
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:10,160
I really. It's just the same problem.

207
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:21,140
Okay, so now let's. Let's let's start right there, the equation here.

208
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,230
So what is the linear regression function?

209
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:36,050
So if I have to say, if I have to write a function for the claims, I would say claims is equal to.

210
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:46,010
The going to claims. Equal to what?

211
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:56,470
Interpret. Give me the formula with numbers 111.

212
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:17,800
66166. So can you give me the formula?

213
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,680
You do an intercept of 11, six, six, one and then you add the period times time.

214
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:40,280
So 11, 6x1. So you say the claims is equal to 1161.

215
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:53,610
Los Altos, what? Two, five, five times to two, five, five times the.

216
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:04,120
Got the regression function right. So if you haven't been on D, then you know you can become pretty clean.

217
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:09,130
So claims of is equal back to that.

218
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,700
That's this function. So now we know all the regression function.

219
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:20,480
So let me just write that formula and then it is equal to.

220
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,240
The Road to the intercept here.

221
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:37,610
And then I'm sure for us is going to be slow here, transformation forward.

222
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,930
And then I'm going to multiply that times 15, right?

223
00:34:46,110 --> 00:35:06,330
And then I get 11 916.2, I will choose a flight code view that brings me to the formula and I'm going to just copy the format.

224
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:16,590
So. Maybe even in different corners that we can know.

225
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:22,650
So this is this is our linear trend right then and how we look.

226
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:30,750
So less so is going into long periods any.

227
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:41,800
And then they can do all these numbers to do their thing.

228
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:48,160
That's fine. And then, girl, she's an arrow.

229
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:55,240
They want to hear the last one, even though there's nothing in.

230
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:04,160
And then I'm going to ride clean and healthy and I'm going to activate the grab.

231
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,340
I want to move a special room.

232
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,740
These are going to be new series in photos names in the first row.

233
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:33,330
The X values in the first quarter. So now we have our linear trend and things you want to forecast with this linear trend in TV.

234
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:47,290
Simply just hoping this formula is just a function of time results and it will be the formula.

235
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:55,359
Then you see that you extrapolated your your forecast and you extrapolated that line.

236
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:03,790
And those are your forecasts for the period 26 to 39 or 25 to 30.

237
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:13,140
But you see that we are not going to be right on the money because these times is is likely to fall.

238
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:17,590
I mean, given that they just need a year or two here.

239
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:29,530
So we are picking up. You're saying now that we need all of the serious in the mean trend of the serious point is fluctuations that are not noise.

240
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:36,520
So say things that we can explain is not is not nearly so we are going to try to incorporate that into the regression.

241
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:40,550
And what we have seen is this often done right.

242
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:50,560
So we can we can forecast up to here and they will be fine but may not be totally accurate.

243
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:56,600
And today, you see the square is not that great.

244
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:01,930
Forecast here, is this the best that we can do for the is what is 0.5.

245
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:07,960
That means that 50% of the liabilities and separate is as played by the growing trend.

246
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:17,740
You know, 50% is noise and something else. So we don't have a good model on that.

247
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,360
So we saw the before that was 95%.

248
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,800
Then it is explained by the trend, but this is just 50%.

249
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:36,310
So we might not be doing quite well, but we need to compare that to see if we can do better with a quadratic function.

250
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:46,810
We using will be, you know, with a quadratic trend using one to better look at this via polling is.

251
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,360
Yes. Could be. Yeah. Could be.

252
00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:03,950
No. You know, it's not. It's not obvious to me, like, because I don't see any of your furniture on the train.

253
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,160
So we have to. We have to check.

254
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,970
So let's do that. Let's go into our bracket.

255
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:27,170
Three. And.

256
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:38,510
Who would want to leave to do these? I do. And learned recreation.

257
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,390
So it was the first thing I did try and what what's the first thing I need to.

258
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,970
Clear the period. Okay.

259
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:59,880
So I'm going to give you the opportunity to use the available quadratic terrain right now in your computer and show me that you can do that.

260
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:13,860
What, what? What what are the steps? So remember, for a quadratic trend, you want some formula that goes claims.

261
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,320
You seem to be evolving.

262
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:25,999
Whenever we found that interesting. Whatever. I understand it.

263
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:35,840
It must be one. I mean, he knows Liberty and Justice Square.

264
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:43,680
So you need to find these coefficients.

265
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:48,680
The non one and the two and.

266
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:54,710
So the question is, how can you just it.

267
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:12,330
So you know that the constant is the constant. So you don't need to put anything here in the regression.

268
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:16,570
You need that. And he is a period of time.

269
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:26,230
What about squaring? What?

270
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:34,740
What did we do this time? I didn't.

271
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:45,630
And so we added a column, writes the column.

272
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:51,180
We both did not really do all that egregious work ahead.

273
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:58,300
How would you do that? So you describe your time and.

274
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:21,500
So we've highlighted the Rite Aid claims and then I guess I write teeth and inserted some of these moderate amounts.

275
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:29,719
So answer the call because because they're aggressors, they're independent variables.

276
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:35,090
PTSD is where it needs to be continuous. We need to be engaged in this war.

277
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:55,940
And then I'm going to raise period two they were right to do and in the script of that last one and so we have 80

278
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:06,290
MP squared plus our computer and so the is going to be the area it is where is going to be the median square.

279
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:13,460
And now we can do a number. We can do it on the regression.

280
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:25,410
What we are going to do that by going into the data.

281
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:34,190
And we will do the analysis regression.

282
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,890
Well, since I'm not in the right place anymore. So.

283
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,880
In the right place. In the right place.

284
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:57,280
So let's start with the wide range, the wide range, the same claims range.

285
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:08,890
But in the now they are they move one column. So I needed to do this and then I go up to 26.

286
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:16,750
So is the first wide range you says for update from E2 to E 26.

287
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:24,400
Now the X range includes the period and the period squared.

288
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:32,030
So these two. Look to me.

289
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:37,700
You look to continue 24, right?

290
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:46,380
And then it reads in the X range reads now see to be 26.

291
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:59,700
The series says labels so they first put their first all and those are labels there and the output range.

292
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,700
I am going to place that for innovation. We know that linear regression.

293
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,450
So when place that for me is going to be 59.

294
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:14,190
I think I said this is right.

295
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:28,770
And then now I have the intercept, this one 1754 that in at the time is 233 and the square is point 86.

296
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:33,500
So there is more curvature.

297
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:41,060
That is. That is. Specify the here and there, but let's see if it's worth it.

298
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:51,120
So let's. If is worth. So the idea was to Die Square for the first one with 2046.

299
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:59,640
And then close to that is where, you know, that's not to say that just the Tahrir Square was 148 here.

300
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:07,720
Okay. And they are just attorneys waiting for the second one.

301
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:16,030
Or. 146.

302
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:21,790
So which one has a high is an ideal scenario square.

303
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:27,470
What's the highest underutilized one daily.

304
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:35,340
And. The first one has a point 48 versus the second 1.45.

305
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:45,400
So it's not worth it to have a drastic trend in this equation because it's complicated more than what is helping.

306
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,910
But that's that's that's the bottom line.

307
00:46:49,510 --> 00:47:02,890
And so if you see they are square, they are split on the first one is point five or six, and the second one is pretty much the same, 5.5 or 6.7.

308
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:12,700
So this is only five or six, four, five, and this is one five, four, six, six, seven.

309
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:22,240
So this is minuscule a minuscule improvement in explanation, but in more complicated form worth.

310
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:33,570
Right. So if you had to do this for real rate, you would then you stop by the linear trend and say it's not worth complicating this linear one.

311
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:41,640
Now, the issue is that, you know,

312
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:47,820
the problem in the book asked you to say whether I'm being threatened just to frighten you, whether that be threatened.

313
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:55,690
But I mean, in practice, actually, for if you were to do that,

314
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:11,800
for consulting or for any type of work with any useful PR training in that seasonality, let's go back and see what our.

315
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:24,520
We have the element when the mask and whatnot,

316
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:30,180
the estimated regression function compounded concerning adjusted that is where value for this model

317
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,750
that of the linear training model what is implied by these comparisons that trend is better.

318
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:48,840
So for 29 be there. You're saying that because the adjusted R value for the ten year trend is higher than that one will be more.

319
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:54,419
That model would be more accurate. No is not more accurate, but is pretty fair.

320
00:48:54,420 --> 00:49:07,800
And it is pretty fair because the it's less complicated to, you know, to use a linear trend function than Dave, whether I think that's right.

321
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:15,800
So you want the parsimonious models to work so as much as possible that give you the same accuracy.

322
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:23,540
So what we're saying is that it was I think trend is not adding any accuracy in these deals, making, you know, more complex than long.

323
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:35,250
So that's why they are idiosyncratic. So, you know, the more and this is this is this is the issue.

324
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:49,560
If you have long ago if you have a model that is parsimonious, that means this long and thinks, well, we have the, you know,

325
00:49:49,560 --> 00:50:01,470
the best the best R squared you can get is more likely that that model will continue to be forecasting well in a few periods into the future.

326
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:13,470
If you have variables that do not mean anything to the model and they get into the equation, they are not adding up to that point anything.

327
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:24,179
But you can try to put values into the future because those values can affect your forecasting in predictable

328
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:29,040
ways because they were not they actually were not explaining anything that was not been reported.

329
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:35,669
And you can say, okay, I am going to explain.

330
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:49,560
I'm going to try to explain the number of forecast, the number of houses that are going to be spilled in an hour were based on the economy,

331
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:58,920
employment, number of people moving to an hour were, you know, a lot of sensible data that you lose.

332
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:10,380
And then I'm going to add in the size of the plant cap devastation, the size of the workout routines, training, anything, right?

333
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:18,599
But if you do it regression and you say just a sensible radius first and then you

334
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:24,600
add another regime that says that with the size or with the size of the plant cap,

335
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,740
your Time Square is never going to go down. It's going to go up.

336
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:35,820
Right? So it's going to either stay the same or going to go up it just by running.

337
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,600
And you say, okay, that is what is better. I'm going to use it.

338
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:48,630
And then you start using that. I mean, you can get your numbers to forecast that the number of houses are going to start in an hour.

339
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:54,719
And then you put, for example, the size of the pool of capital that increased dramatically.

340
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:02,549
So you put in your number, right? And then maybe that it goes into a cubic ratio or something like that and then

341
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:07,770
just totally is going on your fault that because it wasn't doing anything,

342
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:14,340
because it doesn't have explanatory power that nobody goes through.

343
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:21,780
And so therefore you can get very, very weird results.

344
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:31,520
So it's better again to use this more forecasting model that, you know,

345
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:38,340
parsimonious where you can actually understand what, what things are doing that you're doing.

346
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:46,710
So which means use the one with the highest adjusted R-squared.

347
00:52:54,240 --> 00:53:01,800
So the size of this I cab, you know, if you put it in the ideal scenario square it's going to increase dramatically.

348
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:14,610
All right. So, Alex.

349
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:19,200
So compare prepared land grab.

350
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,650
We're Internet users very square.

351
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:37,479
What is implied by this comparison better to right and then very long graph comparing the quadratic trend predictions against the economic data.

352
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:42,650
So now they say okay now you know, is this a linear trend, but let's continue with it.

353
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:48,850
Okay. So but remember, in this model, if you want to forecast,

354
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:57,540
it's better to use just a linear and then because the line graph concurrently with our inflation data.

355
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:05,190
So let's do that. So let's go into the weather.

356
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:13,710
I think it's rain and the wind is not.

357
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:22,490
And then I mentioned four laws in one.

358
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:34,590
And I think more times he would use the PDA.

359
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:50,540
Last. We do know four times she is with.

360
00:54:54,790 --> 00:55:00,130
I was going to be the former.

361
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,150
And. And I.

362
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:22,150
And that's that's going to be so I think what these are going to be my weather forecast and in this case,

363
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:35,160
what I'm going to do is I'm going to close the what I think trend you can see looks like and is going to be, you know,

364
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:39,930
given the similarity of the eyes where the weather,

365
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:49,210
I think the trend on the leading edge are going to be overlapping pretty much until we get into the in forecast that that's important to them,

366
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:55,510
it's going to probably look a little different. There was.

367
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:15,050
Or would be. We have unique.

368
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:30,650
Without the need. Okay.

369
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:37,680
And I'm going to. Activate the graph.

370
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:45,510
Is based on. Are you serious economy?

371
00:56:47,400 --> 00:57:12,450
It's values. That gray line is not right, which is overlapping in the linear trend and if you want to from cash are the same in every one.

372
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:32,330
And. So we need an.

373
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:49,800
Go and activate the so now that I am going to activate link up and move to.

374
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:56,260
Like data to date.

375
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:00,830
What that I think is really a trend is this one.

376
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:09,250
End it, and I'm going to try to believe it.

377
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:36,960
Right. So we can remove which.

378
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:46,050
Right. So this this is a straight line, but it's a pretty flat line.

379
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:53,820
That's why it doesn't make sense to wonder what's going to be there, because it's pretty much straight unless Alaska.

380
00:58:54,450 --> 00:59:05,069
All right. So so now we know what what the quadratic function is and that function is going to be in.

381
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:08,730
I'm going to insert a text box.

382
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:24,230
Can you kind of drive sales at the time he opened those claims?

383
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:32,320
And. Is equal to.

384
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:42,020
1117. 11,755.

385
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:48,780
Grievances among them in South Australia. So many people might.

386
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:56,080
Yeah. Close.

387
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:19,610
Two or three times the vineyard. Those.

388
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:31,980
0.8866.

389
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:40,320
0.66 times.

390
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,390
Ether is significantly down and various weight.

391
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:12,180
So that's the that's the regulation function. Right.

392
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:19,030
And then what we are going to do now is figure out if we can do better just right.

393
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:23,190
So this this time series is an up and down, up and down.

394
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:26,670
And we are forecasting the straight line up.

395
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:37,640
So we are capturing that trend. We're capturing that tendency to grow, but we are not going to be able to forecast very accurately.

396
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:40,020
And in fact, you know,

397
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:57,570
this is just 50% of the equation is either within 50% of the total variability just simply by the equation here in the regression.

398
01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:03,960
So let's see. Our next question.

399
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,940
So we did the forecast and now he says,

400
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:19,750
so we have to do more because we at here calculate multiplicative seasonal in the

401
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:24,490
search for each month using their results and they want that in train model.

402
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:31,480
Use the seasonal indices to compute seasonal forecasts for each of the first six months of 2006.

403
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:37,510
Okay, so let's do that. What are multiplicative seasonal indices.

404
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:46,630
So our assumption is that the.

405
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:53,500
Go to this part of this graph here.

406
01:02:53,510 --> 01:03:07,480
So I'm going to imagine it's I'm a series that goes 93, something like that.

407
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,800
And you see that the seniors have been buddies also have always gone down.

408
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:15,310
Right. So the trend of this series is something like this.

409
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:36,640
But I know that that every so often I say this is you know, let's say these is these are quarters and this is what, a one, two, three.

410
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:44,950
What for? Like for something like.

411
01:03:47,620 --> 01:04:09,710
What a story. And in his time what it 140 to be or what a one year movie was three and four year if the.

412
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:15,920
One. One, two, three, four.

413
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:21,649
So. So what? I did not this is let's let's take what is true.

414
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:29,990
For example, quarter two is both the trend line in in the first year.

415
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:39,590
What it do is above the things the trend line in the second year, what had to be the trend line in the third year.

416
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:45,110
And my hypothesis is that this is going to be above the trend line by the same

417
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:52,720
proportion and going to be 50% over time or 30% or 20% about within three months.

418
01:04:53,780 --> 01:05:10,100
And so my my hypothesis is that this seasonality, if you have a cycle that repeats that medians within this cycle are affected by the same proportion,

419
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:20,390
then from, you know, cycle to cycle the periods with or buy in year to year, i.e. they came to then came back.

420
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:26,780
So there are periods within a cycle that behave the same is what I'm trying to say.

421
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:35,450
It could be in a year that longs behave the same, like the flu season, for example.

422
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:42,530
They are, you know, part of the year. They have more cases of the flu than other.

423
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:46,630
But in general, they may be flu cases.

424
01:05:46,640 --> 01:06:03,080
It might be going up or down. The idea is that we want to first identify what is the cycle can be a year, it can be they can whatever.

425
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:09,950
And then we need to identify the opinions within the year in which it will within

426
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:17,910
this big cycle in which they they are going to repeat the company month every,

427
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:23,329
you know, every January differently than in February or coming quarters.

428
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:30,250
Every quarter of the year, you know, each quarter one behave differently than what I do every year.

429
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:38,480
So and once we do that, then what we want to estimate is how much they differ from each other.

430
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:46,370
So how much we're going to try to make the hypothesis that they all are affected.

431
01:06:46,370 --> 01:07:00,380
The similar periods are affected in the same way, and they exhibit the observations in the same proportion above or below the frame.

432
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:14,190
Okay. So what we are going to do now is figure out how much above or below the trend line we have in in our model.

433
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:17,730
So right now. Right.

434
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:23,590
So we have the moms. Is our hypothesis the thing?

435
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:35,530
The claims are verified more. We have been, you know, broken on the theory that my mom thought we have two years like 2004 and 2006.

436
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:48,760
And we the hypothesis is that in moms one, the the observation is above a certain proportion of the,

437
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:57,900
you know, is, is above or below a certain proportion, you know, over below the trend.

438
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:02,140
I think this case is going to be the quadratic trend because that's the one we are using.

439
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:08,230
So we are going to compute that. We're going to compute that proportion of over over the trend.

440
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:19,360
So for God, we're going to create a column that cause this called claims divided by whatever I think.

441
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:42,620
Debate about whether I think, oh, so once any harm claims will be threatened, we're going to continue that.

442
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:47,960
So this is going to be my claims history and I'm going to divide that diplomatic training.

443
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:57,650
I want to extend this.

444
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:04,460
He's right here.

445
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:18,410
Little complaints. And let me just make this two decimals in your format until this month so it's not.

446
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:46,470
Clouded. So what does this say, for example, is that Mormons won in 2004 was a maybe was 15% that we know the trend.

447
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:52,290
I always find 85 of the trend. That means it was 15% below the trend.

448
01:09:53,430 --> 01:10:06,240
And this goes to 2005. In 2005, well, one was 18% below the trend.

449
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:10,290
So close to that 50%, but a little bit different.

450
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:17,069
And we don't have another or one just to compare, but I'm sorry, period one.

451
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:28,270
But we will do that. We will check all the period of the month one in this case to see how much above or below the trend.

452
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:33,630
Let's take a look. For example, month two and month two.

453
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:49,870
So two was only 91 of the trend.

454
01:10:49,870 --> 01:11:01,030
That means 9% be 9% below the trend in Intel in year one in 2004, earning in 2005.

455
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:07,290
Hotels on either side were 13% below the trend.

456
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,620
So he got 9% and the 13%.

457
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:14,250
Right. So they are close, but they are not the same.

458
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:26,030
Why? So if our hypothesis is correct that they should be, you know, in equal proportion, you know,

459
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:35,340
below or above the trend and the corresponding element, the corresponding periods, quarter or month or whatever it is that we are looking at.

460
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:41,730
You know, why are they? Well, when I take a look at those, why are they exactly the same?

461
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:51,120
Suppose that my hypothesis is correct that they should be the same, but I don't see them to be the same here.

462
01:11:51,630 --> 01:12:02,430
One of these. This is because if what if they were the same, I would have a perfect forecast.

463
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:06,870
Right? So I would be for that completely. So I wouldn't have no choice.

464
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:16,890
Right. So they what they the issue is that on top of seasonality and double trend, we have some noise that we cannot predict.

465
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:22,170
Right. So that noise is adding that the that variability.

466
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:30,120
That's why we cannot capture the proportion in the exact proportion of all the time for those people.

467
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:35,880
And then how what do we do to mitigate the noise or, you know,

468
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:42,010
get rid of the noise or actually mitigate just may make sure that it doesn't bother too much.

469
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:46,350
We just simply average the goes proportion.

470
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:57,150
Right. So I hear you say, okay, this is point 85 and this is point 82.

471
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:01,230
They should be the same, but they are not because they have noise.

472
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:07,610
I am assuming that their noise is on, but there's no bias here.

473
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:16,010
So the noise can cancel out. Right. So the noise has had a mean of in this case one.

474
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:22,190
And so weights and you know, I run around those those numbers.

475
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:38,670
So if I average their noise, it will give me the correct answer or closer a better estimate of they say that the.

476
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:50,430
In fact, or that each of these periods is affected by with respect to the the trend that is threatened.

477
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:54,590
And that's what we call the seasonal factors.

478
01:13:54,980 --> 01:14:08,020
Right? That's factor that we're going to try to get to that that tendency or that proportion above or below the trend for each specific seasons,

479
01:14:08,030 --> 01:14:15,880
a specific period within the season. That's when we pull the seasonal factor, or we can call them seasonal indices.

480
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:20,120
So either seasonal factors of seasonality, this is the same thing.

481
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:23,180
So I'm going to put, you know, seasonal.

482
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:31,340
Factories. Here.

483
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:40,270
One more we will need under seasonal factors.

484
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,120
These economic factors in this column.

485
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:57,890
Okay. And when to call that small?

486
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:05,120
And I'm going to get this seasonal factoring for each month and the month of April.

487
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:23,559
In late December. What? And now they have the seasonal factor.

488
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,390
How do we get a seasonal factor for January?

489
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:44,980
Well, I, I average only January of orange, Mondays here and January here, and then I average and there's no order in January.

490
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:49,090
So the average is still, I think, 8.84.

491
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:53,529
And then the same thing I average all the February.

492
01:15:53,530 --> 01:16:05,270
So it's going to be okay average. Family is here and all my family is here.

493
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:18,110
That's point 89. So when 91 and when in when you and I can do keep doing that, I can just copy that formula with points.

494
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:29,450
But, you know, the problem with copying this formula is that you may have you may not have the same number of that January and February.

495
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:36,980
So we we may have, you know, called the observations in the middle of the year.

496
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:42,800
So that would double words, you know, and, you know, you start repeating.

497
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:53,360
So what we can do is create a formula here that averages specifically all the January and February.

498
01:16:54,020 --> 01:17:02,540
So that is formula that we can use a function in Excel that's called the average.

499
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:09,499
If the average kids's average is, it is January average, it is February.

500
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:13,280
And so. So let's do that.

501
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:23,510
I'm going to delete this and then I'm going to start by taking heat back to average.

502
01:17:29,070 --> 01:17:34,940
It opened parentheses and then this.

503
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:42,890
First I want to highlight what is the range that tells me where those bonds are?

504
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:50,330
The range of bonds. Right. So where am I going to look for January?

505
01:17:50,330 --> 01:18:04,010
February? And those are here. So these numbers all these numbers are is the range of to here.

506
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:09,140
So that's that's that's the first parameter.

507
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:13,550
The second parameter is going to be what is the.

508
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:26,570
By the way, I live and work less long these range because explain to me and I use it again when I look in this month, all they can wear is appraised.

509
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:33,250
So then the second parameter is what longs are a looking.

510
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:38,990
In this case is January one and we're looking for all the ones here.

511
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:44,090
But I want to copy this formula later and I want it to change from 2 to 3.

512
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:51,340
So instead of putting them one, I'm going to click on Case three.

513
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:54,469
This one, they have a month of January one.

514
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:58,400
And when I copy that formula, that attention to three and four and so on,

515
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:08,780
and then finally is going to that is going to say when you're looking for a one in this range,

516
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:12,740
but when you find that one, what do you want to do with it?

517
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:21,260
And then I'm going to say, well, take the corresponding values in this friend here and average them.

518
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:30,150
And that is going to be a lot. Also because I went to.

519
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:37,380
And when to use and when to extend the bulkiness.

520
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:47,030
So in essence, this is what he's saying, is saying, look forward, K-3,

521
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:53,720
that the number one on the column be that folks when the Reagan folks want to be three

522
01:19:53,960 --> 01:20:01,820
and between these between these things and every one every entry with a one grab that

523
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:09,409
and then average all of them in an average the values that they in this column corresponding

524
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:18,740
to all these one it's so it's going to get one 95.92 37.81 and point 87 seconds.

525
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:26,990
So, all right. So I am going to hit enter and you see that the point any for when to go into.

526
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:51,330
So you can see the formula. Average is b three to be 26 long coma key three coma age 3 to 20 things and then close friends like so.

527
01:20:51,360 --> 01:21:01,750
And then now I would highlight all this and then I get all my seasonal factors from month one.

528
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:14,790
So I have all my seasonal factors here, and these are the ones that I'm going to use to forecast because it means that I am going to predict a trend,

529
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:24,629
the trend for these variants, and then I am going to multiply times the corresponding seasonal factor going forward.

530
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:30,720
Obviously the best forecast and you will see how much more accurate information is.

531
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:42,150
So so this is I'm going to extend this forward until Thursday instead of Monday instead of Tuesday.

532
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:47,380
Thursday. Well, we will finish all these things.

533
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:55,530
Have a good week. Remember to show me your ingredients.

534
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:07,100
Yes. Sure.

535
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:17,700
Sure. So, yeah, I got you into it so far and I am waiting for people.

536
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:34,860
So I would really like to print out our agents of job description and recalibrate again.

537
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:45,440
Yeah. Yeah. That's the family history from the colonies.

538
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:49,410
It's like zooming in.

539
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:54,680
You want to go and get rid of everything? Yeah. Not my fault.

540
01:22:54,780 --> 01:23:09,540
I think you only have 45, so it's pretty easy.

541
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:17,630
I know you're just sitting there domestic.

542
01:23:19,130 --> 01:23:27,440
I like the idea that you watching your chest.

543
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:34,280
That's perfectly okay. I like watching.

544
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:40,490
You're so lucky I haven't seen you smile.

545
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:49,620
I tried for three days.

546
01:23:50,310 --> 01:24:07,170
I didn't feel like he wanted me to be like, you know.

547
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:18,370
Yeah. You know, I really to you to be very, you know, so I would.

548
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:24,600
Oh, my God. I thank you. Oh, you know, she suffers.

549
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:27,750
No excuse.

550
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:54,980
I think it's because I feel like I have to be part.
