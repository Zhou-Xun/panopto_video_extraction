1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,773
What are the three regulated steps?

2
00:00:01,773 --> 00:00:02,290
Okay, so

3
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:06,699
the first one is it gonna phosphorylate glucose into glucose 6-phosphatase?

4
00:00:06,699 --> 00:00:10,770
The reason that that happens is that traps the glucose in the cell.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,028
So the glucose as you remember can come in through a diffusion gradient and

6
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:16,820
both muscle and liver and fat.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,807
It always comes in down a diffusion gradient, so

8
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:22,040
it could just diffuse back out, right, which would not be great.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,070
If you were trying to say use that for ATP, but

10
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,963
once it's phosphorylated now it can't just diffuse back out.

11
00:00:26,963 --> 00:00:29,771
So once it's phosphorylated, it's trapped.

12
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:30,700
All right, is that clear?

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,033
So that's the first step.

14
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:38,367
This step which takes glucose, makes it into glucose 6-phosphate is

15
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:42,020
reversible by an enzyme called glucose 6-phosphatase.

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,765
So that's really important in gluconeogenesis, because in that case,

17
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:46,862
we're taking stuff, and we're trying to go this way.

18
00:00:46,862 --> 00:00:48,264
We're trying to make glucose.

19
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:50,456
You've got to get that phosphate off, so

20
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:53,221
it can go back out glute to get into the blood, okay?

21
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:56,104
There's not very much glucose-6 phosphatase in muscle or in fat, so

22
00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:58,182
it basically once it's in there, it's trapped.

23
00:00:58,182 --> 00:01:02,525
It's got to be moving along glycolysis or gluconeogenesis.

24
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:08,240
Sorry glycolysis or glycogenolysis, glycogenesis, it's on the next slide.

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,750
All right, so this is the glucokinase versus hexcokinase slide.

26
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:17,130
So this can be nomenclature wise, a little bit confusing.

27
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,090
So there's two different types of enzymes that can do this phosphorylation of

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,880
glucose to glucose-6 phosphate.

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,493
The first one is the one in fat and muscle so that is hexokinase, okay?

30
00:01:29,493 --> 00:01:32,929
It has a very high km, so this is what I mean by a very high km.

31
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:35,590
So even extremely low concentrations of glucose it's very

32
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,035
efficiently phosphorylated.

33
00:01:37,035 --> 00:01:40,902
Okay, so as soon as it gets into the cell, even if there's only a little bit,

34
00:01:40,902 --> 00:01:43,180
it'll get phosphorylated really quickly.

35
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,270
Does that make sense?

36
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,932
Okay, glucokinase, which is the one in the liver and the pancreas,

37
00:01:48,932 --> 00:01:51,963
and I'm gonna focus on the liver has a couple of different

38
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:54,350
properties that are important for it.

39
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,040
So one is that it's cooperative so

40
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,170
you can see if this is the physiological range of glucose.

41
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,040
This is one of those enzymes when I was talking about cooperativity.

42
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,959
It's useful because at a low concentration,

43
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,000
the reaction doesn't happen very much.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,440
And at a high concentration the reaction happens a lot faster.

45
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,881
Low km.

46
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:18,509
Low km means high affinity.

47
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:21,870
Yeah loads because the km is what is, yeah.

48
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,280
So this is the km here.

49
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,560
So low km means very, very efficient, very high affinity.

50
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,744
So very low substrate to be able to get phosphorylation.

51
00:02:28,744 --> 00:02:33,911
>> [INAUDIBLE]

52
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:36,644
>> We'll get to that in the next step.

53
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:44,190
It primes it for glycogen but doesn't store it for glycogen.

54
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,488
The other property about the liver isoform glucokinase is that it can actually

55
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:49,540
work much faster.

56
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,339
So at the highest possible glucose concentration, it can fix glucose really,

57
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,390
really high.

58
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,108
Whereas it becomes limiting at really,

59
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:59,450
really high concentrations in the muscle and in the fat.

60
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,520
Okay, does that make sense?

61
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,310
The third thing that matters in terms of the regulation of glucokinase and

62
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,483
hexokinase is that only hexcokinase is negatively regulated by

63
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:13,823
glucose-6- phosphate, which is the product.

64
00:03:13,823 --> 00:03:17,093
Okay, so it has negative feedback which prevents more formation.

65
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:18,917
So if you're phosphorylating it really quickly but

66
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:20,760
you're not actually doing anything with it.

67
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,050
That's a way to feedback, tell the enzyme to stop phosphorylating.

68
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,910
Okay, is that clear?

69
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,544
Okay, so take
