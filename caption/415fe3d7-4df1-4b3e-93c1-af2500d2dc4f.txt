1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:06,910
So I'm wondering what to discuss about the do you work for me?

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:12,520
But you want to Tremont. So why we need water? Why when you're drinking water, why we the potable water?

3
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,720
So because that's really essential for daily life, right? This is how much water we use.

4
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,990
Approximately every day. So.

5
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,800
Used to be. This is old numbers, but very nice old numbers.

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,840
Used to be about 150 gallons per day per people. I mean, can you imagine that?

7
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,390
To 150 gallons per day. And we have different proposals.

8
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:49,120
So and the other thing is really how much of what you think you have in your body.

9
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,040
As a percentage of the water income the way 60% of the stuff it in 90.

10
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,830
So depending on the age for the newborns probably 9090 5%.

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,470
We are getting older and then the percentage decrease jobs.

12
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,120
Okay. So are your age.

13
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,370
Probably around 75. 80%. 75.

14
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,260
But we're still my age. Probably 70 to 70 and then maybe 60.

15
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,330
Okay. So because the water is so important, right?

16
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:32,850
What is important? Because if you think about chemistry, all this we had we had the reaction, chemical reaction and water needs all the reaction.

17
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:40,560
You already get all this water. So so that's we don't have to replace the water.

18
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,590
And because when doing the metabolism,

19
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:52,050
see how by the biology you are doing in the cabin all this we generally the waste we generate those compounds we have to get rid of the.

20
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,350
Okay. We have to get rhythm. Otherwise our DNA would be damaged forever and then will die very soon.

21
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,320
Okay. So that's just the. The biological mechanism where we are.

22
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,400
Well, we'll how we survive, because we all have a mechanism to get rid of these toxic compounds.

23
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:16,140
Okay. When you oxidize when you eat the delicious food, or if you think about the biochemistry,

24
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:23,310
if you eat the delicious food and then you're happy by when they oxidizes what that gives them, they produce all these compounds.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,060
We have to give you that. And that's what is so important.

26
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,270
So so do you want how much you want you to do everything.

27
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:44,010
Four, five, six liters of water, six liters of water to integrate six cups of water and six,

28
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,910
eight cups of water to about two liters of water you need almost every day.

29
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,480
But you need this water because that's essential for your life.

30
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:01,720
Okay. Is it really essential for the life? This, this, this because it's biological for is what we are doing.

31
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,750
I mean, how many how many reactions plastic in your SEALs side and your reactions?

32
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,860
I mean, it's perceptual skills, but how we can be functional.

33
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,590
That's the reason we need the water. I mean, that's just for the biological process, but then for our daily life.

34
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,620
We need water. So, honey, if you could get in.

35
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:31,050
So, you see, anyone can tell which country to use or consume the most amount of the water in one average.

36
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,930
America is actually going to say Dubai, Saudi Arabia.

37
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,160
Saudi Arabia. So unless.

38
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:53,360
And wells. So so we have about 150 gallons, and that's in my 90th birthday when we have the moment of the conservation now about 90 gallons per day.

39
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:00,270
But around that number in America. I mean, basically, we use a lot of oak.

40
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:08,479
We are not like the end of the world, but we use too much of all the effects and the water resources of the country,

41
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,020
of course, consume most amount of water for people.

42
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,030
Today, it's time to go. So the copilot.

43
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,020
Copilot is the Middle East. So both.

44
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,860
Okay. And then they have official.

45
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,510
There's a whole of fresh water. All.

46
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:39,440
It is basically they used to like used to just take the where did it run water you can use again they will do well if they have the whale.

47
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,540
We can have the water they want. They might move here.

48
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,140
And that's reason why they also this this culture, because they have to move around leaf by water.

49
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:54,070
Okay. That's that's why they use a pen, because they need to find the water.

50
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,710
Then they can survive. And then you there for a month or two on the water that that will run out.

51
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,980
They have to go somewhere else. They use this making process.

52
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,750
Okay. Because full of death, they have death.

53
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:14,840
So basically, yes, with death, it's much cheaper than a lot of their work.

54
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:22,040
So they use the definition purpose, the process to treat all the fresh water, to get the water from the sea, from the ocean.

55
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,460
And then they distributed back to species. We have. Okay.

56
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:34,060
In this country. And then we distribute to every corner in this country and become this symbol.

57
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,650
And then what you see. Okay for the fugitive.

58
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:45,350
What are your three? And they used probably like 600 meters.

59
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,470
A big deposit. That's the number they have because it's free.

60
00:05:53,250 --> 00:06:02,969
It's free by the day. Most of the family houses, they have the think of what the oak outside it for the walk.

61
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:09,680
It is the tag that they use it for, for that purpose. And they use that for the for the word loans.

62
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:15,270
And that's really is intended. Okay. So I guess.

63
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,200
I'll I'll surprised. But I'm just like, what?

64
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,380
You you have so much water in your heart. I mean, because it's so hot.

65
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:35,160
And also just the water alone, for example, they use a lot of water for that purpose and also see this as well.

66
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,460
So they use for the shower for a lot of these kind of activities.

67
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,920
Okay. That's and also the evaporation they may have as well.

68
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:53,520
So that's the the the the the the the see, we have yeah, we, we'll talk about I mean, we can pick up more about that.

69
00:06:53,530 --> 00:07:01,650
We have a project cut out for 1 to 3 years and to look at the drinking water quality and the health there.

70
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,870
And it's a lot of things to learn from there as well. So.

71
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,440
So, I mean, when you're in the water.

72
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:17,310
So again, this is how we in the United States, we talk about how we provide the water with the open water cycle with.

73
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:25,870
Every time we use it, most of the time we use the surface of water to collect and then to treat them to distribute to the household.

74
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:31,090
And then we get around the waste, but also we gather waste from these.

75
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,589
So this is kind of typical whatever water cycle for drinking water.

76
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:40,030
Now what do we do? What do we do? We will provide the treatment.

77
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:48,370
Okay. Most women like to watch, but to them, before the consumption that's required by the Safe Drinking Water Act.

78
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:55,150
So how do we make sure that the water is safe to drink? In the United States will approach are using.

79
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,549
Monitored. What? A project manager?

80
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,270
Yes. Disinfecting and disinfect.

81
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:12,770
And well, how the how is it that you can want to have the safety requirements was a safety and you want to require us to do.

82
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:21,690
To sample every. What's a 70 to 1 X can we remember that is in the exam.

83
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:26,400
Okay. So what's so receptive on access to do.

84
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:36,100
To see if in view of what approached they used to source particular salt and.

85
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:44,650
If I was approached the court. Is it the.

86
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,490
Multiple Berry approach could be defined by required by the safe drinking water acts.

87
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,160
We have to use multiple berry approach to provide food and clean water.

88
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,940
So remember this. This is one of the two main diagrams we have.

89
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,310
If you think about the safe water and then clean water.

90
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:21,810
So the safe water during a war, this is a high level talk about how much of a burial process might have a burial approach to provide a safe anti war.

91
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,570
We are required by statute. And what else? Okay, so drinking water act.

92
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:37,560
So we have the standards and then we monitor the water quality in order to provide the source of this particular source.

93
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:44,120
We have a social law. We have to protect them. And then you provide treatment, okay.

94
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,030
Provide treatment for the medical for the sufficient treatment.

95
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,640
Sufficient treatment. And they will protect you screen in the storage. And then you've come.

96
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,780
So this so-called modular baby approach model, baby approach.

97
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:09,180
And there were also more to the end product quality in a product that's worth because something that's in the prior week,

98
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:14,130
we have the standard for quality. Can we use this approach like for for food?

99
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,610
Can we do this for the food? Yeah. No, no, no.

100
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:29,400
It can be an approach from any product. For example, when you go to the restaurant to eat the food.

101
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:38,430
To the cast of the final quarter of the last full. But beforehand or after.

102
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:45,030
When you when you just when they serve you how to ensure that the food is safe

103
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:50,840
to use because the temperature of the inside of the food from the liver.

104
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,819
No, that's not really the way they are to eat,

105
00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:00,780
because you don't really have a standard for the food quality to have so many different kind of foods to have different meals.

106
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,900
How do you set up the warm set up for that temperature?

107
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,510
As for the grill for cooking, but they will set out how do you say it will tell you the temperature for tomorrow?

108
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,460
Okay. So but the water for the product is lots of water.

109
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,020
So we can set up the standard for that.

110
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,280
Okay. But that's written for the food industry. We don't really use this approach.

111
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:32,950
So we use this called Heather. Hazard identification, characterization and critical points.

112
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,750
Did you as a process. Okay.

113
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,970
Ajay CCP is not the person for the full interview.

114
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,490
Most likely to focus more on the process.

115
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,420
For the process by the water here we say.

116
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:56,770
Still that. That's why we still have to figure. The center is for the public.

117
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,950
We have a coded pattern for inappropriate.

118
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,170
But we might have a better approach. I still use the modern day approach.

119
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:15,100
It's a little bit different from the has a condemned by some country some country use that process which has a similar with the food product.

120
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,040
But in the United States we use for tomato baby of course.

121
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:28,059
Okay. We also said that the final end quality for the end product was nothing less than for the food.

122
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:35,590
For the food will be become a way to do that. Okay. Now, is that asking me how they make sure it's fully safe to consume?

123
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,440
But how how do they do that? Can we make sure like if you could arrest one, you feel that you're comfortable to either?

124
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:55,080
Who's in? Well, I know for a dying cause, usually the sanatoriums would have.

125
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,940
For someone who's to take it, but I guess I don't know much about it.

126
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:07,040
Yeah. So that's really they use it as a process so that they have to follow the process like a standard operating procedures.

127
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,290
We talk about it now, there's what is called a process.

128
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:18,439
So they focus on the process and make sure that everyone follow that process and then have the record of that process that make sure that,

129
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,760
okay, now the food provides. So that's why you didn't have that U.S.

130
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,260
Could you imagine a house? What good is the restaurant here?

131
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:37,020
Do the inspections they give them say whether you are sanitation pros as people get a train all these they have to have that in place.

132
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,830
Yeah, that's the process that we used to confront to make sure that we provide simple food.

133
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,739
But you see different restaurants may have different ranking.

134
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,190
You see a different rhythm. They have different. Sometimes is varies also.

135
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,500
And sometimes you have the consumer. Was there. No, I mean, yes.

136
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:02,790
But that's also one of the reason I mean, is one of the reasons anybody sees the food borne diseases much higher than what.

137
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,430
Okay, everybody, this is a major concern in the United States and the about you.

138
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,780
Yes, we have, but it's low. Okay.

139
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:23,500
If you think of how we do it, because here in the in the Soviet Union, what we use my favorite approach for that.

140
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:34,350
Okay. So now let's go to the.

141
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:43,230
It's also the drinking water. So first you need to start with a good product, a good source of the water.

142
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:56,550
So, for example, if you if you think about the try to to identify the water, it can be used for the source of the drinking water.

143
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:02,210
So what we need to do. Is in the Clean Water Act.

144
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,300
What we talk about. In the Clean Water Act.

145
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,720
So we need to find. We have the water quality standards also.

146
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:26,870
For fiscal waterboarding. What are we it? How do cold call?

147
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:39,270
Can you want to explain the Clean Water Act? What do you call the use of the water?

148
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:54,020
How do we find when we when we still stand out of the water quality standard and we said this is the use of the water wasn't was a water we use.

149
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,120
Resources. What resources? That's one.

150
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,670
They could use this. Okay.

151
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,910
In the Clean Water Act, we think about the water quality.

152
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:14,450
We say supposing a water body was a direct use of this physical world body, what then they could use?

153
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:20,389
That's so important because everything we say is not like the the the the drinking water.

154
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,750
Yes, we have the war unified water quality standard across the nation.

155
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,370
Okay. Almost like across the water that you are the water quality standard.

156
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:34,680
We always use the same standard with if we have more and if you must then with habitual pattern issues,

157
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,020
they have extended effects, effects recommended, then that is almost across the country.

158
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:45,500
Of course there's a was the same extent, but in the face of suffering of water,

159
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,920
we don't really have a unified water policy in that we have the standard for the pending use of each use.

160
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,020
Okay. So if we have the sort of low drinking water.

161
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:07,170
That they be using this particular one and they will have a set of rules for us then to have a standard for that use.

162
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:16,410
That means that if you try to find solve for drinking water, if the water I say if you go to the river, go to the four lakes,

163
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:24,810
if we try to use the Four Lakes as a as a as a source for doing water, you need to take the water quality set to see what they need to work in.

164
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,550
Because the minute workers don't have to impress, they can use other spots for stupid.

165
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:36,729
That's great. But sometimes what happens? For the Michigan Happy Valley.

166
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,930
In the Michigan, we have the rivers lakes.

167
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,770
We have so much freshwater from other places. You don't know if you could.

168
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:56,670
Arizona, for example, they do what they do. So if you look, I don't have the subject of what we can use so aggressively that you can water.

169
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,450
So what's the source of water to use? Groundwater.

170
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,660
Groundwater, dig the wells, the wells.

171
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:08,610
And we hear why we also use the drilled wells. I will also release.

172
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:18,300
What's the percentage of the. Well, what are we using at the harbor? On Monday we spoke about it and will remember that was the during the beginning.

173
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,990
Yeah, I was not there. So. Okay.

174
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,870
And how much how much stuff is the one they use? From our.

175
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,720
20%. 20%. Okay.

176
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:38,650
So 85% off on the subject of water funds from rivers.

177
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,050
15%, around 15% from the whale. Okay.

178
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:53,720
Why did you do one more? I mean, you talk about Brian, talk about why they use ground water since we have so much, so much fresh water here.

179
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,330
River water. Why they still use Guanajuato so. What's it like?

180
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,720
It's up. Like in case something happened to the source.

181
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:08,030
Yeah. So. So talk about the Social War, because the reason for that is we have the alternatives back up.

182
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:13,600
If something happens, this happens in the river, this other source of water, then we can use that.

183
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:20,209
They can optimize their process. Think about specific water.

184
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:25,260
And with groundwater, it's not always a safe. You know, it's not always the same process.

185
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:30,040
You have to tell you the page. You have the capabilities, the chemistry are defense.

186
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,060
So you may need to optimize your process so that through that.

187
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,720
And I will try to make sure that we have this safe water.

188
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,900
They're using two sources, combined resources.

189
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:50,400
If you have something to show me this makes waste, then they could use it for the source for the union water.

190
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,830
Yes, we have lots of. We have a sufficient quantity. Okay.

191
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,360
So you mean requirements, adequate quantities.

192
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:04,989
And we sometimes don't like the Arizona Arizonans in the in California in our region.

193
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:10,840
I mean, there's no subject was that would have used one word for that before that becomes.

194
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,880
But it would be better if we could use. Okay. So we need to think about the quantity and quality.

195
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:25,060
Okay. So that's some of these parameters you have to consider for the source of the water.

196
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,800
But one of the challenges we have. Okay.

197
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,210
We have if you have the river streams can change rapidly.

198
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:45,990
Accidental spills. Right. If you use like like like, for example, the bottom part of the remote, we have a screen from the works sent.

199
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:52,730
That could impact dramatically. I mean, tap, tap water.

200
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,760
So this action, this field could have it. That could change.

201
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:03,309
Lakes reservoirs more have more graduated but. During the season, you find the temporary changes.

202
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,990
All this could change. What allows it to move the water quality for that?

203
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:14,770
So so that's the reason. One of the reason we have to use groundwater as a source for the drinking water.

204
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,669
Normally for water, the quality. Yes.

205
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:23,430
You have to think about the quantity. You have to use two sources.

206
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:29,270
Like one with from here, the other one from the other places. And that's that's to make sure that you can.

207
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:34,740
And then the quality as well. Think about the point here.

208
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:40,980
What do you think about comparing the groundwater research to what you think, which one has been involved in?

209
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,990
Who around? Water. Flowing water. Why is that?

210
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:54,900
I just think it's like more natural filtering, like going through like, oh, okay, so many of this.

211
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:04,170
So it depends. It really depends because the boil water, normally it's more stable, more constant.

212
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:12,650
Normally the microbiology aspects for the water from this, you know, this microbial growth in the warm water.

213
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:18,630
But I think about a chemical and then the chemicals are small, high in the inequality.

214
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:26,070
Okay. So it really depends. It's really depends which one is more difficult to say which way is better.

215
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,580
But the one one is more constant.

216
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,290
Okay. And the river water could change rapidly.

217
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,700
And one one nominee is really more stable than these.

218
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:50,850
So yes, in terms of the ability to be organic concentration dominate the world, one is no great,

219
00:22:51,190 --> 00:23:00,400
but the mono content sometimes heavy metals like arsenic we talk about probably is higher in the groundwater than the source by relatively speaking.

220
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:05,140
And the government is it's it's it's better.

221
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,380
It's better. So that's reason. One of the reason.

222
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:15,340
If you live in the farms, the remote area, you don't have the connection to the to the to the city water.

223
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:22,720
So what do you do? The President. Well, yeah there the we'll give the current one, but give the current one.

224
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:29,340
So now do you have I mean any I don't know with any any of you movie that you will water.

225
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,629
More and more used to write their children a lot of their lives.

226
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:40,960
You know, you don't normally people don't really want to do anything they said.

227
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,050
But if you want to do that, it's a little bit different.

228
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,340
I mean, you get the moment, what are you doing? You need to have a softening system.

229
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:57,200
And especially in this area of some areas that have the hardness is pretty high you to solving the water for that purpose.

230
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:07,780
So particular sauce and particular sauce because is the sauce for the drinking water they they use governed by the Clean Water Act.

231
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,430
And instead,

232
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:16,720
what you do if you want act that both regulate the sauce for the drinking water to the security where her protections is out for women to do this.

233
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,790
So. Now.

234
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,390
How do we protect ourselves? So why are we just by the lens?

235
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:35,340
They say we have a bottom pump valve, which is quite an idea, and they use that to put me on social work.

236
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:44,150
Can we do that? Can we do that?

237
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:53,040
It is expensive. It's expensive. So most of the men are owned by families.

238
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,280
It's probably all men. Okay.

239
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:05,840
So you cannot really you know, you cannot just go there to give you that occupy, which is the philosophical thing where they cannot do that.

240
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:13,530
Okay. You cannot really do that. So one of the question here is is also interesting.

241
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,490
Now. During the 1960s.

242
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,600
We go to the highway in the United States. I.

243
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,950
How can we give all the lands we need to go to the pirates?

244
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,810
Bon bon bon. Okay.

245
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:41,350
One can argue enough. I think also at the time those was during the Cold War.

246
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:48,430
Somebody had a reason because it was a state of war that they had to use it for military purposes.

247
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,810
The Defense Act, we have a hard time on this because they can use the thing.

248
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:57,280
They can use the highway highways for the Navy that they.

249
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,770
Is alternative airport defined by the defense.

250
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:10,589
So at that time because one of the reasons because so they can give the land I don't have many also cheap right so you

251
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:17,999
can you can put that but we don't really have something like that he is now to say give the land to protect themselves,

252
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,450
but they do go on. So it's it's difficult to do that for that purpose.

253
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:28,710
But we do have the program there for the can you want to accept you can what X to particular source for the drinking water.

254
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:40,150
It's also what protection is. A permits or different programs have been used to protect our source of Water and Clean Water Act for that purpose.

255
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,320
So you guys go to the New York.

256
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:53,370
The big city area. The old one has a very good point there. We couldn't have what is better than 1000 for sure.

257
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,470
Okay. So one of the reason.

258
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:05,450
It's because the availability of these associates you can one in upstate, you have a big reason why they're well protected as a source for the people.

259
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,770
So I have a very good two stories start with.

260
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,710
So first of all, the drinking water, if you have no choice, use ground water.

261
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,580
But there is one workaround. And they need to find another way to do this.

262
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:31,670
And especially some big cities, some big cities, major cities and some high.

263
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,720
Mumbai. And you think about payroll, Nima.

264
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,290
All the big cities are big cities. They're used to going to war.

265
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:46,930
So it was a problem they have is really they withdraw too much money, water the land to fix jobs.

266
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:53,560
Here we go to the war. What they would go and they would then go with that.

267
00:27:53,620 --> 00:28:02,019
You support and you see a lot of difficulties just go to wells in the in the city because they the first

268
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:09,820
they find the water the water and then they withdraw a water and then water bombs in the use of that water.

269
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,040
Okay.

270
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:19,600
Now, in the big cities, some bigger cities, but in the in the west southwest in the United States, a large presence, the U.S. waterfront so small.

271
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,160
Do you want to talk about that as well? Now.

272
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:28,570
Provide the treatment. Provide the treatment. Provide sufficient treatment.

273
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:36,030
We provide sufficient treatment. So, yes, on Monday, Bryan talked about the process.

274
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:41,130
In the arbor, they cut out of all instruments.

275
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:49,010
In fact, they had some advanced human steps. But there's four major steps we have in the drinking water image that's everywhere.

276
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:53,630
Probably use a similar approach of four steps.

277
00:28:54,050 --> 00:29:04,280
One of those there is where you have the source water either putting them into the to go to the treatment facility and then we have the population.

278
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:11,120
You had a Plymouth, you had a room into the water, and then what happens?

279
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:16,330
That's the party. Got a lot of possible people attached to the record when you tell them.

280
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,420
But when you add the polymers or some of the chemicals, you remove the touch of the particles.

281
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:27,340
So the particles now who have become covered together become much particles.

282
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,890
So they can cantilever. Okay.

283
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:41,780
That's the first phase of our project that you suspect this particle could be chemicals, could be sediments and also microorganisms.

284
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:50,820
Okay. That could be a mild argument. So when they do the first, everything's going okay through the coagulation so that they can.

285
00:29:51,870 --> 00:30:00,210
From the line of particles, small particles, now the most charges of charged particles and big particles.

286
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:06,059
And then with a duke. The sedimentation.

287
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,390
So clarifies you see the big tank they have. Slow down.

288
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:15,150
You form the large particles now that preceded them. So down to the bottom and of course, sedimentation.

289
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:23,590
The second escape. And then the third step is filtration.

290
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,360
Now you have the large party of the form. Some settle down by, some can already be civil.

291
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:37,290
The answer is still suspended in the water. And what are you to do now?

292
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,390
You see them, then you filter them out, use most of the passive, you send a filtration okay.

293
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:50,800
Or your standard filtration for that purpose. Remove the fine particles from their process.

294
00:30:52,700 --> 00:31:00,110
The theaters in some places now use GSE granular activated carbon for that purpose because GSE for that purpose as well.

295
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:10,760
And then. I stayed in the treatment plant to perfection.

296
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,100
We'll have the key will be used as a disinfectant was put in for disinfection.

297
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:25,780
The disinfection is to cure the presence. You can hear the president.

298
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:32,080
So. This is a sufficient treatment for major states.

299
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:38,050
The four major steps. A classical drinking watching union process.

300
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,940
That's what can go watch movies that could modify the process.

301
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,450
You see the Arabic we do the disinfection already here.

302
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:54,020
We're already the de facto already here. The move was a discussion much earlier.

303
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,650
And then they also do a secondary. And then the district again.

304
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:08,080
Okay. So this is a treatment process and they will have the authority to take the power.

305
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:16,840
They know they can keep the pressure and the dispute. But you hear they also give the radio time, contact, comfort, disinfecting as well.

306
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:23,230
Good. And then you have this distribution of youth pressure to destroy the water to this each household.

307
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:31,590
Going to each household. That's how the process would look for major steps.

308
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,780
That's everywhere, almost in the in this country. In the other country, the same process.

309
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:43,290
Similar process. And then modify a little bit here and there by this for me, justice for the Duke in watching the process.

310
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:51,140
Okay. Remember this? I mean, this is just really basic basic knowledge about the truth of what you in process.

311
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:03,340
That had to be in place for for many, many, many years, for the most of the Watchmen process is probably sufficient.

312
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:12,010
But now, with specific contaminants, you may have specific to them the chemicals now with the p fast, for example, we have not could do that.

313
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:17,680
Mr. Full Naval. Okay, this process is not sufficient.

314
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,910
So you have an additional tender process involved in the process to put these commitment.

315
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,520
And the brand also adds that you really think that you right now so critical.

316
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:43,430
Okay. What's crypto for that company? I mean, that's pretty close to the U.S. is do you think it's pretty costly and but but it could be.

317
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,110
From my opinion, and I may not be that less.

318
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,470
Okay. Sure it would be great, but it may not be done this week.

319
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,820
But they want to. That's fine. I would prefer effects.

320
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:06,660
Could all assume swimming pools to you. So you relax here for the treatment because that's the most really the crypto infection occurred.

321
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:16,310
The public swimming pools are so important that we're talking about recreational fun, but that's still the case.

322
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,490
When you stop there, you relax. Obviously, that's not the.

323
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,870
Did you want to do, Mark? Yeah. I mean, the risk probably.

324
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:32,410
No. But, you know, Aruba has the money, so they do that anyway. Average we watch on the place.

325
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:39,879
The streamer took up our average human process already and you can see here or they do they

326
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:44,470
use like this for the for the suffering they use a kind of softening process to remove

327
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:52,540
that as basically and then you have this fluctuation and then you've also okay is also

328
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:57,580
for the disinfection and this is a clarify they use also this this is sedimentation,

329
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,960
but then they use also already to disinfect before they do the filtration,

330
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:10,710
before this filtration and this primary disinfect is used in the eye watching implant is also is

331
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:16,290
primary and they will have the secondary treatment disinfectant they are using as a marker on me.

332
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,110
They use ammonia and the chloride reacts.

333
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:31,160
To call the Monaco Army and further to say and then just figure really which is a system is also monochrome.

334
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,519
So these are required by the law. Okay.

335
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:42,200
So due to water and sewage system, we need to have the residual concentration of the disinfectant to control the cost.

336
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:55,300
Okay. Let's take a quick break, two minute break. We talk about the other approach, various we have.

337
00:39:49,940 --> 00:40:49,669
Yeah. Okay.

338
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:54,110
So we have to distribute the water to each household and then through the pipes.

339
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:06,800
Through the pipes. So how can we make sure that the the the the piping system is good for the give you the water?

340
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,980
So in the United States now, I can say I'm you can say it's not perfect 100%.

341
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:15,500
Most of the water needs what you would sometimes get.

342
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:20,790
Most of them I mean, some of them get outside, most of them.

343
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,500
But when they get to the pipes, it depends.

344
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:30,910
So we'll think about a big city like Boston for that. You have some issues they may have.

345
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:41,540
First of all, what are some discrete so. The reason for this is so important that it uses its.

346
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:48,180
If you're okay at this stage, it's somewhat so there's no room.

347
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:54,700
But it is racism. It's huge. Sometimes if you think about and you want to, you're probably going to watch the movie.

348
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,330
You look how big this one is.

349
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:03,010
The timing of this could be guiding the causes of I can't remember the title

350
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:09,400
of the movie that people die of chicken feed the Jews Used To Be in the past.

351
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,500
Okay. That's on me right now or whatever. I can remember them.

352
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:22,630
So that's how huge the tourism could be for New York City because because that's how much water when have to spew.

353
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:26,620
So make sure that the integrity of the the oil is important.

354
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:31,690
So you have these water mains pumping facilities out of the structure for that purpose and then storage.

355
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,710
The story is crystallize the say we are we really want to.

356
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:40,320
We have to keep the pressure in the pipes.

357
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:47,299
Why do we need to keep putting pressure in the pipes? One one reason for confusion.

358
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,320
Why wasn't it used to do the other release?

359
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:58,719
Strategic arms. Yes. The other is the effective to avoid contamination, the contamination.

360
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,480
So that's leaking from outside of the pipe because you had the broken pipes.

361
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:10,900
Now you have high pressure to the wall come out of your safe system so that you can avoid contamination where we do the contamination.

362
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:20,180
That's reason. One of the reason. One of the reason we have this low pressure do immediate is issues a boil water notice.

363
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:21,640
Okay.

364
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:28,990
Because if you don't have the party pressure enough, you can have that the contamination, you should cause contamination from the surrounding areas.

365
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:35,050
Okay. So that's really the one of the several reasons, but also also one of the reasons.

366
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:40,710
Place is mostly water. Very you have the positive pressure.

367
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:45,370
You have both inside. What happens will come out, right?

368
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:55,020
Like in Mexico City, for example, 70% and 60% of the official water lost during the.

369
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:03,040
Just about 80, 70%. Okay.

370
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:08,500
So so that's really one of the issues that we have also ozone in the United States.

371
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:14,690
This is the you have to keep the patient who has broken may have been the price of jobs.

372
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:23,560
Quite weak and they have to issue the boil water notice because the recall here could vary.

373
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:28,240
And then you have the cross-contamination issues for that. So we have to keep the pressure in the pipes.

374
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,640
And therefore, for that, for severe weather,

375
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:37,360
this practice should that reason you open the force area will come up later on by the pressure or the pressure.

376
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:44,580
Pipes, pumping facilities. All these tips in a system you have.

377
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:51,170
So you have to protect the decision system for that up to five different means.

378
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,790
That's the reason why it's so complex. You put it on the ground. Because we're going to see these pipes.

379
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:02,630
That's amazing. How what are we are using here? And then think about after a hundred years in use, what could happen.

380
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:08,360
Okay. One of the one of the problem with this really the building biofilm that we talk about.

381
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:18,850
So one of the big issues we have right now in the United States is drinking water.

382
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:23,300
You guys age infrastructure, it's piping system we have.

383
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:24,770
Again,

384
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:38,240
I would mention that already the the the watching events for example Apple Watch this product only responsible for water quality before the summer.

385
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:47,150
Okay. Before the correction, you have each household the man they are responsible for the means by people in your household and thus

386
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:57,190
reduce does not make it so except the they kind of world that you have to be in all of that okay.

387
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,730
Otherwise all the others most all the time because is in the main system.

388
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:08,790
The U.S. is now is still responsible for water quality in the main in some other countries.

389
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,260
In the world. The only responsible for the world finding when they leave the planet.

390
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:20,710
Convinced the water. So then who would be responsible for that?

391
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:34,670
Main thing would be the city of the city of so many the world quality when they report, the owner report, the one leaving the Finnish law.

392
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:43,600
Okay. But here in the United States, we were really in the water before they reach your house, they receive your private room.

393
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,750
So sometimes that's the reason we look at this.

394
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:55,690
What according to what extent, I mean, kind of embarrassing them for quality standards, but then a way to measure them.

395
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:03,400
Where you can see the world, whether he's in the press or you just look at the differences,

396
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:07,240
make the best of the best, good distribution, the relevance.

397
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:19,250
That's also what I hear. You are very comfortable when you open up for you in the water.

398
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,960
Good. You think you could do that? You can.

399
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:30,420
But in many other countries, most over the 47 people is not possible.

400
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:34,510
Okay. I mean, they do not really meet the quality of the drinking water.

401
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:42,249
So you have to have additional human protein for that purpose. Now we can do this.

402
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:45,340
Another question. And then the standards, the regulations. Right.

403
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:53,780
By the law, we have the regulation of EPA. How can one contaminant of chemical, biological and physical contaminants are banned?

404
00:47:54,220 --> 00:48:01,420
We have these two issues to regulate primary regulated, primary drinking water,

405
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:06,340
lack of primary drinking water regulations, and the national secondary drinking water regulations.

406
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:10,900
Some of these are regular contaminants in the Secretary Clean Water Act.

407
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:17,980
We talk about how we set up the standards to be regulated so they have to have the contaminant KENYON used and sufficient data.

408
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,910
They have outbreaks and then they will be able to provide the technology for it to treat

409
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:25,570
the water and then provide technology for you to monitor water and then the can that.

410
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:33,070
Okay. So if you don't cannot provide this, you cannot regulate. Forget the pitfalls.

411
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:38,690
I mean, not everyone can pass the pitfalls of forcing the outcome of someone to turns out for you.

412
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:47,380
So we don't really have an even with the people. We'll talk about the PBS. We don't have the standard for the people's standard of privacy yet.

413
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:58,480
This just health advisory concentration is so low and I think almost 00.001 Nandigram police say, how can you do that?

414
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:07,150
We cannot really regulate that. It doesn't make sense. What are the people I think about has an advisory just okay, that's business.

415
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:18,850
And then we have these enhanced to talk about especially on the crypto the crypto like like enhanced stuff is Watchmen regulations

416
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:25,630
and there's the two districts it is fair quantification deficient bipartisan regulations regarding the safe drinking water.

417
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:32,170
Okay work water quality standard that we have for quality standard we have and they all have to monitor water quality.

418
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:37,419
We have to monitor them and they need to provide the report to the public.

419
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:40,720
So every if you're a citizen, you always received a one for the report,

420
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:49,530
probably like it was every year for positive follow up on the world, for what time it is, and then the measurements here.

421
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:53,950
So for example, you receive that you can you can have that's pretty.

422
00:49:55,290 --> 00:50:00,880
Confidence, that's all. What is there, what they are testing and what the what is said to be okay.

423
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:04,730
That's also the communication with the public. Okay.

424
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:15,640
Montego Bay. We approach. We are using either United States to ensure that we provide safe and clean water to the public.

425
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:20,950
Okay. That's what we are doing here.

426
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:24,530
Okay. And then we also regulate the products.

427
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:33,870
The quality of the products at the water. Okay.

428
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:38,340
So just if I may. If what? If I start fully?

429
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:45,060
That cannot. I cannot do this because there's no private about it.

430
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:51,840
So much you can do that. Read the books that grocery store to buy, and then you go to the restaurant you buy, right?

431
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:56,070
And you go to the grocery store to grab the meat, uncooked meat.

432
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:03,050
We can only really provide for the fire. So they have to follow the process through the process.

433
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:08,330
And then why do you have the to participate on that? Okay.

434
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:14,300
You've already done this. So. So we want a different one.

435
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:19,100
A different one. If we request the stand that the quality of the end product,

436
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:28,820
the product will use multiple query approach to ensure that in the product but also not only just might have been approved, but then we record people.

437
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:33,190
That's in the United States and some other countries. They will do that. Okay.

438
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,060
You do that. For example, you you the immigrants.

439
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:44,850
They are not required to add disinfectant in the distribution system. They are not required to do that.

440
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:49,270
You see a white. Because they choose them.

441
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:54,100
They remove most of all getting married or getting married in a war.

442
00:51:54,100 --> 00:52:03,330
It's still. No. There's no matter because he's in the water in future, then much less.

443
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,960
I hear you in many states because of gay marriages.

444
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:11,250
We would have a more gay marriage in both states.

445
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:18,020
So we're going to see it's very a lost in the discourse from this system as we grow.

446
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,880
It's pretty common. Okay.

447
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:26,290
The request for comment. How come they don't have much organic matter in the water?

448
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,969
They removed a treatment room without disinfection.

449
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:34,480
We've added different volumes just for the use of the process.

450
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,340
All right. But how did they remove it? That is that.

451
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,580
Do they put more investment in the Regulation Corporation?

452
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:50,320
They we use biological systems for that purpose. I mean, they could have irrigation process that is in the West water, for example.

453
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:54,320
They use that process also at that process also to reduce that.

454
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:58,780
All right. Okay. So so that way.

455
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:05,200
That's one way. I mean, this is probably a better way because now you use this different that you have listed,

456
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,430
which by product and then you just remove again, there's no gross.

457
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:13,060
I mean, it's very difficult for them to grow in the in the war.

458
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:17,800
If you think about the regrows. The temperature is a big factor.

459
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:26,560
So the winter normally is better because winter now has the temperatures below 10,000.

460
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:31,790
And if the water the temperature is 10,000, it is very difficult for.

461
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:42,310
But but if it above, then yes. I mean, that's just the and you can promote the regrowth pretty quickly.

462
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:46,870
A few of the countries also somewhat some of the water is 20 Celsius.

463
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:56,079
That's that's very high temperature for them to do. Okay and we have the disinfection by this virulent byproducts chlorine and is common

464
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:01,600
is still common to use is cheaper is easier to use and the current oxide ozone

465
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:08,709
and then some I ever use them for macrolides for example here this is just most of

466
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:13,440
these human to watch human plants still use chlorine as a primary disinfectant.

467
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,890
Good for the primary disinfectant because it's easy to use is pretty effective.

468
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:31,460
And it's. But because of the disinfection byproducts and some of them, in fact, chlorine is not really effective like crypto.

469
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:40,250
Some of the difficulty they are using is better to use. For example, the chlorine is not really effective against the crypto.

470
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:46,220
Yeah, that's especially the crypto assist. That's the reason why we say in the email.

471
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:50,880
So we enforce most things to use chlorine for disinfection.

472
00:54:51,590 --> 00:55:01,310
Right. If you replace nails as crazy as with organic matter to produce, human ammonia to produce.

473
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:06,770
But that's not efficient for the people. Okay.

474
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:11,810
So you have to use, for example, ozone, U.V. ozone for a crypto disinfectant.

475
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:16,220
But for the swimming force, you cannot really use all all those complex.

476
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:22,530
Then you leave in a better choice is a better choice.

477
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,740
And that's some of the we talk about the this is the research for my lab.

478
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,710
We talk about the suspended cells and biofilms.

479
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:41,410
So a lot of times we talk about this is the in activities of free agency.

480
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:47,620
But this is a biofilm cells. If you can cure the cells sometimes become a really killer biofilms.

481
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:50,980
And here what we found is that's really the case.

482
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:59,170
If you look at this difficult efficiency, just an infection key here, it's difficult only if not only for the cure of my own use,

483
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:07,809
but as well, because the use application process, you can control the order, they can oxides, the other chemical compounds,

484
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:16,400
organic contaminants you can use some of the the that's one of the reason for example we use is the also

485
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:21,790
that are both we use to fit in earlier so that we can improve the computational filtration process,

486
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:33,370
remove the color. So disinfection again is not only just use for the microwave for the purpose, but for for the future.

487
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:36,850
What you mean for the problem? The the problem here is this five byproduct.

488
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:42,820
Since the defection also read to visit with the organic matters.

489
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:49,280
And then they produce these messages. Official coverage is here.

490
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:55,280
So if you have the balance here. Now, here are the micro rhythms for the peasants now.

491
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:59,480
Probably nothing because. So we'll have a balanced.

492
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,590
Okay. How about a short term bottom line that we can understand?

493
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:11,940
That's why we just increased competition for you to do the ones that are my focus on all the zooming for you.

494
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,520
This is the effect. So we cannot do that.

495
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:23,600
Okay. We can already do that. There's a balance you have to make. As a casualty we can think of so.

496
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:30,340
What's the alternative now? This practice is regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act.

497
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:33,790
What's the what's the alternatives for the drinking water treatment?

498
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:40,630
So some of you may at home that point of entry use of the devices.

499
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,300
For example, reverse osmosis, membrane filtration.

500
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:51,829
Some of the families use that process because if we don't have all this process, we have uses the membrane filtration process.

501
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:56,710
If you've got different kind of memory, reverse osmosis can always remove most of the iris in the water.

502
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:03,960
Okay. Use a reverse osmosis, some of some of the point of entry or part of use devices that we have.

503
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:08,160
We've got reverse osmosis membranes for people.

504
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:14,660
To remove all that. And then the cap. You know what? But unfortunately.

505
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:29,010
And the side effects. All of the choke on this technology is that the one you choose will remove all this contaminants with or coming to your remote.

506
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:34,120
And then you. Peter Balmforth sometimes there is for.

507
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:47,720
Okay. That's more of what you want to consume. For the reverse osmosis, for example, and reverse osmosis has some other potential drawbacks.

508
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:54,770
One of them is that they generate a lot of waste. They can only recover probably that once up to 50% of the water.

509
00:58:55,160 --> 00:59:00,680
For example, you have tap water running and then you run through the small spaces through through reverse osmosis.

510
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,760
About 50% of the water get lost. And you have to stretch the part 50 you can use.

511
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:09,940
And then the other thing is really the pitch. Casualties.

512
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:14,180
Sorry, this is membrane filtration to me, industrial scale.

513
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:17,930
But in fact some other places mount the deformation, for example, process.

514
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:21,550
A lot of places now use membrane technology for conservation process.

515
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:26,810
What they do it was a patch is now for six with a new.

516
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:34,160
That's good and a good word to use. Do you?

517
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:41,610
That includes a piece of the food supply. The ax.

518
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:48,500
Typically we tend to think, yes, you could replace.

519
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,530
So that's. They can.

520
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:58,360
Your test, the better of your system.

521
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:03,280
So if you have a reverse osmosis at home, you take the one or two cases.

522
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:09,459
I think the victim is is not equipped to do percent and the two no.

523
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:13,260
Is not good for your health either. Okay. So that's the one.

524
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:20,340
The reason we talk about cook substitutes don't get counting the subjects.

525
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:28,510
We. And then you've re added irradiation technology for the disinfection.

526
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:33,370
We'll talk about some people. I don't know any probably, but hopefully not.

527
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:37,880
Some people like to go to ten under the. You relied on the lights.

528
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,270
Okay, don't do that. Okay. Don't do that.

529
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:50,930
Because the U.V., although they say we use that, the UV light, maybe UVA, UVB, whatever, we can kill the bacteria already.

530
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:57,770
And by this overlap, it can kill the bacteria can also damage your own cells.

531
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:00,730
So everything is safe. Is not safe. Okay.

532
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:08,830
It's not safe if people are like content and then you have test and the second degree is much higher than the general public.

533
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:16,130
The population will want to because they use the same mechanism closely to the degree of bacteria.

534
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:22,550
Because you will. And then that's a reason we have this high rate of cancer.

535
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:27,980
So for the jury to read through to to to to inhibit the growth of the bacteria.

536
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:32,209
The other thing, because biological filtration process is not very common,

537
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:39,320
but they can use some of the places like like we talk about organic man has all these perchlorate or some or some contaminants.

538
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:44,460
They use biological process during the process. We use microbeads, degrade contaminants.

539
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:49,180
Okay. We use the microorganism pretty quickly. Then they allow study.

540
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:54,580
How can we promote the growth? Like if we use ozone for example, that you only disinfection.

541
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:02,470
Now we can promote the growth of bacteria on surface and then in the end we need to disinfect.

542
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:09,370
Okay, because you promote the growth. Now, what do you say you effect, you remove it, you forget even the consistency.

543
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:14,860
Okay, so that's the treatment to go out after the technology has been used and especially household.

544
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:20,950
Okay. So one thing I want to mention, some of the maybe you feel so at home.

545
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:26,170
Okay. I'll use a watch across the screen to prevent.

546
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:32,020
So yeah, yeah, yeah. Recovery is not necessary.

547
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:40,500
Okay. I don't think is necessary. But if you don't make a case like I did that you can you can remove, but you present,

548
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:45,550
you know, to get as frequent as possible of the device because otherwise.

549
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:52,880
This is how the bacteria develop grows their. Now you have again matters concentrated there.

550
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:57,160
And then that's a good place for the bacteria to grow. Okay.

551
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,730
Immature issues. Non-Point source pollution, imaging contaminants.

552
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:06,800
And one of the reasons one of these really is aging infrastructure and infrastructure.

553
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:11,120
And that's the the one of the big issues.

554
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:15,550
So next Monday, we'll talk about it.

555
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:21,950
We will discuss further about the flooding, the water crisis. That's one of the issues we have, especially for the future crisis.

556
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:27,390
Okay. You have the homework today?

557
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:32,070
Well, we're open. That's for public studies so that you can work on that.

558
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:36,730
Okay. Thanks. See you Monday.

559
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:40,330
Except that.
