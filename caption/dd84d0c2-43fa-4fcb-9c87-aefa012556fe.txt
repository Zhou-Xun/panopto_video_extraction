1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:22,840
Yeah. It's good. Be friends with her if you don't enjoy.

2
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:35,310
Okay. We?

3
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:42,350
These companions, vitamins. And how did you find your life?

4
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,120
No, no. Okay. Sometimes you just back.

5
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:59,700
Thanks, man. Right outside of SDH Now realize that there's something that there's nothing really.

6
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,050
From here. It was right across my head.

7
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,790
Oh, my God. What kind of I think you lack?

8
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,590
Yeah, I mean, here, you know, you. I can guarantee that I lost it.

9
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,850
Like, I don't know. Well, I have a very smart one for myself, you know?

10
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,260
But it was years on you lot. Yeah, well, that was the thing.

11
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:29,070
When I called the cops, he was like, Honestly, don't you think I would say, Oh, honey, that's pretty bad.

12
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,310
Have you ever been stolen by people back here?

13
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,520
They must be selling. And maybe they're probably taking them down to Detroit.

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,450
I called security at home by the shops.

15
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,540
I i against your house. You, you and your brother.

16
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,570
I really feel everybody's names in there.

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,540
The security of the right place are you have my done.

18
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,870
Well. It's not just, like, some little thing.

19
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:08,190
This is 2001. Yeah, there's one property and there's one here.

20
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,670
And what do you think it was like you said?

21
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,990
Yeah, but still. Yeah, that's a pretty publicity that you get.

22
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,880
So I. That's pretty cool. All right. Five areas completely live.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,620
Yeah. So, you know, and it's very upsetting.

24
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:32,680
My most prized possession. I'm keeping a look at it all the time.

25
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,530
Oh, my gosh. I mean, a lot of this is.

26
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:44,680
Yeah, every time I'm walking behind a bike lock stand there, just like I even was behind us, like, locked in a dumpster.

27
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,550
Yeah, I didn't see any other.

28
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,950
Rachel. I got some better seats in Parliament.

29
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:05,310
The government is going to have this meeting this morning.

30
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,450
All my interviews are the most for everyone tonight.

31
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:21,100
I remember right after it, and I was just I was making like this final before that, like, I was planning on leaving.

32
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,599
Like it or not, he's a planner.

33
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,360
So there's a there's no itinerary of the president going out through my chambers, but I figure,

34
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:41,740
yeah, I agree with you, but I think I would be if I was doing it, I tried to get the word out.

35
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:49,400
I saw it as a problem. And I just tried to tell you like, okay, so I'm just going to get in.

36
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,510
And I remember this happened last time I came home and I threw up.

37
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:07,510
Yeah, I think we're just going to have smokers and, like, outsiders that I'm just afraid of.

38
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:16,690
Yeah. We're getting closure order phase, which is like a quarter of.

39
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:22,810
It's like in the room. Yeah, yeah. So we gotta go for the better way of life.

40
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:30,070
So I thought that's what occurred with me. That's a bundle. A quarter of it is like a chunk of it.

41
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:37,630
So we're giving it a quarter of that because if you buy from like some random person,

42
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:47,920
it's like I think it's 60 bucks versus like individuals versus like a $6 for one of the nice, nice guys always do extremely well.

43
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,709
In fact, it is obviously a good deal.

44
00:04:50,710 --> 00:05:07,100
It seems like I like going to college and my son's ten, but I know I'm not like, All right, guys, we're going to get it started, but I got it.

45
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,360
That yes. You're like that.

46
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,399
All right. We're going to get started today.

47
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,200
We're going to do start our first actual systems pathology lecture.

48
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,430
So as I said last week, this is the second part of the course.

49
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,140
So we did our Jen have we have our foundation of what the basic changes are in tissue.

50
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:35,440
And today we're going to start talking about what that looks like in a specific organ systems, specifically the liver.

51
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:44,560
So last week we talked about what the what liver morphology looks like, what the structure of it looks like, and how that reflects liver function.

52
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:55,670
And today we're going to apply our basic theme of the class tissue injury, body response and resolution and see what that looks like in the liver.

53
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,169
And we're going to try to look at things that are both kind of acute injury.

54
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:05,650
So kind of early stage in that process versus something that's more ongoing.

55
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:13,390
And we've a couple of examples of that. I know some people were out at Michigan, so t last that was last week, right?

56
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:24,750
Last week. I hope that went well in Michigan. So if you have not viewed the lecture recording, the lecture recording should be up now.

57
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,090
So if you've not viewed that or looked at the PowerPoint,

58
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:34,000
things might be a little bit challenging today because we're going to look at actual slides of the liver and we're going to look at abnormal ones.

59
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,740
So without a good understanding of the normal, it's really hard to interpret the abnormal.

60
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,940
So if you have not gotten a chance to do that yet, today might be a little bit challenging.

61
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:49,210
But just make sure that you set yourself up with like a liver weekend or something and look at the normal and then do pathology.

62
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,230
Okay. So that'll be kind of important. I think, think, think.

63
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:59,499
Okay. So today we're going to do liver pathology, then we're trying to cover we've limited time in the class.

64
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,920
We're trying to cover four organ systems in in order to make that work.

65
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,620
Now, I've even been eased into it. Things get real next week because next week we're going to do kidney and we're

66
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,249
going to do sort of a normal in the first hour and the abnormal on the second day.

67
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:19,690
Our little bit condensed and then same thing with the lung the following week and the nervous system is a little bit complex.

68
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,860
So we're going to split that again into the two weeks. That's kind of where we stand.

69
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:33,430
Okay. I think what I want to say to you as far as the modules.

70
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,970
Okay. So that was the liver structure function module.

71
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,420
We had some a liver supplemental PowerPoint,

72
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:49,799
which was just quick pictures like really basic things that we talked about in the first half of the class, things like adaptation, like hyperplasia.

73
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,240
What does that look like? Basic stuff, what does necrosis look like?

74
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,260
So that's a nice kind of getting your eye used to what pathology looks like in an actual tissue.

75
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:06,030
So that was the supplemental PowerPoint. A couple of those pictures are in were in your quiz or in the one this week or can't remember which.

76
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,350
And then the review should be up for this week.

77
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,570
We have obviously the PowerPoint and then there's a review that's blank.

78
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:21,180
I know most of the review is from the first half of the course are just questions to guide you through the PowerPoint and don't have answers.

79
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:27,990
This one in the second half of the class we're interpreting actual slides and the review is just kind of guiding you through that,

80
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:35,310
but it doesn't have sort of the answers. After you take the quiz for this week, I have one that's kind of filled out.

81
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,909
So that one with a little calendar here is the same sheet of paper.

82
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:46,739
It just has some of the descriptions that we're going to do in class today so that, you know, you're feel free to take notes in class today,

83
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:54,209
but don't get too frantic about writing down every word that we say because it will be in the review answers.

84
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,830
And I really want you to try to, you know,

85
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:03,600
verbalize and participate in the discussion in class without having to worry too much about being, you know, a really fast scribe.

86
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,380
So that will become visible after the quiz from this week.

87
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,120
Okay. I think that's all I wanted to say there.

88
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,219
Your midterm almost done was trying to hope to be done by today.

89
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,910
But I think I need the extra weekend just to like read through for consistency.

90
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,900
But so far so good things are looking pretty good.

91
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,379
So hopefully I should have those for you by the beginning of next week.

92
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:34,290
So I'll send those out and then send out a little kind of overall description of, you know, the distribution and everything.

93
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:45,660
So that should be coming up. All right. Any questions about what we're doing, where we're going, quizzes, review sheets, anything of that nature?

94
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:54,180
All right. Let us give it a shot then. And unfortunately, we still don't have a screen.

95
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,020
So we have this irritating line in the middle of our slides.

96
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:06,719
In the second part where I'm showing the latter part, when I'm showing actual slides, we'll have to see how it projects.

97
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,180
It might actually project better if we go sort of conference room style and turn the lights off in the back of the room.

98
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:18,600
We'll see how that goes. I know that's very sleep inducing, but I'll with your eyes, go with this and I'll call on you and like, you're out.

99
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,770
All right, so let's do liver tox back. Okay, so this is we talked about this a little bit at the beginning.

100
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,520
If you remember, the language of toxicological pathology is primarily descriptive,

101
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:37,260
but there is a little bit of interpretation in the form of the Morphologic diagnosis.

102
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,509
So what we're going to do every time when we look at these slides is first we have

103
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:48,420
to go through the slide in a systematic way and describe the changes that we see.

104
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:56,190
So you sort of in your head painting a visual picture of what we see on the slide and walking our way up to an interpretation.

105
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,390
And I'll show you how we do that. We do that big to small.

106
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,489
We first obviously identify the organ, which will be easy now because we've only done the liver.

107
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:14,970
So there are going to be liver, but identify the organ and then talk about a big picture change and then walk our way to the more specific change.

108
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:20,399
So we're going to do that verbally step by step in sort of real pathology.

109
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,020
Sometimes that happens in your head.

110
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:29,610
It's a way of training your brain to look at the slides systematically, big to small, every single time so that you never miss anything.

111
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:35,759
And you're always going in an organized fashion. And what you're trying to do in that description is you're building the case.

112
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,370
Either if you're writing it out for somebody else or in your own head, you're building the case for that particular interpretation.

113
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:48,030
Okay? So it's like a way of thinking about tissue that's systematic, that's a morphologic description.

114
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,450
So it's a description based on morphology or based on form, right or vol morph means form.

115
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,020
So description based on the microscopic tissue changes.

116
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,220
And then the interpretation is a morphologic diagnosis.

117
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,780
So that's the interpretation of the microscopic tissue changes.

118
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:13,560
So again, it's a diagnosis based on morphology and you can think of it as kind of a summary of the tissue changes.

119
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,069
So I described all these things that I see that are different and that I

120
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:22,590
interpret that is necrosis or fibrosis or whatever my morphologic diagnosis is.

121
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,020
It's important,

122
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:34,950
particularly for sort of the medical diagnostic oriented among you to remember that a morphologic diagnosis and pathology is not necessarily the.

123
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:47,280
Same thing is cause. Okay, so there's only so many things the body can do, and every injurious agent doesn't have a unique pathologic finding.

124
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,920
Okay, so you can have a bunch of different toxins, all of which cause necrosis or all of which cause scarring.

125
00:12:54,340 --> 00:13:03,940
So the two conditions that have the same morphologic diagnosis, so the same tissue diagnosis may have different actual causes.

126
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:11,620
Okay. So here I have an example of this is a diagnostic morphologic diagnosis of broncho pneumonia.

127
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:18,340
So pneumonia is kind of a historic word, meaning inflammation of the lung, broncho pneumonia characterizes it.

128
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,640
So it's the inflammation of the lung around the bronchioles.

129
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,610
So there's an indication of something coming in through inhalation.

130
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:31,240
If we're in talks about the world, we might get a nice and descriptive inflammation per bronchial, nice, simple, easy.

131
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:36,669
That same lesion can be caused by a huge variety of things, and these are just a couple of them.

132
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:41,110
So it could be a bacterial cause of pneumonia. I stop looking ammonia.

133
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,670
It's a common type of pneumonia.

134
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:50,950
It could be a viral agent, you know, through inhalation coming in could be a chemical irritant, something that you inhale on a gaseous agent.

135
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,230
So the same or a different causes can have the same morphologic diagnosis.

136
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:02,200
So really, from a if you're in diagnostic pathology or if you're in diagnostic medicine,

137
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,750
the morphologic diagnosis is one aspect of what you're going to use to come up with a clinical diagnosis.

138
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:14,160
And in talks, Pat, the Morphologic diagnosis is used in conjunction with your other testing.

139
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:22,750
Maybe what you know about the metabolism of a compound, or if you have PCR data or some molecular data about molecular changes,

140
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,760
that is all going to play into your understanding of mechanism or of what a compound does.

141
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:32,380
Okay. So on Pathology World, we're very visually oriented based on the morphology.

142
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:38,560
So here we go. Morphologic diagnosis is based solely on what you see in the tissue.

143
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,180
So those could be growths or microscopic tissue changes.

144
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:48,850
So here I have an example. First of diagnostic pathology, you might describe something as colitis.

145
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:57,010
I just means inflammation, inflammation of the colon. Debra Now necrotizing is a great fancy word,

146
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:04,300
meaning that there's fibrin and necrosis and then talk about nice inflammation, promote colon it feel like.

147
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,820
So that's a morphologic diagnosis.

148
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:14,079
So it means something to pathologists, a clinical diagnosis, you know, like if you're an attending physician would be based on symptoms.

149
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,590
So maybe you have a patient exhibiting hemorrhagic diarrhea, right?

150
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:23,140
The disease diagnosis is the name of a disease based on all the findings.

151
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:32,530
So this constellation of findings might clinically be described as a pseudo membranous colitis, and that's based on the presence of fibrin.

152
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:40,389
It's not necessary for you guys to know and then all that stuff together as a physician, you go through your, you know,

153
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:46,120
your mind bank of different things that can cause a hemorrhagic fever or necrotizing pseudo membranous colitis.

154
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:53,530
And you think maybe this is C diff SELF-CUSTODY Ortiz difficile might have used to be called the stadium difficile,

155
00:15:53,530 --> 00:16:04,209
which is the generates a toxin that causes dissociation of the colonic enter sites and you get kind of a when we talked about fibrous inflammation,

156
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:11,740
you get what's called a pseudo membrane which is sloughed epithelial cells in the surface of the colon intermixed with inflammatory cells and fibrin.

157
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,520
So it's kind of characteristic to get a pseudo membranous colitis.

158
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:22,870
But again, these are all the different levels. So depending on what your role is in this process or what we're doing with the particular study,

159
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,280
you might be coming up with one or the other of these just remembering that morphology.

160
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,820
What we're doing in this class is based solely on what you see. Okay, so that's Morphologic diagnosis, right?

161
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:41,860
And I said, you're going to walk your way up to this by describing the tissue in a very controlled sort of systematic way.

162
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:47,410
So when you're learning to do morphologic description, you learn to do it big to small.

163
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:56,830
And so the kind of basic way of doing it is this five sentence ish, depending on the complexity of the lesion, five sentence or five topic method.

164
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,180
So the first thing when you're looking at a slide is to identify the organ.

165
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,719
I mean, a lot of times you'll know what the organ is taken from, you'll know what you're looking at.

166
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,630
But you always want to confirm, does this look like what I expect?

167
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:16,030
And so some of the I think we've talked before, some of the ways microscopically you identify an organ,

168
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:20,230
you can kind of split it into things that are solid or things that are tubular.

169
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:26,920
So if it's a tubular thing that has a wall and has some sort of inner lining, that makes it relatively simple.

170
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,000
So it's either going to be gut or perhaps portions of the reproductive tract.

171
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,840
If it's a solid organ, usually there are.

172
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,920
Structural aspects of it that will point you towards an identification.

173
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:47,990
So the liver is a solid organ if you're looking at it histologically, but it has structures like we learned last week, like the central vein, right.

174
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,200
And the portal triad that help us identify what it is.

175
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,800
And next week, we'll learn what some structures are to help us identify the kidney.

176
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:01,730
But when you have that first panic moment, if I'm showing you an image to think, okay, solid or tubular, and that's going to start you off.

177
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,230
So identify the organ. This is a section of liver.

178
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,280
So often we have a sentence that just identifies what we're looking at.

179
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:15,860
Then we're going to look broadly across the entire tissue at a low magnification

180
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:21,020
and come up with a broad description of what is the basic change that's going on.

181
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,120
So again, that can be actually a couple of sentences if it's a complicated organ,

182
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,800
but basically it entails a systematic screen, a little map of all parts of the organ.

183
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,849
So going to look at the central thing here and to look over on and look at the central veins.

184
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,270
I'm going to look at the portal triads. I'm going to try to see is something different?

185
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,990
Is it in a particular location? What is the basic change?

186
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:48,020
And one way I like to think of this that makes a little bit easier. I have like I told you, I have another slide.

187
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,530
That's all a pathology is. Just something added, something lost, something changed.

188
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,250
So I have in my mind's eye, I've learned sort of what a liver looks like.

189
00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:01,100
And I look at my little Mac picture and I try to decide, okay, how does this look compared to the normal?

190
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,179
Is there something added here? Is there an infiltrating cell population?

191
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,930
Is something bigger or distorted? Is it a something added lesion?

192
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:14,450
Is something lost? Am I missing something that should be there or something there?

193
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,780
But it looks kind of funky. Something changed. Okay,

194
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:24,080
so when you're learning one kind of nice way of getting that broad category

195
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,570
description is just look at distribution and maybe you don't know what that changes,

196
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,700
but maybe there's something you can say that's pretty generic, like, okay,

197
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,170
so this is a section of liver and multifocal and we'll talk about distribution.

198
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,330
That means in lots of different areas, multifocal, there's cellular alteration.

199
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:52,490
So like cells are kind of funny and that's a broad description, just saying that this lesion is distributed kind of in a multifocal way,

200
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,990
or maybe you're seeing a little aggregate of cells that don't look right in one area.

201
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,440
So vocally, there's an infiltrating population of cells.

202
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,450
So you haven't really diagnosed anything yet, but you're just saying, okay, I'm going to zoom in here.

203
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,880
All right. So there's a broad overarching sentence and then there's a specific description

204
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,450
where you're going to give particular features that help you identify the process.

205
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,950
So my focal example, this is a section of liver locally.

206
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:25,190
There's an infiltrating population of cells, I don't know, in one lobe.

207
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:34,819
And then specific description, these cells have a higher nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio.

208
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,300
They have prominent a clear line in some other things.

209
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:45,590
And then I'm kind of describing the cells moving towards a diagnosis, diagnosis that I can interpret.

210
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,979
So after my so that might give me an idea what the particular type of cells are.

211
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:59,280
So these cells are consistent with neoplastic hepatocytes making something up often that there

212
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:04,130
is a primary process which I've described here are often their secondary changes as well.

213
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,860
So maybe I have something infiltrating and around it.

214
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:13,280
The cells are being compressed, for example, and I have fibrosis, so I think that's secondary to the infiltrating population.

215
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:22,850
So I might have a secondary sentence that says a disc like there were also compressed hepatocytes and fibrosis around the area of infiltration.

216
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:31,549
So I'm painting a picture big broad description, specific description, which is the main attraction, secondary changes, and then a summary.

217
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,780
Identify the process.

218
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:42,260
This is consistent with, I don't know, whatever my example was, the parasite or carcinoma, if it's vocal is probably had a cellular adenoma.

219
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:46,100
So walking my way up so that's the description.

220
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,350
Yeah. And I was going to say about that.

221
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:58,819
So when you're learning, we do this very explicitly because you're training your mind to do that sort of in real pathology.

222
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:03,860
Sometimes this happens very quickly in your head and you are going pretty quickly to a morphologic diagnosis.

223
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:09,530
But we're going to walk our way through our slides like this that we train our brains to look at things systematically.

224
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:17,780
A word about distribution. I said that the second sentence is often giving a broad distribution of the general change.

225
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:26,090
Okay, the distribution has two aspects. It has a general aspect that uses pretty generic words like focal.

226
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,710
So is there something just in one corner, one area of the slide or of the tissue?

227
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,420
Multifocal, where I have lots of little foci.

228
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,050
All over the tissue locally extensive.

229
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,959
You know, maybe I have things a little bit bigger and out of focus,

230
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,240
but just concentrated in this instance in one lobe or something that's wide spread.

231
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,040
It's just distributed throughout the tissue.

232
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:55,930
There are little variants of this, but for the most part, if you if you can narrow things down to focal multifocal,

233
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,680
kind of locally extensive or widespread, that already tells you a lot.

234
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,460
So that's a general distribution that applies to any tissue.

235
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:09,790
But in an individual tissue, there are also distribution aspects that can kind of point you a little bit towards cause.

236
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:16,510
Okay. So you remember last week when we talked about the liver, we put a lot of time into talking about blood flow rate,

237
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,890
how it flow, how blood enters the liver and the portal triads flows towards the central vein.

238
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:28,660
We talked about distribution of metabolizing enzymes, how p450 is are higher around zone three or around the central vein.

239
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:36,400
So in addition to the general distribution, you also want to characterize where a lesion is in relation to key structures of that tissue.

240
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:42,910
Okay. So in the liver, the important things are, is the lesion in the central lobular areas.

241
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:49,950
So maybe I have something that's multifocal central lobular, something everywhere around the central veins or in zone three.

242
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,570
That's what the lesions look like. Maybe I have something that's a portal or para ace and ah, that's around those portal triads.

243
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:03,850
Or kind of an unusual lesion is something that's mid zonal just kind of between the two or maybe it's just random.

244
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,150
There's no particular pattern I can't associate with the vascular structures.

245
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:14,200
And that can actually give me a lot of information if I think about the morphology of the liver and how that related to function.

246
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:19,620
Okay. So there's usually two aspects to distribution. Okay.

247
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,920
So you've done your description of your distribution.

248
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:28,300
You have kind of the description big to small, and then you're trying to come up with a morphologic diagnosis or a summary of the tissue changes.

249
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:35,110
And there are four components to this. Of these, by far the very most important one is the process.

250
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,810
Okay. So you're going to try to identify a basic process.

251
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:42,220
Is it inflammatory? Neoplastic is a degenerative. What is it?

252
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:51,760
And then some characterizing words. So these are severity, mild, moderate, severe distribution we just talked about.

253
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,940
It has two different aspects. And duration.

254
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,000
Is this an acute lesion that this just happened?

255
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:05,560
Has my tissue not had time to have all the responding, you know, inflammatory influx or not had time to have fibrosis?

256
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:11,350
Is this a chronic process? Like do I have areas where I have acute changes and chronic?

257
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:15,580
So that says that maybe I'm having continual exposure, for example, to a toxicant.

258
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:23,170
So duration can be important. And to figure out duration, you're going to have to remember all the stuff we talked about in the first half about the,

259
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,940
you know, the order, the body injury, tissue response and resolution.

260
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:34,480
Okay. So here's an example. There's a diagnostic examples that hepatitis inflammation of the liver.

261
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:40,570
And I've characterized that process a little bit. I'm saying if the lymphocytic hepatitis does, that gives me a little clue.

262
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:45,160
Maybe this is an immune driven process. And then I have my descriptive words.

263
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,880
So this one is Multifocal and Perry Portal.

264
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:56,620
And with this inflammatory lesion per a portal tells me that maybe this is due to something coming up from the gut.

265
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:03,759
So if you've chronic inflammation in the gut, one thing that can often happen is bacteria or bacterial toxins can kind of creep up

266
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,810
the portal vein system and they're going to enter the liver in the portal areas.

267
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:16,030
So that is very common and that's an antigen, right? So it's very commonly a reason for lymphocytes to sort of target that portal area.

268
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:23,890
So kind of chronic inflammation in the gut can lead to a chronic hepatitis in the liver or immune related processes.

269
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:29,200
And then I'm calling this chronic because if it's predominantly linked to sick,

270
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:34,540
that implies that things have been around long enough for me to sensitize my lymphocytes and get a response.

271
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:41,950
Okay. So that's diagnostic and then talks about very similar, except we're just going to use the word inflammation.

272
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:48,750
This is kind of a generic word that means as opposed to neutrophils, this means lymphocytes and macrophages.

273
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,050
Kind of a generic word. Okay, I have another one.

274
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:57,080
Yeah. So how we will do these in this class?

275
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:02,559
So in kind of regular pathology, they always get all like this, which gets a little intimidating.

276
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:10,360
And I find when you do them like this, people get sort of stuck with the words here, like they're just in their severe mild, I don't know.

277
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:15,879
But what I care about most is the process. So for your review sheets and as we do it in class,

278
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:22,530
I kind of give you a little grid like this and I'm looking for you to first, most of them concentrate on the process.

279
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,110
We're learning how to do these. We've learned to recognize the process.

280
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:31,720
So identify the basic process. Next, most important thing is the distribution.

281
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:36,320
Okay. So you're going to identify. Multifocal as a portal.

282
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:41,450
What have you. And then the next most important thing is this an acute or a chronic lesion?

283
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:46,220
Okay. There's a lot of kind of subtleties to duration words.

284
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:53,420
So I put a couple that you might see there for the most part in this class, but I care most about is that you can recognize acute versus chronic.

285
00:27:53,810 --> 00:28:00,830
Okay. So we don't have to get too fancy with that. And then like a severity in this class is almost unimportant because most of the

286
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,490
things I'm showing you are at least moderate because it's easier to learn that.

287
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,680
So I don't care as much about that. But, you know, just to complete the sequence, you can kind of throw one of those in there.

288
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:20,300
Okay. So most important component. So when I'm teaching like my veterinary residence or like about students or giving med school classes,

289
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:25,009
the temptation to look at a slide and everybody does this. But I do this myself in my head.

290
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:31,700
People just want to jump right to a cause and show that common history of and you know, if you're an experienced pathologist,

291
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:37,159
like part of your head is doing that just because you have a good library in your head of what the lesions are.

292
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:43,370
And you can do that. But it is important to at least do the exercise of walking your way through it because there are.

293
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,610
Mm. And especially in diagnostic pathology, you know,

294
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:51,260
first pass through if you're coming up with the most likely cause, but there's a chance that that might not be it.

295
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:56,990
And when that happens, you have to go back to first principles and think, okay, what else could cause a fiber now?

296
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,340
Necrotizing colitis? Why isn't this showing up as positive for receipt of toxin?

297
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:10,220
What else could be going on here? So remember, the reason that we don't jump right to a cause is we're trying to keep that systematic progression.

298
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:19,130
We remember that the same morphologic changes may result from different causes, and the point of the Morphologic diagnosis is to identify the process.

299
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:26,660
Okay, so that's a starting point in diagnostic pathology for cause and in experimental pathology or toxicology,

300
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,690
that can be a starting point for mechanism. Okay.

301
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,620
So we have things perhaps in the zone three area and a liver.

302
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:41,990
Maybe we're thinking, okay, could this be hypoxia driven? Could this be metabolism driven if it's p450, enzyme activity.

303
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:48,080
So other information is often necessary to really narrow down what the true cause or mechanism is.

304
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:55,489
And in experimental pathology. And really usually if it's assuming that it is a compound related finding,

305
00:29:55,490 --> 00:30:00,740
usually we know the cause because we give it to the animal, but we don't always know the mechanism.

306
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:08,540
Okay. So keeping the terminology descriptive like that allows us to kind of really keep it basic pathophysiology

307
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:16,699
and identify basic processes that may downstream help us identify the mechanism or propose a mechanistic,

308
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:24,860
testable hypothesis. Okay. So we're going to try to stay descriptive and we're going to try to walk our way through, as tempting as it is to jump.

309
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,150
All right. So exciting is my favorite part. Slides.

310
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:36,480
So I'm very disappointed in the stupid line and I'm disappointed in the lack of a screen and what might happen.

311
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:42,210
I'm going to show you a slide in a second. You might want to try. We might try switching the lights off and back and seeing how it goes.

312
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:47,060
This one's easy, but you'll see. So this is an example of normal liver.

313
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:53,630
So the refresher we talked about, the liver structure has different vascular structures, has globules.

314
00:30:53,930 --> 00:31:00,500
It has cords or sheets of a well, they're all and little cords of hepatocytes line by sinusoidal.

315
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:08,060
And. Right. What I do here, right smack in the middle of this thing is kind of you because I have a higher amount of this.

316
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:14,550
Okay. Right smack in the middle of this thing. I have a structure that I've zoomed in on here.

317
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:22,340
They remember what this whole thing might be from this young adult, from the coral triad.

318
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:28,470
Right. And we call Triad had three different things. So it has a big thing here with red stuff in it.

319
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:32,340
Portal. Portal vein, which is coming up from the intestine.

320
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:38,410
That's the substrate blood. Right. And then what's this thing category?

321
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:44,910
Yeah, it's harder to recognize. It's tiny. Remember we said that it's smaller, usually smaller diameter than the portal vein.

322
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,780
It's. I know it's hard to recognize, but it has a small, muscular coating.

323
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:55,350
And these little guys are the endothelial cells. And because, you know, it's an animal that died, all you see in it now is serum.

324
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,710
But that's bringing the oxygenated blood to the liver.

325
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:04,280
And that leaves this thing line by cuboid epithelium, the bile duct.

326
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:11,550
So the bile duct or the bile duct, your. And remember we said that that pulls the blood, eventually goes to the common bile duct.

327
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,980
And then we also mentioned that these are little lymphatics. Kind of ignored them trying to keep it pretty simple.

328
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,260
But this is the portal triad. Okay.

329
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,020
And then you can see the parasites in those cords and sinusoidal between.

330
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,860
Okay. And then I didn't show you a high mag, but the other thing is the central vein, which is just one structure.

331
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,720
Okay. Here's our first pathology. All right. Do you want.

332
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:44,500
How does that look? Do you guys want to try it in the back with lights offering for you?

333
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,560
Okay. Or what do you think? Is it better?

334
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:54,600
Okay. All right. Just kind of shape each other. Okay.

335
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:59,790
All right. So this is our first pathology. Okay.

336
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:04,540
Good. So this is a mouse that was in the high dose group of a study.

337
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,090
And so this is our big picture view. I'm going to show you kind of normal liver.

338
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,669
So there's your reminder of what normal liver looks like. And so you're going to orient yourself here.

339
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:18,749
We know liver because of the liver lecture. But even if you didn't, this is a solid organ.

340
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:22,020
Right. And it has some structures in. It has this thingy.

341
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,920
It has. Sorry, running over here, this thingy.

342
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,599
So you can kind of orient yourself. And I'm going to go forward a little higher, Matt.

343
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,330
And then we'll go back and come up with a nice, big descriptive sentence.

344
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:40,170
So looking at this versus that, you're already kind of getting a sense is there something different?

345
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:45,510
Is there something added? Is there something changed? And I'm going to go a little bit higher, magnification.

346
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:52,560
So this was that thing in the middle. So there's this structure versus cells around it.

347
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:56,310
And then here's another area with a structure. In the middle is the cells around it.

348
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,220
Okay. So now we're going to go back. I'm going to try to come up with a nice big picture sentence that give you a.

349
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:09,710
Oh, yeah. Okay. So the easy thing is your ID identify the section and this is the section of liver.

350
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,180
Obviously, it doesn't even matter if you don't use passwords.

351
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:19,350
Does anyone want to take a first pass at like what is different about this compared to the normal one?

352
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,919
What does it look like? Don't worry about path words.

353
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:28,740
Like even if you're just like something's paper, something's purple or anybody want to give a shot.

354
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:38,460
What do you think? It kind of looks like there's kind of some parts of it that are like in the normal one, it's kind of the same color.

355
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:46,319
Mm hmm. So it's very uniform in the normal one. Yes. And this one, it's got kind of patches and it's purple.

356
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,580
And what were the other what's like if you had to describe the other color? It's more pink, right?

357
00:34:51,120 --> 00:35:00,630
And the good and where. Okay. So remembering back to structures of the liver, can you see any pattern to the color changes?

358
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:07,490
So what do you guys think? This is from The Guardian.

359
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:13,720
Yeah, this is a portal, right? So it has a portal vein, a bile duct problem, probably.

360
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:18,250
And then somewhere in there is a paddock artery. Probably too tiny for us to see. So this is a portal triad.

361
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:21,970
Right. So around that is zone one. What's that?

362
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,520
That remains by itself. So orienting yourselves there.

363
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:31,210
And here's another portal, triad. There's another portal triad.

364
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:35,590
That's a larger diameter central vein. That's the central vein.

365
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,610
So having orientate yourself, what can you say about.

366
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:45,460
So we said that there is a a cellular alteration, so some of the cells are more pink.

367
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:54,350
Where is that predominant? Predominantly. What do you think? So again, I set out some three zone three.

368
00:35:54,350 --> 00:36:00,410
And so what is the change in zone three? Is that the more pink or the more purple or pink?

369
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,640
Yeah, the pink is change.

370
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:11,770
So if we had to come up, so is it in one central vote or like what's our general word for distribution, uniform or multifocal?

371
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,610
Multifocal. Yeah, because we start with the whole thing. Is it pink, right?

372
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,100
It's multifocal. And then our tissue specific word is central object.

373
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:28,549
Okay, so this is a section of liver and then we're going to go pretty broad with our first sentence.

374
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:38,900
So we're doing baby step pathology. So multifocal in central lobular areas or in zone three, if you prefer, that terminology does really matter.

375
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:47,030
There is a cellular alteration. Okay, so that's our broad sentence.

376
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:54,740
So I'm going to dove down now to broccoli in zone three or Central Lobular where there's a cellular alteration.

377
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,370
All right. So now the next slides, we're going to look at a first.

378
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:03,740
So that's around that central vein and then we'll look at B, so this is A, so this is the pink thing.

379
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:09,320
Okay. So now we're going to have a sentence that describes what the cellular alteration is.

380
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:14,270
So in this in the central lobular area, what can you tell me about the hepatocytes?

381
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,580
You already said that they're pink. What's our pathology word for being really pink in February?

382
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:24,170
It's in Ophelia. So the affected cells are hyper eosinophilic. So I have a okay.

383
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:33,350
There is like the normal. So let's try to imagine a single parasite here trying to grow around it versus like this.

384
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,740
So what else can you tell me about those cells? They're hybrids.

385
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:41,600
And if you look what else is different about them from the normal, you have the weird nucleus.

386
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:48,320
And can you characterize weird a little more? Here, I'll put you on for you.

387
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:53,150
Well, okay. I'll point to one for you. Yeah.

388
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:59,659
What am I missing? Some are gone. And then what about these from Amber?

389
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:04,430
You are on the right track here. But don't worry about your work.

390
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:08,030
Yes, they like. Yeah, these are multiple.

391
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:11,120
So, like, if you wanted to do a password, it's Carrie, a Lexus.

392
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,380
It's wrecked, broken apart. And Carrie. Carrie, it's Carrie.

393
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:20,650
Carrie. Right, but that's fragmented. So the descriptive part is it's fragmented here.

394
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:25,070
This stuff, the little ones, and then all the people yelling but of this is true.

395
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,829
It's condense very go. Right. Okay.

396
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:36,559
So in affected areas, the hepatocytes are hyper eosinophilic, they're swollen and there are nuclear changes, including nuclear.

397
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:47,930
I mean, you can be very clean and simple nuclear loss, carrier lysis, nuclear fragmentation, carrier axis and nuclear condensation, thicknesses.

398
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:56,450
Okay, so you've described to me what's happening. And now this is actually the first the major change in this tissue.

399
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:01,969
So like by now your brain is like, I know this one, so now you can do an interpretation.

400
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:07,460
So this is consistent with what, necrosis cell death, right?

401
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,130
So we have cell cell death in a zone three,

402
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:19,280
but we're going to look we're going to complete our review and we're going to see if there isn't something additional or an ancillary change.

403
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,640
So here we are in the portal area. Okay.

404
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:29,030
So one very simple way of saying this is there is also change that was good since throw in there.

405
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:34,910
So are there are also. So what do you mean what the hepatocytes in the para portal area.

406
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:39,409
They're, they're normal guys again. I mean this is, this is very severely affected.

407
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,880
So it's kind of creeping up in here.

408
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:47,870
But if you look at just the ones where you can still see nuclei, do those look normal to you or do they also have something going on?

409
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,830
There's a lot of fatty deposits for the evacuation.

410
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:56,090
So, yeah, some of those are look like adipose, like fat.

411
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:59,720
Some of them are a little bit more loosey goosey, maybe some hydrophobic change.

412
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:03,980
Remember, what have we have water influx and it gives you like a less distinct vacuole.

413
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:10,310
So there is also a vacuum relation, let's say a hepatocytes.

414
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,730
And then we have our disperse our location in the power portal area.

415
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,400
So remember we talked about reversible injury and irreversible injury.

416
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:26,810
So if I'm speaking in general terms, these cells are not dead, right, because they're still of nuclei.

417
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:32,960
So if I'm speaking in general terms, if I want to say that these cells are injured but still alive, I could call that degeneration.

418
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:38,960
So I could say in per portal era, there is also the parasite population consistent with degeneration.

419
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:49,740
So in this liver, I have dead hepatocytes in the central lobular area in zone three.

420
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,710
And then I have the parasites that are kind of sickly but not not doing too great, but still holding on in pair of portal areas.

421
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:03,030
So my brain not suggesting to me that I have something that's preferentially or more severely affecting the ones in zone three.

422
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:11,160
Okay. And I have my two diagnostic sentences like this is consistent in necrosis and this is consistent with degeneration.

423
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:16,830
Right. Did you have a question for BE is that bottom left kind of structure?

424
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,870
Is that an oversell train and all that kind of thing?

425
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,210
Yeah, that was a little hard to say. It might be probably.

426
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:30,150
I mean, the mouse, I mean, mice often have like they'll take any excuse to make all the cells so hard to say

427
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:35,430
whether it might actually just be a crunched up bile duct if that were consistent.

428
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:36,929
Like if I'm seeing that everywhere,

429
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:46,760
I might incorporate over hyperplasia and that would actually change my timeline a little bit because in an acute stage if I'm just having necrosis,

430
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:52,770
but you know, the liver is totally fine and then I hit it with something hard, like it's going to take some time for overzealousness.

431
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:56,340
But I mean, I'm obviously showing you a pretty cherry picked photo here.

432
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:00,120
I would have to decide if that were consistent enough before I would call that.

433
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:07,310
But that does look similar to what Oval Cell Hypoplasia looks like. I wasn't going to say I can remember a lot of companies.

434
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:13,410
Okay. So Morphologic diagnosis. So this is kind of the grin that I give you guys for most of the ones I'm showing you.

435
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:20,760
And because that can be different complexities, I'll usually give you a number to tell you sort of how many processes I'm looking for.

436
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,280
Like the next one we look at is going to have a lot of processes.

437
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,490
This one, it has one main process and then it has like kind of the ancillary change, which is really just a gradient.

438
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:33,780
So if I just put I I'll ask you just for one if it's just a simple thing.

439
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:41,490
So if we're doing our morphologic diagnosis, what's our basic process for using you guys already necrosis?

440
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:49,860
And then our distribution was multifocal central lobular or zone three, whatever you prefer.

441
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:54,330
And then what do we have? We have our duration. Oops, I should have asked you that.

442
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:03,059
So if we think back at that slide, this guy, so there's broken up nuclei,

443
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:08,910
things in here and like this can be a little bit difficult when you're starting out because I told you inflammation looks like pepper looks.

444
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:15,240
I'm going through a bunch of random cells on the slide. This one doesn't really actually have a lot of inflammation.

445
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,290
It's pretty acute. Most of the blue things here are the hepatocytes.

446
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:25,290
I don't really have aggregates of infiltrating inflammatory cells, so this is pretty early in the lesion.

447
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:30,510
This is actually a pretty acute lesion. It doesn't even really have an inflammatory infiltrate.

448
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:37,800
If it did, I would have to decide whether the inflammatory infiltrate our neutrophils would be an acute lesion.

449
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:45,780
Right. The acute responders, or if it was something more chronic like do have macrophages in here already gobbling up.

450
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:50,609
And I'll tell you that like if you were if this mouse were to survive, what would happen?

451
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:59,549
All these cells are dead. This is going to have eventually a lot of macrophage inflammation in here, macrophages gobbling up all that,

452
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:03,600
and then all those other things like might increase mitotic rate over cells come in.

453
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:09,360
This is very severe. Like this would be the equivalent of someone, you know,

454
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:14,879
having acute liver toxicity where you either need to be on support or you might even need a liver transplant.

455
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:23,100
This is very, very severe. Yes. Do we assume with any of these examples that it's like a toxicant?

456
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:27,569
It's never like a like a, uh, injury.

457
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:34,020
That's like, no, it could be so, like the way I'm going to be doing it and will do that in like 1/2 I'm going to ask,

458
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:38,550
knowing that the same morphologic change can have different causes.

459
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,880
Usually I'm going to have you walk your way up to a description,

460
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,890
and then I'm going to ask you to give me one example of an injurious agent that can cause this.

461
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:50,820
Okay? So you can, if you like a toxicant, you can use the examples we give in class.

462
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,970
If you have something else that you like that causes the same thing, you can use that.

463
00:44:54,390 --> 00:45:00,870
So I'm going to kind of honor the fact that, you know, it would be pretty artificial for me to be like, what caused this in this mouse?

464
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,630
Because there's like 100 things that could cause this.

465
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:11,210
But I just want you to understand the concept of the type of lesions or the type of agents that would cause something like this.

466
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:19,350
So, okay, where where did this acute. So I said there's no if there was like chronic inflammation in this, right.

467
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:26,400
Macrophages and lymphocytes, then we move towards chronic or if there were scarring fibrosis, then I know this is chronic.

468
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:37,710
Right. And remember that if you have things that are hurting the liver again and again, you can have a lesion that has acute areas and chronic.

469
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:46,410
Okay. But in your more. When you see that, the basic gist of it is that that is indicative of a chronic injury.

470
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:54,030
So even if I have necrosis over here and fibrosis over here, that's telling me that the liver is subject to continual injury.

471
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:59,140
So my morphologic diagnosis is going to cause call the duration chronic pain.

472
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:05,160
So if you see fibrosis, you know it's chronic. If you see chronic inflammatory cells, lymphocytes or macrophages, you know it's chronic.

473
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:10,290
Okay. And then it was pretty severe. But who cares about that? Because I'm not showing you that.

474
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:18,210
Okay. So this is what I was talking about. So then I would ask you something like, okay, what's one potential cause and pathogenesis?

475
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:23,820
So, okay, so this is a toxicology class. I showed you an acute liver toxin.

476
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:28,290
So anyone want to suggest something that could cause acute liver toxicity?

477
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:39,960
There's a lot of things. What's like like in in what's like a common like in applied toxicology, like a liver poisoning thing?

478
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:47,340
Can people take an overdose of medicine or something and they end up, I don't know, acetaminophen, the classic liver toxicant.

479
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:52,740
Good thing you said that because that's the example. Yeah, it's more.

480
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,639
Yeah, there's I mean, the other thing I would encourage you, like, you know,

481
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:02,520
go back to Catherine Duel or whatever your favorite talks textbook is and look at some examples of like liver toxic.

482
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,979
And so then it'll tell you a little bit about the mechanism.

483
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:11,340
Does it go through P450 and then you can relate that, oh yeah, I saw a liver that has central lobular necrosis.

484
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:18,630
So like you can kind of expand your knowledge to other toxicants that affect the liver and now you have an idea of the tissue change.

485
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:25,350
So like I said, for each of these, I'm going to ask you to learn for a for the lesion.

486
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:31,350
I show you like one agent that could cause that. And you absolutely can use acetaminophen because that's what we're going to go over.

487
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:34,530
If you have some other one you want to investigate, you go for it.

488
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,269
So do you guys remember you probably have done this for the folks and talks and some of your other classes.

489
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:43,110
What, the metabolism. So acetaminophen, Tylenol.

490
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:47,340
It's a couple of different things to remember when you have metabolism.

491
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:52,460
So ordinarily acetaminophen come on side.

492
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,849
Ordinarily acetaminophen when it's ingested gets metabolized by conjugating enzymes, right?

493
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:08,220
So phase two, so acetaminophen through the activity of guarana, cell transfer is kind of like chronic acid added.

494
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,570
So that's going to make it more soluble and then it can be excreted through the kidney.

495
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:18,000
And ordinarily, that's probably the more common pathway for acetaminophen metabolism,

496
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:23,280
just that there are some good chronic acid on there and excrete it regionally.

497
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:28,890
Okay. Also you could use Sobel Transferase is to add a sulfate group.

498
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:33,660
This pathway is a little bit more common in children and there's certain ethnic groups for this is more common,

499
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:43,110
but that's another conjugating pathway. So the ordinary metabolism of acetaminophen is via phase two metabolism conjugating metabolism, right?

500
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:48,060
And it gets excreted that way, but these pathways can get saturated.

501
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:52,510
So, you know, maybe you took a lot of acetaminophen or maybe you have something else going on.

502
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:55,530
And these are being, you know, doing other things.

503
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:03,960
So the proportion of acetaminophen that cannot be metabolized via that pathway is subject to phase one metabolism.

504
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:09,630
Right? So phase one, we said this oxidizing or hybridizing and creating functional groups.

505
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,260
So through the activity of cytochrome p450,

506
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:23,490
you can get a toxic intermediate so that PUI is a reactive intermediate or reactive metabolite of acetaminophen.

507
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:28,590
And so cytochrome p450 is activated this and now it wants to bind with something.

508
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:35,700
Okay. And ideally what would happen is to define on the great protector of the body will come along and get conjugated.

509
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:42,330
So then you're still okay because now we're just going to try to refine it on there and now it's water soluble and can be excreted.

510
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,860
So that's kind of what you want to have happen. So most of it, a metabolism goes through here.

511
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:53,640
So, you know, 50% or more and then a small percentage through cytochrome p450 metabolism.

512
00:49:54,090 --> 00:50:02,340
But where things can be problematic is if you have a large amount of acetaminophen that, like I said, saturates your conjugating pathways.

513
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:09,570
And then if a lot of that goes through cytochrome p450, you have a lot of Napoli and you're in the cell.

514
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:15,600
So what can happen is that rather than having glutathione and conjugated, maybe you're going to find levels are saturated as well.

515
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:21,450
This can bind to proteins. Usually this is a protein binder, but other things as well.

516
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:28,560
But typically Napoli is going to bind to proteins in the cell and depending on which proteins and how many, that can be a pathway to cell death.

517
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:35,129
Okay. So typically it's generation through cytochrome p450 or this toxic intermediate that

518
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:39,780
binds perhaps to proteins and and deposits reticulum to proteins in the mitochondria.

519
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:46,580
Enzymes in the cytoplasm, basically shutting the cell down because the enzymes have been bound and can't perform their function.

520
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:56,810
So the pathway of acute toxicity like Tylenol toxicity is via cell death by binding of this toxic intermediate.

521
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,100
Okay, so that is acetaminophen, very classic.

522
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:05,540
Often the one that people use to teach like phase one of phase two metabolism.

523
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:16,960
So that's one potential pathogenesis, which every time it's different.

524
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,510
All right. I'm going to keep going. I know it's getting close.

525
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:25,069
Feel free to step out if you need to grab a water or something.

526
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:29,000
But I'm going to try to keep going to not lose our momentum. Okay.

527
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:37,340
So this is tissue from a cow. Are large animals not a common species, but tissue from a cow.

528
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:41,150
Okay. So and there is the liver, the normal liver in the corner.

529
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:45,650
Okay. And we're going to look across I'm going to show you a couple of pictures of them to kind of go back.

530
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:54,230
And so just orient you. This one's kind of you're following the Triads longitudinally, but here's your ginormous portal triad.

531
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,730
Central veins are harder to pick out here. There's one. There's one.

532
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:02,839
This is probably still part of that same core triad, but there's liver.

533
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:07,350
And so this one looks kind of funky. Kind of patchy. And here's another one here.

534
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:12,980
This one also has that kind of patchwork appearance. Has this weird crop circles in here?

535
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:17,030
Has these around nodular areas also? Okay.

536
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,420
Yeah. We'll go back. Okay. So big picture. So it's a section of liver.

537
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:27,680
What would you say? How would you. If I were struck?

538
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:32,540
If I were you? Talk to me on the phone. I want to describe this to me. What would you say is your big picture sentence for anything?

539
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:38,130
Something added, something more. Something changed. We'll take a stab at it.

540
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:45,150
I went back. Do you think so?

541
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:51,150
Look, forget the passwords. Forget everything. Just like how does this picture look different from that picture?

542
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,050
So there's not just that. There's not just structures.

543
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:58,620
Yeah. Present in the normal tissue.

544
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:03,810
Yeah. So we have some nodular structures and I don't know if that red chunk.

545
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,190
Oh, oh, that's normal. Or just. Just. Let's just see the blood.

546
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:12,090
Yeah. So this is blood. So that's not as much. What do you think about the hepatic?

547
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:20,570
Here's a not here's a different image. Maybe that's better. So what do you think of overall hepatocyte appearance?

548
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,380
Is it even homogenous like we talked about, like in the normal one?

549
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,600
So like, if you just had to describe that, forget all the passwords, if you just had to describe that as a picture.

550
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:36,050
How is the big picture different from the little picture? I don't think it looks very homogenous.

551
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:40,370
It does not look homogenous. Okay. And like what have you like visually?

552
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:43,430
What are you seeing that's different that makes it look non-indigenous?

553
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:48,860
I think the color. Yeah. There's like clusters of like white, white spaces for like like.

554
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,910
So you're talking about like this and this and this.

555
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:58,280
Okay. And what would you say is a little bit tricky, but what would you say?

556
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:04,970
Distribution. Like the other side, we got a clear sense, right, that we had central distribution.

557
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:09,710
Are you getting anything with this one as far as distribution? Hmm.

558
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:14,480
But the speaker thinks. Diffuse.

559
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,290
Yeah. It's a lot harder to like say that something zonal and that's right.

560
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:28,500
So essentially what we have diffusely there are irregular areas with that are pale pink.

561
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:35,710
So it could just or one kind of general phrase that you can use that sounds a little bit more pathologically.

562
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:44,000
You can say something like multifocal, either irregular areas with a with a a change in staining.

563
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:49,310
Say if you want to I mean, in real pathology, you probably go a little bit more right to it.

564
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:57,620
But we're just trying to build our case so multifocal that there's a change in staining that's irregularly distributed, distributed.

565
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,409
And it is. I would agree that there's no particular pattern.

566
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:09,470
This is sort of diffuse across the entirety of the liver with patchy, diffusely distributed, irregular staining.

567
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:19,730
That's fine. And then Ariana added that in some areas we also have these nodular aggregates of the hepatocytes.

568
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:24,470
Okay, so now we're going to drill down and see. So there's our general sentence.

569
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:30,350
I will tell you that this irregularity of this liver has at least four components.

570
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,679
This is a really complex slide, and we're going to walk through each one.

571
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:41,690
We're almost doing a mini description of each one. So the first one is the one that you identified where they have those areas of peel steak.

572
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:47,330
Okay. So think about it that the change something was is kind of a little bit of both.

573
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:54,350
So here's one area where there are some peel standing in here and here I have a couple other images of it.

574
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:00,290
Six one actually is that fibrosis. Ooh, look at you jumping right to it.

575
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:05,979
Good. It is fibrosis. And now we're going to explain how we know this.

576
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:11,630
This is actually a really good example of it. So this is a bit of a something lost lesion, right?

577
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:16,880
Because what's lost what's missing in those areas? So the hepatocytes.

578
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:25,640
Right. So we said there's multiple areas of, um, with decreased staining or pale pink staining in the affected areas.

579
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:29,330
There are decrease the parasite. So there's a loss of hepatocytes.

580
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:35,420
And then, Ambra, how did you know that this was fibrosis? It looks squishy.

581
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:39,940
Like product tissue looks like. So what is fibrosis like?

582
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:43,069
What cells are responsible for about four by four.

583
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:46,640
Fibrosis, fibroblasts. Fibroblasts. And what?

584
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:50,720
What is actual fibrosis? What are the fibroblasts doing? What are they producing?

585
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:55,130
Collagen content, right? So this is the best way to see it.

586
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:59,810
So these spindly looking cells, this guy, this guy, maybe this guy,

587
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:06,200
and then some of the larger ones, those are elongated cells, those are fibroblasts.

588
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:11,780
And then all this pink wispy stuff that's not in a cell, that's all the culture.

589
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:21,260
Okay. So if you didn't know, if you didn't recognize fibrosis right away, what you can do is walk your way up to it.

590
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:28,300
But in the affected areas, there are decreased hepatocytes and there's replacement by, you know,

591
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:36,380
irregularly distributed spindle cells or spindle cells and pink extracellular material consistent with fibrosis.

592
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:44,580
Again at this point, sometimes people get a little panicky because that sounds very technobabble.

593
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:48,990
But all you have to do is recognize that there is something missing that should be there.

594
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:54,750
And then you have to kind of go through your list in your head on what those things could be that's there instead.

595
00:57:55,650 --> 00:58:04,950
Okay, so there's a lack of hepatocytes and there's replacement by a lot of pink stuff that's not inside a cell and that is actually fibrosis.

596
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:09,390
So fibrosis. Yes. Is there an overproduction of collagen?

597
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:15,540
Yes or. Okay. Yes. So it's not just that the fibroblasts are there, it's that they're making too much coffee.

598
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:22,980
Yes. Okay. That's what's giving us. Everywhere you see these patchy things, there's some fibroblasts in there laying down collagen.

599
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:29,460
Okay. So essentially got a bit of a spoiler. There is scarring percolating throughout this tissue.

600
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:37,680
Okay. And then in some areas, the scarring has a very particular pattern.

601
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:46,260
Okay. So we have areas with lots of hepatocytes, increased fibroblasts and collagen that's consistent with fibrosis.

602
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:50,130
We have something else. This is looking at a thing.

603
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:56,430
There are some bluish looking cells here and there's a lot of these in this tissue.

604
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:02,700
I didn't show you this before, but there's some. So there's this structure.

605
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:10,050
Um, there's some more of them here and here. I know it's hard to see with the crazy board.

606
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:16,570
That's not so good. Yep. And then there's some more of the similar structures here and here.

607
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:21,090
Here. So there's lots of these things all through the tissue here.

608
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:27,300
We're going to zoom in on those two images. Those are the structures that I'm saying are distributed throughout the tissue.

609
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:34,110
Does that remind you of anything in our normal liver citrus?

610
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:41,010
It does look a little bit like train tracks. Yeah, it does look.

611
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:44,730
I can totally see where we go there. It does look a little bit like train tracks. I'll tell you that.

612
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:49,500
The train tracks are over cell hypoplasia. The nuclei tend to be a little bit more elongated.

613
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:57,450
So this is kind of a too much of a normal structure, thinking about the normal structures in our liver,

614
00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:02,040
like the kind of things that we learn that are more satisfied.

615
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:06,480
Sinusoidal are lined by flat cells like endothelial cells.

616
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:11,300
That's a good choice, though, because some insights can get into fuel cells, get a little elevated.

617
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:16,050
Think about our portal triads. What are the three guys that we have in our portal trials of the biliary?

618
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:20,880
It is the bile ducts. Yes, it's a bile duct, followed by cuboid epithelium.

619
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:25,200
So these are all cuboid epithelial cells. It's just bile ducts going wild.

620
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:32,340
Okay. So we have increased bile duct jowls and it's hard to get a sense of distribution,

621
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:37,380
but this is throughout the tissue, so they're kind of following those fibrotic tracts.

622
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,930
So what's our word for too much of a cell type? After initial lesion?

623
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:47,399
Yeah, hyperplasia hypertrophy is too big, but there might be some hypertrophy here as well.

624
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:52,420
The hyperplasia. So in the areas of fibrosis, we also have increased bile ducts.

625
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:57,900
So that's consistent with biliary hyperplasia. So a second thing is biliary hyperplasia.

626
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:04,380
All right. And here we have our crop circle. So these are just hepatocytes.

627
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:08,240
But there are and there's a lot of them. It's kind of more dense in the middle here.

628
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:13,230
I don't see any vascular structures in the middle of this thing, and I see all that fibrosis around it.

629
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:19,440
It's like hepatocytes pushing outward. And then some of them actually have a little bit of a change here.

630
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:25,710
Evacuation. What kind of evacuation you think? Yeah. Yeah, the lipid deposition is very clear.

631
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:34,140
So they also have proliferating hepatocytes like that are compressed by that area of fibrosis.

632
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:35,030
Okay.

633
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:44,220
So the reason these are actually hepatocytes that are replicating actually easier to see in this one is like an area of hepatocyte proliferation.

634
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:51,600
But because there's so much fibrosis and scarring, it's being constrained by all those patches of fibrosis in the tissue.

635
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:55,080
And it's kind of compressing it into a circle. Hmm. Okay.

636
01:01:55,650 --> 01:02:00,390
So we have hepatocytes struggling to replicate, proliferate and replenish the tissue.

637
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:08,820
And we have areas where it's been so damaged that there's scarring and that is restricting the ability of the of the hepatocytes to replicate.

638
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,850
So so far, we have areas of that process.

639
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:20,069
We have there is a billion hyperplasia and we have areas of hepatocyte regeneration and sorry electrocution contacts.

640
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:24,660
Okay, areas of that regeneration. And this is still ptosis.

641
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:33,180
And when we talked about this in the first half of the class in general pathology, we talked about this as one form of degeneration.

642
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:37,490
Okay. So instead of cells are kind of shutting down and they're making this protein, they're.

643
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:46,300
Can't be bothered is like lipid metabolism. The step ketosis or lipid evacuation can be indicative of degeneration.

644
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:53,530
Okay. But you can also have the it tells us with excess lipid in the diet, but it can be a change you see with degeneration.

645
01:02:54,310 --> 01:03:00,170
So these areas are actually hepatocyte proliferation and degeneration of.

646
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:11,310
Okay. I'm sorry. Did you ever know that was later? My question was, what does the fatty south of her deposit have to do with the constriction?

647
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:14,610
Yeah, like it's like the constriction specifically.

648
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:18,149
Or it's just the fact that there's a degeneration happening because of the constriction.

649
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:22,770
And in this case, it happens to these two doses. That's how it's happening.

650
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:28,830
The constriction is happening cause this liver is being diffusely affected.

651
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:36,990
Your liver is being diffusely damaged. Right. So you're having diffuse areas where there's been so much damage that you have scarring.

652
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:44,640
Right. And the scar, the fibrotic tissue is actually extending even from portal trial to portal triads of bands of fibrosis.

653
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:49,620
And then in between those bands of fibrosis, we have hepatocytes that are dying.

654
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:53,940
So what are they going to do? They're going to try to proliferate, and so they're gonna try to regenerate.

655
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:57,870
But because you have these bands of scar tissue, they are constrained.

656
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:01,530
Like it's like a fence. They can't go past that.

657
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:09,540
So the fact that there's so much fibrosis is what's creating these nodules and is the fact that it's that that it is that constraining.

658
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:18,720
Yeah. That leads to the type of degeneration that causes steatosis or that steatosis happen if a different kind

659
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:24,750
of the speech ptosis probably is due to whatever is making the hepatocytes sick in the first place.

660
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:27,360
Okay. So that's not specifically related to the five.

661
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:33,180
Yeah, it can be contributing cause like this is the liver that has had, as we'll see, has had a lot of injury.

662
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:40,890
So it had something first that caught like a toxin that caused liver degeneration because it got sick and they started dying.

663
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:47,250
Some of them tried to regenerate, but then it got hit again and then they died again and then it tried to regenerate.

664
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:51,270
And so in some areas it just gave up and created scarring.

665
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:58,170
That makes sense. These parasites are still dying. But you're right, once you have the scarring, there is actually pressure.

666
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,510
So now you have a secondary injury.

667
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:08,580
Not only the inciting, fighting, injurious agent, whatever this toxin is, but you also have damage from like the scarring, some pressure necrosis.

668
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:15,390
And I bet there also might be areas like this, this poor thing, this little thing,

669
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:22,260
this is a cheater slide because the other side didn't illustrate this well. So this is a human with the same lesion and the slide is ugly.

670
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:29,190
It has a lot of all that stuff is chatter from the microphone are in fact but it was the best example of this.

671
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:32,670
There are also areas where you have this. What's the stuff?

672
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,870
Yeah. So, uh, be more be more process.

673
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:44,520
What's the process? You are too specific. What's the general process that this is showing inflammation.

674
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:51,150
Right. And it's actually I would show you a much higher mag of I wanted you to identify neutrophils because this is actually chronic inflammation.

675
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:56,640
These are mostly lymphocytes that was neutrophils in here, but it's kind of mixed chronic inflammation.

676
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:01,950
So there's also inflammation. So your question area, so is liver got hit by some toxin.

677
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,579
The cells started to degenerate. They tried to fix themselves.

678
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:09,000
It got hit again. Cycle of injury and repair.

679
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:15,450
And as things go on, the very processes that are trying to fix the problem are now contributing to the problem.

680
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:20,670
So not only do you have the toxic, you have damage from inflammatory cells, you have damage from fibrosis.

681
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,600
So it's the constellation of events that's causing this overall lesion.

682
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:30,810
Okay. So that was a way complex slide, but we basically had a section of liver.

683
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:37,470
We looked at it and we said, okay, well, diffusely there is irregular loss of hepatocytes and pale staining.

684
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:45,600
Then we went to those areas and we said the affected areas are comprised of increased fibroblasts and collagen.

685
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:48,870
That's consistent with fibrosis. Right?

686
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:54,390
Then we looked at it and said, okay, in those areas there are also an increased number of bile ducts.

687
01:06:54,510 --> 01:07:02,880
So there's biliary hyperplasia. Then we look between and we said, geez, these are parasites in between are trying to proliferate.

688
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:04,380
So there's regeneration.

689
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:11,790
So those nodules are called regenerative nodules because there's trying to do, but there's also degeneration like the steatosis in those areas.

690
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:16,830
And then finally we also in my cheater side that was thrown in pretending to be part of the cow.

691
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:21,450
We also have inflammatory infiltrates, chronic inflammatory infiltrates.

692
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:27,930
Okay. So, yes, sorry. Um, I don't know if you could you go back a couple of stories.

693
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:31,620
Yeah, more? Yeah, more. I was curious.

694
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:36,530
Okay. So our north, if you got okay.

695
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:40,950
Those nuclei. Yeah. Look different to me.

696
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:47,370
They look more hollow compared to the healthy ones. Is that something that you could also explain to?

697
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:52,070
Yeah, that's a good observation actually. Like these you're going to talk.

698
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:55,890
Yeah, right. So the reason is look more hollow. They actually have a more.

699
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:00,920
So the path word is heterochromatin. But who needs that face that.

700
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:08,540
We have to remember when we talked about I can't be blind about it like now when we talked about in the nucleus,

701
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:12,350
if you have heterochromatin and you chromatin heterochromatin.

702
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:20,570
So if you have areas that are open and closed, you're going to have more condensed and less condensed areas of protein.

703
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:25,400
So if you have an active cell, the nucleus is going to look more speckled because there are more open areas.

704
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:29,710
If you have an inactive cell, it's very dense. So these are proliferating cells.

705
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:37,400
They have a lot of active areas. So the reason that Nucleus looks open is because there's a lot more areas of chromatin that are open and active.

706
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:41,930
So it's just more speckled looking because it's a proliferating cell.

707
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:47,750
And compared to maybe there's a parasite out here, which is a little bit more just kind of sitting there.

708
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:55,670
Okay. So we see the parasites similar to the healthy ones, but the quality of the ones that are in the collagen that are are very new.

709
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:59,090
Oh, yeah. So this is actually biological.

710
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:04,520
So these are biliary epithelial cells and they are actively proliferating.

711
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:09,800
So those are pretty busy cells. So they're in a more transcriptional, inactive state.

712
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:14,750
I guess I'd say I mean, biliary epithelium as a whole, the nucleus looks a little bit different,

713
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:19,160
but the reason those live so open in Heterochromatin is because those are proliferating cells.

714
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:22,760
Excellent observation. All right. Okay.

715
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:31,640
So, okay, so if I have a slide that's way complex like this. So all of these things is kind of coming together for a big picture process.

716
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:35,700
But I'm going to ask you very carefully to identify specific things.

717
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:41,179
So, like, I might show you a slide like this, you know, laboratory slides like this.

718
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:50,120
And I might say in even in this image, what is the main process or I don't know in this image, what is the main process?

719
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:56,930
Okay. So I'm going to try to help you break it down, but the basic processes that we looked at, we have that degeneration and regeneration.

720
01:09:57,470 --> 01:10:02,570
And I use your ptosis as an example of degeneration, basically degeneration.

721
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:08,480
Regeneration. That's what's going on in those hepatocyte nodules. We have fibrosis, which was the first thing we noticed.

722
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:13,220
We have biliary hypoplasia, which is kind of following those areas of fibrosis.

723
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:17,480
And we have inflammation. So we got lots of different things.

724
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:25,090
So those are the processes. The distribution was widespread, so we couldn't really see, okay, this one is just around certain areas.

725
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:34,310
The whole liver is kind of messed up. Clearly this is chronic because even though we have some active areas of degeneration,

726
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:41,150
all of these changes, fibrosis, the type of inflammation we see that biliary hyperplasia that takes time.

727
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:44,730
So the overall picture of this lesion is chronic. Okay?

728
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:50,000
And this was severe. So, okay, so that's our morphologic diagnosis.

729
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:54,040
What process do you think?

730
01:10:54,050 --> 01:11:01,310
Okay, if you had to summarize all that in sort of one word or one condition, going more towards a disease diagnosis or condition diagnosis.

731
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:05,420
Now, what do you think is going on with that liver cirrhosis?

732
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:10,410
Yes. So here is an image of cirrhosis in a human.

733
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:15,230
This is macro nodular cirrhosis. So this is similar to that last cheater slide that threw in.

734
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:18,950
Here is our areas of the parasite regeneration.

735
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:22,610
These are big swaths of fibrosis.

736
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:30,140
And here you can really see how that fibrosis is constricting the ability of those hepatocytes to proliferate and grossly.

737
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:33,889
Imagine, like all those the constricting bands around the hepatocytes.

738
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:38,870
That's why it looks so nodular. Okay. And then in the areas of fibrosis,

739
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:46,879
the bile duct gels tend to kind of follow because basically all that fibrosis is changing the flow of bile and the flow of blood.

740
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:51,170
So it's constricting a little bit and the bile ducts respond by becoming really torturous.

741
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:54,410
They're trying to create new branches so they can still make bile flow.

742
01:11:54,740 --> 01:12:02,090
So you have biliary hyperplasia as a reaction to all that fibrosis and all that stuff is going to be in those intervening fibrotic tracts.

743
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:10,010
This is an example of micro nodular cirrhosis, same kind of deal, just less grossly prominent nodules.

744
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:21,070
So in humans, kind of the most common in diagnostic part, the most common causes for this are viral hepatitis or chronic alcoholism, things like that.

745
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,959
That tends to be more consistent. It's not 100%,

746
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:32,300
but viral hepatitis tends to end up like this alcoholic hepatitis related hepatitis tends to end up microRNAs or but there's some overlap.

747
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:39,620
But anything that causes chronic recurring damage to the liver can result in an appearance like this.

748
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:45,170
Okay. So, toxin wise, the cow that I showed you.

749
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:51,680
So the cow is probably not an alcoholic. So this is a toxicant related lesion.

750
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:54,830
This was aflatoxin in that cow,

751
01:12:54,890 --> 01:13:00,950
which is a pretty common aflatoxin process in animals is more common than it is in humans just by nature of what they eat.

752
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,400
But this could also be liver toxicant in a human.

753
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:15,330
So aflatoxin B1 is a toxic metabolite that's sort of like coumarin, like an antiquark and that produced by Aspergillus species fungi.

754
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:21,890
So mostly aspergillus flavors, but there's several different species of aspergillus alpha.

755
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:28,050
It's pretty ubiquitous, this fungus distribution, and it's commonly grown in moldy grains.

756
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:34,260
So like corn that's in storage, in conditions where it's not protected from being wet, generates a lot of heat from it's like that.

757
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:38,159
It's more the same thing with peanuts, corn and peanuts, probably the most common.

758
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:44,910
But any type of grain that's stored where it's exposed to moisture, you get proliferation of the fungus.

759
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:53,729
And if it's the right kind of fungus, you can get aflatoxin production. So humans and animals eat grains, aflatoxin actually even in our pet foods,

760
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:59,340
this is one of the more common causes for like dog food recall because there's grains that go into dog food.

761
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:02,460
So contamination of animal feed is pretty common.

762
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:09,870
Okay. So this is what happens with aflatoxin. It's another one that's dependent on p450 metabolism.

763
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:18,720
So if the grain is ingested with the formed toxin, aflatoxin b one is the most common one that has toxicity.

764
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:23,520
It gets converted by cytochrome p450 activity into any pork side.

765
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,520
And then a couple of things can happen.

766
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:35,190
It can have acute toxicity because this a pox side like our Napoli in acetaminophen example binds to proteins and if there's enough of it,

767
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:37,019
just like in our acetaminophen example,

768
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:46,829
you have cytotoxicity, severe hepatic, you have hepatocyte destruction initially that might be very similar to our acetaminophen example.

769
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:50,850
Like if you have acute ingestion of a high amount, you might have central lobular necrosis.

770
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:55,469
But if that keeps going and if it's, if it's kind of chronic low level enough,

771
01:14:55,470 --> 01:15:01,470
it becomes more generalized and you lose the distribution so you can have cytotoxicity.

772
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:06,750
And if it's in a grain in a common food source, you have the potential of being repeatedly exposed.

773
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:14,190
Right? So that's the repeated exposure aspect compared to acetaminophen, which is more likely, you know, like an accidental overdose or something.

774
01:15:15,690 --> 01:15:18,479
The epoxy also can bind to DNA.

775
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:26,000
So every time you generate that a pork side with cytochrome p450, you also have the potential for it to form a DNA at UPT.

776
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:38,129
So another risk factor for aflatoxin is hepatocellular carcinoma and that can be due to aflatoxin forming a DNA add up.

777
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:42,959
So these are two of the more common attempts to get formed and either gets removed

778
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,530
and that's a potential mutation through DNA repair because you get in heparin,

779
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:53,700
excite you, throw in the wrong base in a mutation or the ad, it can remain and itself can interfere with DNA replication.

780
01:15:54,510 --> 01:16:01,170
So DNA attacks from aflatoxin can potentially be a cause of mutation that's carcinogenic.

781
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:08,640
And this is all occurring in the setting of cell damage, replication, inflammation,

782
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:15,000
all the things that we talked about that can act as promoting factors so you can acquire additional mutations later on.

783
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:23,639
Okay. So aflatoxin aflatoxin hosts is a risk factor that can lead to acute, you know, if you have a sudden exposure,

784
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:28,680
acute liver failure, just like the liver slide we showed first chronic liver failure.

785
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:32,130
With those chronic cycles, you end up with cirrhosis just like we showed.

786
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:36,060
Or it's also a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma.

787
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:40,050
Okay. So this can cause a lot of things with the liver.

788
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:46,740
Yes. So I think I'm a little confused. Is the so is the aflatoxin cleaving the DNA?

789
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:52,950
I don't do that, but I know it's it finds the DNA and here's my evidence.

790
01:16:53,430 --> 01:17:03,690
Okay. So binds the DNA base and then your DNA repair mechanisms recognize this thing as an abnormal base and remove it.

791
01:17:04,410 --> 01:17:11,790
So now you have a space. So one thing that can happen is remove the abnormal base, and then that base needs to be repaired.

792
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:16,830
And sometimes the repair enzymes that replace the base put in the wrong base.

793
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:22,530
Oh, okay. So you're cutting out the abnormal base and it should replace it with just, you know, whatever.

794
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:30,350
It should be a guanine, but instead it sometimes slips in the wrong base and then as DNA replicates, that mutation gets fixed.

795
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:33,830
Okay. I think I was having a hard time reorienting. Yeah.

796
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:40,950
Diffusion of the initial molecule. So I think it's by then where do I mean this is supposed to be this.

797
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:46,920
Yeah. So it's taking this off. Yeah. And then this one is showing you.

798
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:57,750
Yes. So this is here, this base is here and it's saying that in some cases the ad it can remain attached and then it disrupts the space.

799
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:01,250
So it creates a damaged space. Here.

800
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:11,510
And then when you that can be like you could stop replication of that cell of it recognizes it as a problem or if replication continues,

801
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:19,010
you know, you might not have that adequately. I think that's more likely to stop replication of that cell.

802
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:23,510
So what, like the hydroxyl that's next to the like positively charged nitrogen?

803
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:27,980
That's from the bauxite, right? Where am I? Here. Yes, that's the oxide.

804
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:32,780
That's from the sun. Is that what you're asking? Yeah, we just see.

805
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:38,940
Philip. I didn't do it.

806
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:43,910
I think it's from here. Is that nice? I guess.

807
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:50,700
I think it was it. Yeah, it has to be for the fact that I'm trying to, like, mentally flip that because, like, this is this.

808
01:18:50,970 --> 01:18:56,120
Yeah. Everything appears to oxygen. Everything above the nitrogen as far as the oxide.

809
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:01,080
That's where the Parkside was. The Parkside reacted with the night.

810
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:05,720
This is eight, right? This is Jane. Mm hmm. Yeah.

811
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:12,660
So then when it looks like cytochrome p450 and it actually forms like the like the actual oxide and not the whole structure,

812
01:19:12,930 --> 01:19:16,370
I think what that's what's become o over there.

813
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:19,800
Yeah. Yes. There. Yeah. Okay.

814
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:27,420
Sorry. So that could go either way to understand where in so many species, like in three dimensions, like, grab that thing in there.

815
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:32,780
Yeah, it. It's from that, that epoxy. All right, let's go.

816
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:36,370
Look, we know the chemistry. Okay?

817
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:43,530
Yeah. Okay, so we're going to take a little bit of a break, but, um.

818
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:47,440
Okay, as a toxicologist, we said aflatoxin common in animal feeds.

819
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:55,230
It's a pretty common toxicity in animals, but it does also occur in humans, particularly in developing countries,

820
01:19:55,230 --> 01:20:01,320
where maybe the grain storage conditions might not be as optimal and where there are food shortages.

821
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:06,480
So if you have a choice between eating contaminated, not so high quality grain and eating nothing,

822
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:13,920
you're probably going to go take your chances with the contaminated grain. So this is an example of a large aflatoxin.

823
01:20:14,130 --> 01:20:18,690
This outbreak in Kenya that affected many people was related to like a weather change.

824
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:25,560
That years is a very wet season. So grains are being stored when they already were wet.

825
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:34,560
And then due to improper conditions, there was increased growth of the fungus during conditions of storage.

826
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:39,959
So this is an example of aflatoxin causes where there are a lot of cases of acute toxicity.

827
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:47,490
So people were presenting an acute liver failure, but behi and so those are individuals who were unlucky enough to get high doses.

828
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:51,390
Right. So almost like that acetaminophen example. But behind that,

829
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:59,909
there are lots of other people who are having this cycle of damage who ended up with sort of chronic liver damage kind of earlier on or early onset

830
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:08,820
cirrhosis or maybe just low level lack of liver function and downstream that can increase the likelihood or the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma.

831
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:13,710
Okay. So it's a great example actually of how one toxicant, depending on dose, depending on,

832
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:19,740
you know, frequency of exposure can actually to acute or chronic lesions or even neoplasia.

833
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:26,280
All right. Let's take a short break and then those are okay.

834
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:32,280
Those two things are our kind of starter. I showed you an acute lesion and I showed you a chronic lesion.

835
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:35,970
So that's kind of the main theme in most of these. I'm going to show you an acute and chronic.

836
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:43,430
We're going to take a short break and then I'm just going to fly through just to show you this case is in your quiz.

837
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:49,560
So this one, you're going to figure out yourself in the quiz. And the answer to this will be in the review sheet for the quiz.

838
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:57,150
Once I unblind that and then I'll show you an image, a thing of a neoplasm, just so you can see what that looks like.

839
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:01,470
It takes time to learn to recognize Neoplasia. It's kind of one of the harder things.

840
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:04,170
So in this class on your exam and things like that,

841
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:09,139
I'm not going to ask you to differentiate a neoplasm from I'm not going to ask you about D neoplasms.

842
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:13,140
It's just a little bit too high for the amount of practice that we have.

843
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:16,560
But I am going to show you one in this class. Just you can see what it's like. All right.

844
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,100
Let's take a short break and then we'll just fly through this neoplasm neoplasia case.

845
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:27,840
All right. Good job. Today, we remembered a lot of stuff from structure function and a lot of internal return.

846
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:31,320
Like, Oh, yeah, sure. Wake your classmates.

847
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:38,669
Like Have you good luck to you.

848
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:43,579
And you question you know have you worked with our foster. Says Fagan Plaster.

849
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:49,360
My coach, my dog has a cavity like you.

850
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:54,200
Sadly, common in the Midwest. Yeah. It's my my friends have had dogs have died from it.

851
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,230
And I think the cat is pretty calm. Yeah.

852
01:22:57,270 --> 01:23:04,099
And he's been on meds for like a few months now, but he's getting like the skin lesions and they thought it was a staph infection,

853
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:13,970
but I was like, I think it's too like, I don't know if I come in for like bacterial infections, go along with it can be.

854
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:20,840
I mean, this is depending on how extensive blaster is, it can have a lot of different.

855
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:26,269
Is it like the respiratory or do you think he's been having a harder time breathing?

856
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:31,339
But it's not like I thought it's my friend's dogs go through it and it's not as severe.

857
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:32,389
I don't think it should be.

858
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:40,610
It's hard to know when I'll be there this weekend and see more like how it's affecting him but also because they Seattle like a month ago.

859
01:23:40,610 --> 01:23:46,999
Yeah so and they can't operate on the medicine and and the skin lesions started happening

860
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:52,100
and they're like we have to like I think it was probably the old antifungal man,

861
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:57,890
but yeah, I don't know, I just thought of exposure either. Like a fungal infection.

862
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:03,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, Blaster is more it's not like really a toxin.

863
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:08,120
Like not Aspergillus is from the firm's toxin in the ground, so, like,

864
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:17,380
they're really ingesting a toxin fungal origin blaster was an infection with the actual, like, the spores from the fire.

865
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:22,129
Yeah. The sun itself is proliferating. They're taking a medication to get rid of the fungus.

866
01:24:22,130 --> 01:24:28,550
Yeah, as a toxin. There actually is a disease called aspergillosis for aspergillus grows in tissue.

867
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:35,240
But after tough because as often as no fungus infection or because the fungus can be long gone.

868
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:39,320
Yeah, the toxin remains in the brain. So that's more of a concern.

869
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:44,399
Yeah. Last time because this and aspergillosis are my classic infections.

870
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:51,980
Yeah. Infection. They're treating it, you know, similar to how you would treat a bacterial infection will see a middle aged yeah yeah.

871
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:56,370
But because there's tissue damage and everything you know that's actually that's a no no is

872
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:01,580
you have destruction of tissue that are breathing in bacteria all the time when bacteria can.

873
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:11,110
So it's not uncommon for an antibacterial agent and then antifungal agent, which is kind of a secondary hit to time.

874
01:25:11,150 --> 01:25:17,570
Yeah, I kind of agree on that, but I thought that was weird about they would assume it was bacterial, the skin stuff.

875
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:24,010
I thought it would just be connected to her. Yeah, well, it still can actually infiltrate skin as well.

876
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:29,950
So you can get my chronic lesions of skin, but it wouldn't it depending on how it looks.

877
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:35,970
But this is great for you. I feel like I've done enough cause I like so, so good there.

878
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:41,200
So. Yeah, I know. Unfortunately, Blaster is really common in the Midwest, but when I first started,

879
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:46,060
when I was in practice and I practiced in New England, I never, ever, ever saw last year.

880
01:25:46,130 --> 01:25:51,500
And then I came here and I was like, Oh, yeah, you know, I feel like it's getting worse.

881
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:57,400
And I just sort of like, yeah. So I mean, the good thing is that there is a fair amount of experience in Midwest.

882
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:02,140
Veterinarians think, Yeah, I know MSU has a bunch of cases here.

883
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:06,090
I know I'm kind of like, you should take and specialize.

884
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,850
I mean, you could ask your vet and say like, you know, that's really concerned.

885
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:15,480
See if they would suggest, yeah, yeah.

886
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:19,640
Okay I'm kind of dog. You have to call then.

887
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:23,860
Yeah he so so yeah. I'm so excited to see them. I have to.

888
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:28,830
This is like I say, sorry, I know what just did practically but also yeah.

889
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:35,890
You know, like dress and just like, my gosh, I support my pregnancy.

890
01:26:36,770 --> 01:26:44,660
He does. Yeah. That's the tube. That's the one with the plus one side.

891
01:26:44,710 --> 01:26:56,350
And he's like, Don't make me. So I think, yeah, I'm in the suburbs.

892
01:26:57,130 --> 01:27:10,570
Okay, look at the liver and pinion case and then can you I think oh yeah, I think it from autopsy or from a biopsy.

893
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:17,979
I mean what. Oh right. So people are presenting clinically with acute liver failure, the symptoms are.

894
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:25,910
And so some of those people died before I could see evidence in the face of acute liver cirrhosis

895
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:32,140
that can be risky to take a biopsy or I'm not sure I probably didn't play a large role,

896
01:27:32,290 --> 01:27:38,760
but their liver enzymes are fine, so that was likely treated fairly by second other.

897
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:45,399
Yeah, I know. I think it's a picture. And like liver enzymes are biomarkers of radar failure.

898
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:57,110
And then for the people that you can also I think like blood levels of aflatoxin but certainly on the garbage if you die by mass but by other means,

899
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:59,680
you can measure level of that liver.

900
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:07,120
So somebody I don't it's been a while since I read this article and there were several articles and this is like the largest I think it'll

901
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:17,010
be the largest outbreak where a hundred years ago there were several publications described in the aftermath of a lot of people ended up.

902
01:28:17,530 --> 01:28:21,160
But I think yeah, yeah.

903
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:23,620
I think it was a combination of it.

904
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:37,600
One thing that you I like the severity and other noninvasive right and I guess it was also you know, if you know where the green source is,

905
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:49,999
you know, putting that together in the clinical picture together in your liver and you know, it's hard enough for people to see what's going on.

906
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:56,970
Yeah, but the interesting thing about this one, because it was like a really wellspring, so it's not like there was like in there God green plants,

907
01:28:57,010 --> 01:29:03,720
but it was really just it was just an increased incidence of multiple eras, which is part of why it was such a high level of brain.

908
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:08,590
Sure. But yeah, I notice I just thought of it in the back.

909
01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:12,820
Did they use V8? If you guys are doing that?

910
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:18,580
Oh my God. Which is why I wonder what that is. All right, so it's cool.

911
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:24,549
I wonder if it's somebody else that has high salt. I don't know. I've never heard of it, actually.

912
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:32,500
I mean, something like that is hilarious. I think it's a thing, though, I have to agree that I was reading and there's a reference after about.

913
01:29:32,970 --> 01:29:37,140
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. That, that she's like, not really.

914
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:39,520
I wonder how common that is. Yeah.

915
01:29:40,030 --> 01:29:49,420
You know, we do in his still lab and I was like, if you need a control, a positive control for gram stain on tissue.

916
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:52,540
Yeah. Congressman to change what I decide to consume.

917
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:56,349
If you take one step at a time anyway.

918
01:29:56,350 --> 01:30:01,330
Yeah. And you try to process it like tissue histology clean is a great restoration.

919
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:14,890
Yeah. Yeah. But you can use that as a like rednecks to prison.

920
01:30:16,570 --> 01:30:21,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I did actually.

921
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:38,170
I had a collaborator like when I first came out here, period, where my brother did work primarily in my field and I got out of trouble.

922
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:42,100
Think about all the 18 hours or something.

923
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:46,120
I was like, Oh, I need to increase pipeline.

924
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:49,630
But you know, there's an open field.

925
01:30:51,850 --> 01:30:57,009
But the problem I had last time, I was like, with the bottom line,

926
01:30:57,010 --> 01:31:03,990
I only could do that would be kind of like an actual line because we're trying to do something.

927
01:31:04,030 --> 01:31:13,480
Yeah, but, um, but it was, it was fascinating. Like, like, you know, how old are you?

928
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:16,800
Oh, okay. Yeah.

929
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:22,530
Quantify. Yeah. These things like this study is coming in in Arizona like and Maryland.

930
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:27,250
This all your research? Yeah, that's actually a huge issue.

931
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:27,969
I mean, not just that.

932
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:36,400
Can you have anything in particular like based on what, you know, Western research on in their samples from like there are single.

933
01:31:37,150 --> 01:31:42,080
Oh yeah, there is number two but he's from like he's from the FDA.

934
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:47,139
Yeah. So like, you could only be really just like a dad.

935
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:53,440
I'm not sure. Yeah, yeah. One. That's where, you know, where if you're awesome, researchers have to be right.

936
01:31:53,440 --> 01:32:02,379
So I wouldn't give up and I and I think most likely you have to have the opinion collaborators what you should.

937
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:06,400
Yeah. That. Yeah. The worst thing you imagine.

938
01:32:06,830 --> 01:32:11,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

939
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:17,559
So, but yeah that's like if you do that there's a power differential.

940
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:27,400
Yeah. Like you like control. But it, it was also really interesting like how it works in areas of knowledge because like,

941
01:32:28,270 --> 01:32:37,020
it's not like you're, you know, they have more resources than me, but not anybody.

942
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:47,010
I remember we were actually at a fundraiser, which is the Prime Minister's center outside of new Scottish Regulated.

943
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:54,219
You guys are supposed to be like all they do and concentration is like comparison of like units,

944
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:58,170
but they also now run, you know, government and they also do that every month.

945
01:32:59,470 --> 01:33:07,910
And I don't have any problem about everything.

946
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:13,740
And I get there. I, there's like a free clinic in charge.

947
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:19,180
And then she found another girl and that was pretty good year round.

948
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:28,090
And I see men who are more jobs, you know, like biohazard.

949
01:33:28,090 --> 01:33:31,510
Yeah. Yeah. She's going to be there with God.

950
01:33:32,230 --> 01:33:40,020
Yeah. Regular clothes. And just it was like, yeah, yeah.

951
01:33:40,070 --> 01:33:46,180
You know, I think you're saying maybe.

952
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:49,030
Yeah, but like, I just think like getting to know.

953
01:33:49,040 --> 01:34:06,100
So it's interesting is really I mean, I like nerdy it was a very valuable I think they're just like really discuss the situation at work.

954
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:10,510
And I noticed this like you guys are kidnaping.

955
01:34:10,690 --> 01:34:13,770
Yeah, exactly. It's not true. It doesn't have anything beyond.

956
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:17,410
We just kind of like in Europe. So like you're going into.

957
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:23,530
Yeah, know, I'm like, no, no, no, no.

958
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:27,879
But like, you don't really like to read my mind.

959
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:33,970
You're like, Oh, yeah, yeah. So I don't know.

960
01:34:33,970 --> 01:34:46,280
And that's why she, she's always like that.

961
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:50,370
So my ass to work, it's like you can't work.

962
01:34:50,370 --> 01:34:58,540
And I don't think it was like, yeah, she had to get what she wanted to without coming across.

963
01:34:58,540 --> 01:35:09,999
And it was just. Right now they are in the Kenyan government has some programs, but we've been trying to find out something a bit more now.

964
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:16,690
But it's still I'm insulted. I mean, there's an equity. Yeah, but we really enjoy very, very good people.

965
01:35:16,870 --> 01:35:20,260
I mean, how do you get back? You know, it was really cool. It was a very.

966
01:35:22,660 --> 01:35:30,110
Yeah. Setting the science aside is just like a really good. It's not like I come into this.

967
01:35:30,190 --> 01:35:36,670
All right, we're early now. All right, guys, let's finish up so you can have breathing room before your next class.

968
01:35:37,290 --> 01:35:46,809
I'm just like, okay, so that middle one with the cows that's fairly straight for one has sort of two things going on,

969
01:35:46,810 --> 01:35:50,620
but that will be in your quiz thing. And the answer for that, the reveal.

970
01:35:51,010 --> 01:35:57,040
Look, I made it like a little scenario. You pretend you work for Environmental Protection Agency, so you can do that one on your own.

971
01:35:57,040 --> 01:36:00,730
Just kind of remembering a chance to practice, right. That big to small.

972
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:06,940
And then there are two changes that I don't know how to do, and there's a real clue what my can start thinking.

973
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:11,530
What do you think is kind of again, I don't know, but let's look at this tissue from a mouse.

974
01:36:11,530 --> 01:36:19,960
So this is the section of liver. And I'm trying I should have put like a normal liver next to it, but this is the only normal section of liver.

975
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:23,919
And I guess if this were a normal piece of liver, I'm going to try to outline.

976
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:29,530
It probably would be like maybe like this shaped like a book that we're going to lips.

977
01:36:29,830 --> 01:36:32,980
Okay? But instead we have that.

978
01:36:33,850 --> 01:36:44,110
So this is clearly a something added lesion, right? So in our big picture, we have a section of liver that's severely distorted.

979
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:49,630
So it's expanded in size, it's irregular and it's lost areas of the normal parenchyma.

980
01:36:50,290 --> 01:36:57,100
Okay. So just remember, again, I'm not going to ask you to describe a neoplasm, so I'm just trying to freeform it here.

981
01:36:57,550 --> 01:37:01,630
Freeform pathology. I just want to show you this is an example, but don't panic.

982
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:07,240
Okay, so this is I should have put all square. So I have areas that are kind of pale pink.

983
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:10,569
I know it looks white from back there, but still pink and just areas.

984
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:17,620
Also, if this is my normal liver, I can kind of see even at this tiny, tiny magnification there, the vascular structures, right.

985
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:21,760
So Central veins, Puerto Triads and here it's all random.

986
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:27,069
I don't have that nice regular distribution of vascular structures.

987
01:37:27,070 --> 01:37:30,969
I have some areas where are spaces that are clusters of other areas that are sheets.

988
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:39,280
I've lost the vascular structure. I'm looking somewhere at the junction of that pink area and that loss of vascular structure.

989
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:46,390
And I have dense connective tissue that looks a lot like the fibrosis that we saw.

990
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:53,530
I have this thing that gets really hard, so it kind of looks like it wants to be a bile duct up here.

991
01:37:54,160 --> 01:38:01,840
And I know that's hard to see. I should probably zoomed in on that. But rather than this cuboid or bile ducts, those are almost corner cells.

992
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:06,790
They're piling up on each other. So I have a thickened lining to that bile ducts that doesn't look quite right.

993
01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:11,230
And here it looks like all of a sudden they want to be hepatocytes to death.

994
01:38:11,710 --> 01:38:17,110
So this weird combo cell that has features of hepatocytes, features of biliary epithelium.

995
01:38:17,530 --> 01:38:22,600
So if I were describing this, I would say, you know, the liver is distorted.

996
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:27,940
There's a large mass encompassing a significant portion of the lobe.

997
01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:39,409
Within the mass. There are areas of dense fibrotic tissue and there are infiltrating populations of altered parasites, maybe.

998
01:38:39,410 --> 01:38:46,240
LC Forming sheath forming trabecular.

999
01:38:46,330 --> 01:38:50,890
I'll tell you what I mean by that word in a minute. And poorly defined glands.

1000
01:38:52,870 --> 01:38:58,120
So again, just don't forget, I know I'm like doing a lot of words, but I'm not going to expect you guys to do this.

1001
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:04,240
I'm just trying to give you an idea of what we do. And then in the affected plants, I hope that I'm out of that.

1002
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:12,310
Yeah. So in the affected glands, the cell or in the affected areas, the cells are larger than normal, but they're also irregular.

1003
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:17,950
Like, I have some big ones, I have some small ones, I have some boy the one, I have some spindly ones.

1004
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:21,820
So there's a bit of a variability in the morphology.

1005
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:30,100
In pathology description, we often call that paleo morph ism paleo many forms and hepatocyte.

1006
01:39:30,110 --> 01:39:36,879
Some cells should be polymorphic. Hepatocytes are not one, parasites are very uniform, so polymorphism is kind of a danger sign.

1007
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:41,020
When I'm looking at a parasite, these parasites can't decide what they want to be.

1008
01:39:41,890 --> 01:39:47,170
So the fact that these are parasites are doing strange things.

1009
01:39:47,410 --> 01:39:54,549
They're forming sheets in some areas here. They're trying to sort of form a bile duct, but they're very irregular, different sized cells,

1010
01:39:54,550 --> 01:40:02,890
different sized nuclei in some areas rather than the nice to cell cause.

1011
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:08,470
Remember, our parasites are 1 to 2 cell stick. You write up this giant swath of the parasites.

1012
01:40:08,650 --> 01:40:12,250
So that's called a trabecular or trabecular. These are trabecular.

1013
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:15,220
So those are a thickened, abnormal area of the parasites.

1014
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:25,030
So the gist of it is that the hepatocytes are forming abnormal structures rather than the normal, nice, orderly organization of the liver parenchyma.

1015
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:33,280
And so those are epithelial cells, right? Whoever I came through or someone was talking about the epithelial mesenchymal junction,

1016
01:40:34,030 --> 01:40:38,409
epithelial cells, they're doing crazy things and they're sending out different cytokines,

1017
01:40:38,410 --> 01:40:44,830
signals that we don't know, but it's actually influencing an abnormal deposition of mesenchymal cells of connective tissue.

1018
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:55,600
So epithelial tumors, sometimes because they have altered cytokine expression, you can get an abnormal version of fibrosis.

1019
01:40:56,290 --> 01:41:01,060
And there's a special word for that. Again, you know, for this class dismal pleasure.

1020
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:09,790
So this is just like a dense fibrotic deposition and dismal plasma in the context of these abnormal glands.

1021
01:41:09,790 --> 01:41:13,540
It's kind of a flag for a pathologist, for an epithelial neoplasm.

1022
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:17,980
So the gist of this, there is a big mass here.

1023
01:41:18,130 --> 01:41:22,660
We have irregular areas that have hepatocytes that are polymorphic.

1024
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:26,469
They're different sizes. They have a large nucleus relative to their cell body.

1025
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:34,000
They're forming abnormal structures. Adjacent to that, we have dismal plasma, which is an abnormal deposition of connective tissue.

1026
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:41,110
So all of these elements are things that are, you know, the field of cells, connective tissue are all in the normal liver,

1027
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:45,310
but everything's altered, everything's changed, it's lost the normal structures.

1028
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:49,730
And then this is, I think, the same now this is liver.

1029
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:54,220
No liver. This is long from the same animal.

1030
01:41:54,520 --> 01:42:01,389
And this is really washed out. But lungs should look like this. Just alveolar airspace, large cell infiltrates.

1031
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:04,870
These are metastatic foci from that same tumor in the liver.

1032
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:09,760
So not only do I have very altered tissues here, dysplasia,

1033
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:15,700
I also have little islands of cells that have gone through the bloodstream and set up shop in the lungs.

1034
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:21,270
I have lung metastases. This is a little bit harder to see, but I also have a car.

1035
01:42:21,310 --> 01:42:26,889
This is the edge of the heart. And in the upper cardio surface, I have little plastic cells.

1036
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:29,980
This is cardiac metastasis. Okay?

1037
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:36,610
So this is a tumor that has moved, you know, it's altered dramatically the structure of the liver itself.

1038
01:42:36,910 --> 01:42:40,990
And not only that, it's infiltrated the vasculature, the lymphatics, and it spread to other tissues.

1039
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:45,730
This is clearly a malignancy. It's epithelial origin hepatocytes.

1040
01:42:45,730 --> 01:42:50,200
So way back at the beginning, we said that epithelium malignancies are called carcinomas.

1041
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:56,080
This is a carcinoma. And then the type of carcinoma depends on the originating cell type.

1042
01:42:56,860 --> 01:43:02,740
So if you have a carcinoma that most resembles a hepatocyte, usually you call that hepatocellular carcinoma.

1043
01:43:03,670 --> 01:43:09,520
So remember I said that hepatocytes and biliary epithelium come from the same originating cell type,

1044
01:43:10,030 --> 01:43:12,460
and if you have a tumor that has structures of both.

1045
01:43:12,970 --> 01:43:19,150
So this guy has stuff that looks more like liver over here and these kind of look like weird versions of bile ducts.

1046
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:25,210
The palate, the pathology word for that is colon NGO of the bile ducts.

1047
01:43:26,050 --> 01:43:32,650
Colon F is the word for like bile for gallstones because those have cholesterol in them.

1048
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:42,340
So if you have a tumor that has features of both hepatocytes and biliary epithelium, that's a Colangelo hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma.

1049
01:43:42,790 --> 01:43:49,149
That's what this is. So don't worry, I kind of hesitate to sometimes to throw those words at you because it gets scary.

1050
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:52,430
But the point of this is that we have abnormal more.

1051
01:43:52,530 --> 01:43:57,420
Pathology. This is a malignant tumor, clearly, because it's infiltrated other tissues.

1052
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,000
So this is a cholangiocarcinoma.

1053
01:44:00,660 --> 01:44:08,310
The other reason I showed you this is that we spent a lot of time on our non neoplastic processes talking about how you do a morphologic diagnosis,

1054
01:44:08,670 --> 01:44:12,330
see if a process of distribution of all these words a tumor.

1055
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:17,280
You kind of throw all that out the window. The Morphologic diagnosis for a tumor or a neoplasm.

1056
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:27,630
It's just the name of the neoplasm, because it really makes no sense to be like a mild parasite or carcinoma.

1057
01:44:28,890 --> 01:44:33,510
It's bad no matter how you look at it. And the malignancy versus benign is in the name itself.

1058
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:37,860
There's no distribution during duration or severity modifiers.

1059
01:44:39,090 --> 01:44:48,809
Sometimes it'll have people grade a tumor. Um, if a grading system exists, and that is based on the features of the tumor that, you know,

1060
01:44:48,810 --> 01:44:54,000
by experience or by, you know, previous studies are associated with a good or bad prognosis.

1061
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:59,880
So if you have a tumor or some tumors with a lot of inflammation, that gives you a more severe prognosis or,

1062
01:45:00,330 --> 01:45:04,140
you know, depending on how much of the tissue it affects, might be a grade two versus a grade three.

1063
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:09,990
That's a little bit different in that specific tumor. So more for tumor is just the name of the tumor hepatocellular carcinoma.

1064
01:45:10,650 --> 01:45:14,090
Okay. So that's just to give you a sense of what it looks like.

1065
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:19,679
This particular that mouse tissue I showed you was from a B 63.

1066
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:23,990
That's a first generation cross mouse in A.P. study.

1067
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,060
That's the most common mouse used in A.P. studies.

1068
01:45:27,390 --> 01:45:30,390
They do that to get a little bit more diversity than if they pick the inbred strain.

1069
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:37,740
And that is a mouse that was treated with a particular compound that they were testing for carcinogenicity.

1070
01:45:38,490 --> 01:45:45,630
So the tricky thing with some of these mouse studies is that mice can get some background level of tumors just with age.

1071
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:54,150
So hepatocellular carcinoma can occur in mice, but the incidence increases and it occurs at earlier ages with chemical carcinogens.

1072
01:45:54,800 --> 01:46:00,810
Remember said mice were a really sensitive species for carcinogens. And that's that mouse I showed you is from a carver.

1073
01:46:00,810 --> 01:46:04,410
Carver study I a committee. It's like that.

1074
01:46:04,590 --> 01:46:13,500
So carver carver is a plant derived substances substance that can be made into beverages, usually like a tea.

1075
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:19,560
And it supposedly has mild psychoactive effects, like a mild alcoholic beverage.

1076
01:46:20,010 --> 01:46:25,620
So it's common in various eras in the South Pacific and some countries in Europe.

1077
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:34,290
Um, it also is used as like an anti hookah calming tea, like an anti-anxiety agent.

1078
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:41,940
But there has been controversy because when it first came on the market, there were rare reports of liver toxicity in people who had consumed copper.

1079
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:45,120
Copper. It was very sporadic, very hard to pin down.

1080
01:46:45,630 --> 01:46:49,740
So this was actually nominated by the National Cancer Institute.

1081
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:55,129
Remember I said for MTP, anyone can nominate something that should warrant further studies.

1082
01:46:55,130 --> 01:47:00,180
So it was nominated, a study by the A.P. And the slide I showed you was from their mouse study.

1083
01:47:00,570 --> 01:47:07,260
They did an acute a chronic acute study, a chronic study of 90 days and a two year carcinogenicity study.

1084
01:47:07,930 --> 01:47:15,870
And so in their acute study, they used an extract of caviar, kava and gavage the animals daily, with an extract in their acute study in rats and mice.

1085
01:47:16,290 --> 01:47:21,540
They saw things like deaths in their high dose group. So there's a pretty high dose know.

1086
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:29,040
They saw increased clinical signs and their high dose group increased liver rates and then hypertrophy

1087
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:34,040
and maybe more metabolizing enzymes in the liver of the high dose group in their chronic studies.

1088
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:37,350
Similarly, they had some adverse findings in the high dose group.

1089
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:43,290
They had an increase in liver weights. I don't remember if they had pathology specifically about this,

1090
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:50,430
but it was just associated with hypertrophy and then the body weights of the animals in the high dose group only for rats dropped.

1091
01:47:50,970 --> 01:47:57,870
So again, some suggestion that's toxic in high doses, but a little bit equivocal based on something different with rats and mice.

1092
01:47:58,380 --> 01:48:05,400
And then in the carcinogenicity study, ultimately, even though their livers were doing all this hypertrophy,

1093
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:10,590
their livers were kind of handling it for the most part, in that there was no difference in survival from control.

1094
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:19,320
But there were some clinical signs in the high dose group throughout the study, and then troublingly there was an increase in neoplasia in the mice.

1095
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:27,030
And this was kind of confusing because the liver, the body weights overall were not changed in the mice.

1096
01:48:27,030 --> 01:48:29,939
So they seemed to tolerate it almost a little bit better than the rats.

1097
01:48:29,940 --> 01:48:35,879
But there were this increase of carcinomas and the struggle was these are this is a two year study to your material.

1098
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:42,840
Mice are old and increase in liver tumors in old mice happens ordinarily and the

1099
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:47,370
increase in adenoma and carcinoma in females is only in the low in the mid dose group.

1100
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:52,320
So that's a real interpretation challenge because you don't know nothing change in.

1101
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:58,230
Herds of rats. Is that spontaneous kind of muddying the waters or is that really related to a cover?

1102
01:48:58,620 --> 01:49:04,320
And it's still kind of equivocal. The thought is that cover cover is probably a liver toxicant in high enough amount.

1103
01:49:05,220 --> 01:49:11,400
This is just a description of the difficulty in interpreting rare tumors in chronic rodent studies.

1104
01:49:11,820 --> 01:49:16,920
I told you that rodent oval cells are more commonly proliferative in response to liver damage.

1105
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:24,110
So even if those tumors were compound related in the mice, mice are kind of a really sensitive species compared to humans.

1106
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:27,630
So can we really say that carbon cover is carcinogenic in humans?

1107
01:49:27,660 --> 01:49:34,910
Kind of hard to really make that conclusion. And so ultimately cover cover products remain controversial in Europe.

1108
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:38,640
They were actually banned for a while based on this concern over liver toxicity.

1109
01:49:38,940 --> 01:49:43,319
But that ban was later reversed. And looking at the human epidemiology,

1110
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:48,000
most of the reports of human toxicity have been with sort of a concentrated form of

1111
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:54,150
you're taking carbo extract as a capsule form or the extract itself rather than,

1112
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:56,040
you know, in the form of a traditional tea.

1113
01:49:56,430 --> 01:50:03,930
And it also has to do with the type of the plant, the leaves and the stems appear to have more of the toxic agent than the root itself.

1114
01:50:05,370 --> 01:50:13,110
And the other thought is that the reason this might be so sporadic is that the active ingredient is a competitive inhibitor of P450.

1115
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:17,480
So, you know, you're taking carbon probably you're trying to make yourself feel better.

1116
01:50:17,490 --> 01:50:23,819
Maybe you're also taking, I don't know, acetaminophen or some other compound actually that would probably,

1117
01:50:23,820 --> 01:50:27,000
if it's a competitive inhibitor, would be much of a problem.

1118
01:50:27,270 --> 01:50:34,700
But maybe you have something that needs to be metabolized 3450s and you're having some competitive inhibition from something in the teeth.

1119
01:50:34,710 --> 01:50:43,230
It may be a little bit idiosyncratic or empathic and have to do with the overall load and the metabolizing enzymes in an individual liver.

1120
01:50:43,740 --> 01:50:49,560
So that's kind of a cool example. You have that tumor of the mouse. Remember I said the tumors were very difficult to interpret,

1121
01:50:49,770 --> 01:50:55,710
so it's not entirely clear that that tumor was directly related to COVID cover in the mouse.

1122
01:50:56,010 --> 01:51:02,430
And moreover, it's not entirely clear. You can't conclude from that the carbapenem is going to cause liver tumors in a human.

1123
01:51:03,090 --> 01:51:06,390
So it's kind of a vignette. All right.

1124
01:51:06,510 --> 01:51:10,740
So that the whole look, we do have lots of pathology and bile duct art.

1125
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:17,040
So take a stab at the pathology review sheets.

1126
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:25,199
The quiz, rather. And I will and I will reveal the answers to the review sheet on the filled out version of the review sheet,

1127
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:30,570
which has some of the kind of descriptions that we talked about today. I'll do that at the end of the week after the quiz is done.

1128
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:36,260
All right. Good job with the kidney next.

1129
01:51:39,210 --> 01:51:47,490
Right? Right. Oh, yeah.

1130
01:51:48,150 --> 01:51:52,860
That was probably. Oh, yeah.

1131
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:56,270
Thanks for. Thanks for participating. It's hard not to be like anyone.

1132
01:51:56,620 --> 01:52:01,530
Anyone. So that's fine. I think we're really good.

1133
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:04,980
That's true. In a very limited vocabulary.

1134
01:52:06,150 --> 01:52:15,090
I lived in New York, was about seven years ago, which is even more hippie ish than Betty Ann Arbor level hippie now.

1135
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:19,060
And there was a there was a cop in Kabul called her. Oh, really?

1136
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:22,139
So just knowing who you're talking to, look at this place still exists.

1137
01:52:22,140 --> 01:52:26,070
And it does tell folks. Actually, no, it's not.

1138
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:32,190
I don't think, like most of the big concern I think was like early nineties maybe or I don't know, maybe even earlier.

1139
01:52:32,370 --> 01:52:35,549
But I don't think it's as controversial now.

1140
01:52:35,550 --> 01:52:42,490
And I think like I said, yeah, the products and drugs like a museum has been mostly associated with like people taking it.

1141
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:47,470
As a a medication. I wouldn't put it past the people. Go to this bar.

1142
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:58,780
Yeah, yeah. But, ah, I think I'm curious. Just like regulatory perspective, you know, own they're like if people, if we know that time is limited.

1143
01:52:58,900 --> 01:53:02,200
So yeah. And this is like expensive and they have to consider.

1144
01:53:05,030 --> 01:53:08,510
Decisions made where one two weeks ago.

1145
01:53:10,190 --> 01:53:18,530
So let's look at the weight of evidence like and so that you know, it's potential benefit.

1146
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:27,530
Right. So we know that acetaminophen is liver enzymes, also known as Mardi Drug is toxic.

1147
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:29,520
Yeah. What if it's in high risk?

1148
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:44,540
So from the standpoint of typically ignored injury, you really can't take the high likelihood of beer and liver, you know, relevant liver toxicity.

1149
01:53:44,650 --> 01:53:51,440
Yeah. The answer is that for most people, the vast majority of okay, how about within dosing limits?

1150
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:57,720
And it's unlikely to be a cause for lower toxicity if you're taking it chronically in high amounts.

1151
01:53:57,740 --> 01:53:59,780
So that's where like your dosing limits come in.

1152
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:05,150
Or there might be individuals where, you know, if they have liver compromised because I'm a prescribing physician,

1153
01:54:05,450 --> 01:54:11,180
I'm going to be more cautious if I prescribe a drug that is a known where liver is the most sensitive organ.

1154
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:17,840
If I know somebody already has liver compromised, is what a viable alternative, just like an need idea?

1155
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:25,309
Or is that also I mean, every drug has toxicity, so like a hard thing to kind of wrap your mind around.

1156
01:54:25,310 --> 01:54:29,240
Like sometimes when we learn or especially when we talk about these these pathways to toxicity,

1157
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:34,400
just like we said, there is no unique for the most part, there's no unique pathway to toxicity.

1158
01:54:34,430 --> 01:54:43,760
Everything is kind of as a result of its ordinary metabolism, but in excess or, you know, doses that are too much for the body to cope with.

1159
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:47,930
So, like, I mean, if I drink enough water, I can die.

1160
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:54,860
Yeah. So, like any drug. And that's why when we talk about testing drugs in animals, the goal is not to prove that it's safe.

1161
01:54:55,190 --> 01:54:58,220
It's to identify at what level it becomes toxic.

1162
01:54:58,250 --> 01:55:02,959
It becomes toxic. And what is the organ that's most sensitive to it so that if I'm a physician,

1163
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:07,330
I have to decide, okay, you know, mean the chronic inflammatory condition.

1164
01:55:07,340 --> 01:55:09,830
What am I going to give to this person to kind of help them?

1165
01:55:10,490 --> 01:55:15,260
You know, chronic inflammation, like if your knee is bad, that really affects your quality of life and what you can do.

1166
01:55:15,350 --> 01:55:19,070
You might need an anti-inflammatory. Mm hmm. So I have to make a decision.

1167
01:55:19,700 --> 01:55:23,600
What drug is going to be effective for this, and what are the potential adverse effects of this drug?

1168
01:55:23,870 --> 01:55:28,649
How does that look in the context of this individual? Like, is this a normal, healthy young person with a healthy liver?

1169
01:55:28,650 --> 01:55:31,460
Or is this a person who's like on a waiting list for a liver transplant?

1170
01:55:31,730 --> 01:55:36,620
And that's going to affect I'm going to make a value judgment for that individual as to what I prescribe.

1171
01:55:36,950 --> 01:55:39,730
And in the bigger sense, like when I'm looking if I'm the FDA,

1172
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:45,650
I'm looking at someone trying to prove it was the first time acetaminophen was being looked at.

1173
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:49,130
I would have to see demonstrated. Okay.

1174
01:55:49,370 --> 01:55:56,989
We start to see acute liver toxicity is at this level extrapolate up from the animals, you know, based on our metric scaling or whatever.

1175
01:55:56,990 --> 01:56:04,610
I think the human dose equivalent for that toxicity is this in my clinical trials, I dosed humans at this level,

1176
01:56:04,910 --> 01:56:10,840
which I think is therapeutically effective and I'm monitored like is my toxicity monitoring.

1177
01:56:11,150 --> 01:56:19,310
And I monitor liver enzymes because if I have a monitor, I don't think that the word monitor able excessive if it's able to be monitored,

1178
01:56:19,730 --> 01:56:24,200
I'm less concerned about that than something that there's nothing I can monitor it and it just.

1179
01:56:24,290 --> 01:56:30,380
Yeah. Comes out. Yeah. So it's a weight of evidence and you have to balance for the FDA like efficacy.

1180
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:33,920
I mean, if it's not effective, why risk it?

1181
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:35,120
Yeah. Efficacy.

1182
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:43,579
And how likely is it that you're going to hit the toxicity threshold in order to reduce and also like the condition because you're going

1183
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:50,630
to accept a lot more potential toxicity if it's like a chemotherapeutic because you're treating a condition that's life threatening.

1184
01:56:50,660 --> 01:56:55,820
Yeah. Then like high toxicity with like a male pattern baldness drug.

1185
01:56:55,910 --> 01:57:00,830
Yeah. Because the consequence of the condition doesn't warrant taking the risk of that agent.

1186
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:03,920
Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah, that makes sense. All right. Thank you. For sure. No worries.

1187
01:57:38,830 --> 01:57:42,920
You don't have anything to say. Yeah.

1188
01:57:55,080 --> 01:58:01,670
But I. Yes.

1189
01:58:27,410 --> 01:58:33,660
Your friends and family may not know.

1190
01:58:33,670 --> 01:58:37,320
You're so jealous of them.

1191
01:58:40,810 --> 01:58:54,700
Now, why are you involved in this? You know, she said she was going to like this one herself.

1192
01:58:54,800 --> 01:59:00,490
I mean, you were there. Yeah, she's there.

1193
