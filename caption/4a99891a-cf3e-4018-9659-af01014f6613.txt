1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:07,760
So how did you get into this trial?

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:43,560
So we can see you and you can see some wishes through some of the words.

3
00:00:46,450 --> 00:01:18,270
But that's all right.

4
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:37,280
I started doing what I don't want to do by the hour of all, or it's scaring the historical away by this point 3 billion, the highest in history.

5
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:44,580
So last year we had a midterm question, our office, the probability of winning the jackpot.

6
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,250
And that's what I calculated.

7
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,730
What's the probability of winning? What's the expectation?

8
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:05,100
All right. So today I continue on the multivariate random variable and talk about the information.

9
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:13,130
I mean, the previous homework assignment actually involved some questions about the bar.

10
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,990
What do we have to talk about? It's just from the foundations.

11
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:27,210
So today we're going to introduce some era where you can simplify calculation by applying the therapy, assuming that the conditions are satisfied.

12
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:35,700
Take a look at how that works. So before we get started, just a review of what we have talk about or a univariate transformation.

13
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:46,139
Recall that univariate random variable transformation is applied when you we want to derive the

14
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:53,490
distribution for another random variable which can be expressed as a function of the original roundabout.

15
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:01,710
And assuming that you know the distribution for the random variable x, if you want to know the distribution for life,

16
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:12,660
which is g function, you can use the formula that was introduced before if this function, g satisfies some conditions.

17
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:19,960
All right. And we put our container in two cases.

18
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,400
One is not as if this crate if that's the case.

19
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:31,650
Then the Y is also discrete and or any value small like a pdf of the piano.

20
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:40,150
Fly me as the summation of all possible that is for us such that g amounts is equal to y.

21
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,140
And in sum of all those probabilities, acts kick out the piano.

22
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,070
And furthermore, if this chance is a 1 to 1 mapping, then we have the following relation.

23
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:57,760
That is a map of why is, as the PM all evaluated at this inverse function.

24
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:08,200
So that only applies when it's a 1 to 1 map and you can decide the domain of y are the support of Y based on the support of x.

25
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:16,970
So check that support of x. Say what this job x was the image of this job, and that's the support of Y.

26
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,580
And so that's how I define the support for the transport around available.

27
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:29,950
And furthermore, if we have a continuous random variable and this transformation is a 1 to 1,

28
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:40,750
then we can express the PD out of the transform random variable y as acts divide about this enormous y times,

29
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:53,230
absolute value of this derivative a derivative of as over derivative of y that the work acts overwatch or equivalent also present this way.

30
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:05,350
So this is essentially the inverse function. I think we learned the inverse, the relation between x and Y to got the derivative y over us.

31
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:14,260
But now you divide your our function for perhaps you might imagine you must find by that by that absolute value.

32
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,540
So these two are equivalent.

33
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:29,020
So this is the formula for univariate transformation, especially when the transformation is a 1 to 1 function, is a 1 to 1 mapping.

34
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:40,650
So in that continuous case, you also define the support for y for this transform run a variable based on the image of x,

35
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:51,000
you first got the support flags, then apply it to this j function chart for the images and that defines the support.

36
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,339
Transform random variable and nothing is through here.

37
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:02,130
It's always the review of what we have covered in every case, and more generally we have the theorem.

38
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:10,860
That is, if G of acts is not 1 to 1, but it satisfies some conditions such that there are disjoint sets.

39
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:22,560
I'll make a one to make the K that span the entire domain of x and I estimate on each omega j you can get a new function

40
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:34,860
DOJ that is continuous and a one on 1 to 1 on this support omega j that is also equal to the original transformation.

41
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:43,229
Then you can break down your transformation into this k parts and the transform.

42
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:49,440
The variable has this PDF which is essentially just a summation of this k different parts.

43
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:56,880
Each part is directly using for this formula what is a 1 to 1 transformation.

44
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:10,500
So you have this type of ASCII value and this g, inverse y and the absolute absolute value of this derivative of g function inverse over y.

45
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:17,190
That's most general that I'll have to talk about for this.

46
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:26,579
Not 1 to 1 mapping. If you can somehow break down that information into pieces and each piece satisfy this conditions,

47
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,750
you can use this zero to get the PDF of the transform right of our body, right.

48
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:38,640
In particular, we have a case, we have a drawdown of y equals to a square, right?

49
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,890
It has that domain maximum infinity, definitive.

50
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:52,560
Then you can break that domain into three parts and let me go one and be an active zero and activate entity.

51
00:07:52,580 --> 00:08:03,239
There are only got to to be just 3.0 and omega three is zero infinity to break it down into the

52
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,970
three paths omega two we can simply just ignore it because the answer is crying out for the zero,

53
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,250
right? So that the support,

54
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:20,100
the probability of the random variable I'm taking particular value is always zero or that's all I need to focus on if this two is.

55
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:30,360
That's right. And you can argue that this transformation can be broken down into two transformations G one and G two.

56
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:37,350
Both have the same function form on this two domains and on each stoneman, it's continuous on a one on one.

57
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,120
Now you can apply that there are a transform.

58
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,380
PDF is the summation of two functions, okay?

59
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,350
One for each part. So that's the example that we have set before.

60
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:58,460
It also applies to other examples. Any questions so far?

61
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,470
Again, this there's nothing new here. It's just the review of what we uncovered.

62
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:12,410
Okay. All right. So now we what we are trying to do is to extend that through this multidimensional.

63
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:20,370
Unconventional running back. Random parallels are also known as a running back.

64
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:31,320
So the setting is as follows Assume this house, this boat X is a matter of a run of animals X, one, two and three dimensional.

65
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:37,110
And to start with us, consider this continuous case. Okay, so all of this x one,

66
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:44,310
two x and they are a continuous amount of variables and this and we know that drawn distributions

67
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:52,380
of this and run of variables previously we have talk about a drawing distribution for two barrels.

68
00:09:52,890 --> 00:10:00,660
Now just send out a little bit to the drawing distribution and random marbles and could be a number that's greater than two.

69
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,460
All right. But the way it's defined is exactly the same as before.

70
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,360
You can define the drawing period drawn out, etc.,

71
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:19,290
but it's that run up after so soon that we know that drawing distribution, which is not defined as fact in this case,

72
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:26,040
how both letters represent represented factors assumes that our goal is to have a

73
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:34,709
PDF of a transform random variable y where y is a function of this original random

74
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:42,240
variable x 1000 in particular for y one is a function of x12x and in order by this

75
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,000
g one or y two is another function in order by g two and so on and so forth.

76
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,560
And we have another lens and backtrack.

77
00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:01,430
Y y y y. I alternatively can write it in this way for y is equal to a g of acts.

78
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:18,870
So here all three are both meaning. All three are factors, and that's to say basis ya1 to one is the one x always contain an x, right?

79
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:28,230
So each GI is a function that maps, lists and land and vectors to a number.

80
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:45,690
All right. So that way we establish a mapping between the original and doctor original and parallel to the new and parallels this the function,

81
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:51,870
this multivariate function maps from the original and dimensional space to a new and dimensional space.

82
00:11:54,390 --> 00:12:00,510
Now the question is what is that drawn distribution for this new and vector of Y?

83
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,590
All right. So that's what we are trying to get.

84
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:16,230
So the short answer to that question is if this G function is a 1 to 1 mapping, then we have the following formula.

85
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:22,470
That is, the drawing distribution for Y can be expressed as the drawing distribution

86
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,220
for X evaluated as this cheap inverse y high is the inverse of a determinant,

87
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,710
or the determinant is applied to a matrix called the Jacobean matrix,

88
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:41,129
essentially the partial derivative of y over y,

89
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:52,650
over x or ax over y and I that y you can get rid of this inverse by taking the derivative partial derivative of x over x over y.

90
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:59,010
So I say that's the equivalent in a second, but this is the solution.

91
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,240
If you look at this formula and consider what it becomes, one, and it's in quarter one,

92
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:13,230
then only when we consider the univariate case, that's exactly what we have seen before for the random continuous random variable.

93
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:21,840
So if you have a univariate case and is equal to one and what that is is this.

94
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:30,760
While Y is equal to about the inverse y ions.

95
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,110
Now this determinant just becomes the derivative of.

96
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:58,540
Right. It just becomes what I have said before of the previous page.

97
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:16,270
This guy that has reduced this to the universities now that just extend the university results to the multivariate space.

98
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:23,620
Again, this theorem tells us that you can extend the original result to the end dimension of space.

99
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,159
If you have that drawn distribution for a length and vector of random travels, you can.

100
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:39,040
And you have this the end to end mapping this g function that is a 1 to 1 mapping from our into our end.

101
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,530
Now you can directly apply this result to the joint distribution of the Transform roundabout.

102
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:52,750
Okay. So if you look at this formula, we already know what X is, the drawing distribution is,

103
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:58,690
and given the g functions so hypothetical, it shouldn't be too complicated.

104
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:05,620
Calculate the inverse function. So all that's needed is to calculate this, to call your matrix and take the determinant.

105
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,510
Once we have all these components, you put them together. You got the joint distribution for Y.

106
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:23,410
That's how it worked. And more specifically, the Jacobean matrix, as I said, is defined as the partial derivative of Y over x and by a matrix.

107
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,670
So my own sense increases our end to our end mapping.

108
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,440
So this j matrix is a in my own matrix, and it's defined as follows.

109
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:49,470
And. So the first row is all a partial derivative of y one over x one to accent, and the second row as a part of the row y two over x one to accent.

110
00:15:49,680 --> 00:16:01,350
So so you can got this by a matrix, always by a matrix because you can only calculate it to come in at or a square matrix.

111
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:10,680
But if this square matrix symmetric matrix it is symmetric doesn't have to be symmetric.

112
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:16,680
It doesn't, right. It's just partial derivative based on the definition.

113
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:23,990
It does not have to be symmetric. In fact, in most cases it won't be symmetric by itself,

114
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:35,610
but it has to be a square matrix and it has to be a mapping from random travels to another and right variables in order to use this result.

115
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,790
And also, as I mentioned,

116
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:51,340
one way to calculate this and is to take this part of the world of wine over us and then make and then you need is the inverse of that.

117
00:16:51,340 --> 00:17:02,370
So the value of the determinant. Alternatively, it is also equal to one over absolute value of the determinant of a different matrix.

118
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:07,330
And that is the partial derivative of x over what? These two are the same.

119
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,740
So we always have this relation if it's a 1 to 1 mapping.

120
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,980
All right. So namely, the determinant,

121
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:25,540
the absolute value of the determinant for Y over x is equal to one over the absolute value of determinant of x over in practice,

122
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:33,580
you can do that either one, but no matter which one you use, make sure that you use the correct one in the original one.

123
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,090
What we need is that determinant of j that Jacoby it and then you have the inverse.

124
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,530
If you want to use x over y, you do not use that aims.

125
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:53,950
So make sure that you use the correct conversion. And lastly, we need to determine the the support for this transform around variables.

126
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,480
And that could sometimes be tricky compared to the univariate case.

127
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:05,799
So the university case you first decided to support for X and then based on the transformation, you decide that.

128
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:12,580
So part of life is pretty much the same here. But sometimes since this transformation is a multivariate function,

129
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:20,380
so that the termination of that support for the transform round of arrivals can be tricky, I'll see that in examples.

130
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:29,110
And so that's the formula that we can use when doing this try and transformation of multiple random variables.

131
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:39,370
Again, one thing to notice is that this formula, this function only applies to 1 to 1 mapping from an dimension to a dimension.

132
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,500
If you do not satisfy that setting, you can not directly use this.

133
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:54,460
But if you do satisfy that force, sorry, you cannot use this formula yet this g has to be.

134
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:09,410
One, two, one. Maggie Horan To our end, this is a represent they are using as a result.

135
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,370
All right. Now, let's take a look at the example.

136
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:27,440
So assume that we start from X one and as to this binary random arrivals and we want to get the distribution for Y one and Y two.

137
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,640
All right. And in particular, y, y and y two is defined this way.

138
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:36,890
Y one is x one plus x two. Y two is x one minus x two.

139
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:46,610
So first, then first. Let's check whether this is a 1 to 1 transformation from R2 to R2.

140
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,420
If it is that we can use what we just learned,

141
00:19:51,690 --> 00:20:00,299
use that formula to calculate all these components and got this wrong distribution for why one and why two from the drawing distribution of x1,

142
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,960
one and x2. So if you look at this.

143
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:16,560
Relation. This one is equal to achieve one of acts one has two and that she one function is defined by x one plus x two,

144
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:24,030
and it's y two is g two of x1x2, and I define as x one minus x two.

145
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,210
So it's easy to get the inverse transformation which.

146
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:39,500
Prove that this is, in fact a 1 to 1 transformation with each human set of x1x2.

147
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,310
There is only one set up y one, y two, and vice versa.

148
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:50,400
So it's one, two, one. All right. So you can write out the inverse transformation.

149
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:55,100
X one is equal to why do you want the numbers?

150
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:06,060
Y one. Y two, which is. Do the calculation that's going to be ay1 plus y two over two.

151
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:13,980
Right. And also as two is two immersed while on y two.

152
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:20,190
Because my one minus y two over two.

153
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:28,250
So it does have a inverse transformation which proves that this g function is transformation,

154
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:37,350
drawing transformation from x one to x to our next 1x22y1y2 is indeed a 1 to 1 mapping from R2 to our to.

155
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:50,700
Then we can use the formula to help us figure that one distribution for y one and Y to be called out of order to use this formula,

156
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:56,430
we need to get all of these different components. Now we already have this inverse transformation function.

157
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,380
The next then is to get this draconian matrix right.

158
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:13,590
So the Jacoby and Matrix recall that is the part of derivative of y over x write out what each component is.

159
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:23,090
If you take the partial derivative of y one over x one, why do I have to?

160
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,900
So all we want is x one plus x two.

161
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:42,230
All right. That is to say, you are taking this partial derivative of this binary function g1xx2 with respect to ask one.

162
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,340
You do the derivative. That's just a concept.

163
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,270
What I was going to do this partial derivative.

164
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,340
The other the other variable as to is essentially treated as a constant.

165
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:01,620
It doesn't differentiate this function with respect to us.

166
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,060
One. If you do that, you get this constant one.

167
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,960
Similarly, if you do the parts of the ribbon about the Y one over y two, you also get to one.

168
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:18,480
And if you've got parts of the work that y two over x one got a one, and lastly y two over x two, we've got an active one.

169
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:24,450
This is not okay. So putting everything together, we have this two by two matrix.

170
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:36,700
Right. In this case, this is a constant matrix, does not involve x one or two in it, but it's not always the case in many examples.

171
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,959
Jacoby Jacobean matrix a well content x one, an x two.

172
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,790
If that's totally fine. It is what it is.

173
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:51,580
And you take the partial derivative, it's right along with whatever you got all those partial derivatives, that's hard to call it a matrix.

174
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:57,220
And here is a special case where this draconian does not involve x one and I was two.

175
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:05,710
It's not always the case file, that's one. And so next as calculated, the absolute value of the determinant.

176
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:19,210
First one is the determinant of this two by two matrix. I hope you do know how to calculate the determinant of a matrix, especially to by commitments.

177
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,430
And so that's that's definitely something that you should know.

178
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:31,630
Okay. So the way to calculate it is one times negative one minus one times one.

179
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:41,770
All right. So in this case, negative two. And then you take that boulevard there, you got this absolute value of a determinant to be two.

180
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,910
Now we can put everything together, right? So the joint distribution for y one,

181
00:24:48,910 --> 00:25:00,490
y two is the joint distribution for AX evaluated this inverse function times a determinant of Jacobean absolute value and inverse.

182
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,820
So to put everything together, we have the formula.

183
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,920
She's won over two times. That's one.

184
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,620
That's two.

185
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:43,530
This one went over to times of excellence to evaluate y one plus y to over two and y y minus y two over two characters even try and function,

186
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:54,570
try and play out for iPhone. I want to do some plugging in this function to get that PD pdf or y one on y to interact with a basic transformation.

187
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,390
Any question about this example.

188
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:13,550
So this just demonstrate how we can use the theorem to quickly derive a drawing distribution for a transform roundabout.

189
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:23,990
And again, first step, you always check whether the transformation is a 1 to 1 and our into our end.

190
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:31,220
All right. Because that's the purpose and how to check that before using this result.

191
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,690
And the second, you need to work out the inverse transformation,

192
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:43,730
typically what is provided is how this new random variable is constructed based on the original random variable.

193
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:47,780
That's our function. You don't have to use this result.

194
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:54,350
You need the inverse. So that's my next step to calculate the two humors, the inverse transformation.

195
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,800
And third, you need to calculate that Jacobi a matrix.

196
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:09,690
And by I am calculators constant. They are so determinant and put everything together.

197
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,970
You got your result? Yes.

198
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:24,120
So for these types of questions, does it require an explicit consent order or is that just implicit in the fact that we found an inverse?

199
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,319
We don't have to right to do something.

200
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:35,340
And you have to have the explicit inverse function in order to plug into this joint idea.

201
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,160
You do have to have the explicit formula for this to enhance the two units,

202
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:49,379
and that's sufficient as a proof that it's one that's in most cases is sufficient to prove that it's 1 to 1.

203
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,590
Maybe if your inverse function does not.

204
00:27:52,770 --> 00:28:00,000
It has a exquisite form. It basically says, given a set of y one, y two, you have the unique value, perhaps one and two.

205
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:06,180
Right? That is that is one way to prove that is actually 1 to 1 mapping or.

206
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:17,879
Question the other questions. So now we can in this example,

207
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:26,850
we can also double check whether this Kobe and then we calculated basically a partial derivative of Y over ice is equivalent

208
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:35,610
to calculate another partial derivative matrix of acts over Y right and taking the the determinant and the absolute value.

209
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:43,140
So you recall the humors is the part, the derivative.

210
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:59,880
One over 1121 over 122 over 112 over one two.

211
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:11,610
And recall that x one is equal to y one plus y two over 2x2 is y one minus y two over two so we can fill in the blanks.

212
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:21,180
Okay. So what is the first entry was partially revenue of x one over y11 over two.

213
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,240
Right. And what about the second one? X one over two, one, two.

214
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:30,909
Thanks to over y one over 2x2 over y two.

215
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,070
Inactive one over two. All right.

216
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:44,590
Now, if you calculate the determinant of this on this inverse Jacobean matrix that is not negative one or four minus one over four,

217
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,920
not to one over two. All right.

218
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,530
So if you take that absolute value, that's one over two.

219
00:29:51,910 --> 00:30:03,960
Which confirms that this absolute value of determinant to inverse is equal to the determinant of the Jacobean humors.

220
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:11,470
That is how, in general, it's just that double checking to make sure that that's the case.

221
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,910
And then can also be used as a way to change your calculation.

222
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:21,400
In practice, you can do it both ways to make sure that our calculation is correct.

223
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:29,340
All right. Okay.

224
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:36,090
So now consider the case where we know the exact distribution platform next to it.

225
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:40,590
So I assume that's one to our independent normal distributions.

226
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,820
I know words. I just want one, too.

227
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:53,120
It's one that's two is equal to the product of this margin.

228
00:30:55,060 --> 00:31:05,200
It is one over two high speed to the next two square to one or two.

229
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:12,819
And if you write out the joint distribution ranks one next to it has this form is

230
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,620
equal to the product of the marginal and both have standard normal distribution.

231
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:23,260
Then the question is what is the drawing distribution for Y one and Y to divide that way?

232
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:31,340
Okay. So the solution, the answer is here, and they are also independent novels.

233
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:41,120
But I want you to translate that formula of distributions by one and a line two and verify that they are indeed independent.

234
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:53,120
Give me a couple minutes trying to plug in this joint distribution function into what we have just arrived and got the joint distribution.

235
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:59,840
But why one by two and then show that they are the independent and.

236
00:32:05,540 --> 00:34:10,270
He just. Right.

237
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:17,730
Got it. So here is what it looks like if I plug in.

238
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:24,480
Why don't we just had a phone? The function that we have, we have ten from the previous slide.

239
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:31,200
And here is what we got. So you can plug in this joint distribution plus one.

240
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:41,730
And to replace it by replace X one by one plus by two, or to replace x two by one, minus one, y two over two.

241
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:48,840
Then with some simplification. You got this bottom, not that joint PDA, but why wouldn't I want to?

242
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:54,150
All right. And furthermore, in order to gather marginals, how do we do it?

243
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:02,760
The most famous way or the stutter way is to do integration, right?

244
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:12,120
Integrate out why you want to get the marginal player Y to integrate our Y to figure out the marginal distribution for y one.

245
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,710
In this case, you can say the y one and y to are totally separable.

246
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:28,710
In fact, you can directly write out this two in very symmetric form and each one can be viewed as the pdf for each rhinovirus.

247
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:34,920
And in fact, that's the same as what you got if you do this integration.

248
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:40,830
So this is the marginal for Y one and this is the marginal or Y two.

249
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:50,310
And I hope by now you recognize that this is the the kernel or this is the PDA function for normal distributions.

250
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:57,300
Right. The other words, both Y one and the Y to our normal distribution.

251
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:03,070
And since the joint distribution can be to try and create this process of turn off of the

252
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:09,210
individual PDA that just says the two are independent and y one and one two are independent.

253
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:21,300
The Y is the men and berries for yyy1 has this PDA.

254
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:25,680
What is the mean? Yeah, there are always various.

255
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:33,510
What is the balance? You too, right?

256
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:39,600
The square of the square root of two. Square root of two is the standard deviation of variance.

257
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:49,530
Similarly for y two mean zero varies two and they are independent because a joint giddyup is equal to the product of marginal medium.

258
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:58,020
All right. So that's what we got, namely to put this conclusion together.

259
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:07,980
What we see is that if X one and two are independent, set a normal distribution, then x one plus x two and x one minus x two.

260
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:14,070
They are still independent, normal distributions of the differences.

261
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:18,990
Now, after these constructions, the variance becomes different.

262
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:22,680
The means zero of the variance becomes two instead of one.

263
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,580
I don't know if that actually makes sense. Right.

264
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,430
If you consider this how y y is constructed, if you want to calculate.

265
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,870
Here. Consider how y y is constructed.

266
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,470
If you calculate the exact location of y one, that's just the expectation of x one.

267
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:52,150
US has to write and says we know x one and Acts two.

268
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,190
There are independent ways both with means zero.

269
00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:07,550
That just means that the expectation of y one is also there and for the variance of y one, not again hours of x one plus x two.

270
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:12,530
All right. If that's 1x2 are independent.

271
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:22,430
What is that equal to? How do we break down this variance of the summation of two of our priorities?

272
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:35,910
That's equal to what parents of one parent have access to, right.

273
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:39,920
Because they're independent. If they're not independent, we have additional term.

274
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:47,910
Now, remember what that additional time is two times up the covariance of X minus two, right?

275
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,750
Since they are independent. Now covariance is just a zero.

276
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:56,420
So we can order that and now we can plug in the values we know the variance while x

277
00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:02,400
one is one variance for x two is also one that gave us the balance between the two,

278
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,900
which agrees with what? With what we described.

279
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,500
What do we do right? That makes sense. Okay.

280
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:18,090
In fact, any linear transformation, any linear combination of knowledge distribution are still novel.

281
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:26,100
So this is a very generative result. Any linear information of normal random marbles is still normal.

282
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:37,320
And so that's a very nice property for the normal distribution of this is closed with respect to the linear transformations.

283
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,490
So any linear transformation of normal distribution is still novel.

284
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:48,030
So here is just a special case where we have two standard normal distribution that are independent.

285
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:55,320
Then the sum and the difference of this. Two, they are still independent and they have this two normal distributions.

286
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,190
Okay. All right. Questions.

287
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:07,680
Okay. One more remark that I want to make regarding this example is that.

288
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:14,690
You cannot directly tell whether to run a viable independent or not.

289
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:20,240
In most cases, it's like if you think about how this why, why not, why to construct it.

290
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:24,240
It's not very easy to say that a why one? Why do I independence?

291
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:31,610
Right. Both of them are constructed based on this next one on as to why are they independent.

292
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:39,650
When you find that independence has to be true. Once you've got that one distribution form, why one and why two?

293
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:44,480
It's not straightforward to say from how they are constructed.

294
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,660
At least I cannot tell that they are independent is not our topic.

295
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:54,470
But once you're out of the drawing distribution, it becomes much more clearer.

296
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:03,920
So you can marginalize one, marginalize the other, and show that a joint PDF is equal to the part of individual opinion,

297
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:07,970
basically using the definition to show that they are indeed independent.

298
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,250
And I want to make any questions about this example.

299
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:25,110
All right. So here is another example. So I'll leave it to you and give you a couple of minutes to work it out.

300
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:30,840
All right. So the setting is like this I have and one of our goals, that's one to accept.

301
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:35,700
And they are independent and all have the same distribution.

302
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:39,330
That is, exponential distribution was performed a lot.

303
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:47,729
Right. So this idea we're going to introduce that in the next I'm not sure what that means is that one is independent of it,

304
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,970
two, independent of three and so on and so forth.

305
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:55,950
They they're all mutually independent and they have the same distribution exponential.

306
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:03,479
We now consider these transformation Z 1 to 1, Zeta is x one plus x two, so on.

307
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,930
So of course there is x one plus x two all the way to access it.

308
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:13,080
Now the question is, what is that drawing distribution are z120.

309
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:27,990
A couple minutes, follow the steps that we have introduced and try to get final results.

310
00:43:42,620 --> 00:45:49,110
Yeah. You.

311
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:07,930
All right. So let's look at this together and see how to use that formula to grab that joint distribution.

312
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:12,580
Z one to the first step. What is the first step?

313
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:27,960
When it's the first step, very good inverse of G and that will kill two birds, right?

314
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:31,270
One is that and we got the humerus function image transformation.

315
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:41,950
And second, once we have that inverse function, we can use that to show that this is actually a 1 to 1 mapping from our end to our end.

316
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:51,370
So that's the first step. So we want to got this X equal to a, g, m versus Z expression, a form of that, the functional form of that.

317
00:46:52,090 --> 00:47:03,640
So X one clearly is equal to z one, and from how this construct it we can get x two is equal to Z to minus name one.

318
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:12,520
All right. And similarly with this induction, you can get all the way down to the last one.

319
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:21,710
And is equal to zero. -0, minus one not.

320
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,500
That's the inverse transformation. And from this enormous transformation, it's not hard to say.

321
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:32,000
It's a 1 to 1 match of our into our with each set of x, one,

322
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:40,010
two x and you've got a unique z120x and with each the z one to Z, and you also get a you need x one to accept.

323
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:46,820
So this one, two, one. That's right. So that's the first step. Now, let's calculate the Jacoby.

324
00:47:48,290 --> 00:48:13,500
So BEAUBIEN is defined as. Z one over x one all the way to the, uh, the one over accent and the one with the proper one, the over accent.

325
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:18,060
So it's an unbiased square matrix. And based on this.

326
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:35,640
Transformation. We know this matrix is what? His diagonal is blocked down and his upper is the lower triangular.

327
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:38,999
Right. So you have one.

328
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:52,050
The first row is one and then our zero, second row is one, one and then zero as also the last row is one one all the way to the entry being one.

329
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:56,400
The other words, the upper triangular is all zero.

330
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:05,800
Then we can use the the result from algebra to easily calculate a determinant of this matrix.

331
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:13,030
If it's a slower triangular matrix, we know the determinant and just the product of the diagonal balance.

332
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:19,090
In this case, all the values are one, so we can easily calculate the determinant to be one.

333
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:23,940
Absolute vitamin is also one. So that's the second set together.

334
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:30,010
Chookagian and the determinant. Finally, you can put everything together.

335
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:37,750
So far as we know, they are independent exponential distribution where each random variable has PD out.

336
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:48,360
Each NISI has PD of lambda times due to the high says they are independent.

337
00:49:48,670 --> 00:50:02,250
The joint period is just a product of individual opinions and the joint idea is a lambda two and times exponential and active lambda.

338
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:07,600
So I prop one to a Axion and that's here.

339
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:18,820
Now we can put everything together by replacing the x one times and by this inverse function evaluated as z times is determined.

340
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:26,350
We call that the inverse function is X, Y, and z one, x two and a z, two, minus z one, and so on.

341
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:32,290
So force that you plug it in and you can find this one and just.

342
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:38,140
Yeah. All right. But they gave us the product.

343
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:50,930
They learn that and times e to the negative lambda times the times one of the last cars.

344
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:58,280
That is what the that is the join PDF for the transport random variable.

345
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:07,500
We're not done yet. And once you have this joint PDA, you also need to decide what is the support.

346
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:13,320
Why don't you think about the support over the break? And that has continue to.

347
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:32,070
The conditions under which he was able to reach.

348
00:51:38,680 --> 00:52:17,890
Do you think to stay with other either Australia and New Zealand.

349
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:31,240
Yes. There's think so said on.

350
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:42,600
Well, this is not an easy time, but you yourself have to decide.

351
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:56,370
That's right. Yes. It's not exactly what she's saying.

352
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:09,280
She's not is not going to be able to change will come.

353
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:31,570
You can either resolve either party early on this case.

354
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:35,170
We don't think so either.

355
00:53:35,740 --> 00:54:12,820
Na on the differences between the two parties because you don't want to lose everything little by little of what happened.

356
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:44,870
There's not a 100% reduction are you know, that we went into the Bush era.

357
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:57,240
I think it's also one of two things because I think we are not talking about,

358
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:20,380
I believe that towards transformation of the white community from poverty.

359
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:46,780
But of course trauma and trauma and this is the most important thing to show you why you have got to shut it down.

360
00:55:47,170 --> 00:56:30,780
Why do you think your English language is insistent that the entrepreneurs in to to that.

361
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:47,850
What we need to.

362
00:56:54,630 --> 00:57:38,370
If you want to see more of the surgery each time he or she has to go to the hospital.

363
00:57:38,740 --> 00:58:00,990
She costarred with each of them in particular.

364
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:23,280
Otherwise, it's always been portrayed on the same side, managed by the New York Times.

365
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:31,750
You can use common sense.

366
00:58:32,880 --> 00:59:01,560
For example, every transaction I write doesn't require social media communication.

367
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:10,290
So you can be one of the things that you cannot.

368
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:28,840
You know, it has to be my sister. I don't sound like my dad.

369
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:36,930
I should know under those circumstances.

370
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:44,830
Yes, we can tell you how much we have.

371
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:49,010
You shouldn't talk about it.

372
00:59:49,470 --> 01:00:07,980
That's what I was told to know what's on my computer.

373
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:12,660
We have a lot of this transformation now.

374
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:19,500
We have a right of a strong distribution for you. And the final step is to decide what is a support.

375
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:30,360
I recall that in our original run back to the support is the one greater than zero to greater than zero and so on and so forth.

376
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:40,050
And we are namely in the first quadrant or this joint and dimensional running backwards.

377
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:54,750
That's the original support. And you recall that the way to decide to support on the transformer our is by looking at this transformation

378
01:00:55,650 --> 01:01:04,830
considering how this run of our models are transform and then decide to support for this transformer in particular.

379
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:09,450
So as we know, Z one is X one. What about the support for Z?

380
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:13,020
What is going to be the same as a support by one?

381
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:25,260
Right. But that's going to be from zero. You can it and for Z two non-essential services at the one plus X two.

382
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,680
So marginally it's also from zero to infinity.

383
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:41,340
Right. But what do we care about is that join support for Z one Zeta all the way through the if we consider that drawn support,

384
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:45,550
we need to look at the right hand side, okay?

385
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:51,390
And then calculate what the support is going to be. Since we know last one is greater than.

386
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:56,280
As to greater than zero so and so forth to X erm greater than zero.

387
01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:01,650
So that leads to the set of conditions for this easy 1 to 0.

388
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:05,100
That is the one has to be greater than zero.

389
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:14,850
They two minus three, one has to zero and so on and so forth until the minus is minus, one has to be greater than zero.

390
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:16,980
Right.

391
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:27,210
You have to go down the right hand side from this inverse transformation and apply the support for us to get the conditions or the support fuzzy.

392
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:41,100
If you solve this inequalities, eventually what we've got is Z one greater than zero, z two greater than the one, the three greater than the two,

393
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:56,640
and so on, so forth, which leads to a joint support of being Z and greater than Z and minus one greater than the one greater than zero.

394
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:03,720
So that is the joint support for this distribution sense.

395
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:08,160
And that's the drawing clear and the drawing support.

396
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:13,380
And the PDF only takes that function of form on this support.

397
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:23,150
Outside of the support, it's always zero. It is a complete solution to this joint distribution.

398
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:35,220
Any questions? And now we have the Chinese distribution.

399
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:40,050
One thing we can do is to guard the marginals from the joint distribution.

400
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:51,870
If you want to go to the Xi'an, the heart of the camp of Xian, then what we can do is to marginalize this joint distribution by integrating out Z.

401
01:03:51,870 --> 01:04:01,260
One, two, three and minus one. And so we know that drawing distribution of 0120.

402
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:14,299
If we want to get to the marginal position, we just need to do this job distribution, this integration,

403
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:28,820
multipoint integration of this short PDA with the respect to the to the three, actually, they want data all the way to the end, minus one.

404
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:35,310
And we do that multiple integration, we can gather margin all of azn.

405
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:36,299
Similarly,

406
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:48,090
if you want to get the margin of the z i vianney index it just to integrate out all of the other things with subscript one two end except for high.

407
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:52,440
Right. And in this case.

408
01:04:54,620 --> 01:05:04,400
Our goal is to find the Z and we can integrate it from the Z one all the way up to Z and minus one, or vice versa.

409
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:08,549
It's up to you. But one way is always easier.

410
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:14,540
Is that another way? Especially in this case, we know the support has this particular form.

411
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:25,310
Okay. If we want to know, the position is typically easier if you go from Z one to ZM minus one because our Z one.

412
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:33,590
You know, the red is the integration range, but this one is from zero to Z two.

413
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:43,700
That's the support for Z one. And once you solve this first integration, you've got a function,

414
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:55,280
and that is the function of Z two and then integrated from Z to from zero to Z three and in doing iteratively until you reach the last integration.

415
01:05:55,700 --> 01:06:01,759
Okay. So I'll give you a couple of minutes trying to write down what this multiple

416
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:07,810
integration is and see whether you can got the marginal or the last random arrivals.

417
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:13,910
In other words, this some of us want to accept.

418
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:48,930
All right, I've got it. So here is a solution.

419
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:53,979
So you do it iteratively. This time you say not the turn.

420
01:08:53,980 --> 01:09:05,200
This number to the E, to the nominal. The N is basically constant and it's a constant with respect to a, z, z, one, z, to all the way to z one.

421
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:07,990
So we can take it out of this multiple integration.

422
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:16,720
Now what's left is essentially a first a first order term, then a reintegrate to the second order term and so on and so forth.

423
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:24,759
Eventually we solve it. This is what you got. The end to the power of minus one to over and minus one category.

424
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:28,480
All times. The London people, not to London.

425
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:34,899
So that's the marginal distribution or the you can reorganize the term and you will say

426
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:40,540
these first are going to be on a constant London to the end over and minus one factorial.

427
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:53,520
And the really the kernel of this idea is a power term zero to power of a minus one, an exponential term E to an active lambda of the year.

428
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:58,840
And the support for the N is now from zero three infinity.

429
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:08,260
And we do not have this kind of Z1 Z to in the support because those has already been integrated out.

430
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:13,270
All that's left for Z and Mars is from zero to infinity.

431
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:23,710
And from this kernel it should remind us of the common distribution because the common distribution family of this particular form,

432
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:31,060
if our term times exponential, if you refer to the common distribution, you will find.

433
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:35,050
In fact, this is a common distribution with two parameters.

434
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:45,490
That is and and these are the two parameters for the common distribution.

435
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:53,590
So that actually concretely to prove that the sum of individual independent

436
01:10:54,130 --> 01:11:00,160
exponential random variables is a common distribution with these parameters.

437
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:11,790
And then lambda or lambda is the same exponential lambda and n is a number of independent exponential random animals that if you add it up in fact,

438
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,100
and they are one comma, one lambda is just exponential.

439
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:18,330
That's what we have learned before. Right.

440
01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:27,550
So the solve of this individual, independent and identical in a distributed exponential manner, barbells will become a common distribution.

441
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:33,220
But previously we have introduced this result. Haven't really prove it.

442
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:43,360
Now we have the tool to actually approve. The way to do it is first began the joint distribution of this transformation onto our end.

443
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:47,170
And then we marginalized the new transform,

444
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:53,680
one of our most forgotten bars on the distribution part Z because the end is the one that we are interested in.

445
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:59,710
Some of it's the some of it is individual random animals.

446
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:06,760
From this marvelous distribution we got. It is actually a camera and a marvel.

447
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:13,460
So that company would approve of some of its potential is a common.

448
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:26,310
Any questions? Right.

449
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:33,000
Here is actually it also tells us a trade in this kind of proof.

450
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:38,370
Right. If the original question asked,

451
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:46,980
can you to prove that the sum of independent exponential run of animals follows a common distribution

452
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:53,490
is not going to be an easy question because it's not straightforward how to actually prove that,

453
01:12:53,880 --> 01:13:01,010
how to gain the drug distribution, how to grab that distribution of the sum of the independent exponential.

454
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:08,400
But here, this question, this great down actually gave you an idea of how to go there.

455
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,560
Essentially, you can take a detour.

456
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:20,190
You first generate a transformation of the original as one to accept this independent exponential distribution you run of variables.

457
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:27,360
Although most of this transformation Z one through the M and minus one, they are redundant.

458
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:36,630
They are useless in terms of proving the final result, but they are helpful tools that can help you to get there.

459
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:47,390
Right. Eventually all we care about is this is the end. But we need this Z1 to the minus one in order to get the joint distribution using the formula.

460
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:54,979
So then the second step, we can integrate out this readout into one of our houses they want to see.

461
01:13:54,980 --> 01:14:06,830
I'm on its way to get what do we really want? So that's another pretty neat trick and a commonly used trick in practice to prove the distribution

462
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:14,180
of some random variable that is constructed based on some function of another set of variables.

463
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:21,350
You can take this data by first constructing additional random variable transform random

464
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:27,350
variables to make this into RNA transformation and then integrate out to get the marginal.

465
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:42,760
All right. Example, suppose the joint distribution for X one and x two, he has this form 16 times x one to the third, x two to the third.

466
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:54,880
And the support for the original random variable by the right of our boys from 01201 is a squared area.

467
01:14:55,630 --> 01:15:02,620
Consider the transformation that y y equal to x one the square root of x to y to equal to x two square root of x one.

468
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:10,270
Find the joint distribution for y one or one two and answer the question of whether they are independent.

469
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:17,230
Take a couple of minutes to solve this question again.

470
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:24,600
Figure out the steps that you have to follow. She is the first step with the second step towards.

471
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:54,980
It's just.

472
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:19,080
All right. I hope you got it. The smell.

473
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:22,170
I just I mean, our eyes ourself with that calculation.

474
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:30,410
So, again, the first step, you can do the image transformation from these transformation.

475
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:34,620
We can get the humorous transformation by solving this equation systems.

476
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:38,549
And once you do that, you should get x, y in quanta y,

477
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:47,160
one square over y two to the power of two thirds and i two or two y to a square over y, one to the power of two thirds.

478
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:54,780
Okay. And then you can tell me that co in the partial derivative of y one over x one by one over two.

479
01:20:55,200 --> 01:21:03,360
So, so forth. And then calculated, determined by the way, to in order to show it's a 1 to 1 mapping,

480
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:13,470
you can either first guide the numerous transformation and progress 1 to 1, or you can first calculate the in and calculate the determinant.

481
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:19,740
If the determinant is zero, then it means it's not a 1 to 1 now zero, then it means it's a 1 to 1.

482
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:26,370
That's another way to show it's a 1 to 1 transformation. So either way, you have to show that it's 1 to 1.

483
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:32,280
And once that's confirmed, you can proceed to put everything together into the formula.

484
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:36,330
And with some calculation, here is the final result.

485
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:43,770
The joint distribution for Y one and Y two should be 64 over three times y1y to both.

486
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:47,010
To the power of five over three.

487
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:52,950
Okay. And then the last step and the most important stuff.

488
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:56,910
One of the most important stuff is to decide the support.

489
01:21:57,820 --> 01:22:03,930
Okay. Again, the original one. Now we're going to run around most of this square support.

490
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:13,620
Ya'alon took out the joint support for this transfer around variables to now look at this transformation.

491
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:18,060
This doesn't help you, but this enormous transformation can help you.

492
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:26,010
You can plug in the seamless transformation into the original support and solve these inequalities.

493
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:36,750
More specifically, if they plug in y, one square over y, 2 to 2 thirds to be greater than zero, not to one.

494
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:45,600
And why two square over y one two thirds to be the same range.

495
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:51,990
If we solve this right, we can gather support for yyy2.

496
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:58,890
That way you won't miss anything and you won't get any redundant conditions either.

497
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:06,870
So you this humorous transformation, apply it to the original support to gather new support for Y.

498
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:10,080
That's the common way of doing it. Okay.

499
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:23,580
So now if you look at the first one, if it's between zero and one, that just means this y one has to be between zero and square root of y two.

500
01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:33,570
And on the second one, y two has to be between zero and square without y one.

501
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:43,380
All right. Yes, they can further simplify it.

502
01:23:43,710 --> 01:24:01,800
So we want to solve our bounded by squaring our Y to a lower bounded by widening square y one to x and y two is greater than one,

503
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:08,280
less than zero or a conflict. The role of this two both will give you the same region.

504
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:16,170
Right. That is how the support is derived.

505
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:25,990
See also droid. I won want someone to this?

506
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:36,080
Why one equal to why two square is one what's.

507
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:45,580
So why do you call the one square this parabola?

508
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:50,890
All right. Why? One equals wise to square this parabola.

509
01:24:52,210 --> 01:25:04,810
So what this tells us is y one has to be between species inside this shaded area.

510
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:11,380
That's what the support is for this transformer unavailable.

511
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:24,130
It's basically this two symmetric parabola now between this two parabolas on this 0 to 1 interval that gave you this support of this transformer,

512
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:33,600
of that with this support and this joint PDA that finally defined the distribution of all we want to say.

513
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:45,820
Yes. So in the the transformation x, y equal to Y, one square over Y to Y to ten, not equal to zero.

514
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:53,990
Yes. And in this case, zero and on does not really matter because it's a continuous run variable.

515
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:57,970
So we do not necessarily care about those individual data points.

516
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:02,500
So they all have probability zero. So that I can just ignore.

517
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:13,060
In other words, this is actually a speaker and this is equivalent to another distribution with strict greater likelihood,

518
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:19,389
greater than or less than two forgot about this and that.

519
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:28,600
And on the basic basis, you're probably going have to worry about the question and now the question.

520
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:38,240
All right. So the next step is to derive says we want to show that whether and why one and one or two are independent or not.

521
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:42,470
We need to kind of marginals. Now we have the we have the joint distribution.

522
01:26:43,610 --> 01:26:48,470
If the margin if it's equal to the product of the marginals, then we know they are independent.

523
01:26:48,740 --> 01:27:01,310
Otherwise it's not okay. So now China and the marginals are why one on one to, you know, the joint?

524
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:25,790
Now this. This is a support, right?

525
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:32,720
So we can get the marginals by to first by doing the integration.

526
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:52,750
So if they integrated this joint pdf with respect to y one from the lower bound to the upper about Y to a square the square root of y two.

527
01:27:53,380 --> 01:28:06,600
Then we can find the marginal 0y2 and in particular to the integration that will give you eight times y to to the third one to the seventh.

528
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:12,490
And Y to is. From 0 to 1.

529
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,610
So that is a marginal distribution for one or two.

530
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:25,390
Similarly, if I've got the marginal one and clearly the drawing is not equal to the product of individual of the marginal.

531
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:30,910
So why one is not independent of why two.

532
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:45,140
Any questions? Okay.

533
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:50,080
Great. So that's that.

534
01:28:50,320 --> 01:29:00,520
Examples of nuts, not to example, I say, is a very famous and useful conclusion for this.

535
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:07,300
Joint transformation is called the convolution formula. Common also means the summation.

536
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:14,800
And so if you have to run a measure of those that are independent and both are continuous with.

537
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:22,090
Idea of X one or perhaps two respectively. Then we can directly ride out the drug distribution.

538
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:28,210
We can directly ride out the distribution of some of this to around available in the following form.

539
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:43,470
Okay. So the sum of x one at x to have the following pdf that is integration from that same infinitive entity.

540
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:53,850
Have x one evaluate this y y minus y two and that's to evaluate that y to an integration is always right with respect to y two.

541
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:59,129
All right. So because you want to use this formula together,

542
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:09,870
the sum of this two random roles and the reason why that's the case can be proved using this joint transformation.

543
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:18,420
If we know that joint distribution points one and two and they are independent,

544
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:23,160
if we know the marginal and they are independent, we know the joint of x one on x two.

545
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:31,020
Right. If the question is to get that distribution of the sum of this two around variables, one will be the three.

546
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:41,760
What would be the way to get this joint distribution? What would be the way to find this distribution of the sum recall in the previous example?

547
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:47,580
How do we do it? We need to introduce some redundant amount of marbles.

548
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:54,300
We need to introduce some additional rhinovirus to construct are two to our to transformation first.

549
01:30:56,490 --> 01:31:05,430
Right? That should be our first step. Although we only care about this summation by the ordinary use of what we have learned,

550
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:12,210
we have to create one additional random variable so that when we have our true to our true transformation

551
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:18,480
and from there we can get to the drawing of the transport random arrivals and then marginalize it.

552
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:25,710
So that's how we can got this formula. More specifically, we can do this.

553
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:32,670
We denote why one to be a random out of all of the interest to be this x one plus x two

554
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:40,230
and we introduce additional random variable y to just to be equal to our two properties.

555
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:48,270
For example, it doesn't have to be x two, it can also be x one or it can even be x one minus x two.

556
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:54,660
It doesn't matter. And whichever is easier to you, you can use it for.

557
01:31:55,320 --> 01:32:01,200
The sole purpose of introducing y two is to construct our to a to our to a transformation.

558
01:32:02,430 --> 01:32:09,630
And once we introduce this y two, we do have a 1 to 1 mapping from R2 to R2.

559
01:32:11,310 --> 01:32:20,250
All right. And then we can also calculate the command to be 1101.

560
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,930
So a determinant of the recall VM is one.

561
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:35,550
Then we can write out the inverse transformation x one is equal to one minus y to an x two is equal to y to right.

562
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:41,550
And finally we can put them together. Together. Drawing distribution of y1y to.

563
01:32:43,810 --> 01:32:53,710
To be drawn distribution of x1x2 evaluated at y y -1 to 2 times.

564
01:32:54,190 --> 01:33:05,890
This one inverse arc which essentially gave us x 1.1 minus one 2x2 by two.

565
01:33:08,370 --> 01:33:15,180
Because one acts to their independence. Now, the final step is to marginalize my too.

566
01:33:15,810 --> 01:33:33,030
So now that we've got the marginal distribution for 11231111, which is the pdf of the interest is just marginalize Y to become the only entity.

567
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:41,900
One one -1 to 2 y to the y two.

568
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:53,700
That gave us the formula for that joint for the pdf of the sum of two independent of one of our most.

569
01:33:55,180 --> 01:34:00,999
And then craft has to use this. We do not need to create additional random variable.

570
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:05,470
We can directly use this formula if we know x1x2 they are independent.

571
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:17,950
You can directly plug in this quantity into our x one, this quantity into our x two and integrate out this yy2 terms in this product function.

572
01:34:19,450 --> 01:34:25,430
And then you can directly get the PDA for x one plus x two and three.

573
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:36,460
If you look at this formula. Right, that also tells us this is in fact, equal to the expectation of what?

574
01:34:41,330 --> 01:34:47,990
This integration can also be viewed as an expectation because this affects too.

575
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:52,490
Y tu is a PDA or ex two.

576
01:34:53,330 --> 01:35:03,560
So you see activation of x one by one minus y to.

577
01:35:06,730 --> 01:35:12,160
But it. So the random variable is why two here?

578
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:22,930
Why one is just the same arbitrary constant. Now they want to evaluate the original idea had the weigh because then one two is a random variable.

579
01:35:23,290 --> 01:35:33,220
This expectation is taken with respect to why to have x one is just some function of why two.

580
01:35:34,210 --> 01:35:45,010
All right. So from this original form, you can also say that is essentially the expectation of this function on the way to maturity.

581
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:54,610
You can also prove it is also the expectation of x two, y two minus one.

582
01:35:56,640 --> 01:36:22,560
Symmetric. Any question.

583
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:28,330
So this is called the convolution function, but this is a shortcut.

584
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:34,560
If you want to get the distribution for the sum of independent random barrels directly applied is.

585
01:36:36,810 --> 01:36:40,590
Any facts are described as 1 to 2 hour described.

586
01:36:41,050 --> 01:36:48,480
Then we have a discrete version. So essentially, instead of doing this integration, you're doing this summation,

587
01:36:48,900 --> 01:37:01,020
this infinite summation of the protocol to PMR officers F, X, one, G and O, z minus G for each z value.

588
01:37:01,770 --> 01:37:06,990
You want to evaluate it, but it's the sum of the two independent discriminant power.

589
01:37:09,690 --> 01:37:18,270
Alternatively, you can also think about base function as law of probability.

590
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:26,040
Because think about what we have on the left hand side.

591
01:37:26,550 --> 01:37:38,730
That is essentially the probability of this x one plus x two equal to this constant Z right on the left hand side of what do we want to evaluate?

592
01:37:38,730 --> 01:37:47,520
The PMT is the probability of the thumb of this to render variables to this for event variables equal to this value of Z.

593
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:59,400
If you use the law of total probability, you can have a potential of your sample space by evaluating x one out of each possible value.

594
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:08,510
And it served about value to be G because J then that gave us this quotation

595
01:38:09,330 --> 01:38:15,370
If I'm not claiming ability to infinity probability of x one equal through j.

596
01:38:16,570 --> 01:38:16,870
Right.

597
01:38:17,050 --> 01:38:30,370
That's your presentation at one point to change the attention of a sample space times the conditional probability of x to given x one equal to James.

598
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:43,440
X two satellite x one plus x two equal to the original event is x1x to z.

599
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:53,330
Now you have deportation of x, y or z chain and I mean right in rigorously.

600
01:38:55,590 --> 01:39:01,960
So one plus x two equals z gave it x one equality.

601
01:39:02,910 --> 01:39:14,010
That's the total law of total probability. This at one point a j if you sum up all possibilities that create a partition of the sample space.

602
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:18,990
Now you can read express on the left hand side by this law of total probability.

603
01:39:19,980 --> 01:39:31,680
And if you look at the second term, given x y in total j the event x one plus x 24 z is equivalent to adds to the point of z minus two.

604
01:39:33,650 --> 01:39:44,760
Right? That's the same event because condition of all x, y equals j and that's the same event that is said, you are summing up.

605
01:39:46,210 --> 01:39:57,280
She called an active infinity to infinity p of x and y for a j p x to a quarter z minus j even x one.

606
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:06,450
And the first time we know that's in a PM up 4x1.

607
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:15,970
AJ What about the second term? Why is it equal to this?

608
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:20,320
This guy, this piano bar, backs to the monastery.

609
01:40:20,650 --> 01:40:33,520
What about the condition? What?

610
01:40:40,890 --> 01:40:46,930
They're independent and are good because they're independent, right?

611
01:40:47,490 --> 01:40:51,570
Because they're independent. So we can actually draw this connection.

612
01:40:53,070 --> 01:41:04,050
So that's 1 to 2. They are independent. Conditional Z you want in their j or not, the probability of x to z mindset is always the same.

613
01:41:05,430 --> 01:41:15,360
That's what it's called independents. So this guy is essentially equivalent to the marginal amounts to a Z minus two.

614
01:41:16,650 --> 01:41:22,710
So that gave you the same formula. And so you can derive it in two ways.

615
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:26,520
One is using this strong distribution and then marginalizing.

616
01:41:27,330 --> 01:41:37,380
Alternatively, you can use the law of total probability by properly presentation your sample space and use this property.

617
01:41:38,410 --> 01:41:41,710
To derive this convolution formula of the descriptions.

618
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:47,160
Essentially, it's the same kind of continuous case.

619
01:41:48,990 --> 01:41:56,910
You can also use the law to the probability instead of using it instead of during the summation to do with integration.

620
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:05,400
But the idea is the same. Okay, that's just two ways to move this convolution formula.

621
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:13,660
Any questions? All right.

622
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:20,170
So now let's say, how do we use it? Help us simplify our calculation.

623
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:26,530
Here is the example with the power distribution, assume x1x2.

624
01:42:26,530 --> 01:42:33,310
There are independent comma run Americans with parameter alpha and beta respectively.

625
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:40,870
That is to say x one has this bar two has this one and the drawn distribution.

626
01:42:41,410 --> 01:42:46,180
Just have the pdf of the product of this two functions because they are independent.

627
01:42:47,350 --> 01:43:01,360
All right. Now, let's have let's define a transformation by one to be the sum of this to y two to be the x one over xx1 plus x two.

628
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:13,340
And we can prove the following three properties, which actually connects a common distribution with a better distribution at first.

629
01:43:13,700 --> 01:43:17,420
Is that why one is in fact independent of wine two.

630
01:43:18,170 --> 01:43:24,980
Second, why one also has a common distribution with parameter alpha plus beta and lambda,

631
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:32,600
and the third wine two indeed has a beta distribution with the parameter alpha beta.

632
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:42,470
In the interest of time. Let me show the proof directly here.

633
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:49,910
And you got the idea, right? We have this two independent common distribution with the same second parameter lambda,

634
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:54,589
but different first parameter when it's alpha, when it's than in very constructive.

635
01:43:54,590 --> 01:43:58,310
It's true. And you are right about our values. We have the following three properties.

636
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:05,640
So first, to show that the idea is relatively straightforward,

637
01:44:06,030 --> 01:44:12,030
we just need to guard the drug distribution for a while one, two, and then show each of the following properties.

638
01:44:13,110 --> 01:44:20,340
We know the drawing distribution for x 1 to 2. We know that complete transformation from x y is two to the y one, y two.

639
01:44:20,910 --> 01:44:24,479
So we can use what do we learn together? Drawing distribution for y one.

640
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:32,550
Y two. Once we have the joint become marginalize it to get a y want marginalize it to go to y to show the independent.

641
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:42,570
And as a byproduct, we also get the marginal distribution, ay1, and we can show that Scala and the margin distribution provide you with that greater.

642
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:51,900
So that's the idea. All right. So in terms of an actual calculation, first, let's go to the inverse transformation.

643
01:44:53,790 --> 01:45:00,690
This one is equal to why one times Y to two because x y is here.

644
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:10,410
So we can multiply the 2x1x2 is essentially y y minus x one.

645
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:14,510
So that's why one times one minus y two.

646
01:45:15,390 --> 01:45:26,310
That gave us the inverse transformation. And from this enormous transformation, you can say it's one, two, one, happy and a Jacobean completed.

647
01:45:29,010 --> 01:45:32,850
112 over.

648
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:37,560
One, two square and.

649
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:43,420
One one close, that's two square.

650
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:52,940
So the determinant of in absolute value, just the tip.

651
01:45:53,170 --> 01:46:09,440
That's one. That's two. And.

652
01:46:22,370 --> 01:46:27,990
Also from here, we know no one is greater than zero to greater than zero.

653
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:32,390
So why one is greater than zero?

654
01:46:32,790 --> 01:46:35,970
Why two is from 0 to 1.

655
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:42,390
So that's the support for the transport roundabout.

656
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:47,910
With that, we can put everything together to write down the joint density.

657
01:46:48,030 --> 01:47:33,290
Why wouldn't I want to? Okay.

658
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:42,680
With some derivations are the derivation them to write they write out the result is going to be.

659
01:48:13,110 --> 01:48:20,610
And so that drawing distribution, I'm going to be like this. And now we can integrate out one to the margin off the other one.

660
01:48:21,090 --> 01:48:26,459
In fact, you can take a look at that, the joint distribution, all the terms that are involved.

661
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:32,400
We want this to interact and all the terms that involved y two and these two terms.

662
01:48:33,230 --> 01:48:37,170
All right. So it's pretty neat that they are perfectly separable.

663
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:41,220
You do an integration three, integrate our yy2.

664
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:55,440
For example, you got a fader function. Innovative function is going to be combined with your consent to create a constant or a pdf of y one.

665
01:48:56,100 --> 01:49:09,200
And they kind of show that at y one by one is in fact a common distribution, this parameter one over a data.

666
01:49:12,310 --> 01:49:15,870
You know what, Peter?

667
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:30,700
I just want you to know that I wonder why, what and or why to once you intimate out why one not give you a better distribution which have been.

668
01:49:41,890 --> 01:49:48,970
And the ranch is 1102021.

669
01:49:51,130 --> 01:49:54,610
And with that, basically, we got all three conclusions.

670
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:58,720
First of all, the joint is equal to the product of the margins.

671
01:49:59,080 --> 01:49:59,380
So they.
