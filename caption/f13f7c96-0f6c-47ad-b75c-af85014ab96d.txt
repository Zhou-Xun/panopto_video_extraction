1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,120
The recording now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,059
Anybody here other than classroom last semester? Any accounting at all?

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,210
Any time, any place, anywhere. What'd you do?

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:23,010
Uh, finance degree. Do you have accounting for Minnesota U of M medicine, the other beautiful campus?

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,440
I've been there several times. Beautiful campus. Anybody else? I think you got some of that.

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,589
So you have to. You guys might find this easier than the others, but I will say.

7
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,850
Go ahead. Yeah, I have a degree in finance as well. You have a degree in finance from.

8
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,810
From Wisconsin. Madison? Yeah. My son went to Madison.

9
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,170
Oh, that's okay.

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:58,049
A little bit else. So we're going to have nine quizzes throughout the semester ranging from 5 to 10 questions.

11
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,200
I think somewhere in there, I think we count eight of them.

12
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:12,030
You get to drop one week if you come to the class and or look at the recording,

13
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:19,660
however you pronounce it in the recording and you kind of read the book, you should do very well in acquaintance.

14
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:29,970
Okay. I what I try to do is when I give my lectures, I read all the quiz questions before I lecture on it and then I try to cover it in class.

15
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:38,010
Okay. So like, is it nine quizzes count eight of them, they account for 20% of your grade.

16
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,180
Then we have six exercises. They all count.

17
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,880
He also counts. I think 60% of your grade are the six quizzes.

18
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:54,180
Again, I try to cover up in class.

19
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:02,640
I will try to do an extra size on the board around in here.

20
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,490
That is going to be at least similar to the type of exercise that you will do.

21
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,250
I don't expect you guys to do an exercise that you have no idea what it's about.

22
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:24,480
You have no visibility. Okay, so you come to class and or if you can't make the class, which is fine, I understand everything.

23
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,399
Everybody's got different schedules. You can't make it every week. That's perfectly fine.

24
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,950
But if you can't make it to class, make sure you look at the recording.

25
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:39,840
Because like I said, for the exercises, I made sure that when you guys get to do the exercises that count,

26
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,650
you've had some, you know, visibility to that exercise.

27
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,080
And then as a final case. Okay.

28
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,520
And in that case counts for 20% of your grade. And I will.

29
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,009
And as we go through the exercises, I will explain to you my expectations.

30
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,910
I know this as well. This is a master's level class.

31
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:13,680
If they ask you to do one of the questions is been explaining something and not looking for a two word answer.

32
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,540
Okay, I'm looking for a master level answer. Okay.

33
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,030
If they're saying, you know, I'm just going to throw something, I don't even know what it's going to be out there.

34
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,090
They need to increase their bottom line.

35
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,629
If you put, you know, give us you know, give us do analysis of their income statement, blah,

36
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:40,980
blah, blah, and give me four or five different ways that they can improve their bottom line.

37
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,750
Increasing your revenue isn't one of them either is decreasing expenses.

38
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,999
Okay. Yeah, I get that. It's going to be how can they increase revenues?

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,300
How can they reduce expenses? Which expenses you think are too high?

40
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:00,240
Revenues are too low, that kind of stuff. Okay. So a little bit more effort into the answers.

41
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:08,070
Okay. I am a pretty lenient grader, so if I see effort, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt.

42
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:19,320
Okay. Also, if answers build on each other, let's just say question one should be 45.

43
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,670
Again, I've just run something off the question two builds time 45 and 45 plus 23.

44
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,999
And this is 68.

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,500
If I'm doing the math right, if you come up with 42, you will not get credit for that.

46
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:45,030
If you come up with 65, you will get credit for that.

47
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,970
So if you can't do something wrong in a carry through, I don't punish you all the way down the way.

48
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:59,030
Yeah, I think that's a little bit unfair. Well, then again, if I truly.

49
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,860
Okay. So then so that should 20, 60, 20 200%.

50
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:11,320
One other thing as we move into I don't know if we'll take a break to take the mic and keep it here,

51
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,690
but as we move along in the semester, I'm really bad with keeping track of time.

52
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,480
Okay. So I try to give you a couple of breaks, you know, and I but if you don't raise your hand,

53
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,690
if you don't stop, then I keep you up and I'll just forget about it.

54
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,850
So feel free to raise your hand to. Hey, do you need a break?

55
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,940
So February six, I will be in Florida.

56
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:45,370
Do you think it's a lot? Sure. So we get I guess we're going to do a zoom.

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,350
Okay. So I think I've already set it up. Somebody check to see if everybody should have it on the note.

58
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:58,390
And I got to get with Major Guy in four, six, five, and you have it.

59
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,460
But okay. And February six will be. All right.

60
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:08,890
And I think I have it on the 245. That's just so people can get in early.

61
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:15,910
Yeah. So you can get it to 45 and I think I have it till 650 or six or whatever.

62
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:27,280
Yeah. That was just to let people in early. Okay, let's see the overview here.

63
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:33,760
Here we go. So finance is the top dog here.

64
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,000
So you guys get this next semester with me? Yep.

65
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,470
Okay. And then you got the accounting. 606 and then we got the manager and a financial.

66
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,549
We're going to get actually kind of both of those in this classroom.

67
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:56,650
You're going to get a little bit of finance and a lot more managerial, but you are going to touch on finance again starting next week.

68
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,820
And I think for two weeks you're going to put together we're going to talk about the balance sheet of statements,

69
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,229
taking the cash flows, one of the directing to the quizzes.

70
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,780
How are you going to do you're going to put together a balance sheet and an income statement.

71
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,850
Not sure what the cash flow statement. I think it's just a changing of statements.

72
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:21,290
And then you're going to do the next quiz or next exercise is going to be on ratio analysis based on the balance sheets and income statements,

73
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:31,000
and then answer a couple questions with ratio analysis. And then after that, it's going to be all managerial type in terms of budgets.

74
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:41,050
We're going to talk about cost allocations, different types of variance analysis based on actual person budgets and that type of stuff.

75
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:49,090
So also during the class, you don't have to raise your hand, just shout out if you got a question.

76
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:55,180
I don't care if you raise your hand. If you have any questions, please stop me and feel free to shout out.

77
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,919
If you don't agree with anything I say shout it out. We can have a really nice discussion.

78
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:08,800
I like discussion. So in your experience, you find something that we talk about to be different than what you've experienced.

79
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,670
Please feel free to bring that up so we can talk about it.

80
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:19,330
My phone number might have been anywhere. Anywhere anyway.

81
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:32,110
73473466487350.

82
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:42,580
It's on, Your Honor. Select. Okay, good. So feel free if you have any questions at any time.

83
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,770
Shoot me a text. Call me.

84
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:53,020
It's better to text me than it is to send me an email on my.

85
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:59,020
You missed an edu account even though I checked my new Ms. account, combated checking it every day.

86
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:06,430
And I certainly don't check it every hour. You know, like everybody else, I'm attached to my phone.

87
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,880
Okay, so if you shoot me a text that says you need help on something, it's better to send me a text.

88
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,799
Okay, I'll get it faster. Now we can coordinate and we could do a zoom.

89
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,610
We can do it over the phone. We can do whatever you guys feel comfortable with.

90
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:31,420
Okay? If you shoot me a text or you shoot me, I guess if you go through, you study to you, I get your name.

91
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:38,739
But if you shoot me a text, I make phone number or you call me, please tell me who you are.

92
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,760
First, I want to idea.

93
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,989
I'm horrible with names. I'm sorry. I just I've always been horrible with.

94
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:58,220
And as I get older, we get worse. So of course top here, financial accounting which you guys have already had when I understand a little bit of.

95
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:07,209
So now that you think of statements analyzing, you know, ratio analysis, what's a good net margin,

96
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:11,590
what's a good operating margin, what's a good quick ratio, that kind of stuff.

97
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,950
You know, you compare yourself to yourself, you compare yourself to your peers, compare yourself to an industry.

98
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:26,630
We'll talk about it. Let me give a lot. Again, revenues next week are actually you know, we're off next week, right?

99
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:36,020
Yes. So two weeks from now, the first class, we're going to be talking about health care reimbursement, which is,

100
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:42,440
you know, an interesting topic on where we started to where we are today, where we might be in the future.

101
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:50,540
Okay. So that's next. In two weeks, we'll talk about that for a week and then we'll get into the financial accounting stuff for a couple of weeks.

102
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:57,500
And then the rest is cost accounting, budgeting and control cost accounting.

103
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:04,610
And again, what we want to do is if we want to take our fixed cost, we have very everybody understand what a variable cost.

104
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:13,130
And anybody who don't know, doesn't know, don't know very, very.

105
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,580
And I do walk around like I should see me during a football game.

106
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,979
I walk like eight miles. Yeah. Variable cost.

107
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:29,330
Those are the costs directly related with making something or providing a service.

108
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,840
So a variable cost goes up as you produce more.

109
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:43,520
Right. Because it's variable and producing something or providing a service, fixed costs remain the same or fixed.

110
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,920
Okay. So they remain the same no matter how much you produce.

111
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:58,130
If nobody walks through your door and our fixed costs are 100 grand, if nobody walks through the door, it costs you a hundred grand.

112
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:03,380
Okay. If 18 billion people walk through the door, it costs you 100 grand.

113
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:19,820
Okay. So cost a lot of cost. Accounting is taking these costs these these these fixed costs and allocating it to your revenue producing departments.

114
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,930
Okay. So you're going to have basically you're going to have two departments.

115
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:28,730
You're going to have those that produce revenue ontology, emergency room.

116
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:36,950
Okay. And then those are revenue producing departments, and then you're going to have cost departments.

117
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:44,630
All they do is suck up money. Okay. I have been in costs [INAUDIBLE] that person for my whole career.

118
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:56,420
Okay. But this is like H.R., H.R. maintenance, accounting, finance.

119
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:08,420
Okay. And all of these things have costs associated with salaries, you know, all kinds of different benefits and supply that are associated with it.

120
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:18,409
Okay. And then so cost accounting is about taking all of these costs and all that all these other these costs in your cost

121
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:28,570
departments and allocating them to your revenue department so you can get a total cost of of of your revenue proofing.

122
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:36,990
So if you try to price something, let's say that you want to achieve on a sporting goods store and the only thing you sell is basketball.

123
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,570
Okay. So you have a basketball court, right?

124
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,880
So you go out and you buy basketballs and you're going to you buy them for 5050.

125
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,760
Let's say you buy them for $15.

126
00:13:50,030 --> 00:14:00,070
You go out and buy these basketballs for $15 and you decide to say, hey, I want to make $5 worth of profit, so I'm going to sell it for $20.

127
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:08,450
Okay. What the what this doesn't take into account, though, is it cost you other money to run your store.

128
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:18,500
Okay. So if you want to make $5, you got to take this $15 plus everything else and then price it from there.

129
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:22,520
Okay. To make sure that you make what you want to make on your margin.

130
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:30,490
Because if you if you want to make $5 after all of your costs and you price it at 20, you've only accounted for a little bit of your cost.

131
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,770
And you can you're eating all this other stuff. Okay.

132
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:42,529
So we have to make sure that we take all of the costs in the organization allocated to those products,

133
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:47,870
that we're making money now and making money on it so that we can price it accordingly.

134
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:53,540
So we make a net margin that allows us to continue to do business.

135
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:59,430
Okay. And that's cost accomplished. And then budgeting, control, budgeting, have to do it.

136
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,399
Anybody here ever do a budget other than a even if it's a personal budget?

137
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,990
Yes. Do budgets ever work for somebody who's been responsible for a budget?

138
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,040
Anybody? Okay, we got a couple. Good. So you know what I'm talking about.

139
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:19,160
So you prepare your budget at the beginning of a year, right?

140
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,820
And then you. Measure your results as they come in throughout the year.

141
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:31,080
Okay. So you set up the budget. I think we're going to have revenues of $10 million this year.

142
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:35,610
Okay. That's what we think. And I have all my costs and I budgeted revenues, 10 million.

143
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,840
I budgeted all my expenses cost to be 8 million in my budget for net net income for the year is 2 million bucks.

144
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:51,750
And that's your budget. And then you got to measure that against your actual let's say you budgeted 2 million net income.

145
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,400
You only come in at 1.1 million. And now we have to explain why we missed the budget.

146
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,150
And we're going to be doing a lot of that down here, which is later on this semester.

147
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:07,530
So. So it's all good stuff. It's.

148
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,750
It's not like making movies or anything, but it's not too bad.

149
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:18,209
I try to keep it as is lively as I can, given the fact that it's accounting.

150
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:27,130
And so the course goals and I know what's everybody's number one goal in this course, I get it every semester.

151
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:32,780
What's your number one goal? Well, I get an A everybody want today.

152
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:42,689
Okay. All right. So how do we get in a 98 the grading scale of 98 to where?

153
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,680
I don't know. I want to win this for every class. 90 to 100 is an A-plus.

154
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,970
I've given out several A-plus, but I'm not opposed to it.

155
00:16:51,990 --> 00:17:01,050
93 to 97.9 is in. A 90 to 92.9 is a a minus and then so on down.

156
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,190
Okay. I try not to.

157
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:20,310
I do the best that I can in terms of if somebody got a so 97 or not, you have a 97.9 is in a right because 98 you have to be at 98.

158
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,470
So and it does it they do round up.

159
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,800
So if you get a 97.6, I think I think no, I don't think it's that it goes to one decimal point.

160
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:44,220
Okay. So if you get it 97.90 after I'm at all my average everything's and think you get it 97.9 or whatever that 45.1.

161
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,360
I don't think I've ever given anybody a 97 point ALEC.

162
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:55,229
A 0.1 again on that grade. Okay. So if you get close, I'll do everything I can to pump you up to the next.

163
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,950
Great. Okay. Because there's a lot of subjectivity in some of the answers.

164
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:04,320
And so certainly if one point cost you the difference between an A-plus and an A,

165
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:10,330
and then I will go back and see what I can do, I can't guarantee it, but I try not to.

166
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:20,339
And so when you come in with the 97.9 and you get an ink instead of an A-plus at 98, but again, I will go back and see what I can do.

167
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:31,770
If I can't, I can't, but I will try. So the goal of this course is for you to gain an understanding of accounting terminology, concepts and tools.

168
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:38,940
And we will certainly be hitting a whole bunch of stuff, become an informed user of accounting information.

169
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,870
And again, here, the goal of this class is not to become a CPA.

170
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:57,000
Certainly if you want to be a CPA. Yeah, but it's more about it's more about understanding as you guys move forward in your career choices.

171
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:08,850
I'm assuming you want to be running department, be the chief operating officer of a big, huge organization, or be the CEO of a department.

172
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,049
You guys want to be leader? What? I'm getting out wherever you go.

173
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,760
You want to be the leader. You want to be the guy or the gal. Okay.

174
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:25,199
But understanding, you know, accounting concepts is going to help you because you're going to get a whole bunch of people.

175
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,290
When you guys are running departments, you're going to get a whole bunch of finance.

176
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:34,230
I guarantee you, you're going to get a whole bunch of financial reports and you need to be able to understand what you're saying.

177
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,390
And that's what really this is. Classes to me is what it's about,

178
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,219
taking these volumes of financial report that you guys are going to give because you guys are

179
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,200
going to be the leaders in our universe a couple of years shorter time than you would think.

180
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,680
And so you want to be able to take these financial reports and make sure you understand what they're telling you.

181
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,410
So, A, if you have a problem, you fix it.

182
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,240
Okay. And B, if you don't have a problem, how do we get better?

183
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:16,020
Because if you you know, if you take a look back in history, you take a look at GM and you take a look at Kmart.

184
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:26,340
Okay. These guys thought they had a name and they said nobody's ever going to be bigger than GM and nobody's ever going to take,

185
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,580
you know, Kmart place back to me before your time.

186
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:34,450
In my time when I was growing up, nobody ever heard of Wal-Mart.

187
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:40,150
How about that? So it's not always about fixing problems.

188
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:48,420
It's about how do we stay number one and what what do we have to do to make sure we maintain our market share?

189
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:57,330
Okay. Any questions so far on any of those creating expectations of a good stuff at the company?

190
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,870
Sure. So links to the full syllabus doesn't work on campus.

191
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:08,310
When we get down I guess was what I.

192
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,980
I really don't I work. And so what we do I would prefer I like I'm pretty flexible.

193
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:21,390
So if you just shoot me a if you shoot me a text, I can certainly be here an hour before class.

194
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,110
I can stay an hour after class, if that's what you want me to do. And so all we just want to.

195
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:37,590
Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. Yeah. So usually it's just to adding that we don't have any more technology as a graduate student instructor.

196
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:43,110
I don't think so. Just you. Just to just be. Yeah, yeah. There's no no other person.

197
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:48,599
I mean, I agreed on the grade. Yeah, I don't have any. Oh, speaking of grading, I tried to get.

198
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,260
So if you guys turn it in, like, like we're going to have an exercise.

199
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:56,919
The quizzes are automatically graded. I don't think the quizzes there are multiple choice.

200
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,210
So what you get them done, they're automatically they're graded the exercises.

201
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:13,780
I try I do my myself and I would say over 90% of the time I will have all the exercises graded before the next class and you guys know how you do it.

202
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:22,890
But no Yama, it's a one man show here. So office hours just to be a text.

203
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:28,170
Call me hourly for hour after hour Wednesday.

204
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,900
I don't care. Whatever works for you guys, I will do my best.

205
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:38,729
I do coach youth basketball on Thursdays and so Thursdays are probably a great idea at 630,

206
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,690
but that's only until like halfway through February, then after that the season.

207
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:51,360
So. So Thursday is a bad day until like half way through February.

208
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:58,860
Right. Any any questions? So far, so good here with joysticks.

209
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,700
Okay, this is. There's my cell G. That's right in here. Okay, the textbook.

210
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:11,250
So it's a seventh edition. I don't teach out of the textbook.

211
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,260
I use these slides. But it's really a good source document.

212
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:25,419
If you have any questions on how to do net margin for, for instance, you know, they'll have that formula in there for you.

213
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:30,070
I will go over it, but it's not in training. It's time.

214
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:35,350
You know, this sixth edition, I think there's a seventh edition out there. So.

215
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:40,920
It's a good source document to have. I think you can access it through the library.

216
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:45,920
You don't have to buy it there, which is cool. I didn't have it when I was here.

217
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:55,090
Okay, so here's your reading quizzes. 20, 60, 20. I don't think I have any exercises in class this semester.

218
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:58,710
I've had them before. Maybe the first.

219
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,340
There might be one. There might be one. In class, exercise.

220
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:12,050
The exercise. It's okay. Everybody has to turn in their own exercise.

221
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,810
Okay. There's no group. You turn it in for these five people.

222
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:24,660
But if you want it to work in small groups on the exercises, I have no issue with that.

223
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:32,460
Okay. Well, I think small I mean, three or four I don't mean 20 people should or not so small groups or five.

224
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:45,060
And this is on the honor system. But if you work in groups like, you know, a group of three or four, let's make sure all three or four contributing.

225
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,380
Okay. I don't like it.

226
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,730
I would never know. I'm not going to ask.

227
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:59,220
But kind of on the honor system, I don't want to have one person or two people it just quiet through because they sat in groups the whole semester.

228
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,440
Okay. Of course, the final exercise you're going to have to do by yourself again,

229
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:12,120
it's going to be you're going to have a week to do it and and you're not going to be doing it in class.

230
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,830
So, again, it's on the honor system. So but hopefully.

231
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,130
Yes. Let's see. Okay.

232
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,370
Financial management. Okay. Here we're just a little bit into and again,

233
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:33,240
it's going to be a shortened life and then we'll really start heavy next semester or next two weeks from today.

234
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:41,379
But for initial management, it's. The concern with the development of inherent processes for planning, tracking,

235
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,070
reporting and analyzing the flows of money through an organization from when it comes in.

236
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,080
Money goes to how when it comes back in and how do we record all that stuff.

237
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:59,320
You know, that this is where you get into your your revenues, your expenses, your assets and your liabilities.

238
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,740
And so that here there's there's health care is huge.

239
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,500
There is just billions and billions and billions of dollars in health care.

240
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:20,110
And this is going back even to 2019. We could see hospital care is the biggest.

241
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,380
It's 31.4% if you think of this thing as a pie.

242
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:43,219
Prescription drugs. It's getting to be huge. Where I work, we have we spend about $4 billion a year on health care for these.

243
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,480
We have approximately 600,000 members in our trust.

244
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:52,760
And we spend about $4 billion a year on their health care.

245
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:00,980
About 3.8 billion or billion of that.

246
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,940
It's prescription drugs and it's going up.

247
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:12,140
We actually have we started back in 2000 and 2010.

248
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:21,460
We had 800,000 members. And through because we are the retirees through they get older.

249
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:27,860
Our population is older like our average our average person in our in our trust.

250
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:31,160
It may be like, you know, somewhere around 70 years old.

251
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,780
Okay. So what you find out throughout the years.

252
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:41,720
So we're in 2022 and we're we're down to 562,000 members.

253
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:49,400
Okay. So as these people get older, you know, they get sicker and then they pass away.

254
00:27:49,870 --> 00:28:02,520
So I think our actuaries say that by 2074, I think it's when the last member is going to be around at 2074, that's determined by our actuary.

255
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:07,489
So it's not our trust is not a Ferrari, you know, it's got an end life.

256
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:11,540
As soon as the last member passes away, the trust is gone. Okay.

257
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,870
But we're down to 562,000 members right now.

258
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:25,340
We started it, you know, a little bit more than 800,000 when we first started in 2010 with 800,000 members.

259
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:30,770
Our our prescription was about $1 billion a year.

260
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:36,080
We're up to 2.8 billion with.

261
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:46,070
Quite a few less people. So that's telling you, you know, the price of prescription drugs is just going through the roof.

262
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,120
And so that's our biggest concern is what do we do with prescription drugs?

263
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,380
And that's our biggest risk.

264
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:59,960
And one of the things coming up in our that we have to be aware of coming up with, like I said, this is where you have to understand,

265
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:05,210
you know, what your organization is today, but where your organization is going to be tomorrow.

266
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:12,140
And so our you know, one of the things that we're looking at is because we have an older population, like I said,

267
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:21,440
about an average age of about 70 right now coming to market the next few years are probably going to have drugs for Alzheimer's disease.

268
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:29,780
Right. And we certainly have people in our membership who have Alzheimer's, but it's going to cost a lot of money.

269
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:38,389
And so so we have to be one of our risks is, you know, be able to provide this drug certainly to our members.

270
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:44,210
But we have to be able to understand what the cost implications are on some of those new drugs as they come out.

271
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,290
I just approved one. Yeah, I know. So it's it's coming out shortly.

272
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,790
So it's going to be sooner rather than later.

273
00:29:52,950 --> 00:30:02,360
Issue for us, for sure. So, so unique aspects of the health care industry, which is interesting.

274
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:05,180
So usually you go into a store, right?

275
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:13,610
You go into Kroger, the owner, and you buy your stuff, you take it to the counter and you pay for it and it goes to Kroger.

276
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:19,160
Right. Okay. Health care industry, it's different.

277
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,310
You go see your doctor. I got a patient.

278
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:33,910
I got a doctor and then you get a bill, and the bill goes to this third party.

279
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,330
Blue Cross Blue Shield already.

280
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,050
And then they pay for it in most cases.

281
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:49,360
So this third party payer system is really unique to the health care industry.

282
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:55,569
And so you have your government now through the exchanges and you have your Blue Cross Blue Shield,

283
00:30:55,570 --> 00:31:00,550
your ONS, health partners, all of these different insurance companies.

284
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:06,070
And then within the health care industry, you have.

285
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:19,959
Hospital Systems. Trinity is a nonprofit hospital system which means they are like a fibro and see I think

286
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,440
that's what they under the tax code which means they don't have to pay taxes on most things.

287
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:31,840
They do pay taxes, but they don't pay taxes on doing stuff that they're supposed to be doing.

288
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,059
They have this thing called Dubin, which is unrelated business income tax.

289
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:41,620
So if they do, if they generate revenues, it's unrelated to running a hospital.

290
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:48,879
They have to pay taxes on that. But anything that's related to running a hospital, they do not pay taxes on, that's a non profit.

291
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,620
And then you have for profit hospitals who have to pay taxes.

292
00:31:53,890 --> 00:32:00,730
Okay. And then you get them yelling and screaming at each other because the for profits complain that the non-profits don't have to pay taxes.

293
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:08,410
And then a nonprofit say, well, we we do other things that you guys don't do like charity.

294
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:14,500
They get people who come into their hospital, they don't have insurance. They take care of them.

295
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:19,810
The non-profits or the profits don't. They can turn them away.

296
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,580
The nonprofits can't.

297
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:33,250
And so we'll talk about kind of what that looks like in the in the ever ongoing feud between nonprofits improving the government,

298
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:38,080
that they do enough charity care, that they don't have to pay taxes.

299
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:44,110
I'm concerned about like the not for profit organization.

300
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:50,860
What about the emergency situation if something happened and then come to the emergency department and,

301
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:55,710
you know, they don't have insurance, they can turn them away and that's the dollar.

302
00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:00,520
Well, they will send them to they will say, hey, go down the street to Trinity Health.

303
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:06,639
They'll take the out. They have to take you. And then what Trinity Health would do is they would take them through the emergency room.

304
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,460
They have to get them stable. They can't leave until they get them state.

305
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:16,900
You don't have to treat them for whatever disease they have, but they have to get them stable.

306
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:26,290
And then also on the health care industry, you know, you have your hospitals and then you have your doctor.

307
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:35,050
Okay. And so when you go to a hospital, you know, you have a surgery done.

308
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,090
A lot of times you'll get two bills.

309
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:42,760
You get a bill from a hospital because you stayed in the room and you use the operating room and you get a bill from your doctor,

310
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:48,820
which you will send to BlueCross BlueShield and hopefully they'll pay most or all of it for you.

311
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,420
But those are kind of unique aspects of the health care industry.

312
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:59,530
Again, third party payer systems, your profits and nonprofits are not in the health care industry.

313
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:02,020
It's kind of split between your hospitals and your doctors.

314
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:13,660
We are have been seen in the last several years if doctors or doctors are being employed by the hospital for buying a

315
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:23,260
lot of doctor practices so they can go because what comes along with purchasing a physician practice is a patient list.

316
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:27,700
So they bring along with them patients with them that walk through their doors.

317
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:38,170
And so there is quite a bit of purchasing of physician practices by hospitals in the last decade or so.

318
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:46,760
The rate. And again, we're going to be going over this in more detail as we go along through the course.

319
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:55,700
And then this is kind of like a diagram of the third party party payer system with the health provider up top.

320
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,840
You got your patient pretty similar to true up here.

321
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:03,950
Patient third party. Payer reimbursements. Cost sharing.

322
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:14,720
Your services and insurance premiums. And so how many people are employed and have their employer pay for their insurance?

323
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:31,500
Okay. Yeah. And so so hopefully in the future, everybody lands a position where your employer will pay for most of your insurance premiums.

324
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,860
Insurance company usually don't pay for all of it.

325
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:44,810
You'll have a co-pay, you know, a couple hundred or 2 to 300 bucks a month that you would have to pay and then that your employer picks up the rest.

326
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:49,670
But those are the insurance premiums that get paid to the insurance companies.

327
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:54,590
And then the insurance companies pay the claims from the hospitals and the doctors for you.

328
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:58,430
Okay. And that's the reimbursement side with a third party payer,

329
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:10,640
your insurance companies reimburses your health care provider for the services they provide sharing in health care services.

330
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:14,930
But between the patient and the health care provider.

331
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:21,850
And again, we'll talk about that as we go through the semester.

332
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:26,600
But there's also cost sharing between health care providers and insurance companies.

333
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,370
Now to where we have that,

334
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:36,530
how if the health care providers do what they're supposed to be doing and they're in there keeping patients out of the hospital systems,

335
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,850
the insurance companies, who will give them bonuses for doing that?

336
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:47,950
And so they were incentivized for actually keeping people out of their hospital.

337
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,200
As opposed to in the old system. When it first started,

338
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:59,220
the incentive was to get people into the hospital and keep them there for as long as possible because that's how hospitals make money.

339
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:08,850
But we'll talk about that in two weeks. So here's your Blue Cross Blue Shield and Medicare and Medicaid.

340
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:22,440
Those are for your bigger ones. Also, what you see a lot is self-insurance with health.

341
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:31,380
So if you work for a if you actually work for somebody more often than not more often the case that not they they're actually self-insured.

342
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:37,080
You don't actually go to an insurance they can. And usually companies will offer both.

343
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:41,220
But most companies are self-insured.

344
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:51,540
And what that means is like where I work when we make a claim, Blue Cross Blue Shield for us,

345
00:37:51,540 --> 00:38:02,070
when you're a self-insured organization, often Blue Shield, that if they pay the claims for you, you do not pay.

346
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:07,560
Blue Cross Blue Shield a premium every month to insure your people.

347
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:14,810
You, the organization, actually insure through people all Blue Cross Blue Shield does is make the payment for you.

348
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,120
Then they charge a fee for processing those payments.

349
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:25,610
So you become self-insured and it would be like your car insurance.

350
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:32,820
Okay, right now you go to triple J, you send triple A $2,000 a year, right?

351
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,120
$2,000 a year. And you have car insurance.

352
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:41,170
But you write with a different color if you insist.

353
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:52,049
Okay. Let's say you go to triple and you pay them $2,000 a year in a premium you have for your car insurance.

354
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:58,380
So if you get in Iraq, you go to your garage, they fix it and it costs $10,000.

355
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:05,370
Okay. That bill goes to triple AA and they pay it for you and then they check your $0.08.

356
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:15,530
If you were self-insured, right? If you're self-insured, you don't pay triple anything.

357
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:19,010
When you get in an accident, you pay for it yourself.

358
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:27,770
And what you would do is. And that's what's happened that that's what happens in a for these organizations.

359
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:34,490
If it's just me, my organization does not pay a premium to Blue Cross Blue Shield.

360
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:39,649
If I get sick and I go to a break, I have a heart attack.

361
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:43,879
Let's just say that I have a heart attack and I have to go to the hospital and they have surgery,

362
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:50,990
put a stent in and I stay there for three days in the hospital, charges me $10,000.

363
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,890
Okay. The doctor charged me $5,000.

364
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,380
My organization that has to pay the $15,000.

365
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:03,260
Okay. And so in a hospital system,

366
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:13,970
what we would do is we would pay for Blue Cross Blue Shield $15,000 and Blue Cross Blue Shield would then pay the hospital and the doctor the $15,000.

367
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:25,960
Okay. As opposed to if I have insurance with it, I pay a premium to Blue Cross Blue Shield if I pay them $1,000 a month to insure me.

368
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:32,830
So my organization pays. Blue Cross Blue Shield $1,000 a month to insure me for every month.

369
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:36,459
I give them $1,000 when I go into the hospital.

370
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:43,030
And it costs me 15 Blue Cross cuts to check for the 15 grand and work and we don't have to pay anything.

371
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:50,560
So if I'm self-insured, I'm taking the risk.

372
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:58,420
Okay. So if you're if your organization of self-insured, you're taking all of the risk of your employees using the health care system.

373
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,920
Why we involving low cross blue shield? That's a darn good question.

374
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,690
It's a question of the agents that nobody seems to be able to answer.

375
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:18,730
Why? Why do we use a third party payment system? But but but again, what the big answer is theoretically,

376
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:32,110
what Blue Cross Blue Shield could do for you is that it's like any insurance company or any insurance company, you have a population that's this big.

377
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:39,940
Right. And and you have however many millions of people in here paid Blue Cross Blue Shield.

378
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:43,510
Right. And they take and they decide what to charge.

379
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:49,269
And so this guy, number one versus number 1 million down here.

380
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:54,610
Right. So you got a million people in this pool, better paying Blue Cross Blue Shield or a third party payer.

381
00:41:55,420 --> 00:42:00,040
And they all get sick and different, you know, in different rates.

382
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:05,170
Right. So one may never get sick. That number 1 million may get sick all the time.

383
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,880
So in number one, health pays for America.

384
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:18,010
So you get this power of the numbers that health as opposed to number one, right.

385
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:23,770
He doesn't he never uses it. Right. So he's okay with number 1 million guy.

386
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:30,400
If we didn't have this insurance company and he was self-insured by himself and he gets it could ruin him financially.

387
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,320
And so you pool all of these people together in an insurance company and help and you

388
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,580
offset the costs of people who don't use the system versus people who do use the system.

389
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:43,989
So why do large employers who self-insured pay through Blue Cross?

390
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:48,549
Do they get like the discounts that are negotiated what it is so large self-insured.

391
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:55,870
Yeah, because all they do is Blue Cross. If you're self-insured when you use Blue Cross, Blue Cross Blue Shield for is to pay the claim.

392
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,260
So they have all of us here and so they pay the claim for you.

393
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:03,459
So you may have all these different hospitals and you don't want to have the administrative

394
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:10,420
task of figuring out I got a kind of checked of you pay like we pay BlueCross BlueShield.

395
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:18,340
Let's just say we pay them $3 every month to process claims.

396
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:19,180
Okay.

397
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:29,980
So if I have 20 people, I send them $60 a month and they take that $60 and they process our claims, but we take the risk of the of the insurance.

398
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:34,720
Okay. So yeah, take a Blue Cross is just a conduit for getting the payments done.

399
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:46,000
So but yeah, so insurance is again taking this big pool of people and kind of spreading the risk to a bigger pool of people.

400
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,309
Or is it versus an organization?

401
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:57,240
If I'm an organization and only have 50 people in it, you know, my risk is a lot bigger than an organization that has 100,000 people in it.

402
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:06,370
Because if I if I have 100,000 people and one person gets sick, I can easily absorb that better than if I had 50 people and three people get sick.

403
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:18,580
It's all. Public payors are much more generous to private payers, which means your private payers are going to be your government.

404
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:27,850
So Blue Cross pays better than Medicaid or Medicare pays better than Medicaid.

405
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:38,380
And these private payers all pay better than both. Okay, so Medicaid pays maybe.

406
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:45,130
I don't know. Half know what they pay half. They pay a lot less than what even Medicare would pay.

407
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:52,720
And so if your hospital has a overabundance of Medicaid patients,

408
00:44:54,100 --> 00:45:02,460
that just means you get reimbursed less for the same diagnosis than you would if it was a Blue Cross Blue Shield patient that come through.

409
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,790
Now, if you have it, we'll talk about this later on as well.

410
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:14,950
If if your patient base is made up of a lot of mad at Cade people,

411
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:21,400
you get you get additional funds that are available to you to make up for the fact that you're getting reimbursed a lot less than everybody else.

412
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:28,240
So so there is at least a little bit of an incentive to take in those Medicaid patients.

413
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:35,010
And then it's it's just a process of getting reimbursed. It's complex.

414
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:39,810
And we'll go over what that looks like as we go along as well.

415
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:48,630
The coding itself, the coding every everybody heard of drugs, diagnostic related groups.

416
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:54,210
And so, you know a little bit about the coding. And so it becomes very important, you know,

417
00:45:54,270 --> 00:46:04,440
after all that you code every event so you get the most money and so you want your coders to be very experienced and very well trained.

418
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:12,630
So they so they when you send in the cost reports to the government or even to the insurance companies, they're done, right?

419
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:21,210
So you get the most money out of every event that happens and every discharge, every outpatient person who walks through your doors.

420
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:27,330
And again, that's basically the revenue cycle management.

421
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:41,140
And so. You know, health care providers have to contract with every insurance company that they accept in your hospital and you don't just contract.

422
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,970
You know, if you do a contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield, it's more than just one contract.

423
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:50,139
It's just like the contract. You have family and family plus one.

424
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:59,950
You get your family and your wife and two kids. And there's just lots and lots and lots of stuff that goes into contracting with.

425
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:05,170
And you have to do that with every insurance company, with every doctor that walks through your doors as well.

426
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:10,500
So. You like here.

427
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:15,020
Big numbers on University of Michigan Health have had 2 million registrations per year,

428
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:19,830
so they get 2 million people up through their doors every year. And so that's a lot of people.

429
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:24,380
So you got to process all those people. All those people have cost reports.

430
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:32,490
Those cost reports have to be done correctly. So you can make, you know, the most revenue that they can get so they can provide services.

431
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:38,190
You know, when you think about you of them, it's really the go to hospital in Michigan.

432
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:43,290
And usually, I mean, if you talk to most people, if they have something wrong with them,

433
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:46,440
you know that that I'm not talking about a broken leg or something,

434
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:52,080
but if there's something wrong with them, that's a little bit more complex than the normal stuff.

435
00:47:52,230 --> 00:48:00,630
You know, more often than not, they want to give you a kind of give or take care because they have the reputation on nonprofit ownership.

436
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:09,180
You can see the nonprofits are in I'm really, really colorblind here is if the 53 of the 24.

437
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,280
Yeah so again Trinity Health Ascension for nonprofit.

438
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:26,399
If you guys heard of Ascension, Trinity Health dignity is all capital throughout the United States strong and then the

439
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,350
benefits of it I mean the benefit the big benefit of the nonprofit is you don't pay taxes.

440
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:35,700
I mean, that's that's the biggest benefit you have to people with charity care.

441
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:42,300
You have to do more charity care work, but you don't pay taxes, you know, for the most part.

442
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:49,350
And then again, what you find out is you get the for profits,

443
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:58,290
complain to the government that the not for profits don't do enough charity care work in the community to be given this, you know, nonprofit status.

444
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:06,450
And then then the nonprofits have to prove to the government that you do.

445
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:12,419
And one of the ways they do that, if you ever look at a nonprofit, if you ever look at maybe I'll bring in maternity out.

446
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,730
If you ever look at their audited statement,

447
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:20,910
they will have a footnote in their audited statement that details all of their charity care work that they do.

448
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:27,860
And so and that's become a requirement as well. And again here, why?

449
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:30,990
What do nonprofit do to justify their tax exemptions?

450
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:34,799
And so, you know, again, it's to charity.

451
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:44,220
They they they they care for the under the underserved in the in the community physician self-employment.

452
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:52,290
As you can see in 2012 it was only 26% were hospital employed physicians.

453
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:57,720
In 2018, it rose to 44% and it's gotten even higher since then.

454
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:05,970
So hospitals buying up these physician practices are still going on.

455
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,969
And again, physicians in a steady income, they make money.

456
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:18,240
When he sells up, they make a boatload of money when they sell their practice to a hospital and then they get their salary,

457
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,630
you know, on a guaranteed salary plus incentives going forward.

458
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:27,870
And then that and then the hospitals hopefully get a really good profitable.

459
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:40,150
You have an extreme walking through there, walking through their doors, especially these apps, that kind of stuff does orthopedics is huge.

460
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:46,239
I need to go see my and just go, okay.

461
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,790
That's all I had. Next classes, the 23rd.

462
00:50:50,080 --> 00:51:01,240
We will talk about the health care reimbursement in the provider payment system that we're going to talk about and of, you know,

463
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:11,530
from when it first started to where we are today, kind of going into the future, I'm not sure if there's a quiz associated around.
