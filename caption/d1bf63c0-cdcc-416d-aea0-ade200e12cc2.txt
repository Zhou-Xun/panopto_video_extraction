1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,930
Cities don't have the eye was the monitor here, so I would just speak with you.

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:13,840
Hopefully not to it. OK. And you have this life all the time and the undercover side.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,200
So when you think about water, all of us.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:30,450
What's your impression? Do we have a lot of one of us, or just maybe it's probably not like you just heard?

5
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:40,890
Oh yeah, didn't that? So I would say a lot of water that has a lot of it is very fresh water.

6
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:51,030
That's good quality like a lot of water and the ocean communities don't really have a lot of unqualified.

7
00:00:51,030 --> 00:01:01,870
Most of what I'm asking you, do you ever read any of the freshwater you've made and others?

8
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:10,810
So, yes, we do have if you think of our ocean life possible next to the ocean, we'll see what impression we have so much more.

9
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:16,630
OK. Yes, if you think about the total amount of the water, yes, no.

10
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:28,980
But when you think about that, because what really allowed and then most of the is wasn't already on board,

11
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:41,380
the ocean is probably going to fall off in Q4 and air with the freedom of every one of these fish.

12
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:55,440
And this one put be on the ground and on some water, a tiny amount of the fish while we can use.

13
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:09,100
The problem was that this wasn't a pen or something.

14
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:23,010
Yeah, right. I just think people think that we're going to get gold in the world for them.

15
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:31,500
We use water and then the problem we have here is, OK.

16
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:47,040
All right. I love you of your retirement. Agriculture Secretary General Envisager, how do you see the infrastructure?

17
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,670
Well, we just passed the infrastructure requirements on that infrastructure.

18
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,470
That's great news for the hopefully we'll do that for the infrastructure. OK.

19
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:05,320
Anything you think of water contaminated?

20
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:11,410
OK, so we have the domestic issues, we have an and AdDuplex user.

21
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:18,130
And also we've used every day on the most viewed the person you want me tomorrow.

22
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:25,450
Because one of the hardest is the clean for a number of people.

23
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,650
You're all set. Thank you. All looks good enough. Much better now.

24
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,550
I like the pretty colors. That was nice for the morning. Thank you.

25
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:48,990
Take care. So every time we use a water because we were told you could also use it to the Super Bowl or think

26
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:56,820
about this is always just let's review how we use the law because every time when we use the water.

27
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:03,880
We introduced contaminants in floor either for domestic use, while why pick up a shower, right?

28
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:14,580
It's often, but also also. For agriculture, for industrial use, we're the car washing, for example.

29
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:21,190
So that's reason every time you use the water, you would introduce contaminants into the bottom.

30
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:26,740
OK. That's a major. So that's an all avoidable.

31
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:41,350
Right is all more. And for them to worry about others and then face wash our hands right now, use the hand sanitizer.

32
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:48,840
But most of the time, just use them for what they use it in terms of what is.

33
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,280
So let's clean what can you soap? So what you can see here for four different types of use of water.

34
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:02,300
Domestic use. Agriculture use. Industrial use what you should use a variety of contaminants, including.

35
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:10,580
Right. So that's our word. So water contamination is unavoidable.

36
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,210
OK. But every use,

37
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:22,480
every different couple of use where you just a variety of different things to think about it for the domestic for use personal care products shampoo.

38
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:29,390
Some people put out shampoo off and this does give you a few people to getting the water for agriculture.

39
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:38,430
You see people a pretty sight. Put your mind as you use everyday and for industrial use, for example, heavy metal oils can often go for.

40
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:47,450
OK, so, so different couple of years introduce different parts of protein into the water, and then we have a really high demanding.

41
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,080
Hide your money.

42
00:05:48,080 --> 00:06:02,750
Use your CGI industrial use worldwide because you use 70 percent, one to two to three people and the industrial use probably like 20 percent.

43
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,810
And this is raised in the United States, for example.

44
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:12,380
We're probably 60 percent of all you have to use and then we use it to study agriculture.

45
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,480
So the problem is the issue we have right now is really with increased population.

46
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:23,940
We have increased demand. We are more than seven billion people.

47
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,560
We have children, right? Everything we do, we need the water.

48
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,930
OK, so that's the demand and availability.

49
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,830
So the problem we have now we have this water scarcity is not ready.

50
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,210
We are talking about in the water cold here. But yes, that's also the issue we have.

51
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:47,670
And then we have domestic use. Now how much water we use every day on a daily basis.

52
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:53,620
Four percent. So think about this in the United States.

53
00:06:53,620 --> 00:07:06,950
Average control, how much water we use everyday, how much water we ask you to drink, suggested to drink every bit of.

54
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:16,910
Sixty six, sixty four ounces, 64 ounces of white, five or six pills, five or six right now.

55
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:27,590
So what's the hunky about? Thirty two? The five probably hasn't been too much, but let's close of close to needed a.

56
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:34,920
OK, you read. So that's what happens when we use.

57
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:41,550
On average, 150 gallons of water we use on average per person, OK?

58
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:47,290
But surely with water conservation now in the United States, we probably use about.

59
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,050
90 gallons per per person per day.

60
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:56,500
With all this conservation movement, we have people now to try to reduce use of water by Stewart Creek among a drinking water.

61
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,550
This is just for duty is to truly.

62
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:07,000
OK, Tony, why would why we talk about this, because when you think about this in terms of water quality, it kind of house.

63
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,340
The drinking water is terrible rainfall, but all of them on a small amount between consumption and food.

64
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:21,310
What do you think our what? How about you kind of help us? It's more just drinking.

65
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:27,370
OK. Ali was taking a shower. I mean, how could you let me get in the kitchen?

66
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:35,430
Me out all this, all composed of you, explore the possibility that you me have in the give it the contaminating the water.

67
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:40,950
Right. So the drinking water is only like a small portion of the protocol,

68
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:49,180
if you think about the use of the war against what region is avoidable if you look at this.

69
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,830
Probably you're not really seeing we're often not in the United States. OK.

70
00:08:53,830 --> 00:09:04,460
I used to be like this since 1960, so if you work for the United States, looks like that's how many of you see even.

71
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:10,420
Five Great Lakes. What do you think the pressure of a release?

72
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:20,500
Super, super clean, right, Crystal. OK, especially if you go to London and I put you up, you'll see the what is super clean.

73
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:31,420
But that's the case. The secret? Incipient before, prior to the 1970s, presidents have to pay for them on the Hugo River.

74
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:37,220
But first they call the fire. Many times.

75
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:44,960
And then we have the political movement, as is Typekit EPA, then we enact the the Clean Water Act.

76
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:53,240
We'll talk about the Clean Water Act and all this. Does this work now as we seen before at this moment, but this time somehow was also my time.

77
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:59,600
And you sort of see some this the situation in the American war, in some other country, you can see some of these.

78
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,480
So what happened? ContaminÃ©s we have just mentioned every time we use introduced contaminated public, you would have our chemical,

79
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:16,070
biological and physical that, for example, he's seen about how it can be contaminant contaminants.

80
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,750
Right, increased to two percent, two degree Celsius.

81
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:30,800
What's the problem? Because we just hope. If you think about the warm water, hot water, right, the fish up organisms in the water,

82
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,780
if you include temperature for two degrees is detrimental to that.

83
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:42,070
One of the reasons because of course, you will be reduced to just reading from the water.

84
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:51,680
OK, when you to it's about this, of course, is going to rely on the dissolved oxygen, water and all surviving.

85
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:59,820
So that he could be I mean, we can't count five, he's contaminated water.

86
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,740
And we'll have an example of that, we can find the heat contaminated water.

87
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:15,300
Very likely, you can see. Climate change or climate change is one one could be right.

88
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:21,440
Postgraduate, we may not see that. I mean, maybe two degrees, but hope it.

89
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,180
OK. They use a huge amount of water to cool the system. OK.

90
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:36,140
And then the water they were discharged into rivers, into the lakes close by and they could raise that water temperature their put out.

91
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh, OK. So just different color effects out of health effects.

92
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,810
Health. We're really concerned about a robust health impacts, ecological effects cause and some economic costs.

93
00:11:50,810 --> 00:12:01,260
Now with this, what can we do? So, yes, we know that's the water, this is for claiming to introduce the parties.

94
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,600
OK. Every time we use it, we introduce content to the world.

95
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:15,640
So what can we do? Urban agriculture catching practices for fertilizer is more or less energy for grand final.

96
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:21,290
OK, so control versus control source of contamination.

97
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,460
So that's key to us also commemorated.

98
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:33,410
First job ever went to all this was doing, if you knew the water was doing interviews, it can come into the water.

99
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:39,440
Right. So in terms of intervention, how can we prevent?

100
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:48,790
The contamination, our stuff, the water from the rivers, lakes. And then we can also have this clean water, safe water to drink.

101
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:58,280
The U.S. So in the United States, we have a clue what it's all about, who on excessive drinking water.

102
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:04,030
So here is that this is the. Water cycle we have.

103
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:09,310
So what do you can see here? We have a crusher use. We have industrial use and do have residential use.

104
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:18,990
So whatever we use use of what we should use a contaminant and then we also use the same water source.

105
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:24,720
As a source of drinking water, I think about the water and therefore the consumption.

106
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:42,350
So what can we do? OK, intervention from a so before the water discharge into the rivers lakes, which help remove.

107
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:52,210
Because of oil, every time we use oil, introduced coupons and then we know that's in the river, the water is not safe to drink.

108
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:58,770
Evan, you go to the Great Lakes, the crystal clear water is not recommended by the river.

109
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:08,710
OK, get sick. All right. So basically what you need to do before that getting into the.

110
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,150
Surface to surface,

111
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:22,310
which is so the West watching process to remove contaminated water stuff and then if we're going to use them wasn't sure that you can watch them.

112
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:33,140
Rubin at Condemned for consumption. OK, that's great. That means we use less washing the process, prevent the contaminants decided to resume, work it.

113
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:39,940
And then when you Georgian, process to remove contaminants from the source of water.

114
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:50,360
Because simply because it. OK, so that's the practice we have, infrastructure we have since.

115
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,810
Essentially. OK.

116
00:14:53,810 --> 00:15:04,320
And especially if you're now in the United States, would help us carry on as if we can enforce the treatment, but also all the problem.

117
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:15,790
No words what you. Well, you know, we're all in France, but also we can only address the portals contamination.

118
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:21,130
What is porous, you can identify the source, for example, from the House, from the budget,

119
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:26,660
there's some difficulties and other parts of the agriculture somewhat erroneous.

120
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:34,270
You cannot really simple a source of contamination and come over the keyboard from that could.

121
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:43,880
So even we took most of the source protocols contamination, but still from the most precious objects.

122
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:52,670
So what can we do with that, OK, try to do the pollution prevention of pollution, prevent pollution prevention and use,

123
00:15:52,670 --> 00:16:00,780
this is different practice, try to minimize the interference to the environment.

124
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:10,670
OK, so that we can maintain the water quality. This is a yes, how we do this well is not everyone does.

125
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,850
We may say, Oh yeah, what is very important?

126
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:22,580
That's true. OK, that's good to know, that's not really the case, especially for somebody who doesn't believe it.

127
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,590
In fact, this, in my opinion, I will say to him. We'll talk about it often.

128
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:32,630
We talk about the water crisis. I want to say one.

129
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:45,270
OK. So how does Clean Water Act? Well, you want to do is to prevent the contamination of the surface of water to pick our ourselves of water for.

130
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:51,760
OK. Rivers, lakes, streams. Look what is not.

131
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:59,400
Unfortunately, with grandma is not really covered by the Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act.

132
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:04,950
It's to provide safe and clean water. The United Nations declared.

133
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:12,720
Let's go. Access to safe and clear what is best for human rights in 2010.

134
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:26,000
So what we need to provide a safe, clean water system to the public and it has also defined in the U.S. is stepping in all this to want to act.

135
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:35,060
Made it to war, and this and other policies of aggression also allows anyone this look upon the world for it are really the two

136
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:42,260
major wars statues to United States of governing the for companies to say How can we protect ourselves the water?

137
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:48,900
The other one is how can we provide a safe and clean water for the poor?

138
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:54,660
OK. When you use the surface, the water as the source for drinking water,

139
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:05,430
reportedly the use of water boarding that separated your ex government, one body and the pool was also coming that.

140
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:14,320
So, for example, in our. Do you know where where the source of even a lot of our.

141
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,350
Anyone who's sitting here in your underwear? Yes.

142
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:28,540
Where's that thing? So if you haven't been to the Algo Park and I will talk to you.

143
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:34,920
Yes, you do. Yeah, go upstream. A little bit doesn't bother, Tom.

144
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,630
Nothing on my list. Yeah, there's a there's a dam there and they just go, Oh, there's a pond.

145
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,520
There's a there's a there's a pond, record pond, bottom pond.

146
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,990
That's a source for drinking water. OK.

147
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:59,360
Thus, the water body is governed by the Safe Drinking Water Act and also the water.

148
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,090
Because the basic use of these special one money is.

149
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:13,930
So what do you want? OK. Now you want to ask basically what we do.

150
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,950
We do have the goal. What is it? One is what is going on.

151
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:29,650
How do we define the water clean? So how in the world so different type of pollutants with a level of forces allowed nutrients, fertilizers?

152
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:36,040
For example, some chemical contaminants, you know? And then like, what temperature is all this?

153
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:46,580
And then we need to contact the morning process where most of the water quantity does not reach the wall for me to work on a standard that's quick.

154
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:52,250
But now we need a apply entity for this. What does that mean?

155
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:58,300
That means every how very high quality better than your standard.

156
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:03,860
You cannot allow this war for to be thuggery.

157
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:10,430
Did you have out of work except for the special access?

158
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:19,730
So some people say, OK, we have we're going to vote, let's just dump stuff into the water, but you can't, you have to enter the gradation.

159
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,490
And then if does not meet the water quality standards,

160
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:29,300
they need to develop strategies to improve the water quality, for example, to the maximum daily load.

161
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,440
And then you implement strategies.

162
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:43,080
So reduce the discharge from industrial or from agriculture, from the overall, for example, and then you monitor the results again.

163
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:53,390
You've got a mix with your approach, what you've done now, numbers you need to revise, make the most pitches until you reach that point.

164
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,820
OK. That's the Clean Water Act.

165
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:07,000
How walking the Clean Water Act, but how we improve the water quality in the United States, I guess emissions in the 60s, 70s, the water quality.

166
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,900
How are you across the river, for example, the pull, the files. When people try to dump always,

167
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:22,960
it has always grease on this kind of stuff on the river and they can quantify how local it looks like in my messages, in the magazines.

168
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,700
But because of the Clean Water Act, now we have the water quality standards and how to improve that.

169
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:34,880
And then gradually, as we improve the one point, you take it into the current standard.

170
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:42,930
So to current situation, you can see. OK, so it's more like.

171
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:49,610
Don't take the awkwardness of endless.

172
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,820
To be improved like what we have not. That's reason sometimes people think.

173
00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:01,690
Some people think, Oh, can you regret? We don't really. All this regulation is in the water.

174
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:07,730
Yeah, terrible idea, because if you can kind of easy and then just improve the development,

175
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:20,300
you will still have the legacy of contamination in the Great Lakes because area of consoles Chicago, Detroit, we still haven't been able to result in.

176
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:27,650
Because of the historical contamination, I still, you know, sediments, some areas, you still have it all.

177
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:36,010
We were late. OK, so. So that's we don't we really need to work very hard to maintain this.

178
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:44,930
Well, clearly we have not. And then the stuff you don't want to act in the United States will use.

179
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:51,000
Support multiple barrier approach. To provide a safe and secure.

180
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,350
OK, might have a parallel approach with the money, but barrel. Talk about.

181
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:00,980
We have the war coldest ever.

182
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:06,350
First of all, do you think a soul, so for them all, we have the source of water, this bottom part is the source of water.

183
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:11,480
We need to protect ourselves water quality. You have a high quality to start with.

184
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,990
People says if you go to New York, people save you. Look what has really good.

185
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:24,910
OK. Big City, you may be worried you just think about a big city in New York who have pretty convincing water.

186
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:33,090
And then why that? OK. One of the reasons behind this perfect social work study.

187
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:37,630
In the office. They have a real voice.

188
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:43,910
They use a resource of the source of what you can do, so they have really, really well to start with.

189
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:54,880
And that's the what to do with it. OK. And then any you're stuck in the water for future purpose, for the public use, you have a trillion, OK?

190
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,720
Provide the troops sufficient. Human nuts also is very decent.

191
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:08,290
Is needed to provide treatment. And then we're going to do when we want to give the Western advance.

192
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:13,450
Perfect. Sure. Clean, safe. High water quality.

193
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:20,910
And then what happens? Think about how the want there to be sufficient.

194
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:35,160
What do we use and what pipes and how many how many miles of pipes in our doesn't and have some idea how many miles of his system,

195
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,640
the pipes in our five hundred mile underground?

196
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:52,010
OK, five hundred miles pipes underground to distribute water to the different color of our.

197
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:58,210
And then imagine now. When do we go this system?

198
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,540
Typekit, a long time ago, decades ago, 20 years ago.

199
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:12,040
OK. The start of nineteen thirty, something like that, almost two years old.

200
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:18,580
And with the security bill pumps, just interesting.

201
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:28,260
The deterioration of the pipes you have committed and, you know, historically we use lead pipes, service lines.

202
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,960
Right. So that's all the problem with this five hundred mile pipes.

203
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:40,470
Just to have a 500 mile pipe. You can imagine out in the Port of New York how many miles of the pipes there.

204
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:47,890
And then in this process, we have the pumps. We have the reservoirs. So you have to keep the pressure.

205
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:55,060
OK. You have to diffuse a war between a high demand and we just pull up to the faucet.

206
00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:01,620
We have the water grid, right? 724.

207
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:06,710
But if you think about how can you keep that system running all the time?

208
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:13,100
As much as you. And you have all these issues, OK?

209
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:27,700
In Mexico City, for example. Thirty five percent of the water that ships leave the western coast 50 out before they ever reach the consumer.

210
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,280
Because obviously, you can probably have.

211
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:38,970
Properties and we have and then we have to keep the pressure high prices so that you can avoid the contaminants come into the pipes.

212
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:44,400
OK, so all this come from these differences.

213
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,290
OK, that's a big issue we have now.

214
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:54,650
One of the big issue we have in the United States and the infrastructure is that for that, we are that can be part.

215
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:59,270
OK, we have to address all these very pipes and.

216
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:06,320
But how can we improve our infrastructure? The reason for that now, we don't think about it.

217
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,700
I don't disagree. Oh, our water use that very well.

218
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:15,710
So most of what the United States might still need the water for is still bush.

219
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:23,840
If you don't have confidence, you tore the faucet from the water and the problem?

220
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:31,740
But then ask me, there's no issue with this. There's an official in this parts who have to address.

221
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:41,340
We cannot just be here all alone is good. Now we have a lot of heavy water, so we can't really know how to invest I the ease of use.

222
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:52,480
It's timely and immediate. It's not sufficient. I was there one trillion dollars spread across the United States as well in just seven of.

223
00:27:52,480 --> 00:28:01,650
We have even a few normal effects. What he knows is easily can be.

224
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:09,710
OK, so think about this, you know about this. Yes, you want to see a rich country, no.

225
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:15,870
This country. But we spend the money on.

226
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:20,860
OK. We'll spend the money in the most graphics. OK.

227
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,900
We spent when you spend money to improve our infrastructure here for our people.

228
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:31,960
OK. Because that's the issue we have. We know that this particular one with the infrastructure really, you know,

229
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:39,600
pretty much even our vision really into our life, into our health if our life expectancy.

230
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:49,210
So it used to be false, the old. OK, now what's a major problem in our state?

231
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:54,510
Correlated with pandemic, not two years job.

232
00:28:54,510 --> 00:29:02,900
But still, right? But what does attribution? It's meant attribution is the widely of.

233
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:11,480
OK. Very quickly, I just have one. So how could it be otherwise you will see drop of our lives again?

234
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:17,690
So the water treatment again is how we through the water Mitchell process.

235
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:23,480
We have someone some in process here, and they also have a whistle coming to talk about what the Waterman process.

236
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,920
We can remove the we get the water from the source.

237
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:33,240
This is a weatherwatch were meant to be credible, although certainly we have produced.

238
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:43,980
Go to waste water treatment, plant some 17 primary treatments and then have this so-called occupation irrigation tank used by

239
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:50,070
the process of removal game after every time you need some of the the food you need to feed,

240
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:56,000
you don't think about it. Let's give someone a picture if we don't feed them.

241
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,180
Getting water and then promotes education.

242
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:10,690
So and then what do we do? We use the West, what process to remove this segment and then we do the disinfection.

243
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:16,080
The police presence would have to write all this. Think about all this.

244
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,810
Permanent housing. You can find. You may be able to find the whistleblower in the suit.

245
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:27,130
Think about the Flashpoint Kitchen first appointed.

246
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:35,120
Other cities, such as most, at least. And then, you know, what's what true get?

247
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,060
So. Captured. Mushroom.

248
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:49,030
So breast cancer finds almost like a variety type of presence in the west of London to get some of you may know

249
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:58,900
I'm working on the project on the monitoring of stuff over Kim in the future with all these other stories.

250
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:05,950
So we have the same both project from State Health Department to do this monitoring every day, every day.

251
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:15,680
My my students stuff crater walls, wastewater samples every day to monitor the COVID 19 virus.

252
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:24,050
And that give you a lot of information about what's going on on campus. So the presidents use our data to communicate with the school,

253
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:29,750
with the students with fact that it was stuff on campus because our data really have followed the trends.

254
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:42,310
For example, we see anywhere. Embedded in the on campus will probably be able to see that in the words of a few million bucks.

255
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:46,440
OK, so we provided some information, so this is worth watching.

256
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:52,390
Let's listen to remove. OK.

257
00:31:52,390 --> 00:32:00,460
And therefore, we didn't get much in in protest, this is what we do. We have a thoughtful walk me and then we have sedimentation proclamation.

258
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:06,610
And then we do the settlement construction, remove them. And it is to that and then to speak to the household.

259
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:13,050
So that's the trivial process, how we choose to work to the Western Wall or two particular.

260
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:16,650
OK. That's how would you. So what are you can see here?

261
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:25,490
It's really tried to prevent the contamination of soapy water to recover the clean.

262
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:29,330
Wanted to on the reverse looks like pretty nice.

263
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:34,880
Otherwise you have the smells of the water, all these lots of things you can find in the water.

264
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:41,690
And then you go on to really want to provide a safe and can you want free to use?

265
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:47,770
So now the question we have is how will this deficit?

266
00:32:47,770 --> 00:33:00,050
What is the safe water? So what do you say when you set up the Senate and what does the whole crew look at having?

267
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:08,540
That's not the case, because that's not the the case, because you cannot find zero contempt, he said.

268
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:13,580
How do you say this is what you can say is known to tick?

269
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:20,480
I cannot say anything zero to what you say, Oh, this is lovely if you're so.

270
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:27,700
So what are we going to do? How we define the all this itself is what we need to define this meeting to work on instead.

271
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:37,680
So how do we set up the center and then based on the health effects? I mean, based on the ecological effects.

272
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:45,000
We stayed out of the workforce down a Typekit because the ratio was accurate, chronically poorer and how that impacted the health.

273
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:53,730
So think about also the exposure to that to the to the to the contaminants from the water, the human health.

274
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:58,500
Right. So drinking water, food body contact.

275
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:06,630
So that's what I mentioned when we said drinking water is only two liter of water every day, but we still need to use the water for cooking,

276
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:15,990
both for cleaning, for the shower and also for the future towards the warmth up to those of our most of it's borrowed from the drinking water.

277
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:22,920
And then water from the use in the kitchen cleaning and the water from the shower.

278
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:28,500
That's how exposed to the contamination of contaminated cooking water and how we get exposed.

279
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:34,350
Surely this aquatic organisms could also some of the restoration foods and the

280
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:38,340
semi-aquatic of food for the also exposed to the contaminants of the water.

281
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:44,910
So that's how we get exposures of water that if you evaluate the health effects, you have to take that into consideration.

282
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:45,990
How do we get?

283
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:58,440
So and then we have to give the water, for example, the best cause of human health and then use this if you can study to set up the standard.

284
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,910
Can we say zero risk of the water? Absolutely.

285
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:07,780
There's no risk of the water from the water that we see that.

286
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:16,660
And there's a note, right? So we need to set up accept acceptable risk.

287
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:21,130
Because it is no right. So what we accept.

288
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:28,260
So, for example, for drinking water, normally we use one out of two arduous hours.

289
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:36,060
Are you that's because we have an exposure of drinking water contaminated, OK?

290
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:45,340
That's what we set up a whole contest and that's how the law protects the world for this, then that would cause a lot of what they think.

291
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:50,980
OK. If the leaves are more important than that, will Costanza, what is it?

292
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:56,410
Does not necessarily mean the war is absolutely. Risk.

293
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:05,130
Hillary's OK. Just the one who said. Look what you said.

294
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:12,120
You know, this is very, very important thing to do when we have this war criminals.

295
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:24,330
We do see the use of the effect the disease. And this person, so they used to have these filtration, just as you said, the filtration.

296
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:28,530
Was transportation, you see the all of these cases dramatically.

297
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:33,910
And then we have the correlation, alcoholism, the water only.

298
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:41,730
And there you see that high for Cliff is going to make it more Typekit the almost given the.

299
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:51,540
It was OK. It worked to improve our life expectancy dramatically because of its treatment we had in terms of health effects.

300
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:58,230
So that's really the way we can change that. Of course, if we change our course, we're being.

301
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:05,320
And soon some other countries will still have the same issue. But it's so historically, yes, compared to the other countries.

302
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:11,370
So we cannot switch away from this. The truth.

303
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:18,000
We can all switch away from this. What do we do find, you know, we can one at one.

304
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,900
And what you've ever come up on deliberately, this is very critical for our house for you.

305
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:40,170
We cannot do this. And and you can see here, if you look at these children, there's two you're on five years old pathology.

306
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:49,590
And they can see, but then the population with accept to Putin what?

307
00:37:49,590 --> 00:38:00,490
Clearly reverse correlation, more access to safe drinking water and the less mortality you.

308
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:05,430
See? Crazy. It's true.

309
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:14,360
OK, so provide. Safe and clean water to the public.

310
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:22,010
It's critical, essential. How?

311
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:30,260
And you can see from the. We. OK.

312
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:35,690
So that's reason when the former President Clinton came to the campus.

313
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:41,820
I don't know who he is. I was just I just joined with the university you on this memorial.

314
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:47,370
Let's do this for the congressman. One of the major.

315
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:55,900
Paul, he makes is that if you want to really serve. The developing country to other people, you have a country.

316
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,860
Not just provide the money. OK.

317
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:04,950
Is to provide adequate. Right.

318
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:11,040
Fantastic job. To have. OK.

319
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:17,130
How several more, because you can see this for these numbers.

320
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:26,190
OK. Yes. You know, just me wanting to reduce diarrhea disease or another, for example, provide a safe, clean water,

321
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:35,360
sanitation and hygiene reduce almost 50 percent, sometimes 50 percent of the diarrhea duties.

322
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:43,310
OK. So, yeah, now come back to the United States when we come out our forces to clean our hands.

323
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:49,120
It's good to ask people to think ahead. Some people.

324
00:39:49,120 --> 00:40:01,500
And that's going to comply with it full time. But yes, everything the kindergarten we teach them how to go, that's very important for your health.

325
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:08,530
OK. And again, this is the message we want to use because I'm what you call the sanitation.

326
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:13,900
And then this is a lot to use in terms of access to the Safe Clean Water Act.

327
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,540
And here you see some of. Sorry.

328
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:23,480
So we have some region with the words don't really have access to essential sanitation.

329
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:32,190
Talking about. African South Asian countries, South Asian countries, and then don't have access to drinking water,

330
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:36,000
for example, some are, some African countries don't exist.

331
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:52,980
Specifically, one act subpoena we have here and then you can see it very well to the face from unsafe use of tap water, sanitation hygiene.

332
00:40:52,980 --> 00:41:06,810
Right. So if you look at the map here. Now, if you look at this week's nuclear so again, safe clean water, sanitation.

333
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:16,990
It's essential for the health. Look at this map, Grace, in the United States, right?

334
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:23,320
There are issues in the United. In terms of the.

335
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:28,550
What are we really? You see her cry.

336
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:37,240
So probably thought, OK from all of us, yeah, we do have outbreaks.

337
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:48,880
Everything in my face, I think I with drinking water. For example, here, if you look at these numbers various, yes, we still have issues issue, OK?

338
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,250
Of course you say, Well, yeah, this is my look at these numbers here.

339
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:58,800
The number of outbreaks, very unique is quite big country.

340
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,260
What to give. OK.

341
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:11,030
Think about the health, right, no more tangible things about the people through it by putting your.

342
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:20,620
OK. Because really because how else how we will continue to have until some some issues allow you to think about this,

343
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:30,220
compare it to the pandemic COVID 19, how many does not qualify for COVID 19?

344
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:34,800
Which one of them probably close in on you?

345
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:41,250
All right. It is the year again, this is the.

346
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:51,530
Very. 700 350000 people die musical.

347
00:42:51,530 --> 00:43:00,860
And. What would you go to look?

348
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:10,340
What was the your. I found people. Look out to see a couple of the recent.

349
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:19,310
Thinking of those. The risk. This is not.

350
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:24,690
Confirmed at the ceremony, it sounds like. OK.

351
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:30,130
But. If anything, wrong with human.

352
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:35,560
Thinking. But. Three one crisis.

353
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:40,590
What is the problem, all Typekit. Oh, this.

354
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:44,460
OK, now how long one is time?

355
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:53,360
They got a thirty five year. Communications is a area of policy.

356
00:43:53,360 --> 00:44:03,680
So in terms of public health, think about this. I'm mostly here you while talking, focus you for a ritual speaking.

357
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:10,040
Our drinking water is high quality and you can maintain a high point of drinking water.

358
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,640
No doubt about it. OK.

359
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:24,210
But. We can easily fold to achieve this good violence through the and if they do something wrong.

360
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:30,820
I'm going to provide a be all for us. On the other hand.

361
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:37,540
You have to be so. And what you've got a very good job.

362
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:46,090
You're right. You're doing a good job, well done this for me.

363
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:55,620
We. The complaints, the issues with juvenile is not really the real issue.

364
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:02,050
Could we just see how can I just think about the different ways you may have to?

365
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:11,620
But yes, we do, for example, now we have increased has these major media narratives in the United States.

366
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:16,440
A six year old was drinking water. OK.

367
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,780
Got an infection from Legionella.

368
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:30,040
And you see the increase, so that's something we need to address, especially in the highest rising buildings where high rise in buildings.

369
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:38,150
And that's some of the cases now say what's emerging issues who have the policies process emerging contaminants.

370
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,180
You can have an image.

371
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:47,960
And Giovanna is one of the example aging infrastructure that's also one of the big issues we have to work on here in the United States.

372
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:54,760
And the water security, invasive species, climate change always provides a challenge for us to address.

373
00:45:54,760 --> 00:46:04,660
Perhaps again, I still want to say we need to give kudos to the to the Clean Water Act step two, if you want to act, you miss this.

374
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:13,090
So the people work in this sector that really provide the safe and to us.

375
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:16,910
OK. Don't take me wrong as much as me, there's no you should.

376
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:25,100
Yes, we still have an issue with that. Farage was speaking. This is a question.

377
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:29,740
Chair, we have United States economically.

378
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:37,330
We still have some issues for some others, the water policy, for example, access costs paid, some people come over, they're paid in.

379
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:43,710
Some major populations become already housing sufficient as possible treatment.

380
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:57,870
If you put Arizona, things are going on a major one, which which major populations here don't have the stomach trouble to get over.

381
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:02,940
But does this inequality feel we have in the United States in general?

382
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:10,270
Yes, we have. Can you work for us to use force to use?

383
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:18,850
Do you guys take a break? No. OK, so we can continue oh, no question about it.

384
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:24,410
So I know it's detected in late 2001,

385
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:34,940
and so I'm assuming that there were deaths to himself for 2001 for you when it was and it would just attribute those deaths or factors of.

386
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:51,500
So to help you think, how would you do this? What is my theory, sometimes based on the more hopeful issues they put on the the.

387
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:57,160
OK? Before he comes, he shoots, yes.

388
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:04,710
Maybe you to have a whole of paper that you take it and it's outrageous.

389
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:13,170
Now you guys. OK. But how do we do this?

390
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:18,500
The reason why is because. Again, precisely.

391
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:24,960
But if you think about the water in this building.

392
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:40,860
But ultimately, you know, all the promises of the promises, and then let's put the economy in the world, we.

393
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:53,020
So the one man who I think about myself and imagine what went on with it was just going to get you this, you know what?

394
00:48:53,020 --> 00:49:01,430
How do we measure or loss of life? We are trying to put on.

395
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:14,440
OK. What's the the engine issues?

396
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:20,710
One of the key issues is pharmaceuticals, a symbol that we find in our social stigma.

397
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:24,970
Social stigma is something that we're looking to get one.

398
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:31,460
So this is The Associated Press. We found drugs in the.

399
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:36,130
Software to keep order in the metropolitan areas, big cities, Chicago, all this.

400
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:43,550
So the phones, the pharmaceuticals and involved in the drinking water source something going on.

401
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:47,120
And in February 2008, 2002, some people already published.

402
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:55,580
Absolutely take this. So what do we make sure we have now is because they use and dump discharge.

403
00:49:55,580 --> 00:50:04,840
So all this use drugs, all use drugs, all these metabolites discharge into the water accumulate now cause a problem.

404
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:10,430
Now let's just go off because you probably know very little connoisseurship by now.

405
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:17,240
The cartridge anybody, especially in the system, will not have some ecological impacts.

406
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:24,410
OK, so that's one of the issue. And then the Congress now tried to address this with a public.

407
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:35,240
So in the emerging contaminants you can see here, if we saw an ounce of these ingredients, pharmaceuticals just one, I would lose all this.

408
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:44,770
I can get into our water and cover these ships, sometimes not only the drinking water, but also the specifics of what.

409
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:52,000
You just mentioned harmful algal blooms is a worldwide issue, climate change will make it worse.

410
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:02,600
With the warm water of some of this, for example, this is in China, in Peru and in some of the students in the Great Lakes, we also see that.

411
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:08,730
This area is going to be. Toledo area Toledo.

412
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:15,930
So are you there go through how to stop the private drinking water because it's out of balance?

413
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:21,800
OK. I was wrong, and so that's the issue we have in the United States.

414
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:34,090
One of the issues is. And the study found when they finally let the iconic liver diseases.

415
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:43,840
Is associated with our rooms of our buildings, but what we do to the water we exposed to these toxins finding the water.

416
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:54,520
We have not regulated the toxin yet. It is recommended level of contaminants for the toxins conversation, but we have not really recognized that yet.

417
00:51:54,520 --> 00:52:00,160
He felt. That's this image issue that gives some examples.

418
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:06,780
So imagine you should give us. Give us why you use almost everywhere.

419
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:12,660
OK, almost everywhere. It's very persistent in the water.

420
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:18,540
And it's a very difficult race. Why do you not become the consultant?

421
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:27,410
I'm. So what you can see here now looks like Michigan is a hotspot.

422
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:32,810
But going to be a couple of options for us.

423
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:44,760
And then you also see some is that is the state of Michigan so high, so high occurrence of the press.

424
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:53,850
Why is it? I mean, we had a lot of manufacturing, but I mean, is it probably hydrolysis over stuff like plastic goods?

425
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:59,680
OK, we're going to. Because. You don't have to go for it.

426
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:07,180
Why don't you just sit? They had a preexisting condition.

427
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:10,890
The news is that why it doesn't work?

428
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:18,040
OK, great. And are you regulation Eurovision's, I mean, you new working?

429
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:25,970
We're going from immigration reform to pass. Oh, you, we have a stuff out of there, but it's not.

430
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:32,380
The reason one of the reasons I would say, because.

431
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:37,960
That. Her fruit has become a critical.

432
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:47,790
Issue. Right now said when the dust settles, if we want to find something or in the state, the federal court that provides.

433
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:58,490
Border security is not enough. And for some of it's tough to find, right?

434
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:04,680
So that's one of the reason the check is a great reporter.

435
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:16,000
We're going to Texas and the state of Michigan, though, how many more states let a COVID rule than most other states?

436
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,150
So basically, the status of everything, everybody over.

437
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:29,860
What happened, Chris? The very next 25 year.

438
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,390
OK, the next 25 years.

439
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:40,840
So for some Arabs planning how to this all first, you've identified his office and then try to represent think of the road with him.

440
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:47,490
OK. But again, the past is very difficult to regulate.

441
00:54:47,490 --> 00:55:00,540
EPA how was most set up as a seven year? Because that's not easy to give profiles of right of people's product.

442
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:07,950
This might be some, some audiences. Don't you think?

443
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:15,620
Yep, I'm in the cast now, I'm teaching.

444
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:23,450
Urgent or. OK.

445
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:28,260
OK. Sorry for that.

446
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:32,910
My my people are on the field right now to watch them both with blood samples.

447
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:39,930
So how do you think you do that? Oh, OK. So so that's really that's what it really is, right?

448
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:47,430
So how to keep it ready for the visit from the regular to get some type of set up, some standards and some other states,

449
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:56,810
like California, to try to also set up some standards, maybe very stringent standards, how to treat?

450
00:55:56,810 --> 00:56:06,200
So are we still with us? They use this active just a new act of coming to remove us from the water, but fighting them off.

451
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:13,810
And now we have probable cost. Spending a lot of resources for that, just for.

452
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:17,470
OK. Well, I'm not saying it's not necessary.

453
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:23,760
Yes, it's messy. But think about the cost. A simple.

454
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:31,470
That's something but no one really consider. But they also say.

455
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:39,080
Well, when you. You Typekit.

456
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:46,880
But you need to tell you the public, OK?

457
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,690
But yes, surely the contaminant was contaminated better to chew them, to remove them?

458
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:57,110
That's good. That's good. OK. Five The EPA has goes through in the process.

459
00:56:57,110 --> 00:57:08,060
You want to remove that, should you? We're just talking about the the the drinking water, how do we provide the drinking water?

460
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:13,010
We have the thing, the source of water, we treat them and we distribute to each household all these.

461
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:17,990
We have a five 000 mile policy in Arabic, for example.

462
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:22,970
And then this is supposed to help in the state in the ABA.

463
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:26,720
If we're not sure we have the water, we have rice.

464
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:34,820
So you're from Oklahoma for the of you have. In most cases, that's what you have the support of.

465
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:44,760
And then what happened and what gives us? So a years ago, you see the water like this.

466
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:54,120
Quite the word come from the fact that if we look at this shot of the Wallace Typekit thanks to all.

467
00:57:54,120 --> 00:58:01,810
OK. Something wrong with what if we can't afford that, you see that and then they keep going you on with flashes for my bigger company.

468
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:17,380
But if you make some money from. OK, but that's what happens if these people continuously find this water crisis and what happens.

469
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:26,170
So question is know what's going wrong and why we have this.

470
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:35,250
Ideas. To try to save money and go to the different water systems,

471
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:45,210
and then that it's like you read the price that a lot of fun because it shows you what the world is.

472
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:46,960
Yeah, I wasn't a film, I mean,

473
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:54,630
it wasn't the public health or the water was really what was left of the corporate earnings of the manager for the whole game,

474
00:58:54,630 --> 00:59:03,280
but it's not trying to save the money. Some of.

475
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:21,490
Anything else we have, Michael Boudreau here looking out over overall approval of this problem.

476
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:29,990
So the level of maturity I was. And also the you get early these.

477
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:35,890
Increase in the genetically recorded equally.

478
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:44,080
Because three people are.

479
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:58,070
I mean, it's just easier, like you usually get right, although we'll see you back on, set it up and then people get on this island, I.

480
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:05,370
We're glad to hear that. This is not.

481
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:14,880
It's not. But, you know, we don't want security, we want our freedom over.

482
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:24,250
But I think even though that was somehow the seizure of my life by the.

483
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:33,530
I. I think part of the reason why it's so long has gained so much notoriety to me is,

484
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:38,990
I mean, a lot of particularly especially children like it's harmful to the brain.

485
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:48,680
The facts are not necessarily like that, but there's, I believe, now safe dressing that's not supported by the stuff that's going on.

486
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:54,590
Why? Why, why? Why we we we why was to how, how sick you are actually.

487
01:00:54,590 --> 01:01:02,850
It's why it's so easy to make or having a walk.

488
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:16,700
What we generally want to hear if it athletes. OK.

489
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:21,800
Think about the model of every approach. Protect ourselves.

490
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:28,210
All right. Do you have a good psychological story? What in the world have?

491
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:36,110
But they used to have a lot of fun working there, and they received a lot of them.

492
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:44,640
You want to talk? Where to go, what is the reason you're going to Detroit?

493
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:50,340
You can watch him and find him or the rest of it.

494
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:56,410
Because they have a big stimulus program that provides sufficient water for Indian people.

495
01:01:56,410 --> 01:02:03,710
How many people are you put? So it's a good.

496
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:07,730
So we still need to operate the people in that capacity.

497
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:14,540
And of course, it would be higher, so get they will walk through the airport and they.

498
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:23,220
So preference would be how it is on the financial crisis, the emergency managers is it makes everybody wants and what we want.

499
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:31,450
Also particularly among. So they you're supposed to get the water from the lake.

500
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:36,640
Bureau. OK. I'm probably not out of time.

501
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:42,980
The past is not out yet. Look, if we can use more.

502
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:49,500
OK, and for you, what is the. It's a very powerful.

503
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:55,740
And then they use that word for temporary. You don't want them.

504
01:02:55,740 --> 01:03:09,310
In fact, one of the problems. Right. And then when you provide sufficient information for the engineers to get high.

505
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:16,120
So we have hired some people for some pretty good reason.

506
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:21,160
So what are the children that they public service people?

507
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:31,030
So how do you make? Prospects, the prospect of a that.

508
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:37,780
That's when the warning comes in for the next three employees.

509
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:49,190
But we have. And that's why you have the southern province of water, where all this stuff coming from the pipes.

510
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:54,590
Great come from the place. And this can cause.

511
01:03:54,590 --> 01:04:01,160
Release of the president's region, our colleagues and also cost less effective,

512
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:07,370
the disaffected they have of dismantled the tremendous cost efficient and they have

513
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:14,390
this now so provides perfect decision stories of criticism of the labor policies,

514
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:17,810
component parts all on the ground everywhere.

515
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:31,470
And then now we have this surface removed the skill and removes all of the water of the top of each of the bases before.

516
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:36,010
OK, so my the list, the.

517
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:47,350
Used to be OK if you put all this skill brought up that prevent them from the sun, the Typekit water, for now, everything's coming to the electricity.

518
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:53,740
Between the legs of the war. Now,

519
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:58,810
how do you how do you have in this type of monitoring and now this is set up

520
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:04,090
to stand up instead of the same system that was almost across the country,

521
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:14,390
but in some of the more than one in the world, according to the report. Some people, some people say, Oh.

522
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:23,570
All right. They try to do that when they have these High Court decision because they have more property.

523
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:31,280
And then this index of two or three cycles of.

524
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:47,450
But all of us that's really what happens when so much of a barrier approach we have to provide, we want a fair.

525
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:58,420
In most cases, you. But finally, reason.

526
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:07,080
The Global Financial Week for the final four months of the Bush.

527
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:14,270
But. This issue is not a.

528
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:28,210
It's not exactly Europe. Every historically in the 60s and 70s, we used to always have a place with Mexico.

529
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:39,160
Was very good for. So a lot of City does have this line of five episodes month.

530
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:47,230
OK. You see what you see in 2002, how this issue.

531
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:54,220
Because all the more the off the price, the less people in this economy price.

532
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:58,880
And then our police. But in other.

533
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:04,490
And all of this will come out every week as much as three.

534
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:08,750
I mean, it was just because it comes the hospitals, because of political getting.

535
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:14,820
People are taking advantage of some people take a position, take advantage of it.

536
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:20,810
During the 2016 presidential election, know all the accomplishments.

537
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:28,240
I think more presence. Leave me alone, lot of concrete proof of address it.

538
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:33,910
And what's your talking about? Yes, it.

539
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:44,830
Those problems are real. OK, so that's reason the infrastructure, the it's time they a couple of house otherwise.

540
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:49,900
So are the missions, the risk associated with ginger water?

541
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,990
It's very low. It's very low.

542
01:07:52,990 --> 01:08:01,830
You have the high quality water in the United States, but right through the water everywhere if we don't take care of it.

543
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:10,360
If we don't get customers. The aging infrastructure dispute system is a big problem.

544
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:18,150
One of the biggest problem that we have in the United States. In terms of what Colin was thinking, what a lot.

545
01:08:18,150 --> 01:08:27,520
How about you? OK, so. Are a lot of people already taking cannot go somewhat mechanical?

546
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:32,770
So we're a hundred billion dollars in invested to upgrade our infrastructure.

547
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:39,650
Now the price tag will increase. And so that's reason I say $150.

548
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:44,600
You mean, it's just how acute at what price?

549
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:49,470
Are very good job. You know, when you.

550
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:54,180
But we need to get. Because think about this publicly, right?

551
01:08:54,180 --> 01:09:01,350
This is about how access to the safe, clean water is essential for us.

552
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:07,250
OK. Don't have access to the water would be in deep trouble. Children who.

553
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:16,920
I guess he's created the correlation with the water quality and it's simply water and that you both have you.

554
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:24,960
When my children are five years old, who are five years old, so that's what I'm saying.

555
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:33,050
Yes, we need to have an infrastructure upgrade. But we we don't bring anything to the wall, OK?

556
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:39,020
Still, we have a very good one for the United States across the country, OK?

557
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:44,330
Yes, there are some more of our Asia region regions.

558
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:51,490
But let's just begin. Yes, it's hard for you. But we have to think what happened to it.

559
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:56,180
OK, how you do it otherwise would be in trouble.

560
01:09:56,180 --> 01:10:05,080
It's more like a freight. People will say, whoa, this, this is oil.

561
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:15,340
Mr Ball, what can we do that? How would you like just a parabola, what can we do that?

562
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:19,290
Can it's not sustainable? No, not sustainable, right?

563
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:27,280
So cannot just take the future water is going to need to that there was only one side of it for Africa to tap water.

564
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:33,820
We have. And if you use bottled water, not everyone can afford it.

565
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:40,990
Think of how much water you use every day, as they say about how to live together.

566
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:45,580
One over 1000 times higher than capable of it.

567
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:52,500
No one ever knows it's one way we have. Not everyone can afford it.

568
01:10:52,500 --> 01:11:07,810
A horse of. Are you see here on? Switch to the Baltimore one, which has set up the security wall system, whatever the death of the British.

569
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:12,512
All right. So the powerhouse, how do you think the public?
