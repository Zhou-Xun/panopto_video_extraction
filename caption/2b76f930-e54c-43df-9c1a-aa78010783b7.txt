1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,950
In this segment, we're going
to talk about three types of

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,325
bias that are particular
to screening studies.

3
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:13,710
Those include; lead time bias,

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,330
length bias, and selection
of participants.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,230
So let's just first talk
about lead time bias.

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,585
What I need to do is
bring you back to

7
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:28,380
our figure looking at
the natural history of disease.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,634
If you remember, there
is a pre-clinical phase,

9
00:00:31,634 --> 00:00:33,585
that it stretches from
the time when you have

10
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:35,600
the biologic onset of disease,

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,660
and then when
symptoms are present,

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,355
and that's represented
by our blue arrows.

13
00:00:41,355 --> 00:00:43,420
Then we have a clinical phase,

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,120
that goes from the time
when symptoms develop,

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,970
and then onward, and
that could be until

16
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,760
cure or until death.

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,820
But when we do a
screening program

18
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,205
for diseases where
it's appropriate,

19
00:00:58,205 --> 00:01:01,850
we have what we call a
detectable pre-clinical phase,

20
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,425
and that's shown in green.

21
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:06,580
That's when detection by
screening is possible,

22
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,955
to when symptoms develop.

23
00:01:08,955 --> 00:01:11,630
The time by which screening

24
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,190
advances the diagnosis of
disease is called lead time,

25
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,680
and that's shown in orange.

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,560
So when you have a
screening program,

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,630
there is always lead time.

28
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,250
But with lead time bias,

29
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,130
what we're really
asking ourselves is,

30
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,820
did the earlier detection
of disease result in

31
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,800
a benefit with respect

32
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,195
to let's say mortality,
in this example?

33
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:39,230
In this example here,

34
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,545
with the orange
illustrating our lead time,

35
00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:44,929
it's the total orange line

36
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:47,300
that represents
the amount of time,

37
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,855
let's say that we knew about
a person with disease.

38
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:53,330
That's from when they were
detected by screening,

39
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,100
to when they had death.

40
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,945
So now let's say we have

41
00:01:56,945 --> 00:01:59,510
an individual who's
clinically detected,

42
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,370
and that's our purple arrow.

43
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,090
So that's from diagnosis,

44
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,775
on out to death.

45
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:08,245
So if you look at this example,

46
00:02:08,245 --> 00:02:10,550
it will look like the screen

47
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,215
detected case has
a better outcome,

48
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:17,710
because they knew about
their disease longer.

49
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,945
But it didn't advance
or change the time of

50
00:02:20,945 --> 00:02:24,560
death relative to
the clinically detected case.

51
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,510
So this would be an example

52
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,020
of lead time bias being present,

53
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,045
if we looked at
the total length of time

54
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:36,290
that the screen detected case
knew about their disease.

55
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,709
So now let's look at
a slightly different example,

56
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:44,075
where our clinically detected
case doesn't do as well,

57
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:46,430
and so they die sooner.

58
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,335
What we really want to

59
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,740
compare is the time
from which our screen

60
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,885
detected case would've been

61
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:58,670
identified by having symptoms
and being diagnosed,

62
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,790
compared to our
clinically detected case.

63
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,980
In this example, you can see that

64
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,010
our screen detected
case did much better,

65
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,980
and that's because let's say
initiating treatment earlier

66
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,690
was a benefit to
that screen detected case.

67
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,200
All right. So the next one
I want to talk

68
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,940
about is length bias.

69
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,710
So length bias occurs
or can occur because

70
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,410
we are not able to screen

71
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,180
individuals every
month let's say.

72
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,775
Generally, those intervals
between screening might be

73
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:37,675
six months a year,
sometimes even longer.

74
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:42,430
If you have a scenario
where the screen detected

75
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,890
cases are those that are

76
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,850
intrinsically likely to
have a better outcome,

77
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,010
let's say in the case of cancer

78
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,410
because they're
slower growing tumors,

79
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,560
they haven't better biology,

80
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,875
they're more amenable
to treatment.

81
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,830
If those are the kinds of cases

82
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,245
you're detecting by screening,

83
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:07,340
it will look like
the screening is effective,

84
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,310
but that's really
only because you are

85
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,760
identifying cases
through screening that

86
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,165
were never likely to
result let's say in death.

87
00:04:17,165 --> 00:04:19,460
So let's just take
a look at this figure

88
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,895
and a graphical illustration
of that phenomenon.

89
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,790
So along the x-axis,
you have time,

90
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,550
and that's the onset
of disease out

91
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,670
to when individuals are screened,

92
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,350
and along the y-axis,

93
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,005
you have the size and
the stage of the tumor.

94
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:38,870
So what you can see in
this example is that,

95
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,420
it's our slower
growing tumors that

96
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,480
are detected by screening.

97
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,860
Whereas our rapidly
growing tumors,

98
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,100
which are biologically,

99
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,595
intrinsically more
likely to be fatal,

100
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:53,210
those are never detected by

101
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,760
screening because they
occur so rapidly,

102
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,565
and individual just
doesn't get screened.

103
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:01,475
Some will, but most will not.

104
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:04,580
So when you have
length bias present,

105
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,210
it means that it looks like
there's a screening benefit,

106
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,310
but really the benefit is only in

107
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,680
detecting cases that
were never going

108
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,155
to be a serious cause of
morbidity or mortality.

109
00:05:18,155 --> 00:05:22,040
The last type of bias that
we need to think about in

110
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,150
screening programs is

111
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,865
self-selection or
participation bias.

112
00:05:25,865 --> 00:05:30,640
Who is more likely to participate
in a screening program?

113
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,810
Just think about
that for a second.

114
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,870
So that's right,
healthy individuals are more

115
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,020
likely to participate
in a screening program.

116
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,000
So it's possible that if

117
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,945
your screening program only
includes healthy individuals,

118
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:47,885
that you will have a biased view

119
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:51,380
of the benefit of
that screening program.

120
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,255
In this segment, we've talked

121
00:05:53,255 --> 00:05:55,550
about three specific
types of bias

122
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,590
that we have to keep in mind

123
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,065
when we're evaluating
screening programs.

124
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:02,180
Those are lead time bias,

125
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,698
length bias, and
participation bias.
