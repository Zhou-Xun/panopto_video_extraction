00:00:02,766 --> 00:00:05,140
Hi everyone, I'm Kerry Carben Gutierrez.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,710
And today we're going to talk about
some important design issues related

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,670
to case control studies.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,270
The learning objectives for this module
are to identify the important issues about

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,900
the selection of cases in a case control
study, as well as to identify important

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,770
issues about the selection of
controls in a case control study.

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,570
We want to be able to describe why
matching is used in case control studies,

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:34,240
and then be able to calculate an odds
ratio for when we have matched pairs.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,070
We also want to understand how limitations
in recall can influence findings from

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,880
a case control study.

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,700
Our key terms for
this module include prevalent cases,

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,830
incident cases, hospital controls,
neighborhood controls.

13
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,670
Group and individual matching,
concordant and

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,430
discordant pairs as well as recall bias.

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,560
So one of the principal questions that we
faces investigators when we're designing

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,750
a case control study is where
are we going to get our cases from.

17
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,060
And not only where are we gonna get
them from but who should those cases be.

18
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,150
Should we select prevalent cases,
or incident cases?

19
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,650
Well just as the name suggests,

20
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,500
there's a fundamental difference between
prevalent cases and incident cases.

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,188
Whereby prevalent cases are those
individuals that already have the disease

22
00:01:22,188 --> 00:01:25,804
and may have had the disease for
quite a long period of time.

23
00:01:25,804 --> 00:01:30,649
And this is compared to incident cases
who are individuals who more recently

24
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:36,230
have had the disease, they've recently
been diagnosed with the disease.

25
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,740
And so there's both pros and
cons to both of these options.

26
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,600
Incident cases are generally preferred,
they may remember their exposures better,

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,370
they may be a more homogeneous population

28
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:52,450
in terms of the type of disease
experience that they're having.

29
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,160
But one of the major problems
is that we actually need to wait

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,240
while they become diagnosed
with their disease.

31
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,280
And so it may slow down our recruitment
as we're constantly waiting for

32
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,560
newly diagnosed cases to become available.

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,850
Prevalent cases, by and large,
are faster and easier and

34
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,890
cheaper to be able to recruit.

35
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,190
But there is a concern that they may not
be representative of all the cases because

36
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,090
being a prevalent case or being someone
who has had this disease for a long

37
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,070
period of time may actually be a function
of having survival with the disease.

38
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:32,120
So the individuals who are prevalent cases
may overrepresent long term survivors and

39
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,090
may not be appropriately generalizable to
those individuals who may be a case but

40
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,120
not be a survivor of that disease.

41
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,960
So once we make a decision
about whether or

42
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,230
not we're going to select
prevalent cases or

43
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:52,010
incident cases, we need to decide where
we're going to find these types of people.

44
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,720
So where do you recruit cases?

45
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,370
There's a lot of options and most oftenly,

46
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,010
these types of individuals are recruited
from hospitals, or medical clinics.

47
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,480
And this is because we want
to know their disease status,

48
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,470
that's a fundamental feature of a case
control study is that we recruit

49
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,700
individuals based upon knowledge of
them having a disease of interest.

50
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,861
And so, because they are patients
at hospitals or medical clinics,

51
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:19,850
we are able to ascertain
their disease status.

52
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:25,660
Another common opportunity to select
cases is from disease registries.

53
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,320
Many large registries have been
set up across the country for

54
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,517
different diseases of interest and so cyr
is a cancer registry that is national and

55
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:40,260
keeps an identification of
individuals with cancer.

56
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,140
Here at the University of Michigan,
we're one of the leaders in developing

57
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,880
an arthroplasty registry of individuals
who have undergone a joint replacement.

58
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,130
But there's lots of different types of
disease registries that can be used and

59
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,260
leveraged as a place to recruit cases.

60
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,390
Another option is that we can
also go in to the community and

61
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,160
seek individuals who have a disease
that we are interested in.

62
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,310
This is problematic in some ways,
in that particularly with rare diseases.

63
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,800
If we're looking in
the community at large,

64
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,310
there may not be quite
as many individuals and

65
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,725
we mean we have to do a lot of screening
to be able to identify those people.

66
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:22,150
But by enlarge it does,
have the advantage of perhaps

67
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:28,360
giving us a better understanding of
the source population of interest.

68
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,680
So with respect to
the selection of controls,

69
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,335
this is another concern
of ours as investigators.

70
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:37,360
And it's really critically important for
us to get this piece right.

71
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,200
And it's important because they provide
the information about the exposure

72
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,200
distribution and
the underlying population.

73
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,710
So if you recall from our previous module,
the goal of case control study is to

74
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,530
compare the exposure distribution and
the cases as compared to the controls.

75
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:01,080
And we use our controls as our
group of interest to provide

76
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,270
information about what the underlined
population that gave rise to the cases,

77
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,490
has in terms of an exposure distribution.

78
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,740
And so, who those controls are, where they
come from is critically important and

79
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,490
in the measures of association that we
ultimately calculate from our study.

80
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,860
So where do you recruit controls?

81
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:28,050
Well, the best scenario would be to
recruit controls from the community.

82
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:33,040
And so this could be a probability
sample of the community at large.

83
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,670
We could do neighborhood controls.

84
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:39,850
This is an option where we go into
the neighborhood that the cases live in.

85
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,520
And find the next nearest neighbor
who meets the criteria that we're

86
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,080
interested in.

87
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,250
We could also do something like random
digit dialing, where we use lists of

88
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:55,610
individuals and call on numbers at random
that may live in the same geographic area

89
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:01,820
as that individual until we find someone
who might meet our inclusion criteria.

90
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,130
We may also use the best friend of
the case or a close friend of the case.

91
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,540
As they are likely to be invested
in the research study and

92
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,480
interested in participating because
of their friend's disease status.

93
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,220
But they may also be similar to
their friend in many ways in

94
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,860
terms of perhaps where they live, the type
of job they have, their marital status.

95
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:32,120
And so these are all opportunities that we
can recruit controls from the community.

96
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,930
There's pros and cons with both of these.

97
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,330
And so, the pros are really that,
when we recruit community controls,

98
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,830
they're more likely to have come
from the same referent population

99
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,670
as compared to where the cases are from.

100
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,410
And that's really important
because it allows us to have some

101
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,650
comparability between the cases and
the controls.

102
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,930
The cons for this type of recruitment
is it's time consuming, it's expensive,

103
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:59,770
many of these individuals may be hard to
recruit because finding them is an issue.

104
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,160
Making sure that they are the type of
individual where interested may be

105
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,230
difficult.

106
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,990
And then they have no real invested
interest in the study, and so

107
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,960
they may not be as willing to participate.

108
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,460
Hospitalized patients are another
option for recruitment of controls and

109
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,980
hospital patients are an important
caveat to consider is

110
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,670
that we do wanna only include patients
as controls if they're admitted for

111
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:31,100
conditions that are not related
to the exposure of interest.

112
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,450
So for example, if we're interested and

113
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:39,020
looking at the association between
smoking and arthritis, for example,

114
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:44,400
we wouldn't want to select controls who
have been admitted for cardiac surgery

115
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,580
knowing the relationship between
smoking and cardiovascular disease.

116
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,290
And so we really need to be cognizant
of making sure that our controls,

117
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:58,370
if they are from the hospital, are those
that have conditions that are patients for

118
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,620
reasons other than
the exposure of interest.

119
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,840
And so for this type of control the Pros
are that they're easy to identify,

120
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,810
it's easy to pull the hospital records,

121
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,040
find out who those patients are,
we can find them ,they're in the hospital.

122
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,640
Because they're there,
they're more likely to participate,

123
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,923
they're invested in their own health and
the health of others.

124
00:08:20,923 --> 00:08:25,055
And because their patients that
are undergoing a type of health event,

125
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:30,045
they may have more comparable recall
as compared to the cases versus

126
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:34,860
individuals from the community who don't
have any real reason to speculate or

127
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,850
think about their exposure status.

128
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,500
Some of the downsides to using
hospitalized patients as controls is that

129
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,610
they are also ill.

130
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,920
And so, as we mentioned before, they may
not be representative of the exposure

131
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,320
history of the source population
that we're interested of.

132
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,700
And, of course, if they're admitted for

133
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,260
conditions that are related
to the exposure of interest,

134
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,776
this is a major problem and
can result in a certain type of bias.

135
00:08:58,776 --> 00:09:03,548
And finally, there are some registries
that are being developed now

136
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:07,960
to keep a listing of
individuals who are interested

137
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,585
in engaging with health research but
do not have a certain disease of interest.

138
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:17,073
And so, for example, the University of
Michigan keeps a listing of individuals

139
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:20,505
who are interested in participating
in health research, and

140
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:24,927
this is an opportunity to find controls
in that way, that the listing is there,

141
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:27,179
it's available, we can contact them.

142
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:31,664
But they might not have some of these
other caveats that are difficult with

143
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:37,780
the community or
hospitalized patients as controls.

144
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,340
So I'd like to speak a little bit about
some of the important design elements that

145
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,990
we need to consider when we're
talking about case-control studies.

146
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,830
And one of the major
design elements that is

147
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,840
at our disposal when we're conducting
case-control studies is matching.

148
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,720
So matching is a design element
that helps us ensure that cases and

149
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,930
controls are similar on selected factors.

150
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:04,260
And so this is a decision that we
make as investigators to deliberately

151
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:10,590
identify controls in a way that will
make them similar to our cases,

152
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:16,210
so that we're having greater
comparability between these two groups.

153
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,500
There are two major types of matching
that we are going to learn about.

154
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,710
The first one is group matching, and
this is also called frequency matching.

155
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,010
And the second type is
individual matching.

156
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,680
So let's start with group or
frequency matching.

157
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,270
So, group or frequency matching
is when we select our controls so

158
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,840
that the proportion of controls
with a certain characteristic

159
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,940
is the same as the proportion of
cases with that characteristic.

160
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,330
And so, whatever that characteristic is
that's of interest we wanna make sure that

161
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,380
it's balanced overall between
our overall group of cases and

162
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,770
our overall group of controls.

163
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,710
And so one thing that we need to keep
in mind when we're doing this type of

164
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,720
matching is that we must first enroll all
of our cases so that we can understand and

165
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,870
be able to quantify the proportion of
cases who have that characteristic

166
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,030
of interest.

167
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,550
And we need to do this before
we can enroll the controls, so

168
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,940
that we can really understand what
target we're trying to reach.

169
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,180
It's important to note that you can
actually group match on more than one

170
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,550
characteristic, and
we'll see an example of that here next.

171
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,180
So let's do an example.

172
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,180
Let's say the investigators are wanting
to make sure that the case and

173
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,010
control groups are balanced with
respect to male-female distribution.

174
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,245
And so,
once they enroll all of their cases,

175
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:39,600
the investigators observe that
33% of the cases are female.

176
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,280
And so then they enroll their controls,

177
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,100
so that 33% of those
individuals are also female.

178
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,880
So, if you see in the schematic down here,
5 of the 15 cases are female

179
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,225
and 5 of the 15 controls are female.

180
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:59,110
So, they're not individually matched,
which we'll learn about in just a minute,

181
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,600
but overall when we're looking at
the whole population of the cases and

182
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,900
the whole population of the controls that
in both groups 33% of them are female.

183
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,500
As I mentioned,

184
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,810
we can also match on several different
features when we're group matching.

185
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,320
And so let's take it a step further and

186
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,140
say that perhaps the investigators
are interested in making sure that there's

187
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:25,240
a balance of residential area with
respect to the cases and controls.

188
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,440
So let's say 40% of the cases
live in urban areas, and so

189
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,167
we see that here where we've got 6 out of
these 15 cases who live in urban area.

190
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:39,591
Well, then we would wanna make sure
that 6 out of the 15 controls also

191
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:41,082
live in the urban area.

192
00:12:41,082 --> 00:12:45,122
And so keep in mind that they don't
have to be the same individuals, so

193
00:12:45,122 --> 00:12:50,121
when we're considering multiple
variable here we have male, female, and

194
00:12:50,121 --> 00:12:54,912
urban versus not urban, they don't need to
be the same individuals but the overall

195
00:12:54,912 --> 00:13:02,170
proportion between the cases and the
controls is the same in those two groups.

196
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,570
Individual matching is also called matched
pairs, it's a little bit different because

197
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,910
rather than looking at the overall
group proportion of a given feature,

198
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:16,240
here we're doing a one to one match or
maybe a case to many control match.

199
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,780
And so, for each case that is selected,
a control or perhaps more than one control

200
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:26,665
is selected that is similar to the case
in terms of selected characteristics.

201
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:30,805
And it's important to note that we can
match more than one control to a case and

202
00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:36,205
to increase our statistical power, so we
can have a one-case to one-control match,

203
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:40,585
we can have a one-case to two-controls
match, we can go generally up to about

204
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:47,420
four controls per case before we max
out on improving our statistical power.

205
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,550
Individual matching is often more
practical to implement because we can

206
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,830
do this as we enroll cases and
controls simultaneously.

207
00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:00,190
So, as we enroll a case, we look at their
characteristics that are of interest.

208
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,060
And then we can seek out
our control population and

209
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,960
screen them until we find a control that
meets those same characteristics that

210
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,560
would be of interest with respect to
the case, and then we match them.

211
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,100
We consider them as a matched pair.

212
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,580
Moving forward in the study.

213
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,450
So let's look at an example.

214
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,670
Let's suppose that we have a research
study in which the investigators want to

215
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:29,190
match on sex, age,
body mass index and marital status.

216
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,998
So each of these, the investigators need
to decide how closely they wanna match on.

217
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:40,960
So sex, they want to have a male case
paired with a male control for example.

218
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,653
And then with respect to things like age
or body mass index where there's more

219
00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:49,990
variation, we need to decide
how closely we want to match.

220
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,730
So age, it would be very unlikely that
we would be able to match someone

221
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,570
exactly on their age down to
the very birth date and year.

222
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,980
And so, instead the investigators make
a decision based upon what they think that

223
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,450
relationship is between
these characteristics and

224
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:12,440
their exposure and outcome and say, okay,
we think that matching within five years.

225
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,950
So a case and a control who
are within five years of one another,

226
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,370
we would consider that a match.

227
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,750
And here with body mass index they say,
okay,

228
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,930
within two kilograms per meter
squared we will consider that a match.

229
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,230
And then marital status,
we could select that to be,

230
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,238
they both have to be married,
or unmarried, or widowed,

231
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:36,310
those are decisions that the investigator
makes at the design level.

232
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,460
So let's look at a couple of examples,
so here we have matched pair one.

233
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:45,163
We have a case who's a 75-year-old
male with a BMI of 34.2

234
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:48,766
kilograms per meter squared,
and he is married.

235
00:15:48,766 --> 00:15:53,489
And we match him with a control who's
also a male, who's 77-years-old, so

236
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:58,016
within that 5-year window the control
is only 2 years older than the case.

237
00:15:58,016 --> 00:16:04,435
The control has a slightly lower body mass
index, 33 kilograms per meter squared, but

238
00:16:04,435 --> 00:16:09,505
still within that two kilogram per meter
squared window that we're interested in.

239
00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:12,185
And our control is also
married like our case.

240
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:16,570
And so, these two individuals here
would be considered a matched pair.

241
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,400
Let's look at one more example.

242
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,446
This would be match pair number two we
have a case who's a 56 year old female.

243
00:16:23,446 --> 00:16:29,770
She has a body mass index of 29.7 kilogram
meters per square and she's unmarried.

244
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:33,320
And then we match her with someone who's
also a female cuz that's one of our

245
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,830
characteristics that we want to match on.

246
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,110
And she's matched with
someone who's 60 years old.

247
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,080
So their control here is a little
bit older, four years older but

248
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,260
not exceeding our match parameters.

249
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,700
She is a slightly lower body mass index,
but

250
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:53,720
not very much different than our case and
she too is also unmarried.

251
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,216
So in both of these scenarios,
we consider match pair one and

252
00:16:58,216 --> 00:17:00,785
match pair two as units together.

253
00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:05,153
They're pairs of individuals
that are matched on age, sex,

254
00:17:05,153 --> 00:17:08,930
body mass index, and marital status.

255
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:14,450
And the difference is that one of them
is a case, and one of them is a control.

256
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,240
There's important
considerations that we need to

257
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,150
think about when we're doing matching.

258
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:24,400
So the first thing is that it may be
really difficult to find matches for

259
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,960
our cases if our characteristics of
interest are too many or too narrow.

260
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,360
So in the example before we had
four characteristics of interest.

261
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,515
Age, sex, body mass index and
marital status.

262
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:43,369
But if we had many more,
if we were interested in occupation

263
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:48,402
as well as city of residence,
as well as religion or

264
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:53,220
something, many different characteristics.

265
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,710
The more characteristics we add to it,

266
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,950
the more difficult it might be
to find a more suitable match.

267
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:05,030
Likewise if we have a matching
characteristics that are too narrow

268
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,280
in the sample of age.

269
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,497
If we're interested in getting
someone who's the same age within five

270
00:18:10,497 --> 00:18:15,288
days of another that's much more difficult
to do rather than within five years.

271
00:18:15,288 --> 00:18:20,256
And so it's really important that
the investigator think about this and

272
00:18:20,256 --> 00:18:24,491
think about how many characteristics
they need to match on and

273
00:18:24,491 --> 00:18:27,025
with what window of match they need.

274
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:31,256
It's also important to remember that once
you match on a characteristic, you can no

275
00:18:31,256 --> 00:18:35,880
longer consider those characteristics
as exposures of interest in your study.

276
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,496
And so this is by definition, if you
keep in mind the case control studies,

277
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:42,256
we're looking at whether or

278
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:46,606
not their proportion of exposure
varies between cases and controls.

279
00:18:46,606 --> 00:18:50,534
And then we match on them,
we're by definition making sure that those

280
00:18:50,534 --> 00:18:54,270
proportions do not vary between
the cases and controls.

281
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,550
And so if we're asking our cases in
controls to have the same marital status

282
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:02,945
for example, then there is no
variation in that exposure any longer.

283
00:19:02,945 --> 00:19:07,905
And so once we match for something
that characteristic can no longer

284
00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:11,743
be considered as an exposure
variable in our study.

285
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,776
We also need to be
cognizant of overmatching.

286
00:19:14,776 --> 00:19:19,902
And this is when we make our criterion so
tight that we

287
00:19:19,902 --> 00:19:26,556
can't find anyone to actually
meet those limitations we've set.

288
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:30,189
But also that we make the matches so

289
00:19:30,189 --> 00:19:34,449
tight with one another that in doing so,

290
00:19:34,449 --> 00:19:42,745
are inadvertently matching on exposures
that we are actually interested in.

291
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:47,760
Because that the match characteristic may
be related to the exposure of interest.

292
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,070
And so we need to make sure that
that's something we pay attention to.

293
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:56,180
Most importantly, we need to keep in mind
that when we do individual matching,

294
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,390
this requires a matched analysis.

295
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:03,167
And so we can no longer use our
traditional tools that we've learned for

296
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:05,005
measures of association.

297
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:07,831
But instead,
we need to look at it a different way and

298
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,090
conduct what we call a matched analysis.

299
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,460
And we'll learn about that right now.

300
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:17,200
So when we do individual matching,
we have matched pairs and

301
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,950
then we need to calculate odds ratio
based upon those matched pairs.

302
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,390
And when we do that it's important that we

303
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,810
only use the data from
the discordant pairs.

304
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,770
And so what do I mean by that?

305
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:37,590
Well when we have matched pairs, we have
either concordant or discordant pairs.

306
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,360
Concordant pairs are those
pairs in which the case and

307
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,330
control in that pair are both
exposed with respect

308
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:51,580
to the measure of interest or unexpose
with respect to the measure of interest.

309
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,169
Discordant pairs is when our case and

310
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:58,938
control in a given pair have
discordance in their exposure status.

311
00:20:58,938 --> 00:21:04,530
So in that pair one of them is exposed and
one of them is unexposed.

312
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:10,712
And really it's in this discordant
pairs where we can better understand

313
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:16,904
differences in exposure experience
among cases relative to controls.

314
00:21:16,904 --> 00:21:22,113
Because the concordant pairs, because of
their similarity in exposure status or

315
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:27,970
unexposure status for that matter doesn't
give us any information towards that.

316
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,330
And so when we do this type of analysis,

317
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,660
we conduct a different
type of two by two table.

318
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,970
And here we see that this two by
two table represents the case and

319
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,890
control pairs, not individuals.

320
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,610
And so that's really important to
note that our cells here are actually

321
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,930
pairs of individuals
not individual people.

322
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,530
And so here on this two by two table,

323
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,950
we have the controls up on top and
the cases down below.

324
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:59,621
And so we can have a case that5's
exposed that's cell a and

325
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:03,155
a control that's exposed,
excuse me, that's cell a.

326
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,745
A case that's exposed who's paired with or

327
00:22:05,745 --> 00:22:10,235
matched with a control who's not exposed,
that's cell b.

328
00:22:10,235 --> 00:22:14,330
We can have a case who's not exposed and

329
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:18,340
a control who is exposed and
that will be cell c.

330
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,431
And then we can have a case that is not
exposed and a control that's not exposed,

331
00:22:22,431 --> 00:22:28,153
and that will be cell d.

332
00:22:28,153 --> 00:22:32,760
So let's do a brief example with
respect to our match pairs here.

333
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,533
So here's our two by two table and
suppose we have this study where we

334
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:41,579
have ten individuals,
excused me, ten matched pairs.

335
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:46,710
We have ten cases and ten controls,
and we see their exposure status here.

336
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:50,680
So e is exposed and n is not exposed.

337
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,290
The first thing we wanna go through
is understand which of these

338
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:58,970
matched pairs is discordant and
which of them are concordant.

339
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:02,489
And so first, we see that we
have concordant exposed pairs.

340
00:23:02,489 --> 00:23:06,928
And this is where both of
the individuals in that matched pair,

341
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:09,795
both that case and control are exposed.

342
00:23:09,795 --> 00:23:14,565
And we see that the only situation
in which that happens that is pair

343
00:23:14,565 --> 00:23:18,060
number two and so this is our cell a.

344
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:22,140
So there's one match pair there.

345
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,266
Concordant but not exposed,
this is when we have both the case and

346
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:29,802
the control is not exposed
to our exposure of interest.

347
00:23:29,802 --> 00:23:36,260
So we see that this is true for
pair three, pair six and pair ten.

348
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,490
We have discordant pairs where the case
is exposed but the control is not.

349
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:45,150
And this happens for pair one,
four, seven, and nine.

350
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,270
And then we have discordant pairs
where the case is unexposed, but

351
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,320
the control is exposed.

352
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,180
And so we see that for
pair number five and number eight.

353
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:00,020
And so now what we are gonna do is take
the number of those pairs that meet

354
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,790
each of these criterion, and
put them into our two by two table.

355
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:09,710
So you can see here that we have for cell
a, that's our concordant exposed pairs,

356
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,208
we have one of those.

357
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:18,060
For our concordant exposed pairs, that's
cell d there, we have three of those.

358
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:24,208
Discord pairs where the case is exposed,
that's Cell B, we have four of those.

359
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:27,831
And discordant pairs where
our case is unexposed and

360
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:32,610
our control is exposed,
we have two of those.

361
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,220
Okay, so moving along.

362
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,900
So now we are wanting to
calculate our odds ratio

363
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,380
once we've filled out
our two by two table.

364
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:46,720
So our odds ratio, in a matched
pairs analysis is just b over c.

365
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,090
And that's because we're only using
the discordant pairs in our analysis.

366
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:55,800
So, cell b is our discordant pair
where the case is exposed, but

367
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,880
the control is not.

368
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,880
And c is our discordant pairs,

369
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,780
where the case is not exposed but
the control is exposed.

370
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,042
So, if we pull those numbers,
four divided by two equals two.

371
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:14,063
So our odds ration in this
matched pairs analysis is two.

372
00:25:14,063 --> 00:25:18,499
Okay, so one more important issue
that we need to consider when we're

373
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:22,940
designing case control studies
is issues of recall bias.

374
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,985
So in case control
studies by definition our

375
00:25:25,985 --> 00:25:28,935
exposure ascertainment is retrospective.

376
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:32,225
We're asking individuals,
once we define them as being a case or

377
00:25:32,225 --> 00:25:34,455
control, to tell us something, or

378
00:25:34,455 --> 00:25:39,675
to gather information about their exposure
experience or their exposure history.

379
00:25:39,675 --> 00:25:43,000
Often times we do this by interview.

380
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,580
And so in both cases, cases and controls
may have limitations in their recall of

381
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,110
exposure and
this results in misclassification.

382
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,050
So cases may tell us that they were
exposed when in fact they were not,

383
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:59,330
controls may tell us they were
exposed when in fact they were not.

384
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,973
Or both may tell us they were
unexposed when in fact they were.

385
00:26:01,973 --> 00:26:06,370
And so this is problematic
because of the misclassification.

386
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:10,940
But generally when this happens for
both cases and controls, it leads

387
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,920
to an underestimate of our magnitude
of association between the outcome and

388
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,490
exposure.

389
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:20,390
So it makes our estimate more
conservative than it might actually be.

390
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:25,310
However there's a concern when cases might
have a differential recall as compared to

391
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,460
controls.

392
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,985
And this results in bias, and
it's a type of bias known as recall bias.

393
00:26:29,985 --> 00:26:34,382
And so when this happens it results
in an artificial association between

394
00:26:34,382 --> 00:26:38,990
the outcome and the exposure when
in fact there may not be one.

395
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,380
And the reason this happens is
that perhaps some of our cases,

396
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,720
because of the nature of their disease,

397
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,060
are ruminating about
the cause of their disease.

398
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,390
They've been worried about the disease,
they're wondering what they may have done

399
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:55,160
or what they may have been exposed to that
may have led to their disease, and so

400
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,735
they have better recall, or

401
00:26:58,735 --> 00:27:04,040
are remembering things or bringing
things to the forefront of their memory,

402
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:09,300
in terms of exposure that the controls
may not be because they are not diseased.

403
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,420
And so when this happens, it's a concern,
it's known as recall bias and

404
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:18,310
we need to be careful to pay attention
to what it might do in terms of our

405
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:21,610
magnitude of association.

406
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,680
So in summary in the design of case
control studies important decisions about

407
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,200
where to locate and recruit cases and
controls is critical.

408
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,340
Ideally we'd like to capture the controls
from the same population that gave rise

409
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,120
to the cases.

410
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,170
And to make our cases and controls similar
with respect to important characteristics,

411
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:44,260
we often use matching as
an important design element.

412
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:48,449
And finally, we need to make sure
that we're cognizant of recall bias,

413
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:58,666
which may be a common concern
in case control studies.
