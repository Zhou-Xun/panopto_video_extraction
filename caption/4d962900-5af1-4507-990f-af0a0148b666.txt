1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,470
I've got to go.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:20,030
I swear to God, I'm not sure about the way I do that.

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:28,700
And then I like I don't even know, I guess, what I'm saying.

4
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,910
I don't know if it's like an icon.

5
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,840
It's like. I think so. Okay.

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:01:15,790
So you are aware that you took your students now, so why would you go to great lengths to only have to spend too much time on the subject?

7
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:36,200
Yeah. You want to get started or just wanted to start with a showing you the distribution of exam one and two which um,

8
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:44,100
pretty similar exam to has a slightly lower average than Exam one.

9
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,670
Um, during the times average time you think the exam was longer.

10
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,290
That made sense because they were more short answer questions.

11
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:01,470
But the bulk of everything is in both Exam one and two.

12
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:22,210
So as the exam one, if you got the lowest 70 and you want to retake the exam and score up to 70, any questions on them?

13
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:28,620
Three is going to be a take home exam. So I'll answer and.

14
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:43,080
For the last the last two weeks, there'll be very similar kinds of questions answered questions as if they.

15
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:58,580
There's actually one question from last week I highlight because it was a question about

16
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:07,540
whether and not having a shorter antibiotic course increases the possibility for difference.

17
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,930
Now, actually, and that is something that used to be.

18
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,110
Assume that if you have, you had to complete the course of antibiotics,

19
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:29,700
even even post when your symptoms have resolved in order to minimize both the reoccurrence of that disease and minimize resistance.

20
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,910
That's something that more and more fewer of fewer physicians actually adhere to.

21
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:41,459
And there's a lot written about it with respect to that not being the case.

22
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:49,500
So that the idea is that, you know, in general and this is not there are clinical situations, this is not true.

23
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:56,490
But in general, you can stop your course of antibiotics, bacteria or symptoms that can result.

24
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,549
So I don't think I, I looked at my slides.

25
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,690
I don't think there is anything in the slides that says contrary to that fact.

26
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:16,790
Yeah, that's something. And if you Google it that that's something that is an ongoing discussion about how few of your people are adhering to that.

27
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,350
But again, there are some clinical situation where that's not the case.

28
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:32,520
So this lectures on sexually transmitted diseases and.

29
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,720
Basically, here's an outline of what we'll be covering.

30
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:45,710
I think the highlight here is the sort of is the want to emphasize and highlight

31
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,710
aspects of stories that are unique and with respect to transmission modes,

32
00:04:50,810 --> 00:05:02,760
the respect to the social networks that are important in understanding how how stories are transmitted and how best to mitigate STIs.

33
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:08,210
So we're going to focus a lot on that in this.

34
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,670
In this lecture, it will be a focus of our discussion at the academy.

35
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:29,780
So first slide, just to emphasize that STIs are on the rise, maybe in the increase has been quite dramatic for many of the common STIs,

36
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:42,110
this infographic that is Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and syphilis and the rise we are seeing since 2000, and particularly since COVID.

37
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:56,210
These are the civic subgroups. They're most affected by STIS, adolescents, people aged between 15 and 24 years.

38
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:08,300
This emphasizes the fact that since COVID cases have skyrocketed, specifically syphilis.

39
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:16,190
And this has a lot to do with the fact and really it's the lot of the indirect impacts of COVID.

40
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,930
The impact of COVID is not just on the fact that killed a lot of people,

41
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:29,690
but also it's taking resources away from other public health programs and specifically with respect to cities.

42
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:46,370
And this talks also we'll talk a little bit more about this, that the link between HIV and STIs, it has been highlighted in many different situations.

43
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,450
In settings, we talk about the sort of biologic making the mechanism of that.

44
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:59,900
But this as with antibiotic resistance, this kind of highlights how important STIs are in this country.

45
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,520
This shows some of the more common STIs and.

46
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:21,770
The incidence and prevalence. We see that HPV is the most prevalent STI and herpes simplex virus.

47
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:30,680
Also HIV prevalence. And this also highlights the fact that the dark green is the prevalence later in the

48
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,770
incidence highlights the fact that many of these diseases like HPV are chronic.

49
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:46,490
And that's why the prevalence rate is much higher than compliance, as opposed to something like gonorrhea here, which is more acute.

50
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,380
And therefore the incidence was higher than the prevalence.

51
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:03,219
So there is, you know, roughly 30 different bacteria,

52
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:13,720
viruses and parasites that cause STIs are important pathogens and in the context of SDI disease burden.

53
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:22,720
And this also highlights the fact that there are of those eight common, four of them are treatable.

54
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,810
They're bacteria, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, chicken, lotus.

55
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,670
And for them, all viruses don't have any treatment.

56
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:43,350
So it's important to note what we mean by sexual contact defined as vaginal, anal or oral.

57
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:55,290
These you know, these treatable and curable SDI is account for 340 million new infections every year.

58
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:06,660
And then. Also to emphasize the fact that we have a variety of different pathogens monkeypox, shigella.

59
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:15,330
A lot of interrogate, actually, in which sexual contact are associated with close contact.

60
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,839
So a lot of these diseases are now being considered sexually associated diseases

61
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,430
as opposed to sexually transmitted diseases because of the close contact,

62
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:37,870
which is which is resulted in the transmission. And so again, sexual contact occurs through vaginal oral or anal intercourse.

63
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,180
And so it's classified as a directly transmitted disease.

64
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:49,190
And as different pathogens are spread these different rabid they're spread through different.

65
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:59,760
Means either sexual fluid. It can be through blood or through your genital skin to skin contact.

66
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:08,550
And then there's some messages that can be transmitted from other child that are also important to consider.

67
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:22,679
So one of the big distinctions and important concepts to really be aware of is, is this idea of core theory of SDI transmission,

68
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:30,870
this idea because SDI transmission is all about social structure and who is in

69
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:37,790
sexual contact with who is bored and understand that social structure and so on.

70
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,570
Back in the late seventies, head of code developed this theory,

71
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:51,480
core theory that's really been used extensively to think about how to target control of SDI.

72
00:10:52,350 --> 00:11:03,390
And this came about with in the late seventies when Hasbro observed that generally 2% of the population in the U.S. had gonorrhea.

73
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:11,020
But have you assumed homogeneous transmission like we do for measles,

74
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,930
likely due for COVID and many other parts from directly transmitting pathogens or

75
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:23,350
where we just this homogeneous assumption of transmission actually works quite well.

76
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:31,150
You would expect a much higher prevalence of gonorrhea than you see in the U.S.

77
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,710
The second observation he made was that some people have more sexual partners in others,

78
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:48,000
and that heterogeneous, heterogeneous transmission really is what accounts for the transmission dynamics.

79
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:58,120
So the idea is that there's a core group of high risk individuals and a non-core group of low risk individuals.

80
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,130
And if you just divide the population in those two categories,

81
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:10,450
you can now have a model that much better predicts the prevalence of gonorrhea in the US.

82
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:25,800
And so the idea is that. This small group of high risk individuals can actually sustain transmission and intensity in the population as a whole.

83
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:33,390
But if this core group didn't exist, there'd be no the non-core group doesn't have.

84
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:44,100
Enough transmission risk to actually sustain sustained transmission of of of gonorrhea in this example, and the disease would die out.

85
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:56,970
So this is an important concept that how a core group of people, our core group can actually sustain transmission in a population at large.

86
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:06,660
Without that core group, the population that the disease would be eradicated so or eliminated.

87
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,910
So in that data,

88
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:20,670
to look at this in a little bit more detail and the way in which have code developed this concept was the idea that there was a core high risk group,

89
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,630
which was a small percentage of the population in this case, let's say, let's say 2%.

90
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,960
And a non-core group which comprised of.

91
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:43,790
A large segment of the population 98% and they're assumed to be mixing between and in this case will define what proportion mixing means.

92
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:53,260
This is. One step towards better modeling what's happening in these communities.

93
00:13:53,710 --> 00:14:01,120
And so the idea is that in the core group are not as greater than one in the non core group are not is less than one.

94
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,520
So if there is no mixing here.

95
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:12,920
The disease would die out in the non-core group and the disease would be maintained in the core group, but they were socially distinct.

96
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:18,680
We'd have a very small group in which you'd have transmission, and the large group there wasn't.

97
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:26,210
But if you had this proportionate mixing, then disease is actually sustained in this non core group.

98
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:36,690
And so the idea here with proportion mixing is this assumption that the number of encounters between these two groups,

99
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:42,920
individuals in these two groups, is proportional to the relative sexual activity in these two groups.

100
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,790
Again, this core group is defined as a high risk group that has higher.

101
00:14:50,150 --> 00:15:04,370
Sexual activity that in the non. What this suggests is that intervening in 98% of the population is going to do little in controlling

102
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:10,940
transmission that you really want to focus your resources on this small 2% of the population.

103
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:19,720
And so this is really the beginning of thinking about social networks as a way to understand transmission.

104
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,370
Nowadays, people are using and really developing.

105
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:32,319
And we'll look at a few examples where people are actually mapping out the social networks and the

106
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:40,090
sexual networks of different populations to understand who essentially and understand who is the core,

107
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:49,060
who is the have, who is this, who are who are the individuals or groups that are really driving transmission?

108
00:15:51,670 --> 00:16:05,560
So just to go a little further in defining what proportional mixing is, which is really the most common used model mixing model in the literature.

109
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:15,730
So if you look at the literature and see how groups are and researchers are modeling transmission in size,

110
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,480
they're going to most likely be using this proportional mixing model.

111
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:27,550
And again, it assumes that the number of encounters between two groups is proportional to their relative sexual activities.

112
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,610
So here's the basic equation of the mixing model.

113
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:43,880
The idea is that and is the population size of group by an A is the contact rate that

114
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:53,370
grew by so eight times and is a total number of encounters per time in this one group.

115
00:16:53,380 --> 00:17:03,030
I. And so if you look at all the groups that you've identified in the previous example in the car,

116
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:08,960
we're just talking about two groups, core and non-core. But you can have as many groups that you think are important.

117
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:15,840
And then some models you see you see some models looking at three groups or even as many as eight groups.

118
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:24,420
The denominator is just the total amount of sexual activity or encounters across all the groups.

119
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:35,550
So that this is really just the proportion of sex sexual encounters that are occurring in Group II relative to the all the groups.

120
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:46,000
So this B is basically this mixing parameter that is used in these transmission models.

121
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:55,570
So, so if we have beta, which is our transmission rate, we talk about beta again being a having a social factor.

122
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:04,059
That is contact rate and this is how we're defining it and a biological factor.

123
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:14,550
That's infectivity. We see that we've got the infectivity of Group I, the biological factor representative.

124
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:23,050
Q And then we have the social factor, the contact rate of group by representatives A and B is this mixing parameter that.

125
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:36,220
Yeah. That describes the. The social rate, the contact rate between group activity.

126
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,260
So it defines how much between group encounters there's going to be.

127
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:49,660
Again, if the between group encounters is zero, then you've got two independent transmission phenomena happening.

128
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:57,700
And the way we constructed it that the non core group doesn't have enough contact to sustain transmission in the core group does.

129
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:04,040
But as this data i j represents b you know,

130
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:11,350
the amount of mixing that's occurring between the core group and the nonprofit group and

131
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:18,430
that mixing is defined by this B decreasing to be as defined by this information here.

132
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:30,340
So this is the crux of. The math that's used in when you look at STD models, STI models out there in the literature,

133
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:40,600
they're always they're often going to incorporate mixing and some sort of either a core noncore or divided even into multiple risk groups.

134
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:47,710
This is the basic math that's going to be used to modify the transmission rate parameter.

135
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:55,120
So again, the transmission rate parameter that we've always talked about as this sub pushed the contact rate in this infectivity.

136
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:01,420
And when we're talking about mixing among groups, we're going to add this one other factor.

137
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:19,120
This mixing factor. So here's some just a few examples where here this paper highlights the fact that time and

138
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:25,150
place are both important factors in identifying the core groups in a syphilis outbreak.

139
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:40,749
So here we see different clusters. This cluster here is defined as the core group in this in this analysis where a relative risk of 4.56

140
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:49,000
and we see that this has has high risk occurring throughout this observation period from 1985 to 2007.

141
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:54,700
There's some small groups here with higher relative risks for shorter periods of time.

142
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,410
So they may act as a core for that short period of time.

143
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,460
And we see some larger groups here with much, much lower group.

144
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:11,800
So this this could be defined as your non core group in this residential in this area in which it's

145
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:17,650
really the interaction between some of these other groups that would sustain transmission here.

146
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:28,810
So again, identifying cases, intervening in a non core segment of the population is not going to do a whole lot with respect to addressing.

147
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:37,079
Transmission, whereas focusing on some of these high risk groups, even this this one here.

148
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:44,879
But you know, we did focus that on intervening between these years would have a much huge,

149
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,660
huge, huge impact on the transmission of syphilis in this whole region.

150
00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:04,060
Again motivating this idea that targeted intervention is going to be much more efficient when various heterogeneous activities in communities.

151
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:18,290
And this is another example, gonorrhea outbreak example, where they did much more extensive social networking surveys to identify that black box.

152
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:24,230
Here is a bar. These black circles are people that attended this bar.

153
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,580
And then and this is considered the core group here.

154
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,510
And all the cases from this outbreak were.

155
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:41,670
Came about through contacts of people that attended this bar with the other people that had not attended this bar.

156
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:53,309
So, again, this is a much more, you know, example of the way in which outbreak investigations see the importance of this kind of

157
00:22:53,310 --> 00:23:00,660
contact tracing to identify these networks occurring that occurred during this outbreak.

158
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:10,260
And so this is done very extensively in health departments or investigating SETI outbreaks.

159
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:21,889
So the other idea. So we've talked about the idea that there is high risk individuals and there's low risk individuals,

160
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:28,040
that there's groups that are our core groups that have high risk behavior.

161
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:35,610
But the important thing to realize is that sexual behavior is not static,

162
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:44,070
that somebody may be exhibiting high risk behavior in one part of their life or in certain times and not in others.

163
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:50,970
And so this study here highlighted the dynamic nature of behavior.

164
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:58,110
In analyzing this cohort study of 750 men in Amsterdam in the mid-eighties.

165
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,720
And so men were stratified into different risk groups.

166
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,220
Any other behavior with respect to anal intercourse.

167
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:21,440
And this is some of the data that was collected and analyzed with respect to these different groups.

168
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:29,650
So one thing to note is that the low risk group, which is group one, no anal intercourse increases over time,

169
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:35,379
that the percentage of individuals in the lower risk group increases,

170
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,780
while that percent of individuals in the high risk group group four decreases over time.

171
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:51,160
And so the percent abstaining from intercourse in Group one increases from 12 to 49% over this observation period.

172
00:24:53,190 --> 00:25:00,809
So that is that is sort of this is really a static snapshot of risk added at different collection cycles,

173
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:09,720
which is promising that we're seeing this move in this low risk, higher percentage of people in a slower interaction.

174
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:16,059
But what this plot hides is the fact that men are continuously moving from

175
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:22,720
one risk group to another and therefore a much higher percentage of men have,

176
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:29,760
you know. Partook in high risk behavior at some point in during this time period.

177
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:38,840
And so this study analyzed the data using what's called the markup chain model.

178
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:50,060
It's basically similar to a data transmission model dynamic, but it's focusing just on behavior.

179
00:25:50,390 --> 00:26:01,030
The idea is that there's four states. Corresponding to the four risk categories that were defined in the previous slide.

180
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:12,639
And what we can do is what the analysis has done is look at the probability that somebody stays, let's say, in this low risk group.

181
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:22,330
And that was 70, 73% of the people from one time period to a next remain in this state.

182
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,700
Lower estate. And then you can also look at the probability of entering the state.

183
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:33,920
And that is people can be entering the state from any one of these other states.

184
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,640
So it's basically 79% are entering the state.

185
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,360
That's 2.3 plus 2.17 plus 2.3.

186
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:50,210
And then likewise, you can look at the probability of leaving the state. And so using these data, using this model,

187
00:26:51,890 --> 00:27:04,790
the authors here were able to get at this the dynamics of risk behavior during this observation period from 1984 to 1988.

188
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:11,390
And so the expected length of stay in the low risk group was 22 months.

189
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,210
And in the high risk group was 14 months.

190
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:25,399
So highlighting again that no one few people actually stayed are only a small proportion of the population actually stayed in,

191
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,030
let's say a low risk or a high risk group during that whole observation period.

192
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:44,210
So that this again highlights the fact that even if at any given time, only 10% of the population is at high risk group,

193
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,170
much higher percentages are in the high risk group at some point of time.

194
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:58,520
And so often when you look at transmission models, they're assuming that the dynamics of the transmission is.

195
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:06,959
The transfer transmission is dynamic, but they often assume that his risk factor behavior is static.

196
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:14,160
And this was a nice illustration of how that can be misleading if you if you don't.

197
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:22,810
Consider the fact that that respect behavior is going to be dynamic and depend on a lot on context.

198
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:30,830
So. And these markup models can be applied to a lot of risk behavior.

199
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:37,760
And I think there is a this risk behavior is true not just for SGI, but also of many different.

200
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:50,820
Infectious diseases. You know, to the extent people drink water, that gets uncontaminated.

201
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:57,810
It's not a constant. Like depending on the situation, depending on drought situations and access and dispatch is going to change over time.

202
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,980
And so the dynamics of that are going to be are important to consider.

203
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:17,590
So so this is going to just just to go through a little bit in the three common treatable stages that I mentioned before,

204
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:24,900
chlamydia being one which has often, again, asymptomatic.

205
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:32,950
That's a theme of a lot of these guys is they are asymptomatic for much of the time and that makes control very difficult.

206
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,580
Tourism is another one that is often asymptomatic, especially in males.

207
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:49,400
A lot of these diseases are the issues are committed and the complications are connected to infertility.

208
00:29:49,880 --> 00:30:02,780
They're also connected to pregnancy outcomes in gonorrhea, also, again, often asymptomatic, making control of very difficult.

209
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:13,120
And why? There's a lot of screening programs out there to try and catch asymptomatic and treat them to decrease duration of infection and disease.

210
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:22,640
Gonorrhea. I think we mentioned this. I mentioned this last week or Monday when we talked about antibiotic resistance.

211
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:29,720
One of the issues raise in developing resistance to antibiotics that we used to treat and we're down to,

212
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:38,750
you know, with this sort of inadequate one recommended treatment option is remaining with gonorrhea.

213
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:48,830
So it's becoming a huge issue with respect to our one most important way in which we can control gonorrhea is through screening and then treating.

214
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,710
So antibiotic resistance is is linked heavily into with gonorrhea.

215
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:10,380
Syphilis, highly treatable, highly infectious, and also can go undetected as a lot of symptoms are open sores and rashes,

216
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:18,540
but has can have a lot of significant serious issues if it's not treated.

217
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:27,780
And so syphilis is an interesting disease because it's had a long history, a long history of stigma.

218
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:33,870
Back in the 15th century, every country was naming it the disease of another country.

219
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:39,030
So the Russians called it the Polish disease, the Polish the German disease, the term Christian disease.

220
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:44,880
It was a very highly visible disease with a lot of stigma.

221
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:58,540
The 1940s is when penicillin, which was used and is still used to control syphilis, became an important part of decreasing syphilis.

222
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:08,530
Disease burden worldwide. So we saw this major drop between 1940 and 2000.

223
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,770
Since then, we've seen a huge rise in syphilis.

224
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:24,310
Here's this schematic from just the 2000 and early, from 2000 to 2020, and another data from this increase, 2017 to 2021.

225
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:33,130
And it's been recently, recently seen in the press just that the skyrocketing cases of syphilis since COVID.

226
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:40,009
And so I'm going to play just a few minutes of this NPR piece,

227
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:48,740
because I think it's really interesting just to think about a disease that most people think like,

228
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,760
is this all disease that happened during the plague?

229
00:32:52,790 --> 00:33:02,809
Time is just not an issue right now. And you can understand that the importance of syphilis right now and obviously,

230
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:08,060
if this were in 1999, federal health officials made a statement about syphilis.

231
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:14,090
It was so rare then that they thought it could be completely eliminated by 2005.

232
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:22,730
Now, in 2021, public health workers say they are seeing a disturbing number of babies born with and even dying from syphilis.

233
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,090
So what happened? With us now is Caroline Chen.

234
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:32,550
Caroline covers health care for ProPublica and she's been reporting on this rise in syphilis infections in the U.S.

235
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,640
Good morning, Caroline. Hi. Good morning.

236
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:46,459
So a lot of people hear syphilis, myself included, and think this is a disease that was a problem a long time ago and yet it is a problem in 2021.

237
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,620
What's going on? Yeah.

238
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:56,150
So a lot of people think that this is ancient history, but in fact it's a sexually transmitted disease that is still going around the U.S. today.

239
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:03,650
Symptoms can be mild like a rash, but it can also progress and eventually cause blindness or even dementia.

240
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,790
Now, if a woman is pregnant, the infection can be passed to the fetus.

241
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:15,740
And unfortunately, without treatment, up to 40% of those pregnancies can end in miscarriage, stillbirth or early infant death.

242
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,120
Syphilis is treatable, though, right? Yes, that's right.

243
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:26,299
It can be cured with penicillin and during pregnancy, so long as patients are treated within 30 days of delivery.

244
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:33,260
The baby should be fine. If it's treatable, if it's preventable, if it's a thing we know how to avoid, why are cases going up?

245
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:41,150
So studies are rising across the board in the U.S. and there are a lot of factors at play like meth use that

246
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:47,120
can lead to risky behaviors like unprotected sex and some patients who don't have access to health care.

247
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,640
But also, public health really hasn't had enough resources to stop the spread.

248
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:59,420
Okay. So you've been looking at how some public health departments are responding to this increase in cases in particular.

249
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:03,110
You've been looking at Fresno County, California. Tell us about Fresno County.

250
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:08,420
What's going on there? So in Fresno has had some of the highest rates of congenital syphilis in the state.

251
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,800
In 2017, more than 60 babies were born with it.

252
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,070
Since then, they've been focused on getting those cases down.

253
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:24,110
I spent some time with my name and work at Fresno County Department of Public Health, and my role here is communicable disease specialist.

254
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:33,019
It's her job to track down patient groups. So the rest of it is like a seven minute video, and I encourage you to listen to the rest.

255
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:40,639
But it goes into this one case, this one person who has very minimal access to health care.

256
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:48,320
And she's she's testing positive and just what it takes for that person to actually wind up going and getting treated.

257
00:35:48,890 --> 00:36:01,129
This is a lot of work. And the fact that the fact that there's just not a lot of resources in tracking down these people in which,

258
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:04,490
you know, again, it's being highly asymptomatic is an issue.

259
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:10,610
And the fact that people don't have access to health care is an issue.

260
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:20,060
And all of those translate into the fact that you've got a treatable and preventable disease that is skyrocketing in incidence.

261
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:26,000
So it's a it's a nice piece. It's very easy to listen to the whole thing.

262
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:35,150
It's only 7 minutes long. And again, highlights why we're in this crisis, syphilis crisis right now in the U.S.

263
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:52,420
So then there's the group of non treatable guys like herpes, which is, is a disease that can remain active,

264
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:59,800
active infection for life in the nerve cells and then it can reactivate periodically.

265
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,720
And so again, no known cure.

266
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:08,080
And there are certain antivirals that can be used to help.

267
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:18,450
Suppress reactivation. Prevalence around 20% in the US.

268
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,390
Again, these are highly asymptomatic and a lot of people don't even know that they have it.

269
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:32,760
HPV. Also, another important virus is not treatable, but this is one that we do have now a vaccine for.

270
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:41,550
The main importance of this pathogen is that it has been linked to cervical cancer.

271
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:59,160
So that so the whole the whole vaccine schedule is really targeting protecting women from advancing to cervical cancer.

272
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:15,840
HIV also is a virus that during the pandemic experienced the epidemic of HIV, killed a lot of people.

273
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:26,969
HIV is now is considered a chronic disease, given the fact that now we have medication to control and prevent serious disease from developing,

274
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,270
even if it can't eliminate the virus itself.

275
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:36,419
So there's three main stages of HIV. The first stage is this acute infection stage.

276
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:46,559
When individuals are very contagious, they've got various, you know, again, a lot of them broad spectrum symptoms.

277
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:53,040
So during this most contagious period. Individuals may not actually know that they have HIV.

278
00:38:55,110 --> 00:39:03,330
There's the chronic infection state where the virus will tend to go into a more latent state.

279
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:10,560
This is when people are generally asymptomatic, and that's going to occur for years or a decade.

280
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:26,400
And then the third stage is, at some point when the virus diminishes your CD4 count, you can develop a acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

281
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:33,660
And you're usually people die of a disease that's associated with being immuno compromised.

282
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,120
And there's there's a list of there's always there's been this list of AIDS

283
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:46,290
defining illnesses that are associated with the HIV in developing countries.

284
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:59,370
TB is often that in the U.S. settings, it's often a lot of these rare, rare diseases like Pneumocystis County that are and are the cause of death.

285
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,030
At this point, it's those that aren't getting treated that wind up dying of AIDS.

286
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:17,780
So it's problem still a huge issue in the US with respect to prevalence incidence.

287
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:34,630
But 111 thing that's actually a hindrance is the fact that those with that CD have 2.5 times increased risk of having of being infected with HIV.

288
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:45,710
And so there's a number of mechanisms that are being put forth with respect to how it increases susceptibility,

289
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:52,249
having an SD and how it increases contagiousness in both cases.

290
00:40:52,250 --> 00:41:03,500
So in one case, it's resulting in the fact that having lesions or ulcers can make it easier for the virus to find that somebody.

291
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:12,110
But it also can lead to increased shedding of HIV and therefore increase the contagiousness.

292
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:17,870
So there is this important link between other STDs and HIV risk.

293
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:29,020
And so SGI control is now become a part of HIV control.

294
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,620
So. And again, just to emphasize here.

295
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:41,550
So from from about how. Perspective.

296
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:47,190
One of the main issues is that guys are asymptomatic, many of them symptomatic,

297
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:53,430
meaning that can mean that a lot of transmission can occur without individuals even knowing that they're infected.

298
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:59,970
And that's an important aspect to be appreciate when thinking about mitigation.

299
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,180
Majority of new studies are in people under 25. It's also a big, important aspect.

300
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:13,560
There's been a lot of outbreak investigations of outbreaks occurring in high school age kids,

301
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:20,160
and there's a lot of research on the sexual networks that are among those kids.

302
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:25,650
And studies adversely affect reproductive health.

303
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:36,630
And thinking about the different risk factors for SETI, as many of you know, again,

304
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:41,969
occur with respect to insufficient screenings of this has this implicates our public health

305
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:52,080
system confidentiality concerns with respect also an important part of how we investigate STIs.

306
00:42:52,080 --> 00:43:00,660
And I've talked about this extensively there are biological factors where.

307
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:11,760
Women's bodies are biologically more settled. STIs limit their health care access, which is a word that in the NPR piece emphasized,

308
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:21,690
and this idea of multiple sex partners being an important risk increased SETI read SETI transmissions.

309
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:25,800
So, you know, having more.

310
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,850
It's not just the amount of sexual encounters you have,

311
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:37,290
an amount of sexual encounters you have with different people will dictate the kinds of risks that

312
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:43,710
are going to be associated with and the transmission risks associated with outbreaks and such.

313
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:52,020
So. SDI is our preventable and or.

314
00:43:53,120 --> 00:44:00,230
Treatable. And there's a lot of ways, recommended ways with respect to prevention of infection.

315
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:08,350
This is a statistic. Statistics that so many people use condoms for the first time, they have sex.

316
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:14,200
But then when asked about the last time, last four weeks, less than a quarter said every time.

317
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:18,100
So the consistent use of protection is important.

318
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:21,880
Fewer partners, as we mentioned, vaccinated when appropriate.

319
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:31,600
And, you know, communication amongst partners and in screening and treatment becoming the other essential piece of this,

320
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:37,660
especially in the context of having the fact that we have a lot of asymptomatic transmission in.

321
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:45,110
With these SDI. So.

322
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:53,980
With that. Needless to.

323
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:06,410
Especially the question that just basically wanted all the groups to think about the unique.

324
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:12,950
Features of cities that that I covered during this lecture.

325
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:18,380
So and think about that in the context of mitigation strategies.

326
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:25,600
So given these unique features, describe approaches you believe would be most effective, and what are the challenges that you might encounter?

327
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:38,050
So some of the unique features that we talked about were this idea that there are or groups that drive transmission into non-poor or lowest groups.

328
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:46,190
And that obviously has implications with respect to how we develop intervention and control strategies.

329
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:57,500
The fact that risk factor B risk behavior is dynamic and not static, the fact that a large proportion of individuals are asymptomatic,

330
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:08,780
the fact that this STIs are stigmatized disease, and the fact that some are treatable and some are not.

331
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:15,980
So these are just some examples of unique features you may in your group come up with other ones.

332
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:22,910
But these are the ones that I try to emphasize in the. Slide deck and the lecture today.

333
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:27,090
So. Any questions?

334
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:43,870
Okay. So very carefully group's presence here.

335
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:54,890
So, yeah, we're like any other.

336
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:58,310
Yeah. That's been like no other.

337
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:23,989
It doesn't matter what they can increase their like everybody's like making like, oh, I said so it's not like yeah.

338
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:38,800
Because like, that's why you are doing it all. But we don't talk about not, you know, it's not just like you can't possibly have one.

339
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:41,930
So yes. Like for just one, it's 200.

340
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:47,540
Yeah, yeah, I know what that's like.

341
00:47:47,780 --> 00:48:04,460
I think it's all right you for joining us.

342
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:08,989
I appreciate that. All right.

343
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:15,220
Well, these are like 40 years old. Do you have children?

344
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:20,690
Yeah. So how do you think about it?

345
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:28,669
A little bit. So that you can, you know, just friends.

346
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:37,000
And this is between you and your wife. It's just, you know, the greatest thing.

347
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:45,380
So even if it's not like, say, like sex, that's not true.

348
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:50,600
That's like sex. And of course.

349
00:48:50,780 --> 00:49:01,069
Yeah, that's that's not that's not what you want to do.

350
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:06,590
You know exactly how much you slice in China, therefore restrictive about all that stuff.

351
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:17,020
Like less access is only possible inside the heart of a lot of talk.

352
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:28,790
Exactly what we're talking about like they just disagree about using which told.

353
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:33,440
But as we all know, it's still happening here.

354
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:43,009
But you know, anyone noticing like in this case,

355
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:59,150
well educated population speech but we don't really understand them all their time before we just need to vaccinate.

356
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:11,750
Yeah. Bias shooter or something like that.

357
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:24,290
Yeah. I think like generally but you know the word for which like.

358
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:51,030
Patients don't want to talk about that one last time around.

359
00:50:51,560 --> 00:51:02,780
So I think a lot of that, you know, I don't know the difference. Maybe my sex in general is sort of like this phenomenon I'm talking about.

360
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:09,210
Obviously, it's a family.

361
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:22,820
And then I'll talk about how I think we can help stop number two look like.

362
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:35,870
And I don't think the lines between like, you know, I think I'm kind of, you know,

363
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:51,830
another person who maybe some people think makes do which is very individualized thing.

364
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:59,870
I completely agree with you know, we're going to be like, oh, where going try to use condoms and people who are like,

365
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:13,690
why do you consider yourself so yeah you probably it was just like that and like especially given like myself I think maybe like,

366
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:30,140
like I was trying to tell you we also have to get used to, you know, it's a very much like I said,

367
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:58,220
you're probably going to say, well, yeah, know it's like they're not brain tumors and also think that I think like that.

368
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:28,090
But that's all there is. I mean, want you to know that I love this is your husband.

369
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:44,000
So, you know, it was like, you know, I feel like that's what it was going to tell you last night.

370
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:49,520
There was nothing like that.

371
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:57,070
You know, that that's an up and coming as well as well.

372
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:00,409
It's just like, what did she just bring it back to?

373
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:03,580
That was yesterday.

374
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:40,680
I just I think my friend is my mom and I was like, I think they were just like, you know, you know.

375
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:57,070
Oh, that's true. I mean, like, my, you know, my only point.

376
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:24,920
I don't know that there's a reason I was like, okay, I just I just think that if we do that.

377
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:44,240
At least we didn't have like a rock star.

378
00:55:47,270 --> 00:56:06,430
I think sometimes, you know, the right time for the most complicated, though, there now is just a much higher up there.

379
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:22,969
If you have and I don't know how long it's going to be until the most probably you would know either way for a lot of these are the Garron screenings,

380
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:26,840
right? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my God. It's very interesting.

381
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:35,140
After 33 hours, I don't know.

382
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,950
Gonorrhea. Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

383
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:44,480
I got somebody. I don't know which ones they even like.

384
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:51,790
I guess it'll be nice to experience each other.

385
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:56,059
Like, you know, they do.

386
00:56:56,060 --> 00:57:02,060
They actually got to be costars.

387
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:20,060
Yeah, that's only because the last one I got, this one isn't really a lot of changes me together through my baby Jesus.

388
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:26,840
But I think the heart is like you can never tell who was.

389
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:37,399
Some diseases are on women every single time.

390
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:51,080
So I guess you know what it is by chance.

391
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,380
Yeah. I mean, like I.

392
00:57:54,650 --> 00:58:05,330
Yeah. And that's something we've all had a relationship, you and I just yesterday.

393
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:22,160
I just want to say that.

394
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:39,589
I mean, I'm sorry. I didn't know it happened, you know?

395
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:56,390
And they're like, Oh, my God, I can't I can't wait to hear from my brothers.

396
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:00,750
And it wasn't like, yeah, I'm.

397
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:05,990
I'm not gonna live.

398
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:16,880
Where does that change everything? I need to go to the right place.

399
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:26,180
And I was like, Oh, it's like Illinois.

400
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,220
You said it was clear you guys are missing here now.

401
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:46,520
I think they seemed like most things like that, it's like, I don't know,

402
00:59:48,200 --> 01:00:06,739
like it's just not they probably haven't gotten to know, you know, you're going to get their favorite.

403
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:26,270
Did you find out where?

404
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:35,050
I think all I can say is, like I.

405
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:45,470
I did my baby the way I was playing with my baby.

406
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:57,410
How do you know that? I'm sure there's a much in this exercise near autism,

407
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:13,500
which is really a celebration of the fact that whereas you be writing something like that because I was writing, I was out of.

408
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:43,430
Is there anything we can you know, it seems like I was like, let's start recording Black Features, starting with seven months.

409
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:55,390
I can do it. I got it. I was trying to get clean to do it.

410
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:04,600
Sorry. Okay. So what we talked about for most effective mitigation strategies were specifically the barrier method.

411
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:09,880
So condoms and other forms of protection like that for most effective.

412
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:15,819
It was kind of like, you know, the papers and they're talking about like also like pre-exposure prophylaxis as well as vaccination.

413
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:20,980
But there's not necessarily vaccination for the majority of the sexually transmitted infections.

414
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:30,610
And also talking about comprehensive testing and campaigning like information campaign to talk to the public and kind of explain,

415
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:34,450
I know it's not going to necessarily reach everyone but reach some people.

416
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:39,759
And then the challenges and current that we would encounter through this would be specifically

417
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:47,049
like stigma and using condoms and specifically in monogamous couples and then embarrassment

418
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:51,940
that some would have if there's potential cheating to kind of explain why you would use that

419
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:59,530
as well as the cost and kind of inconvenience for the barriers and and testing as well.

420
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:05,890
And then like the cognitive dissonance and like, you know, you could be infected.

421
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:10,690
We don't want to get tested because you don't want to know that you're positive because you don't want to have that stigma around yourself.

422
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:12,770
So that's kind of what we talked about, right?

423
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:22,570
I mean, so, yes, stigma, communication are huge issues, both between partners, but also between people and.

424
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:30,190
Public health. So like there is one thing to do ongoing have ongoing sort of everyone doing.

425
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:38,030
You know, low risk behavior. Another is to identify when transmission is occurring and really sort of.

426
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:44,370
Working hard and doubling down on trying to. Got that transmission down.

427
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:50,110
And so communication is going to be critical in both levels that ultimately.

428
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:57,040
Six. Yeah.

429
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:01,430
So we kind of broke it down a little bit differently and like approach and

430
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:08,389
challenges for each of the numbers for approach for like core nine for dynamics.

431
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:17,150
We talked about intervention specific to high school and college aged kids for like more in the high risk demographic and

432
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:26,270
challenges like pushback from parents of high schoolers and the lack of sexual education and abstinence only education,

433
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:32,930
that's a lot in high schools. And then another one we talked about is taking risky behaviors.

434
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:38,719
Approaches for that would be increased education on same sex practices increases

435
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:43,550
harm reduction practices to help mitigate the effects of risky sexual behaviors.

436
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:52,860
And some challenges could be people participating in risky sexual behaviors may be less likely to seek care and education,

437
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:58,400
kind of like groups seven talked about. And the population may just be harder to reach,

438
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:06,200
maybe because they don't have access in the first place and they are worried about finding out their status.

439
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:13,979
Yeah. Dealing with younger and younger ages are increasingly challenging.

440
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:23,790
Both groups under age kids that have parental oversight and guardianship become makes a lot of that just amplifies all that communication.

441
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:32,880
Barriers and issues. A group for.

442
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:42,530
So we were thinking that I missed group focus.

443
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:50,120
Group focus. So, yes, we had a group five after.

444
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:59,870
Okay. Yeah. All right. So we were saying that some of the best ways kind of like what they they were kind of saying that target a targeted

445
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:05,839
education is a good mitigation strategy because a lot of sexual behaviors are highly individualized behaviors.

446
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,430
And so it's really important to.

447
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:13,380
On an individual level, I'll be able to sort of give different options as to what you can do for your sexual behaviors.

448
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:21,930
That being said, a lot of the challenges that you're talking about were mainly what we talked about a couple of different like cultural challenges,

449
01:06:21,930 --> 01:06:25,290
like the shunning of LGBTQ groups in certain cultures.

450
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:30,000
There's different interpretations of sex within and outside of marriage.

451
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,120
And so some people will say, like, yes, I've had sex, but no,

452
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:37,320
I haven't had sex because it was really like with my wife, you know, like it's just something different.

453
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:43,860
And then also, Rosanna brought up a great point about how some cultures or some languages don't really have a word for rape.

454
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:52,200
And so if you don't really have a word for that, you maybe don't have a way to combat it or be able to express it.

455
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:59,640
We also were saying that there's just been a long standing stigma of sex and not being able to talk about it in any way, shape or form.

456
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:06,819
We also kind of talked about how some of the challenges are with not being honest

457
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:11,709
and not disclosing to your partner how many partners you have yourself or perhaps,

458
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:18,580
you know, your engagement with sex workers that you could bring back to a different partner again, like your long term partner.

459
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:30,339
So a lot of it really comes from those individual kind of behaviors that there's stigma, there's culture, all stigma, there's just disclosure issues,

460
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:37,240
and there's all kinds of different things that affect your ability to actually be able to prevent infection in certain populations.

461
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:44,950
And the stigma kind of amplifies all of the problems we've been talking about along with public health.

462
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:51,080
But you talk about. If at the individual level of behaviors.

463
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:57,110
But then there is this there's more structural issues that kind of.

464
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:07,270
Feed into why people have those individual behaviors, which, as you mentioned, can be cultural, can be political things.

465
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:11,380
Yeah. Like it has a lot to do with the context that you're like if you're I don't know.

466
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:16,990
It depends on like what your family teaches you, what your religion teaches you, what your state teaches you.

467
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:20,020
So it's very difficult.

468
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:29,110
It's like a really intertwined web of like individual stuff or that you know yourself and that the other entities are kind of pushing on you.

469
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:37,210
So what about how were you as a public health, somebody in in a public health unit that's trying to.

470
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:43,490
Addressing transmission in an outbreak, how you would tackle all those issues.

471
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:50,700
So that's the hard part, is that like I think the best thing that we could come up with were those like finding those core groups

472
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:55,349
and being able to talk to them from being able to outreach to them and provide them with resources,

473
01:08:55,350 --> 01:09:00,660
provide them with testing, provide them with education, because it's just difficult.

474
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:03,990
I think that's just something that the individual has to take upon themselves at some point.

475
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:09,960
That was kind of the best solution we could come up with. I'll add on to that too.

476
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:17,590
So I actually have done some case investigations with like interior illnesses like shigella and some that are sexually transmitted.

477
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:25,149
And so it's like that surveillance. And then you look into some behaviors that are popping up and then you can target the education towards that,

478
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:29,620
put funding towards that, and then get people testing and do the contact tracing with all of that.

479
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:33,460
So this some other things. Yeah, it's great.

480
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:41,830
And it does bring in to this idea of what I would control Souls lecture on and the idea that you really as a public health.

481
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:52,640
Official. You really want to understand what those cultural barriers are to best improve your messaging and improve

482
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:59,160
your ability to fully engage with the communities and understand what those kind of real constraints are.

483
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:09,210
I think what when we fail is when we have these blanketed kind of recommendations that don't ring true for a lot of people.

484
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:19,830
And it's, again, amplified here because it's such a stigmatized activity, but.

485
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:29,950
And a disease. But even for things like smoking, just to vilify people that it's smoke or bad is really not the way to actually get people that smoke.

486
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:48,760
So nutrition groups are very important in this fight and we didn't really have much more in the past.

487
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:54,370
The last three groups talked about and we had the same thing about like sexual education.

488
01:10:55,060 --> 01:11:00,430
We included increasing access to testing services and health care.

489
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:04,930
And we also talked about stigma a lot as a big challenge,

490
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:10,120
but we also talked about funding and resources that go along with sexual education

491
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:15,490
and increasing testing services on an already strained public health infrastructure.

492
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:26,230
So we have resources everywhere now we're trying to add more things to help some that might not work.

493
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:37,959
Um, those are our main things. The stigma attached to funding these kind of public health do these activities is huge.

494
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,930
And I brought that up at the beginning of the course,

495
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:48,680
but there was an article at the same time that we're Pfizer has developed this vaccine that can target how

496
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:56,500
homegrown we're pulling back from resource giving recent research public health services actually find.

497
01:11:57,510 --> 01:12:05,969
People that aren't vaccinated. And so that's a huge issue, that value issue.

498
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:16,530
And I know that we don't value this kind of boots on the ground work to really understand address and it's going to it's going to its huge in

499
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:28,740
cities and a lot explains a lot of why has that impact said you know emphasize that you've got a treatable preventable disease that is just.

500
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:39,290
Skyrocketing with respect to seniors right now and having these health workers are now able to address those.

501
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:51,469
Three. I let you go after me really quickly.

502
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:55,090
But one thing I do want to add to all this, this has been really great.

503
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,390
I love what everyone said.

504
01:12:56,810 --> 01:13:07,910
But I think also it's really important to consider that any time when we are looking at especially like behavior based risk mitigation with sex,

505
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:12,770
that we need to consider patriarchal sentiments that we might be dealing with,

506
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:21,589
like we need to address the elephant in the room and the fact that one of the other really, really difficult things to try to work with,

507
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:28,549
with any community is also like, what do you do if you do have these risk behaviors that you're promoting?

508
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:33,020
But the men ultimately are to say, no, we're not going to do this, which,

509
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:37,580
you know, gets into a lot of other really, really difficult topics to deal with.

510
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:43,009
You know, another thing, it's like I really love like the example with language.

511
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:50,059
When I was working in Madagascar, one of the things we did was the example there was that they had words for like menstruation in sex,

512
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:54,320
but they were actually negative. So the words for menstruation literally meant taboo of the month.

513
01:13:55,130 --> 01:14:01,310
And so but it's also not our right to walk into another like Eastern community and be like,

514
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:04,160
I'm a white American and I'm going to give you a new word to use.

515
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:08,659
But thankfully, there were Malagasy movements where they were creating their own words.

516
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:12,709
And so like. Empowering women is really important,

517
01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:20,120
but also trying to do it in a culturally non ethnocentric way is a really important thing to consider when we walk into these communities.

518
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:27,530
Yeah, that's a great point because I think empowering women are is is critical again across the board.

519
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:36,080
And so it's a huge issue in my area in water and sanitation now because they're dealing with water and sanitation activity.

520
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,310
So that's a great point. And it's kind of been.

521
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:46,430
Huge here. And it's. It's. It's. It's a slow process change.

522
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,870
I did a community mapping actually of my community and went to a little stand

523
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:55,669
and saw how many do have condoms and how many or they expired or unexpired.

524
01:14:55,670 --> 01:14:59,210
And that was also another really interesting take on the community mapping.

525
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,710
There was not a lot,

526
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:09,799
but was there energy like there was an area where you could see some are just it was just like there was some and this was like a really,

527
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:15,140
really, really rural community. So it was just like little would stands, but, you know, they had virtually everything.

528
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:21,800
But it was interesting to go to each one and just to even see like how much do people actually have access to condoms in this community.

529
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:27,080
And it was very low, especially when you considered like expired versus unexpired condoms.

530
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:33,469
Yeah. Which already says to if they're as many of them are expired, then people are also not buying them.

531
01:15:33,470 --> 01:15:37,520
Which also leads to people who run these stands do not want to order them.

532
01:15:38,150 --> 01:15:43,610
Right. So yeah. And this access and also desire to actually use it.

533
01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:47,680
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

534
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:52,969
And some other topics we discussed, so we don't think we've found too much though.

535
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:54,890
I was, you know, out of the room slightly at the beginning.

536
01:15:54,890 --> 01:16:06,080
So maybe we have as how age plays in especially to noncore group interventions given that a lot of interventions for especially non treatable

537
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:15,380
ACS really should happen fairly early in life like presumably before like debut of sexual activity so usually before age 16 if not earlier.

538
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:22,040
And how that really conflicts with like autonomy of the individuals receiving

539
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:26,600
that since children often don't have their own medical or educational autonomy.

540
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:34,429
So like how there needs to be more, you know, especially tailored education and just more education around STIs broadly,

541
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:41,959
like a lot of us know that HPV causes cervical cancer, but we don't talk about how like 60% of penile cancers are also caused by HPV.

542
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:46,250
A lot of people aren't aware that it can cause like oral and anal cancers as well.

543
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:51,499
And so having like tailored educational materials is really necessary.

544
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:55,910
But something we'll encounter is that a lot of people won't have access to that until they're

545
01:16:56,990 --> 01:17:02,000
adults because schools and even parents within schools can limit your access to that education.

546
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:08,180
Same way with vaccines, we really need, you know, HPV, HPV vaccines early.

547
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:15,200
And if we're considering how the meningitis vaccine can protect against gonorrhea, we probably want the meningitis vaccine quite early, too.

548
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:23,970
But. In a system where health care is quite expensive and a lot of adolescents don't have regular medical coverage,

549
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:26,670
like they're probably not going to get the reminders to get that vaccine.

550
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:29,969
Schools might not offer it and parents can limit what they have access to it.

551
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:37,560
So that's one big thing. Another thing is bias in like medical development and implementation in that,

552
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:42,960
you know, regular STI screening is really important, but a lot of medical providers.

553
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:51,840
Are not trained or might have the inclination to ask about sex in a way that would be appropriate to get proper testing like you might ask.

554
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:55,760
It's often Who do you have sex with? Do you have sex with men?

555
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:57,680
Do you have sex with women? La la, la.

556
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:03,990
But we don't talk about like, more importantly, which specific behaviors do you engage in and how which will dictate,

557
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:07,620
like what switch you take because there's a big bias in.

558
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:15,770
Especially just like, says heterosexual women, where it's assumed that they only need oral and vaginal swabs.

559
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:17,360
But anal swabs aren't conducted,

560
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:24,620
which can lead to an increase of like missing anal infections of S's and the migration of those STIs to vaginal infections.

561
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:32,750
And so, like. A lot of the times we don't test properly and sometimes we don't have tests for various parts of the bodies, which is.

562
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:42,089
Going to lead to a lot of missing. So especially in non core group dynamics like age and like medical accessibility is a big problem right now.

563
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:50,030
All great points. All sorts of all sorts of political and.

564
01:18:52,700 --> 01:19:02,150
Barriers to being able to actually implement these things that increasingly people are appreciating and actually.

565
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:06,900
Implementing them is just really harder and harder.

566
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:14,130
Things are getting more and more politicized, but certainly important points to be bringing up in.

567
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:19,940
As many settings as we can to try and actually change.

568
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:24,880
Thanks. And one more group.

569
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:29,019
Q Well, one thing that wasn't covered,

570
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:38,690
we talked a bit about post-infection interventions and for like the difference between treatable and untreatable STIs and the like,

571
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:44,530
more effective intervention interventions for treatable STIs might include like making antibiotics

572
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:49,000
and just like screening and health care more accessible to like high risk populations.

573
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:57,834
But like a challenge or concern with that could be like antibiotic resistance concerns with like overuse of antibiotics and then for untreatable.
