1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,969
So then he's coming to me. But it's not just, like, go home.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,220
And then [INAUDIBLE] just come by Saturday.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,730
And then he was like, Oh, I'm coming with you. And I was like, Yeah, sure.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,000
He was over it. Really?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,280
Like, I was like, everybody could probably hang out with the father, with Jimmy.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,810
And so. And then my friend called. I never run off like a talking like I'm.

7
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,849
So he's like, Oh, yeah, you do this again.

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,420
It's really fine. But then I realized this is like ten boys now.

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,330
I was like, I need a friend, like, texting. How much can you please come in?

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,140
I'm like, Oh, yeah.

11
00:00:52,010 --> 00:01:02,520
So that was like, Oh, wow, you don't really like for, like, you know, like, just like this one time.

12
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:11,030
And I'm a little worried because, like, the building is full of all 2172 raging in there.

13
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,450
So it was like to work here, then we just leave, right?

14
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,870
Yeah. That's yeah. I get any side street.

15
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:24,780
Every house that I was traveling was like, Thank you.

16
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:33,180
And he was nearly with a one time or anything, but I don't think it'll be that long and I don't know how long this weekend,

17
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,659
but toys there she was just like has no you know, like it's totally it's like the right.

18
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:44,490
Care to tell her to join in? Yeah. She probably will just go and meet with some other people because I think she's going to the game too.

19
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,120
So if you think of, you know, to be respectful of your time and everybody that's here.

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:04,709
So good afternoon. You know, so we're talking about numbers today and we're planning on this.

21
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:13,410
And one of the things that I was curious about was cell phones and landlines and different phones that we all use,

22
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:25,380
but also more about the numbers we remember. So I'm curious, I'm going to ask each one of you people about how many numbers?

23
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,060
Phone numbers, literal area code plus seven digits.

24
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,980
Could you do you know by heart?

25
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:45,960
And the reason I'm asking, because all day I've been asking like a generational and the numbers has been shifting and it's hilarious.

26
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:52,920
But so how many phone numbers could if I asked you to write on a piece of paper without cheating in the phone and all that?

27
00:02:53,550 --> 00:03:01,720
Could you write down by memory. For 2 to 2 years.

28
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:16,030
Let me ask it differently. That's well for and is one of them parental uh, out of your for that matter.

29
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,870
Yeah. So parental you got in that for you got one. That's a one or two.

30
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,020
That's a parental. Okay. All right. Yeah. Mom and Dad's mom.

31
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:30,370
Right. I see them all that.

32
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,200
Two, five, four, two and four.

33
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:49,030
Two of of your mom. Dad, I will jump to the side. Five and one for the last couple of four months.

34
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,360
I think maybe I'm at like ten now, but a lot of those are like from like my high school boyfriend, whatever.

35
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:01,210
But I mean, know, that was my phone size person on the radio.

36
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,350
Television. Yeah, like six or seven is.

37
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:15,219
Okay, six. Okay. Thanks for coming back to kids perennials.

38
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,690
Right. I know once the landline and one like our home.

39
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:24,910
My man, what's my boyfriend? Just a boyfriend. Yeah, but it might have changed their phone numbers last year, so.

40
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:33,910
Yeah, love that. I love that. Six, six, four, four, four.

41
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:45,400
Okay, so the average for this class is about four. So you pay for those that are on zoom in chat.

42
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:57,340
I would love for you to answer the question how many actual phone numbers without cheating do you have memorized and and is one of them parental?

43
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:08,320
So if you don't mind putting in check for me the answer to that question I appreciate it is coming up for you four.

44
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,680
So I started this morning with a lot of my and I'm going and I'm going to continue until next Tuesday.

45
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:22,600
But some of my colleagues have like the highest number that I heard it was 25.

46
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:34,149
And I just getting you well from generation where you didn't you couldn't you literally couldn't go into the and find the name and just die.

47
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:40,060
All right. You had to memorize the number in all your friends.

48
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:49,089
And so at that point time, generationally, even even my grandparents numbers are 80 113.

49
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:57,430
It was like taking the C in the R from the two and and then making some sort of fun way of dialing the phone number so that you remembered.

50
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,310
Gosh, I don't think any of you guys have ever been on party lines, but but for the most part,

51
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:09,459
you know, just watching the generations of 25 down to today, that's amazing.

52
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:17,080
But definitely parental was was something as far as the emergency number that you had to have.

53
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:24,489
And I think I got my 14 that I could remember caught between parents and friends and grandparents numbers.

54
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:33,490
And I still have a landline number. And, you know, even today, husband kids would want to raise $100,000.

55
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,580
But all these other people are like, I think that you can look at your contact list and know you've got tons of people in your

56
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:46,089
would be just interesting how many numbers we have that's close that's close to us.

57
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:52,250
So had the share that had this year that think you simply said three days you said five.

58
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:59,170
And then you said to your parents, Samantha said four, Claire said four.

59
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,450
So it's this common name is four.

60
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:08,980
So you're listening to Sam. It's early.

61
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:16,590
And so for those that have just joined us, I asked, how many phone numbers do you actually recall that you can recite right now?

62
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:23,560
If I recall, and are any of them credit? People really think?

63
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,480
Yes. How many of you probably saw seven.

64
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,250
So your parents in this case.

65
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,170
Okay, okay, okay, love. Two years left.

66
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:42,580
Yes. And all three of my parents are ones.

67
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:50,390
Whose hands did you?

68
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:57,370
Did I see your face and the names not registered?

69
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,300
Yeah. Eddie Evey guy. Okay.

70
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,020
Eddie Phillips? Yep. That's okay. I'm working on it.

71
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,680
Did I get your answer to my mom and my dad?

72
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,110
I mean, I used to know my grandparents number and everything, but they don't have a phone or they don't have a.

73
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,550
It's different now as a yeah, yeah.

74
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:27,190
The changing of the numbers. So sort of we used to just have the one line and you had it forever and, and it was do I switched my number.

75
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,059
They think they know it by heart going forward.

76
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:36,000
So. All right. So we're talking about numbers today. Thank you for restating that term.

77
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:41,550
Ice breaker you. Decision.

78
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:55,830
So last class I when I was talking about pulling back a little bit and talking about some

79
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:03,809
macro level items that actually from the environment will impact the work that we do.

80
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:09,690
And this class is going to be about workforce planning from a macro level,

81
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:16,050
things that you might want to consider as you are going forward and doing your work and managing your work.

82
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,840
I won't ask one quick question before I go into this is how many people went to the Griffith Leadership Conference?

83
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:28,850
Okay. It was great. I thought it was. But they did a very nice job in that regard.

84
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:36,860
And there was just a lot of information there, especially towards the end that they were talking about ways to think about

85
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:42,469
resilience in the workforce and workforce and what you can kind of think about them,

86
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,299
especially with Kelly's presentation with the nurses and the nursing workforce.

87
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,290
So just a little bit of a timely note there that last week that was happening.

88
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,380
And then I do want to ask, how was the career fair for those that went? Good, good stuff.

89
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,890
Awesome. And thumbs up. Thumbs down on the interviews fellowship process.

90
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,290
Okay. I'm just taking your temperature control, how we are doing.

91
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,410
Because if it's. If it's like this, then I got some motivation for you guys, but nonetheless.

92
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:21,450
So the learning objectives for today, you're going to try to describe the importance of workforce planning in a changing healthcare system, right?

93
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:28,410
I don't mean to describe the methods used to project workforce supply and demand for healthcare workers.

94
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:35,370
Try to understand the challenges in determining the right number and mix of workers needed to meet patients,

95
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:42,639
demands for health care services and apply workforce planning methods to real world issues and interpret the results

96
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:50,250
the workforce workforce planning models and their implication for human resource planners for the most part.

97
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,190
So Spencer, I got to put you on and blast.

98
00:10:53,400 --> 00:11:03,059
The question to the class was when you think about the numbers that you may have retained from a cellphone or landline perspective,

99
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,650
how many number of numbers could you write down on a piece of paper right now?

100
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:14,610
And is any of them parental? My husband likes that.

101
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:21,720
Both my parents, my land, mine, my wife, the number of number in my phone number my sisters.

102
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,890
How many of that is good? Or was the average.

103
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:34,650
So not a problem that way. And just coming in high, how many numbers can you recall?

104
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:41,940
Right. And even if there is any is any one of those a parent gets two of the three of them.

105
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:49,320
Love it. Love it. All right. Thank you. So that's our learning objectives for the day when we're talking about workforce planning.

106
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,090
You have seen this slide and it will continue to get repeated.

107
00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:01,350
That's my world. That's our world. That's what we live in. Workforce planning we use that for.

108
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,890
I've been using it for a number of different topics, but there's a thread there, right?

109
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,969
Just looking at the 51, how do we plan for the 51,000?

110
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:14,910
What what goes behind that? What does human resources think about the workforce?

111
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:22,170
And how are we adequately recruiting and retaining and sending off into retirement what we need?

112
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:31,620
So there's a macro level concept versus the micro level workforce outcomes.

113
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:38,520
And the macro level is sort of the style environment that we need to look at.

114
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:44,579
That can be indicators of what we can have based on our supply of health care

115
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:54,510
workers and the demand that is expected of those health care workers going forward.

116
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:05,130
And so the goal of any good workforce planning, what you need in your area is the link.

117
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:13,680
So what you're doing is trying to find the right number of people with the right skills in the right place at the right time.

118
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:20,590
In trying to balance what I consider the quadruple aim.

119
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:35,070
So when you find that workforce where you're able to plan for that workforce are they can can you deliver enhancing a good patient experience.

120
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,210
Are you eventually improving population health?

121
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:49,370
What does it mean to reduce the costs for this workforce and improving the work life of health care providers?

122
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:58,010
And that fourth bucket is an it is an emerging what I consider an emerging strategy in health care,

123
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,680
taking care of the workers that take care of the services you want provided.

124
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,649
And I know a lot of that was talked about last week, get to grips with leadership, being able to take care of that workforce.

125
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:15,260
And you've heard me talk about that here in this class. So that's been an emerging and emerging strategy.

126
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,530
So when you're thinking about workforce planning, there's your goal.

127
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:26,090
As with any operation, right? You need to have people there to open the doors to to process operations.

128
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,740
And I got phone records and think I'm helping.

129
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,570
It's interesting. Okay.

130
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,080
Looks like the first slide and thought I was going to be repeating and I'm going to go backwards.

131
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:54,790
If you're trying to aim at that goal and you're strategically and proactively putting into place a workforce plan, what will it help?

132
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:59,410
It will help improve the care delivery for patients.

133
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:06,730
Again, heard me say the right number of mix to delivery, quality of care, reduce costs for payers in the health care organization.

134
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:12,850
Basically by decreasing the cost of recruitment, turnover and training improves employee engagement,

135
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,140
decrease burnout and increase employee satisfaction.

136
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,190
And it will achieve efficiencies for employers and health systems.

137
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:26,590
Missions Lead Mission. Mission leads to better operational and financial outcomes.

138
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:34,030
So we're going into a little bit of this as we continue through the slides, but improve and reduce and achieve.

139
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,600
That just sounds like such great goals for any health care administrator in what it is we're doing.

140
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:46,690
We definitely want to make certain that we are looking at what it is we're trying to achieve,

141
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:52,810
what is we're trying to do, and do we have the people and the right mix of people to get there going forward?

142
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:13,370
This slide just it's once you really get into the numbers and what this is really saying, we literally cannot continue on the path we are going.

143
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:19,550
We need to really be creative and think about our workforce simply because what we are spending on health care,

144
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,710
with the bulk of that being salaries and benefits is.

145
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,460
It's at least 60, 60% of what we're spending in the workforce.

146
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:39,520
How are we going to make this sustainable? There's an interesting note to the line of this graph in that you can see 2020.

147
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,700
And it went up. What happened in 2020?

148
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,850
Especially with health. Public health.

149
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,150
What happened March 2020. Google calls it.

150
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:05,780
How much money was released from federal aid for health care workers in 2020 was amazing.

151
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:11,720
Were we even prepared with the workforce at that time and what we would be needing and spending?

152
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:19,180
But when we still look at this goes back to 1960, I believe to 2020,

153
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,690
you look at the health care expenditures as a portion of our gross domestic product.

154
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:38,710
He will be in charge of this expenditure. What you do, what you put in place, what you plan for goes through h.r.

155
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:46,660
To a payroll, to a paper, to a system to then be aggregated, to basically show.

156
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:52,270
What you could potentially control with this particular number.

157
00:17:52,270 --> 00:18:00,129
So having having the great foresight to think about trying to be as effective and as efficient as you can with the workforce and having the right mix

158
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:09,740
of people and the right models in place and programs in place to deliver the quality care is a burden of a public health leader is a burden of h.r.

159
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:18,700
Who is your partner? And this. And what's influencing this particular grant, specifically high schools closing.

160
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:26,670
Is anyone aware of in there, whether their hometown or local area of hospitals closing?

161
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:35,730
And what ends up happening is you have to move that care somewhere else is not.

162
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:43,230
The population just didn't get healthy. The hospital closed because they couldn't afford to stay open.

163
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,340
I've seen a lot of that, especially rural hospitals that maybe didn't close, but they got.

164
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:58,150
Swallowed up or they were they were acquired by a bigger health system because they couldn't sustain on their own.

165
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,170
But the need was there, especially in rural areas where they. This is a huge issue.

166
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:08,620
Absolutely. Anybody aware of what just happened as far as a merger?

167
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,940
Spectrum, Beaumont and Spectrum. Right.

168
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:18,530
Trying to really think about efficiencies and effectiveness and still provide quality

169
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:24,080
care in the regional areas with the talent and services that they have need.

170
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,800
But let's think about that. How much duplication?

171
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:39,560
First of all. The process by which you merge is a long, arduous process, and there is true thoughts in the workforce who do retain.

172
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,700
Who not to retain, what to retain. Do we get rid of all of our primary care doctors?

173
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,159
Probably not. But do we get rid of our ICU nurses?

174
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,430
If we may just start spectrum hospitals only primary care.

175
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:57,720
There's primary, secondary and tertiary care going forward.

176
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:11,340
So getting back to the slight influences of of domestic spend, staffing shortages, maldistribution of providers and high costs of services.

177
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,700
I wanted to talk a little bit also about the nurses.

178
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,710
I'm sorry, not the nurses. The workforce breakdown. This is 2020 data.

179
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:32,670
20.7 million health care workers and nurses make up a good, from what I understand, 3 million of that 20.7.

180
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,380
But they're expected to grow.

181
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:44,940
So in 2020 and we're now in 2020 to go into 2023, if we did that data today, we were expecting a 12.1% increase in nurses.

182
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,440
And does anybody still hearing that we are short on nurses?

183
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:55,479
Like, Wow. I mean, it's we're thinking about it.

184
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,540
We see it. We know it. What else?

185
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,750
What else are our options? Right. What?

186
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:09,550
How else can we think about planning in the workforce if we're going to be short nurses and we need nurses, but the projected to grow.

187
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:16,569
Just just the balance of that then the paraprofessionals that that also projected to

188
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:23,770
grow 8.9% unlicensed professionals in addition to physicians expected to grow 7.3%.

189
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:30,520
Again, how many times have we heard shortages on physicians in certain areas, places and spaces?

190
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,709
But it's important for us to think about this in totality,

191
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:44,740
but also to start thinking about it in regional areas and what you can do and what resources are within your hands to think through.

192
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:52,060
You know, what are my options? What what can what can I what's within my toolbox that I can utilize?

193
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:02,550
So talking about the health care models or talking about health care workforce planning,

194
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:11,849
and there are models that I will get to eventually in the slides that will speak to how to forecast,

195
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:15,230
how to plan, how to predict, how to think about this.

196
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:25,229
But I wanted to put in front of you first some of the things that are that that caused pause, that is gives hesitation to some of these models.

197
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:33,060
The traditional way was headcount. But now we're thinking in different ways of of looking at workforce planning and.

198
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:44,020
Best laid plans. Do they always work? Your best laid plans.

199
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:51,250
Do they always work? That's what that speaking to forecasting is exactly that.

200
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:56,200
It is our best effort with the data that we have trying to predict what is forthcoming.

201
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:11,380
Did anybody predict COVID? So you saw the little spike in the gross domestic product expenditures and where that's at before COVID,

202
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:18,430
we were expecting on a somewhat of a downward trend for our expenditures and spending.

203
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:26,020
But again, forecasting is sort of a weakness when we do workforce planning and it's something that you want to know about.

204
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:33,880
But it's our best it's the best tool that we have to predict where we can go, what decisions to make and how we can make them.

205
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,800
And then policies has major influences, and I know there's a lot up there,

206
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:46,930
but the current Biden administration, the build back better plan, we're all familiar with that.

207
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,620
The build back better plan.

208
00:23:51,340 --> 00:24:05,260
This information about the policy made at the federal level and how it in how it impacts access and availability of care insurance and what it drives.

209
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:13,510
What I'm getting at is 4 million uninsured people will gain coverage.

210
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:20,219
We don't have enough nurses, we don't have enough doctors.

211
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:32,050
So they're going to enter into health care when not every single one of them, but at some point time, I'm going to use the system.

212
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:38,830
It's a phrase that comes to mind when I think of individuals who don't have care and they finally get

213
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:43,030
insurance and they access and I think you've heard me say it before when they when they got bennies.

214
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,470
I heard that a lot. When I've got bennies, I'm going to be on benefits.

215
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:53,170
I'm going to I'm going to use them. So imagine that on your workforce.

216
00:24:54,610 --> 00:25:01,750
Depending on the geographical area, uninsured people will gain insurance.

217
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,000
That's a good thing, is it not for people?

218
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,460
Because people who are uninsured getting insurance.

219
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:16,070
But as a health care leader of a practice that's already bursting.

220
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,770
And we talked about physician compensation and you want to get them from 30 to 35 because you see more.

221
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,970
I mean, that's that's dollar value to you.

222
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:34,950
But you don't have enough workforce capital to build another facility to put people in.

223
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,170
You mean I mean things that you have to contemplate.

224
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,860
Policy, high policy levels will impact you.

225
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:48,290
So keeping that in front of you as as a as a leader is going to be important.

226
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:54,440
We had to really think about that and how that impacts the the systems that are within Washtenaw County.

227
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:01,960
Saint Joe and he. Socioeconomic status and demographics.

228
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:08,260
I don't want to assume everybody's aware of and what assesses socioeconomic status.

229
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,850
I want to make certain that we're all for that. And demographics forecasting.

230
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:26,200
I giggled because 15 years ago when I walked down the streets of Detroit or on the waterfront,

231
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:34,660
it was it was nice because you were at the water, but you definitely knew that the city was in despair.

232
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:41,430
But you walked down there after I went to the auto show and I've gone back and forth there today.

233
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:56,110
The demographics of downtown Detroit have changed. What would that have impacted for the workforce, for DMC, for Henry Ford, for Detroit, Riverview?

234
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:01,250
Just that population coming in to demand of those services.

235
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,500
The demographics of where those health care systems sit.

236
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:15,150
What might have changed when you've got despair, homeless and others with minimal insurance or no insurance coming in?

237
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,780
What is your workforce look like versus.

238
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:25,790
A new Detroit. Bloomfield Hills suburban areas.

239
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:35,060
Ann Arbor. What does that look like? It looks and feels different then, so you never know what a gentrification might do.

240
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,630
To a health care system. And how do you forecast for that?

241
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,280
No one thought about COVID. Many were planning for gentrification.

242
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,870
But did the hospitals really think about that environmental change that was going to happen to them?

243
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:57,570
So this definition is clear as mud, but I will do my best to explain what it is it's trying to say.

244
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:13,000
Workforce planning. The model definition is the process of creating simple assumptions, simple assumptions represented by reality, which is your data.

245
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:22,900
What do you know right now? And working to project trends with this data in order to see patterns,

246
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:28,790
I know I switched out representation to see patterns about whether supply of healthcare workers

247
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:37,520
for a find geographic area will be adequate to meet demand for health care services five,

248
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:43,450
ten or 15 years or more. So.

249
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,640
Let's just say. Got a great job next year.

250
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,830
You're locked in for five, possibly ten. You've got a line of service that's yours.

251
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,500
You've got staff that you have to manage in some capacity.

252
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,940
What's your data around you to know what's what's the federal policies that might impact your services?

253
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:13,040
What's the staff that you might possibly need? What do you know about that data so that you can trend out?

254
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:19,850
You've got pressures on the hospital to produce in some way a deliverable, right.

255
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,270
So when I think of the Beaumont and Spectrum merger,

256
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:33,679
expectations have been set from a high level of what system would produce what it went from a human resource

257
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:41,300
perspective they had to look at now both combined and how can they best utilize all those resources effectively?

258
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:48,280
Side by side. Who's getting fired or who's getting reallocated?

259
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:55,240
What does that look like? What's the data?

260
00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:02,180
How are they going to do workforce planning with that particular merger or you as a leader?

261
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:09,850
How are you going to do workforce planning with the data that you have? So there's a basic.

262
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:16,680
Supply and demand, right. That you kind of been hearing me sort of touch with some and give it its names.

263
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,340
Did you guys get macro economics? Is that still a part of the program?

264
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:28,990
This is economics. A part of it. You micro economics.

265
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:32,530
What's what's the economics you come on into? I don't know.

266
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,979
I mean, so but you had economics. So that's what I was trying to get at.

267
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,580
But supply and demand, right. You've kind of been taught digital widgets.

268
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,800
So I still using digital widgets. I see no.

269
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:58,300
I see no reason with Polygon. So supply and demand is important and.

270
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,500
A basic, basic methods,

271
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:12,180
things to think about when you're thinking about supply for what you're trying to deliver in your health care through your workforce.

272
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:23,670
There's a little bit of a diagram up here about sort of the consider the process by which you want to think about these things.

273
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:32,700
But when you think about supply and what drives supply, and you heard me say you need to know exactly where you are right now,

274
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:39,210
what is your current workforce and examining the inflow and the outflow of what's happening

275
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:44,489
in your practice so that you can think about the services that you kind of provide.

276
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:53,670
Because again, the right mix of staff at the right time delivering the right care, another driver is headcount versus full time equivalent.

277
00:31:53,910 --> 00:32:00,120
And talk a little bit about that because we've said head count, 20.7 million is a head count.

278
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:08,550
But I also want you to think a little bit about when you're looking at your practice and let's just say you need 20 physicians,

279
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:16,470
that's a headcount, right? But all 20 physicians are not working 8 to 5.

280
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:27,100
So what's a better analysis or thought that you should be thinking about when it comes to planning for your workforce?

281
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:35,200
I mean, we've got people asking today about future of work and the workforce and what it's going to look like and flex hours.

282
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,610
And, you know, it means trying to come in and share a shift or what have you.

283
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:49,420
So drivers can be a head count or it could be how you're using what you would consider as a full time equivalent,

284
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:55,930
which can be broken up into four, can be broken up in two or just one FTE.

285
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:05,920
What does that look like? When you are doing a budget and you have to submit a budget as a health care leader,

286
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:16,930
are you going to survive of this AMA in this practice over in clinic A and then you do a 1.0 FTE for Clinic B.

287
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,410
What are you saying is your total workforce?

288
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,640
Because when you submit a budget, someone's going to say, Tell me about your people.

289
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,380
How are you using them? Because that's your.

290
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,390
That is. That's your supply. But what do you know about that supply as well?

291
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:44,170
A driver for supply is also training pipeline in that I use the example.

292
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:57,750
Being able to take someone who came in as your first registrant, they're your registers and they want to grow within the organization.

293
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:03,930
We talked about non-monetary support and rewards to give people training.

294
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:10,050
So you train this person to become a medical assistant and then they become a medical assistant and then they become a nurse.

295
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,730
So what have you done right. Training can help.

296
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:28,750
In your supply, what are what are your H.R. constructs to help train your staff to be loyal and stay with you and grow and help you deliver?

297
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:32,590
What you're trying to deliver is quality care. Migration.

298
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,579
Talking about the closings of certain rural hospitals.

299
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:48,380
Maybe not closings, but reallocation. When you shut down services, where do you where do those individuals go?

300
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:55,010
When you think about New York and what New York can offer for health care providers versus Idaho.

301
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,740
So think about if you're not, is anybody going to Idaho?

302
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:08,510
Are any of my healthcare professionals who are looking for jobs going to Idaho?

303
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:14,720
Case in point. Think about what I'm saying.

304
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,880
Migration. Where are you going? California does a study.

305
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,720
You're going to New York? We're going to Minnesota. You got to sort of look at the Prince thing anyway.

306
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:32,840
But migration, you're going where you think you're going to be valued.

307
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:44,570
So now that workforce can have the workforce can either be shortage or plentiful depending on what's happening in your area.

308
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:51,150
But for Idaho, we're at a table where the public health people work with doctors.

309
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:55,670
And so think about if you are from Idaho, I think you're going back.

310
00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:00,089
Is anybody from Idaho? For my families.

311
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:05,000
So I see a lot of money to provide right at home.

312
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:09,450
Okay. Okay. But Idaho is different than New York.

313
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:14,560
Current. And from what I understand, even from a physician based.

314
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:20,209
When you you know, we projected 7.3% of physicians.

315
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:30,590
Where will physicians go equally, you know, and deal with cold sores and small, you know, preventative services?

316
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:39,890
Or will they go to New York to see a plethora and get experience or probably do research and engaged, move up the options supply?

317
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:44,150
Where's your supply coming from? Where are you? Where is your supply coming from?

318
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:52,100
Attrition. Age of retirement shows based on economy.

319
00:36:53,930 --> 00:37:03,659
And. You know, we we at Michigan look at the the what I consider the succession rates and retirement rates.

320
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:08,910
You heard me say recruitment, retention and retirements and attrition.

321
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:17,550
Just just looking at what's going to happen to the workforce and how that that goes away and the quiet quitting.

322
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,740
Just people leaving and what we're doing about it.

323
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:31,300
But how do we how do we get those back? Are we trading up? Are we really looking at the model of how people are working differently?

324
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:40,720
These will be the things that you are challenged with because when you present your budget in telling you who and how they can recruit,

325
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,510
it's going to matter to you at that level. It will matter to you at that level.

326
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:52,510
So that's supply. A workforce.

327
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:58,750
Health care. What about the demand? What impacts the demand of your people?

328
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:08,840
I have in my head already seen all of you guys in your business suit or whatever you can have in front of you with your staff and doing your thing.

329
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:20,630
But what's going to bring them to you? So let's say you have somewhat of a right mix, but.

330
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,590
The. The demography of where you're at.

331
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:30,480
Idaho versus Detroit. Somewhere in Idaho.

332
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:34,320
What's a city in Idaho? Idaho Falls or Boise?

333
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:40,140
Idaho Falls. Boise versus Grand Rapids, Michigan.

334
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:45,750
Different feel. Madison, Wisconsin. Different feel.

335
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:51,420
The characteristics of a population. Right? Urban versus suburban.

336
00:38:55,330 --> 00:39:05,740
In an urban setting, would we say we see more chronic care and in a suburban setting, would we say we see more?

337
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,250
Preventative medicine care. Who disagrees with that?

338
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:22,969
Everybody agrees with that double negative kind of regiment with the characteristics of the population matters and what's coming to,

339
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:28,400
you know, what you're surrounded by, know what's coming at you.

340
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:41,130
To make for certain you have the right workforce mix. If you're seeing more mental health concerns, but you're a primary care clinic,

341
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:48,690
is there some way you can triage this and have somebody at the front desk triaging all of this so that then you can refer to that?

342
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:59,130
Because when you've got a mental health patient coming in your doors and they just booked a regular physical,

343
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,900
which you really realize is a mental health situation. Is your staff trained for that?

344
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,250
Is that the right workforce?

345
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:13,680
And you start looking at your data and you're like, wow, we've we've had 90 referrals to mental health resources in the last week.

346
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:18,239
What do you think you should do with that workforce? How are you going to plan differently?

347
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,020
Something might have changed or happened in the environment that's going to cause that.

348
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,910
The epidemiology rate. The prevalence of risk.

349
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:34,310
Epidemiology. My head right now for the last two and a half years has been what is COVID?

350
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:43,219
So I apologize and my thoughts here, but it's what do we know about obesity in our area?

351
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:48,950
And do you have the right clinic and tools and positions to help with that smoking?

352
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,910
And I'm assuming you're all aware of the great American slowdown on November 17th,

353
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:57,160
and then our policies have changed on campus and we are beginning to have it.

354
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,159
I just don't that's that's actually coming.

355
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:06,190
But again. What does smoking due to the body?

356
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:10,239
And if you're in a situation and it doesn't even have to be in America,

357
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,960
let's just say you decided to go overseas where the smoking bans may not be as as enforced.

358
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,180
What's coming at you and can your workforce handle it?

359
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,970
What are the symptoms? What are the chronic symptoms of smoking?

360
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:32,430
And if that's not a clinic you're prepared for, how do you know it?

361
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:36,360
Do you know what's coming? Are you aware of it? What's coming at you.

362
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,950
Health care delivery models, including technology.

363
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:46,530
So. Health care delivery models.

364
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,440
When we when we talk about demand.

365
00:41:52,360 --> 00:42:03,480
When a clinic is overrun and you just bursting at the seams, right sizing the workforce to the right amount of work is important.

366
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:06,760
The right mix of employees to do the right job at the right time.

367
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,120
Nurse practitioners, physician assistants have helped tremendously.

368
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:23,450
I grew up in the era where. Just using the word physician assistant was a nasty word because physicians thought that they were losing their autonomy.

369
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:34,880
That they were literally losing their autonomy and the right to prescribe was sort of just this thing that they wanted to protect.

370
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:45,170
And in managing the cancer center and I don't know if you saw it last night or the night before, there was another repeat of Dr. Novelli on TV.

371
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:49,220
Anyway, another hundred and 50 women came forward.

372
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:55,149
Just to share with you from our Dr. Renee Naomi, you should know that we talked about that.

373
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:58,240
We talked about the reasons why. So looking forward.

374
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:05,310
We in the clinic decided to look at our model.

375
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:09,660
The demand that was coming into the clinic. The physicians just couldn't keep up.

376
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:19,120
Where in our model could we? Present support for the physicians was in the form of a peer and a nurse practitioner,

377
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:24,700
and this was the first time this practice had implemented that model because of demand.

378
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:31,750
And it definitely opened up. It opened up access and it decreased anxiety on the physicians.

379
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,440
The throughput was was great, but where do we find them?

380
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:39,580
Where do we get it? Where, where? Where was I pulling them from? Because the resource.

381
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,660
Thank goodness.

382
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:50,720
Being in southeastern Michigan, we've got great schools, we've got great training, we've got great resources to pull from and we paint them well.

383
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:59,260
There is a new. There's a new health care worker called the scribe.

384
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:07,780
Anybody familiar with that? What's it like?

385
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:12,940
A doctor's visit. They'll be documenting and typing. What's happening during the visit?

386
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:18,400
Yup. They're right here. Okay. So then go back 20 years.

387
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:22,880
30 years ago. Who was doing that?

388
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:29,990
Who was doing this mission? The physician was his own scribe.

389
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:35,160
Every now and then, you'd have a great nurse working with that doctor and she would describe scribing,

390
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,900
God forbid they were not going to put it on medical,

391
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:47,490
but what did it take to get that workforce to alleviate pressures out of a system to provide care?

392
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:56,070
What training was put in place to have those available, you know, as a resource 20 years ago?

393
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:05,309
So yeah, when I graduated, that was not an opportunity for me in the resource planning that I could tap

394
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:09,690
into and think about the model and what I'm doing and what could we provide.

395
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:13,800
But you had that capacity to think through, Well, what do I need?

396
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,460
It's that next step of looking at the process for you.

397
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:22,559
What else can you do when demand is high? Economic factors.

398
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:29,880
You heard me say SDS, young versus elderly. Do the young need more care or do the elderly need more care?

399
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:38,040
And if you were to guess, where are the majority of our elderly in America in the winter?

400
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:47,260
Who's in Florida? Florida. Right. We do agree. Florida, California, Arizona, a little bit.

401
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,120
And I think is the highest population of 65. Arizona has the highest.

402
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:54,450
Oh, Arizona. Yep, yep, yep, yep.

403
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:59,120
And so think about it. Think of what?

404
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:10,730
I just want you to ponder that for a minute because. Discussion question and I'm curious to hear how will the aging of the population affect

405
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:15,620
both the supply of health professionals and the demand for health care services?

406
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:23,410
So. And they were all going to go up into the stands.

407
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:27,760
And I'm going to ask you what your favorite restaurant is in Ann Arbor.

408
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:33,580
And then I'm going to have you share with me what you think your thoughts on for that particular question.

409
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:44,410
How will the aging of the population affect both supply of the professionals and the demand for health care services?

410
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,360
Thank you. I think I got it from a press conference.

411
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:02,760
How do you know? I haven't been reading. You know, Peter. What I mean is it was like this brewery by my parents living here.

412
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:08,309
It's called the fair. Now, if I remember all you shouted, that's a shout out.

413
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:15,629
But the place, the demand, I think, is definitely affected by the aging population right now,

414
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:19,090
just because of like the baby boomer generation is very common.

415
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:23,100
I used to work in a nursing home for two years as a nurse assistant,

416
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:30,239
so I like seen the demand for like rooms specifically like we would have especially during COVID.

417
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:36,990
We had a lot of residents kind of pass away and those rooms were filled within days with like the waitlist was insane.

418
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:40,470
So there is a huge demand when it comes to like that side of health care.

419
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:46,580
I guess it kind of ties in the supply as well. Higher demand, less supplies.

420
00:47:47,580 --> 00:48:00,000
Okay. Just listening to your thoughts, I think that it's probably definitely going to lead to an increase in demand for health care services,

421
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:04,709
because obviously, as people are aging, they require more health services.

422
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:13,410
And I would know what kind of long term care, mostly head, shoulders, pretty much everything.

423
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,310
Okay. Knee surgeries, hip surgeries.

424
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:24,360
You know, think back to have you guys heard the song had so okay I'm like oh I just one so.

425
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:33,500
Okay. But yeah, all of those things start to wear right and demand for those services versus someone who's younger.

426
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:42,600
I mean, there's not that those services aren't needed, but the amount of services that are needed sounds like you're finishing adding I think I know.

427
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,500
Sorry, was there an additional for the health professional and then the demand.

428
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:50,280
So the supply like. Like what does it look like that's different?

429
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:58,140
I'm assuming at least I would guess the supply of health professionals is probably going to decrease as the population ages,

430
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:06,150
because I think that a lot of health professions are probably less attractive to a lot of young people who care more about work life balance,

431
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,260
which simply isn't to be found in health care right now. So that's my opinion.

432
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:15,570
And I appreciate you. Thank you. Is there restaurant all right for the potatoes?

433
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:19,379
I gotcha. Forget. That's it. Yeah. Totally appreciate that.

434
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:24,150
What was what was it? Frito potatoes. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

435
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:29,549
Oh, yeah. So you're like, hey, I like creativity.

436
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:35,810
Those too. Okay. Um, yeah, I would say, like, an agreement with what everybody else says.

437
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:38,070
The demand would definitely increase.

438
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:45,750
And I say this just because I work at a dermatology clinic, we had like a year long waitlist, and it was mainly like containing people,

439
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:52,630
the older population, and just coming from like the specialty perspective, it's just something that's.

440
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,130
Hey. How you doing? What's your name? I don't think I have one.

441
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:07,670
Okay. But, yeah, like everyone said, I think demand will increase for a lot of the services supply.

442
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:15,840
I'm curious to see what that has done for a lot of the younger generation.

443
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:24,890
On whether they want to enter their. I know a lot of my friends who were in nursing school when COVID happened.

444
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:28,800
They graduated early and they were put on the spot to work, evening work.

445
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,480
And after about a year of working, they were burnt out and so they quit.

446
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:47,750
So I want to see how that transition translates like, I hope, in 2020 did we we projected a 12.1 increase.

447
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,569
They've gotten a train, but are they really in the workforce? And we're still saying we see a shortage.

448
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:57,980
Right. So, you know, the thoughts around this is the supply of health professionals.

449
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:05,450
You're familiar with geriatric centers. I mean, we know nursing homes, long term care, but geriatrics,

450
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:13,579
there's there are a lot of physicians who are thinking that it's just easier to move out of primary

451
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:22,250
care and into tertiary geriatric care because truly thinking of the generation they believed in,

452
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:26,030
the doctor, that generation believed in the doctor.

453
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,870
That's starting to change a little bit. But it's.

454
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:34,460
The assessment, the need may be greater and more.

455
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,100
You know what? The billboards. Imagine the billboards when somebody who's.

456
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:48,120
65, 75, 85. True, true story.

457
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:52,650
My girlfriend's father was just put into the hospital last Saturday, so.

458
00:51:52,860 --> 00:52:04,180
And I called him down and. He had gone in for a procedure and ended up for no apparent reason having sepsis.

459
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:10,820
And it was a situation where he went in, for one thing.

460
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:14,700
And I kept asking her. They need to manage what he came in for.

461
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:19,650
Let's make sure that's taken care of and then let's manage what's going on with the sepsis.

462
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:30,750
And then we can manage the pain, right? We need to have all hands on deck looking at this, but I can't begin to tell you how many calls she gave me.

463
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:35,429
He's 84 about they want to do this.

464
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:38,370
They want to do this. They want to do this. They want to do this. They want to do this.

465
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:42,600
They want to CT scan and MRI's, X, Y and Z, you know, the catheter.

466
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:49,780
And I was like, Oh, my God. Well the billable on that now.

467
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,490
And I managed her through it.

468
00:52:52,490 --> 00:53:00,980
I gave her the tools and the words to say, this is what you need to advocate for, me for, and this is what you need to do now.

469
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:06,459
You know, she she did it all. He's he's back home. He he's he's home.

470
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:14,010
He's resting as a positive story. But. I really believe he would have probably been in there for another 14 days.

471
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:27,860
And that was my concern. Let's just be over here by a few health care workers trying to assess the situation and what's happening.

472
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:36,420
The workforce getting the right people do the right thing to advocate for the right process at the right time to deliver the best care.

473
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:43,880
And I will have to say, ma'am, the funny thing that she texted me, I just really need to share this because they're aging.

474
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:50,810
They've been they they've been married, I think, 50, 54 years now.

475
00:53:52,160 --> 00:54:03,780
They did not kick her out of the room. Yeah. She was in her pajamas and nobody had the audacity to move her because they respected that love for that.

476
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:13,200
I, I was grateful and I told her, let them provide the best care they possibly can for him and for her being in that room, in her nightgown.

477
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:18,510
And that's what they're going to see. But at the same point in time advocate, he is aging.

478
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,340
What are the health professionals that are around him that could have a properly assess that.

479
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,510
So kind of like a question, just kind of based off I think this kind of ties in with we're talking about,

480
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,900
you know, the lot of people that like we see this overuse of health care.

481
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:37,069
But I also can say from a physician standpoint, I mean,

482
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:42,110
there's kind of some perverse incentives created by the marketplace, like with multiple malpractise lawsuits.

483
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:48,070
Like, why wouldn't they want to do everything they can? Because if they don't, there's a chance they could get a a lawsuit on them,

484
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:52,670
maybe lose their license of livelihood like I can see maybe why these physicians are doing it.

485
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:57,350
And what can we do to change that? Mm hmm. These, like, perverse incentives we set up for them.

486
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:02,780
Yeah, that was a mouthful, because it is.

487
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:10,820
It is a delicate balance that I have to give that to you, because the key word that you stated was litigation.

488
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:16,550
And. Yeah.

489
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:24,440
I got to go into it. You opened a Pandora's box. So you are aware of Kevorkian?

490
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:28,070
Jack Kevorkian? They call this the death doctor.

491
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:33,640
I'm going to get to you. I promise. Someone's just waiting in the zoom for me.

492
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,840
If you. Okay.

493
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:43,680
Okay. Thank you. As I'm looking at them and I'm not here, I don't see it.

494
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:48,110
But thank you very much. Jack Kevorkian was totaled.

495
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,080
The death doctor.

496
00:55:50,160 --> 00:56:04,920
And the reason why I'm going with that is a friend of mine was his attorney, and she talked a lot about doing everything you can for the patient,

497
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:10,170
doing everything that you can for the patient, because that is the best approach.

498
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:21,860
And. What? What we get into constant conversations about is overutilization adds to the GDP.

499
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:28,110
It adds to the expenditures. Is it really appropriate?

500
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:32,520
But I ask you, when you when when you are the patient.

501
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:40,720
Do you want them to do everything they can? Depending on the situation.

502
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:47,220
Because the answer is yes. We need a lot more money.

503
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:56,490
Or do you want them to do what's right because of what they assessed for what you presented as your concern?

504
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:04,140
You come in? Personal example.

505
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:10,740
I am the guardian of my sister was older than me and she went in for.

506
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:18,190
Being in some. In Lindsay. And leaves the health care system nameless.

507
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:24,790
She went in. They gave her ice chips for three days.

508
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,740
They gave her ice chips. How would you feel on ice chips for three days?

509
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:36,620
Anybody feeling good? Anybody in their right mind? You're already in hospital and painting on ice cubes.

510
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:43,750
I get a call. They want to do an MRI scan because they think something's wrong with my head.

511
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:58,780
These are real. These are real. You will be an administrator of health care workforce, people who are trained, trying to make the right decisions.

512
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:07,809
Where was the breakdown? And there was somebody attending to her. But how did she get from pain here to.

513
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:12,970
They want to do a scan on my head. Let me explain.

514
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:18,850
It took me 38 minutes to get to Lansing to explain and advocate.

515
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:23,380
What are you advocating for? What are you advocating for?

516
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:28,510
And what are you saying to your workforce to advocate for? How are you keeping the GDP down?

517
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:38,290
So you're actually right. Litigation pushes us to think about doing everything for the patient.

518
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:43,390
And I mean, how do you practice? Because.

519
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:50,750
Each hour. We'll have to assess it as well. Is. Looking at what it takes for insurance.

520
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:57,980
You know, that is truly when you are recruiting physicians from Idaho to New York.

521
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,380
Your liability just went up. That expense just went up for that physician.

522
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:06,530
And they are negotiating that. That is a negotiating tool.

523
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:12,650
So it's a delicate balance.

524
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:22,490
And I want to say that I really wish we would focus more on what did the patient present, what's the best treatment plan,

525
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:30,560
how could we not go through an overutilization so that we've done enough to treat the patients, to treat the care?

526
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,520
But at the same point in time, we didn't expend all resources.

527
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:44,950
Going forward. But how many people come in to a health care system knowing exactly how it's supposed to go?

528
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:53,750
The workforce is going to tell them how it's supposed to go. What do you advocate for?

529
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:57,740
How do you advocate that in your next leadership phase?

530
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,360
She writes. I said, so thank you for that question.

531
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:07,260
Was that sort of getting it a little bit? It was a lot more than.

532
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:14,930
But matching supply and demand.

533
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:24,800
Is anybody heard of plasticity? I was going to call it Plastic City, but it's not.

534
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:29,420
And this is just overlapping the scope of supply,

535
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:33,889
meeting demand and what can what having different types of health care workers in

536
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:37,280
different specialties and professions meet the same types of health care needs.

537
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:41,450
This is physician based workforce training. They're being trained.

538
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:45,110
We're expecting 7.1% increase. We don't really know what field.

539
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:55,130
But but this this chart that you're seeing as far as an approach of a benchmarking approach of taking providers,

540
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:59,960
what you see is the providers on the left and the type of visits around the top.

541
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:06,920
And so if I was in a in a health care system, and these are my visits that I'm seeing.

542
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:14,150
I know that all of those specialties have circulatory visits.

543
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:21,240
Right. So I can have different providers providing different different services at different times.

544
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:30,030
And my internal medicine represents 26% of the visits.

545
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:38,770
In all of my circulatory visits, but 54% in my internal medicine only wrote.

546
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:45,710
So rethinking can I overlap some services of of workforce.

547
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:52,300
Personnel. Just trying to say one place or another.

548
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:59,970
Being flexible with your work force. But H.R. will want to recruit that coming in.

549
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:07,680
They won't know if you don't tell them. You don't tell them in your budget.

550
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:17,730
What you're trying to do. So your geographic location matters.

551
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:19,620
It demographics matter.

552
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:30,960
The types of data that you're using matters highly, highly, highly, highly, highly important, but overlapping your supply versus what is needed.

553
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:38,070
You're going to really need to think about being flexible and keeping this in your toolbox.

554
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:42,209
When someone asks you for your strategic plan for your department,

555
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:46,410
that's going to roll up to another department unit that's ultimately going to get

556
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:50,970
shared with leadership in an H.R plan and some EO that's going to say approved.

557
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:57,300
What is your strategic plan? What is your budget? What do you know? You're trying.

558
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:03,770
To be empathetic. You're trying to have all your tools in front of you.

559
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:09,440
But there's also the hard core of the work that you're doing in H.R. will be involved, but they won't know.

560
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:17,520
If you're not balancing your data and understanding the workforce that you're trying to bring in because that's where you're located.

561
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:25,170
My time here. Okay.

562
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:36,510
So there's a six. This is the tool that I share with you as you sort of go forward as next leaders when you're just thinking about workforce planning.

563
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:42,839
And there's several things that happen. There's state and local level things that happen from a policy perspective.

564
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:46,709
There's shortages of training and what have you.

565
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:51,870
And you're trying you're trying to just how can you be better than your competitor to get

566
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:56,970
the staff that you need to do to get the right mix of the right people that you need?

567
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:09,120
One of the things that I say as a project manager all the time is, know what question your answering for yourself and your service and your employer.

568
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:14,040
For what? For for what you're trying to deliver. Define, define.

569
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:18,870
Define the plan. What is the problem you are trying to solve?

570
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:25,200
I apologize for the type of you know, you don't see the stuff until this like large and it's hard to describe.

571
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:34,049
So I'll do my best to fix the cycle for those. But what will what will a good plan enable you to do?

572
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:40,260
Right. I think you can think that through what services, patients, staff groups are affected by the plan.

573
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:47,490
What are you trying to do? Great dermatology services to the elderly, just geriatric care, because that's what we're doing.

574
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:52,950
What what is what's the problem you're trying to solve with your workforce that you want to come in.

575
01:04:54,100 --> 01:05:00,340
Agree on an approach. Don't do it in a vacuum. Benchmark find other people.

576
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,440
Who are your colleagues? Call each other from across the country. Hey, I'm working on this problem.

577
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:11,680
Believe you me, I've called my, my, my class, and I've graduated from Kelly and I from Griffith.

578
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,940
Leadership still taught.

579
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:23,380
But what changes can and can't you control agree on the approach can't just come up with the plan and say my way or the highway,

580
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:30,399
somebody is going to say, no, it's not. What are the forces that support or hamper your plan?

581
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:37,690
What jobs, roles and locations will be affected? Spectrum From what jobs, roles and locations will be affected?

582
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:45,070
Who put that forward? Who put that information forward to agree on and how is it communicated?

583
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:48,780
And you know who can probably communicated most H.R.?

584
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:56,610
John was saddled with pretty much internal public affairs,

585
01:05:56,610 --> 01:06:03,960
did the external lowly paperwork and communications and TV and media ads, executives looked at a plan.

586
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:10,770
But I can tell you, I did a lot of that work as far as getting the data for the workforce plans.

587
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:20,520
And let me tell you, they asked every line manager, what is your service that you are providing profit or loss in summary.

588
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:29,710
Model future workforce demand. Just making sure nobody is in the waiting room.

589
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:38,950
Model for future workforce supply. So we talked about demand and supply breakdown activities by skill and time required.

590
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:43,089
Identify any new roles and productivity options and then for the supply.

591
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:46,930
What are the characteristics of your current workforce? Right. What do you have?

592
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:52,900
And then what will you need? What are the short and long term ramifications of making no change?

593
01:06:54,770 --> 01:07:03,990
Which might happen if you did nothing. So these are tools that can go in your toolbox when you become leaders about workforce planning,

594
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:10,590
take into consideration plasticity, supply, meeting, demand review, all options of achieving the plan.

595
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:13,500
Agree on the best option, build and sustain momentum for change.

596
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:24,840
Now the checklist here is to repeat two, three and four until you feel as if you've got a comfortable,

597
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:28,080
socialized aspect of what your plan needs to be.

598
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:34,270
Most people most people will jump straight to fine.

599
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:38,520
We are solvers. We like to solve it right away.

600
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:42,140
What are the actions that need to happen? What do you.

601
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:48,260
And it is so easy to be caught up in the culture and climate of an organization.

602
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:52,410
H.R. is going to push you to say, give me what you need.

603
01:07:52,410 --> 01:08:02,440
Give me your action plan. We need to. Friend of mine came into the University of Michigan from another health care system here,

604
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:10,080
and she called me, says, Oh my God, I've only been on the job three days and they want my action plan.

605
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:18,460
But. You have just entered your new employer and your new boss is asking for your workforce action plan.

606
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:22,150
You don't even know what bathrooms are from your job at this point.

607
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:26,470
You don't know your colleagues. I know your staff.

608
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:33,840
What are you going to take into account? How are you going to just ask for a step back and she will let you talk it through?

609
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:37,670
We appropriately managed it and I was like, This is what you got to do. Such as? She.

610
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:41,780
She was fine. 6 seconds. Anybody knows it? A couple things going on.

611
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:47,040
So just don't jump. Avoid going straight to five.

612
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:50,210
Avoid going and repeat it. Avoid going straight five.

613
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:55,800
Because we are solvers. We want to answer. We want a solution. Let's take a step back.

614
01:08:56,570 --> 01:09:00,470
Be thoughtful about it. Implement, monitor and refresh.

615
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:05,690
Define key milestones for the plan. Right. Spectrum and Beaumont.

616
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:12,410
Everybody's just going to be happy on day one. Or will it be phased in?

617
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:22,069
They have, I think they're called. There's a caudwell corals.

618
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:25,340
Cowell core is in there for Cowell.

619
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:32,420
So I have been wearing my lovely swag from Specter and I've been wearing my lovely swag from Beaumont.

620
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:37,710
That's what I'm going to be tomorrow. Lovely swag from Cornwall.

621
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:45,620
That's how it's going to go. And that's. That is so important because what are the milestones to get the staff there?

622
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:53,630
What are they going to do to train, educate, engage, plan for how do we get everybody aligned?

623
01:09:54,470 --> 01:10:01,490
Remember that we're being aligned with what leadership wants, aligned to the same direction that you can take.

624
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:08,230
How are outcomes and unintended consequences going to be measured?

625
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,540
So workforce planning.

626
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:18,370
We talked about the young nurse coming in to the older nurse and the older nurse might want to quit.

627
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,459
So now you've done some workforce planning and you go to a certain place,

628
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:26,840
so you're going to change the age and the dynamic of there might be some outcomes.

629
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:32,380
Did you plan for that? Did you plan for attrition or are people retiring or quit quickly?

630
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:43,410
What is the process for revising the plan? Have that in your thoughts as well.

631
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:53,580
What's the plan? And so when you're in five and you're looking at options for your workforce, you can build it.

632
01:10:54,740 --> 01:11:00,230
You can buy it. You can borrow it or you can bounce it.

633
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:05,760
Which is redeploying. In that regard.

634
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:15,900
So it's important that you take a step back when you think about it as you go into your fellowship roles.

635
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:23,150
If you are capable, ask, ask how they do workforce planning for their systems.

636
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:28,460
Be curious as to sit with a line manager or if you've got the opportunity,

637
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:32,840
take the experience and sit down next to somebody and say, How are you planning?

638
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,349
Show me. I don't want you to make them do something on demand.

639
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:46,640
But I'm intrigued about what your what your metrics are here for your unit and how are you trying to get the right people in at the right time?

640
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:56,450
I'd be really curious to hear what's being said, because from a michigan perspective, H.R. is heavily engaged with trying to understand.

641
01:11:57,230 --> 01:12:04,970
We saw that first slide with all of the 51,000 people doing job analysis, trying to look at the workforce, where we going to get it from.

642
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:09,920
We are lucky to have Michigan in our background. Eastern in our background.

643
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:14,360
Ross School of Business in our background. School of Public Health in our background.

644
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:23,750
To pull from places and spaces to fill some of what we need for for our units in many ways to provide the care we need.

645
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:28,909
But we still have a whole I mean, even, you know, as Michigan,

646
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:38,240
with all this resources and everything that we look at from a workforce planning, we still have to grind it.

647
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:43,920
And. What does that look like?

648
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:48,030
I need to. I don't have it up, but.

649
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:56,740
One of the latest things is my colleague Angela making doing talent acquisition and talent management here through H.R.

650
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:05,220
What we found is. Our recruiting process and our job descriptions are great.

651
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:14,580
But we were also dealing with the people aspect, the human aspect of somebody sitting there and interviewing someone else.

652
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:19,799
And there was a breakdown in what was being asked and how it was being asked and

653
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,430
if it was offended or not offended if they broke a law or didn't break the law.

654
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:31,140
Well, we use the metaverse. There's these goggles you put on as training of new supervisors.

655
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:36,570
You are in a virtual world with a new recruit in front of you.

656
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:43,260
And you're you have the role of asking the questions that are on the screen, too,

657
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:48,170
that you get to choose between the four questions that are onscreen in your metaverse to the person in front of you.

658
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:54,780
And if you ask the wrong question, you get immediate feedback that that was not the right that was not the right question to ask.

659
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:59,210
And here's the reasons why. Here's legal reasons why. Here's the climate reasons why.

660
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:00,540
Here's the culture reasons why.

661
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:11,880
Those are the so we are training our supervisors to recruit not only for the skill set, but the right workforce that we want.

662
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:17,710
And the train and the supervisors are getting those skills. They're finding out that man.

663
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,649
I thought I had it. I thought I had. Right.

664
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:29,640
But we're we're trying to keep our workforce in supervisors because we found they were frustrated that they couldn't get the workforce coming in.

665
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:34,860
So we had to train our supervisors to do things a little bit differently.

666
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:42,810
And the impact that we're having is the oh, wow, I did not know that I was hurting the university that way.

667
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:50,050
What's within your employer set? What's within your toolbox?

668
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:55,419
What's within your goal? And how will you work with H.R. to help define your workforce?

669
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:59,500
And what kind of leader will you be? What kind of training will you give yourself?

670
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:06,300
To be the best to lead with your best self. What are you thinking as a training unit?

671
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:09,820
You're getting it right now in school by the L. But what?

672
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:13,430
What else? What else will you need going forward?

673
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:22,149
So I am asking for an assignment. What types of scenarios could you develop to model how health workforce supply will

674
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:29,260
respond to changes in the economy and what factors and or what factors in the model?

675
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:33,790
You saw that little model inflow outflow are likely to be affected and in what direction?

676
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,840
So just a little I think I'm asking for one or two pages on that and I think big.

677
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:49,220
But looking at that question, I want to leave enough time for the midterm next Thursday.

678
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:54,620
How will this go? So it will be online.

679
01:15:55,970 --> 01:16:11,240
I will need everyone to the zoom will be open at 330 and we need everyone to log on with their screen on and the exam will be open and ready at 355.

680
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:15,740
It will close at 630 and I will be there the entire time.

681
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:20,750
I am asking that when you sign off you send me a direct message in chat.

682
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:28,960
You are done with the exam. It's part of my way of just the the notification and documentation going forward, but it will be online.

683
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:31,640
It's 18 questions.

684
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:41,030
And I think if you've just been following what we have in the class, this should not the exam should not be one that stresses you out.

685
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:48,440
I mean, I've tried to engage you enough that I think you'll understand what the questions are asking of you.

686
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:59,270
I'd say as a review, review the notes, review the slide decks, if you will, and think about some of the homework that you have turned in.

687
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:07,339
And that to me should be successful. So I am looking for everyone to be in attendance for the online exam.

688
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:15,380
But you need to turn on Zoom, make sure you're in a very comfortable space and quiet space so that you can do it.

689
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:25,580
But yeah, I'm looking to see you all on scene and it will be again, 352 will be open and then 355.

690
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:32,130
So it makes sense.

691
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:41,260
Yeah. What's going on for the last three months from.

692
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:47,420
Straight out. They say, oh, my gosh.

693
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,470
Sign in sheet. Sign in sheet. Jesus.

694
01:17:50,060 --> 01:18:01,549
I mean, I don't mean to say that when I got the book, I think you got some of my little pad out of my mouth and you sign, please.

695
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:07,460
Thank you. I am not exactly sure that I have a pencil.

696
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:13,100
Yeah. Yeah. It.

697
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:27,620
Because you don't think it's because there was no clear real reason we spent is just this

698
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:38,940
is a bit to talk about I think are you taking over from people like college counselor?

699
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:42,290
I was I was like, yeah.

700
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:50,570
I mean, I'll go with you and say, oh, I borrow your car.

701
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:56,010
I drove here. I was like, I'm not going to drive.

702
01:18:56,170 --> 01:19:01,190
Oh, oh, oh, are you kidding me?

703
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:17,330
It's I have to go down, so I'll just take it outside, you know?

704
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:22,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're here. But are you feeling that? I feel like watches.

705
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:28,490
Thank you for letting me. You send me a note. If I were in some, like, awkward.

706
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:32,920
I'll have to make sure they got all of you.

707
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:38,780
Thanks. Thanks very much.

708
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:54,350
I mean, I think.
