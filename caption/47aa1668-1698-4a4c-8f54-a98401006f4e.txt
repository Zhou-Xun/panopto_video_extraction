1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,409
Barriers to Health Equity Interventions.

2
00:00:05,409 --> 00:00:10,331
Conducting health equity research and
action initiatives must benefit vulnerable

3
00:00:10,331 --> 00:00:15,160
groups or
health disparities will not be reduced.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,350
Recognizing the need to consider social,
environmental, and economic factors

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,150
often results in the identification of
barriers to achieving health equity.

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,180
Critical barriers to health
equity interventions include

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,850
no national strategy to support
cross-sector partnerships.

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:39,190
Consequently structures for leveraging
resources across sectors are missing.

9
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,760
There are limited opportunities
to learn across communities.

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,196
And strategies for
becoming aware of available activities and

11
00:00:47,196 --> 00:00:52,093
relevant conceptual
frameworks are fragmented.

12
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:56,832
Developing community academic partnerships
is a strategy that can be used to address

13
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,900
the latter barrier.

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,210
This approach will more accurately
assess the influence of social and

15
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,930
political contexts when applying
social justice strategies and

16
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:13,420
addressing social determinants of health
from the perspective of communities.

17
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,879
What are some trends that could exacerbate
health inequalities because they

18
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:22,826
unevenly benefit privileged groups?

19
00:01:22,826 --> 00:01:28,203
Think about precision medicine,
healthcare reform policies,

20
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:34,653
causes of SCS disparities, changing
job markets, environmental hazards,

21
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:40,620
investments in education,
and economic reforms.

22
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,330
As a health equity specialist,
you must be aware of your own biases.

23
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,580
Know your population, including their
health status, health behaviors, and

24
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,090
stereotypes associated with them.

25
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,140
Identify a relevant social
determinant of health strategy, and

26
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:05,080
work in partnership with
communities to affect change.

27
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,390
Here are several questions to
consider as you do your work.

28
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,960
How can public health researchers and
practitioners justify examining health

29
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,750
equity issues without getting negative
reactions about their work and

30
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,230
the groups they might help?

31
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,510
What would be the greatest criticism
of your health equity research or

32
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,950
practice approach?

33
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,935
How would you frame your
message to be persuasive?

34
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:37,180
What rationale would you use
to justify your position?

35
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,760
How would you silence your critics?

36
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,865
Finally, how would you restate
your health equity question?
