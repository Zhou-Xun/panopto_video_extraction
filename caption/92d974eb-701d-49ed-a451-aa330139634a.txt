1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:07,780
we don't have a click or you actually have to use the phone or the keypad I'm sorry

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,960
and you could have the pharmacy models. normally they take a break around like

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:21,680
three fifty four five you know whatever you need sort of the time frame. I

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,740
don't think it's good for

5
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:32,280
her there's a lot of plants were pretty good. really

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,420
um we used to do the farm and

7
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,080
then

8
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:51,660
um government Cincinnati and then um. if you have any questions about problems

9
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:58,320
last time we can do that. um and then order start about

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:06,059
and talk little bit four years.

11
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:14,479
okay. I have a question for just hope these aren't the side assistance.

12
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,239
please sign my title has the right date and. okay. alright

13
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,439
man. I don't still okay. I mean that's that's saw that they don't recall and I can't believe in this and I think

14
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,459
where you know I didn't miss it this time I remember no worries. actually I'll just pull it up from

15
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:36,819
my e-mail. yeah I'm gonna that's okay.

16
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:42,919
okay. hopefully I don't have anything where 's

17
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:50,399
no sorry.

18
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,779
I'm glad you told. just should I

19
00:01:55,779 --> 00:02:11,669
start talking you want us to talk okay. six second okay

20
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:16,949
oh did you guys did you guys see this e-mail from Chris Tony.

21
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:22,009
they're asking about their e-mail you saw a

22
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:27,089
part of that but also very busy you know what I'm

23
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:32,129
saying. okay here we go.

24
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:37,629
okay. we got the rates like no.

25
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:43,669
so. so flies up. so um

26
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:49,329
really right here that we have something today to ask difference.

27
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:54,809
uh but lots of time hearing from epidemiologists

28
00:02:54,809 --> 00:03:00,431
and send decisions like today always somebody coming from like the okay

29
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:05,671
can teach us about it through genetics and social science research through kind of looking a few number of

30
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:11,351
directions I so think can know be a little bit different so there's lots of question.

31
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:16,951
you like in the on same for Thomas with your chance counselors asked me about

32
00:03:16,951 --> 00:03:21,971
mechanisms the social things are how they interact with another not one.

33
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:27,171
nice well for you know. okay. alright well hello

34
00:03:27,171 --> 00:03:32,971
everyone. so yes hi my name is coulter Mitchell and

35
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:38,091
I see what kinda how can I describe this. I just a little bit of background

36
00:03:38,091 --> 00:03:43,371
I mean my PhD 's in sociology and demography demography is a lot like

37
00:03:43,371 --> 00:03:48,431
epidemiology. there's some other slight differences that we can get into that. I won't right now but

38
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:53,431
they're both like look at the population level so demography is really what I think

39
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:58,971
of myself and then I actually do molecular biology postdoc at Princeton

40
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:04,151
got my PhD here and I have a masters in statistics so I have some of the same things but then

41
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:09,411
that sociology one is just kind of outside of the norm.

42
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:17,051
and so does it make that sound every time. like was trying to break in. yeah. okay.

43
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:22,271
so let's see let me talk a little bit about uniform interaction this is something that people

44
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:27,591
absolutely love and like the public the general public thinks this is like the most amazing

45
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:32,691
thing these are the sorts of things that you will find like stories on in the newspaper right and it kinda

46
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:37,751
makes sense. we would love to have gene environment interactions research like the really

47
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:42,831
big because we all kind of think that that's what's going on right so so let's say

48
00:04:42,831 --> 00:04:48,111
you have a genetic liability for alcoholism. but you grow up in a family

49
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:53,351
or in a society that alcohol isn't allowed. you're likely never

50
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:58,547
to be an alcoholic right that makes sense and then you can start thinking about that on instead

51
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:03,787
of like a country maybe you think of it as like a neighborhood or into the

52
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:08,907
south to be alcohol could be anything if you're not ever exposed to certain things reached exposed to much

53
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:14,527
less violence or nurturing or

54
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:19,587
you know food whatever could be that we we kinda have the sense that the genetics

55
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:24,647
interacts with the environment and the reality is for the next little

56
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:29,687
bit. you're gonna hear mostly reasons why well why this is so

57
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:34,867
hard to do this but that doesn't mean that Jean interactions aren't happening or

58
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:39,867
that you shouldn't be studying. we should be studying does that make sense so I'm gonna say like hey guys this

59
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:44,947
is this is really hard to do and actually almost impossible to do sometimes and most

60
00:05:44,947 --> 00:05:49,967
of the stuff that you've ever seen is probably wrong

61
00:05:49,967 --> 00:05:54,967
or at least just one data point and we need another thirty or forty before we can really

62
00:05:54,967 --> 00:06:00,111
make some conclusions okay with that. let's go so have an outline we'll talk a little bit about

63
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:05,231
models of gene environment action and you're saying there's more than one

64
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:10,291
tax BS there's all sources. behind how these things might interact

65
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:15,351
um and then I start using it because I can't type out Jean um what

66
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:20,351
what genes can be used what environments can be used um this

67
00:06:20,351 --> 00:06:25,391
really great thing for Jean environment correlation which is actually something I think

68
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:30,511
we're gonna see a lot of work on for the next decade at least before we start getting

69
00:06:30,511 --> 00:06:35,983
better gin about interactions. um power and replication.

70
00:06:35,983 --> 00:06:41,030
I think you guys will have the slide so here's there so many reviews about the Syria

71
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:46,350
behind you know of our interactions of papers. special issues American general public

72
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:51,530
else twenty thirteen which helped Stone long ago. um

73
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:56,890
but but yeah. so as well as psychology

74
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:01,970
and sociology they'll have different reviews. they rarely read each other which is

75
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:07,750
really frustrating. okay. so um. up until very recently.

76
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,810
I think you could describe Jennifer if I'm action pretty pretty easily. so if

77
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:18,350
you think about this wonderful. you know four squares here we have like an outcome.

78
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:23,490
so pick any outcome you want from a very bad. version of that outcome to a very positive version

79
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,490
of that you could do this from height to. I don't

80
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:35,230
know to some cognitive ability whatever you want. you pick two ends of the scale

81
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:41,039
one that you would consist you would maybe label is is lower or negative or whatever one is positive

82
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,259
then you have an environment from harsh to nurturing and this is key like the harsh

83
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:52,239
the middle of that is not necessarily harsh but it's also not and it's really nurturing. that's a key component.

84
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:57,419
the vast majority of work and I would say this is still true that's majority of workers

85
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:02,779
in this clot quite. so it's harsh

86
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:07,879
to not harsh and negative to not negative. not necessarily

87
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,919
the positive side of that outcome. so you know you might have a disease down here and

88
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:17,959
lack of disease. that's not the same as you know sometimes it's

89
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:23,059
hard to come up with the opposite of disease right. so think about that one for

90
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:28,059
a while though. don't ask me because I don't have a good question. I get a hundred years. think about once every few

91
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:33,059
who live a really long time. yeah. tires. yeah. yeah right

92
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:38,417
so in general longevity would work. that's kind of the opposite of mortality

93
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:43,697
yeah yeah. 's longevity with yeah. anyway this is been mostly it's

94
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:48,977
so and this is been the predominant model. so the faster stress model

95
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:54,277
which is essentially and this this ties in especially with the social workers risk now some

96
00:08:54,277 --> 00:08:59,377
some of focus mostly on social things we can say. so this is what I was

97
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:04,697
sparsely from not harsh and all parks.

98
00:09:04,697 --> 00:09:09,957
this wire variability for like the twin estimate versus

99
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:16,557
like actual measure about the outcome. so that's. so this is essentially

100
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:21,597
with over on this point right here. it would be that that bottom corner that I was

101
00:09:21,597 --> 00:09:26,657
talking about before um and so then I think about this as I do like comparing

102
00:09:26,657 --> 00:09:31,677
the idea that like asked the risk goes up the status

103
00:09:31,677 --> 00:09:36,717
is stress model suggests that genetics play a bigger role. that's the

104
00:09:36,717 --> 00:09:42,105
general idea um and so I put vantage sensitivity

105
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:47,345
which is a different model because that's actually the flip side of diet this is stress. that's for a

106
00:09:47,345 --> 00:09:54,825
like longevity it's like a positive model. positive outcome model and it's that.

107
00:09:54,825 --> 00:09:59,865
anyway so so I'll show you some more versions of that. so then comes this

108
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:05,005
and so that was I was almost all the research I mean I still feel like that's about ninety five ninety

109
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:10,605
six percent of the research is using this model right and you see this all the time so here's one group

110
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:15,885
girls at this rate can go you know that another rate at one point there together and then the separate.

111
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:20,925
that's the general idea. so differential sensitivity

112
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:25,965
or system differential susceptibility or Phoenix Phoenix at the capacitance

113
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:32,165
all of these are saying the exact same thing and that is just generally

114
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:37,385
well I'm gonna change one thing so this is this is where I actually disagree with this and I've already told

115
00:10:37,385 --> 00:10:42,459
the author this but he didn't change it it's just weird and I didn't

116
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:47,879
stop thinking about things is just being from risk from low risk to high risk but actually from

117
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:52,959
harsh to nurturing right and so in a neutral environment everyone kind

118
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,419
of the same but you know harsh environment one group does really really well

119
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:03,719
and and the nurturing environment the father group does really. so there's this cross over right in the mutual

120
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:08,759
environment everyone's the same. that's the general idea behind it so average

121
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:15,819
environment. jeans don't matter at the extremes they do

122
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:20,859
this once the other prominent one. there's a thing called the cork a dandelion hypothesis.

123
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:27,919
if you guess for that one before. so that's that's this analogy that people use

124
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,999
essentially people here with jeans that are like the dandelion versions

125
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:38,337
of the. essentially stay the same in every single and buyer

126
00:11:38,337 --> 00:11:43,437
the dandelions grow here to grow in Iceland and they

127
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:48,637
grow in Arizona right lots of different environments that all girls are the orchids however

128
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:53,797
cannot survive and all of those environment so and so they would perform quite poorly

129
00:11:53,797 --> 00:12:00,117
others they would actually you know very prolific.

130
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:06,577
so this is an exciting one. this is actually how I started my career with setting these things people eat fish

131
00:12:06,577 --> 00:12:11,757
because like yeah I I know who I know the dandy line in my family. I know the orchid and

132
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:17,637
my that's exactly where they go to it's wrong but that's where they go

133
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:22,697
to hear some other ones that you don't see very often but do exist and there are

134
00:12:22,697 --> 00:12:27,797
like you know a couple studies every year to try to test this social distinction you can start to see how

135
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:32,837
this works. if I'm gonna switch this again. um this idea that she

136
00:12:32,837 --> 00:12:37,875
go. - barns elsewhere. jeans matter the most um

137
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:44,275
that's where you really start to see separation is nurturing dogs. yeah.

138
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:49,435
's miles. yep yep these are different.

139
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:54,755
it's different expectations for how the jeans are interacting. so if you had a twin model.

140
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:59,835
you know you can test that this way by things we expected this like

141
00:12:59,835 --> 00:13:04,875
harsh environment. actually does really well. so

142
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:10,215
their social distinction and social push social push is really bizarre I've actually

143
00:13:10,215 --> 00:13:15,415
only seen theoretical uses the best one I've never actually seen someone tested but this is the idea

144
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:20,861
that ever expired Jesus matter the most

145
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:25,861
um and they have them they don't really matter at all at the extremes who

146
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:31,781
is different for for faster assistance trust uh yeah people are different strategies

147
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:37,221
right and the social and the social distinction people are there for

148
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:42,281
good writer and a social punch people are different in

149
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:47,461
both better doesn't them out in the middle and then with differential

150
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:52,981
susceptibility people are different sort of all along except ones legislating

151
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:58,121
yeah they same and one's movie yeah one. is changing. one is very responsive

152
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:04,041
to the environment and the other one is not at all response that makes sense. so

153
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:09,121
you can imagine essentially what you're doing is they're just taking different groups and trying to model all the

154
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:14,501
different ways to just get interact but the reason why this why is would well I could just ask but

155
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:20,554
why why would be important. actually have a series for how this is gonna interact before you test

156
00:14:20,554 --> 00:14:25,694
question I was just you guys both size and save up. before they

157
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:31,194
look they you know like we always look at the data before we come up with that. not always friendly I totally

158
00:14:31,194 --> 00:14:36,374
I'm not anything to hold you know could be yeah but like this

159
00:14:36,374 --> 00:14:42,054
kind sir still come at it from like some kind of serious

160
00:14:42,054 --> 00:14:47,054
respect right right sometimes. musicals are quite yeah. so why would you why would

161
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:56,734
you do that why would you have a for how these things interact before

162
00:14:56,734 --> 00:15:08,914
yeah go ahead.

163
00:15:08,914 --> 00:15:14,374
's. yeah no I think that's right so.

164
00:15:14,374 --> 00:15:19,634
so I think there's two ways to do this right one is to acknowledge and actually I feel like the whole field is moving

165
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:24,784
more towards the way I could imagine the get the genealogy does which is like oh hey. we actually have

166
00:15:24,784 --> 00:15:30,124
no idea what's gonna happen. so then we're just gonna test all of the different interactions

167
00:15:30,124 --> 00:15:35,804
were gonna say we're only gonna assume it's one type of interaction and just do it that way.

168
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:40,804
right as opposed to like a social sociologist would say like I really strongly believe it's gonna be

169
00:15:40,804 --> 00:15:46,784
this kind of model then ideally they would only test that kind of model.

170
00:15:46,784 --> 00:15:51,964
now the problem is is a lot of people might say like I run the interaction. I mean actually I'll talk about

171
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:56,984
this. I run the interaction and and I'm gonna see which version

172
00:15:56,984 --> 00:16:02,044
it is and then I'm gonna call at that and that's that's not the right way to do it. but in theory

173
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:07,444
if you have it. if you've maybe already tested certain like

174
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:12,604
sure you know little bit there's a whole set of genes that were candidate jeans that everyone thought where these differential susceptibility

175
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:18,764
ones the crossover ones orchid dandelion ones and so that was the starting hypothesis

176
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:24,144
and so then they had to test that specific model and

177
00:16:24,144 --> 00:16:31,664
yeah yes good

178
00:16:31,664 --> 00:16:39,164
yeah

179
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:44,564
that's great a question. so I think part of it is in this not just sociology

180
00:16:44,564 --> 00:16:49,964
I'll say like psychology also if falls into these camps I think there's a strong

181
00:16:49,964 --> 00:16:55,664
assumption that people do know what's going on a lotta times they don't

182
00:16:55,664 --> 00:17:02,004
I mean I was just at a conference where I kept seeing people get up and get these really detailed presentations

183
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:07,444
like the biology of a certain gene or certain system and I was going to

184
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:12,564
buy. I've seen all of that. I don't know that that's how that works. you

185
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:17,784
know Mike you you're basing this on like handful of papers and saying like this is exactly how this model works

186
00:17:17,784 --> 00:17:22,784
and I'm like that's that's too many mechanisms we don't know that that's true. um I think there's

187
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:28,080
part partly it's that but usually they have this you know either from literature

188
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,160
or an animal literature they'll say this is this is what we believe there's a knock out jeans.

189
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,320
here's what happened to the mice therefore we assume it's gonna happen right I mean that's really

190
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,380
the only way you know what's happening with jeans if you actually have. look

191
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,560
like here in the through yeah here where you not that our know theirselves you or

192
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,580
animals and then you have to do that. yeah which a lot of

193
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,780
times that doesn't translate over but but it's a fair question and I'm not I don't wanna like

194
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:03,820
harp on these are people who are very smart. trying to draw on the literature that they have and not used

195
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:09,620
to the idea of being agnostic. they're used they're like driven by the idea of having hypotheses

196
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:14,740
and testing a hypothesis and and they would actually call doing what

197
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,820
what we typically do in my genetic epidemiology day would think that's

198
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:25,844
you know data dredging. so they wouldn't see it as actually productive science

199
00:18:25,844 --> 00:18:31,144
so it's different ways of doing things um so you know there you have the gene environment

200
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:36,704
action most of it today. there's bandage sensitivity which is kind of the so the positive environment

201
00:18:36,704 --> 00:18:41,844
side differential sensitivity susceptibility orchid again line is still

202
00:18:41,844 --> 00:18:47,664
the school you from parts to nurturing the ideas that you have both um

203
00:18:47,664 --> 00:18:52,804
but still the point comes out like they're still not a lot of work

204
00:18:52,804 --> 00:18:57,924
kind of in the supper space of like longevity or kind of more positive outcomes there's more but

205
00:18:57,924 --> 00:19:04,324
not not the time. I'll show you a few examples of this coming up. so

206
00:19:04,324 --> 00:19:23,604
so I can go saying something. so yeah go ahead.

207
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:29,040
yeah

208
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,180
yeah. yes so so like um. so

209
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:39,740
look at the rep susceptibility right so even just keep it the same I don't have like the pages.

210
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:45,100
so this is using twin data right so this is like when Eugene jeans matter. I'm

211
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:51,300
not a specific interaction but when the team. so so for us it matters

212
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:56,474
how it matters. average stuff right and then then actually this in

213
00:19:56,474 --> 00:20:03,414
the difference between the difference of susceptibility. the idea is that that role.

214
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:08,634
there's there's a difference here so the genetic

215
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:13,734
difference years. this different genetic but you see that the groups are

216
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:19,054
different like which ones on top one for getting

217
00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:25,174
you know it's just related to the like where in the environmental spectrum Eugene.

218
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:30,354
yeah and like how did go to groups look to make him like they look the same

219
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:35,514
as your member and they're always looking different. yeah right. so is this is

220
00:20:35,514 --> 00:20:42,014
to shake and you know where yeah.

221
00:20:42,014 --> 00:20:47,214
so. so yes that's roundabout to get to some of the formal stuff I mean I can't get into a lot of the heavy details

222
00:20:47,214 --> 00:20:52,734
of it but like that's what this formal. so originally the work was literally like a.

223
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:58,245
I'm gonna do statistical interaction and an up slot the curves and then I'm gonna determine

224
00:20:58,245 --> 00:21:03,385
which one it looks like the most that was I was I really do think that was like

225
00:21:03,385 --> 00:21:08,945
for several years. that's what that was now it's been there's been a larger push to do exactly this

226
00:21:08,945 --> 00:21:13,945
to distinguish between these models and so if you really are interested in it's like there are several

227
00:21:13,945 --> 00:21:19,145
different papers. you can go to look up and like read heavy details of like how do you just

228
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:24,245
increase to small versus this how much of a crossover do you have to have. where do these regions

229
00:21:24,245 --> 00:21:29,385
of significance line. I'll talk about that in a second so right now. regions of significance

230
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:34,765
either values of the environmental variable for which the moderator significantly associated

231
00:21:34,765 --> 00:21:39,885
with the outcome. so um part of this is determined by what ends up happening

232
00:21:39,885 --> 00:21:44,905
sometimes people do these interactions and then they like that.

233
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:49,925
you know if two lines are not parallel. they will eventually cross right so the

234
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:55,231
quote one of the questions this is where and where does that lie and if that doesn't line a realistic environment

235
00:21:55,231 --> 00:22:00,691
then it probably isn't gene environment interactions and so part of that is teasing

236
00:22:00,691 --> 00:22:06,351
out like where does that where that lies that a reasonable place where it's significantly

237
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:11,571
different where the genetic difference or the interaction is different. um

238
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:17,031
and then just get that kind of the other points like if there's a crossover over the proportion

239
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:22,331
of interaction so the proportion of interaction I'll show you some examples of don't worry too much about the definition.

240
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:27,871
it really is talking about how much of that whole graph.

241
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:32,951
um do you see like a crossover. so

242
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:38,511
I'm just show you what this looks like this is an example this is a great paper if you wanna look into a little bit more

243
00:22:38,511 --> 00:22:43,531
um. so proportion of interaction will can see that you guys have

244
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:48,751
it on your screens to right. okay good because like there's a great part of here that really

245
00:22:48,751 --> 00:22:53,995
cool the screen. oh yeah

246
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:59,795
interesting the stuff. so so here

247
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:05,275
and here. so rewind in the black line solutions and

248
00:23:05,275 --> 00:23:10,275
this is supposed to be sure the proportion is either zero or one that's just

249
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:16,375
depending the label which side but the ideas like that's

250
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:22,095
you know the – this is stress is kind of hazy up there. so

251
00:23:22,095 --> 00:23:27,835
you know as it becomes if you have a really harsh environment it's becoming better

252
00:23:27,835 --> 00:23:33,615
really adjust to it. six. this is Bass sensitivity

253
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:38,775
right so there's still no crossover these other two versions of those I

254
00:23:38,775 --> 00:23:44,495
asked us to stress model where there are some amount of overlap

255
00:23:44,495 --> 00:23:49,815
and so one of the things that happens is you know to some of the truth I asked us is for small

256
00:23:49,815 --> 00:23:55,117
happened between forty and forty six percent. so

257
00:23:55,117 --> 00:24:00,237
um I mean which is the spark divided by

258
00:24:00,237 --> 00:24:05,457
the total to be between

259
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:12,317
forty and sixty percent. you know so fifty would mean that it's it's you know

260
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:17,317
it's like on middle the. but you know that's that's the sort of thing that they're

261
00:24:17,317 --> 00:24:22,397
saying okay you have to have a crossover you have to have the regions of significance have to be reasonable. so

262
00:24:22,397 --> 00:24:27,417
they start formally testing how do you calculate that when you start forcing people to do this

263
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:33,537
very very quickly start to see the regions of significance aren't realistic.

264
00:24:33,537 --> 00:24:38,557
and a lot of times this crossover is like very very it's

265
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:43,637
like ten percent of the total and then you start to say like is that really a crossover

266
00:24:43,637 --> 00:24:48,817
or suggest you know every time we get back to this another

267
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:54,037
little bit with money when you talk about power. um. so

268
00:24:54,037 --> 00:24:59,335
anyway if you really care a lot about how to achieve these out.

269
00:24:59,335 --> 00:25:04,495
there's a lot you know there's a lot of formal testing models.

270
00:25:04,495 --> 00:25:09,715
yeah there you go. so let's talk a little bit about putting the gene and gene

271
00:25:09,715 --> 00:25:15,975
environment action. I think I mentioned this before the original work really look the candidate genes.

272
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:21,055
the search on transporter gene was probably like the most famous ones I'm and actually

273
00:25:21,055 --> 00:25:26,175
I don't know if you guys ever seen that one. I had the chance this last week actually sit down with both

274
00:25:26,175 --> 00:25:31,255
Cassidy and Moffett who wrote that and that was pretty interesting. actually asked him a little bit

275
00:25:31,255 --> 00:25:36,295
about it. they have they honestly have like they've been beat up on

276
00:25:36,295 --> 00:25:41,635
that one like you know you know like an unfair and fairways and on fairways. has

277
00:25:41,635 --> 00:25:47,615
like date day really have a hard time talking about it. we for people that for.

278
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:53,035
yeah. Berman or ask you for about those are for regards to golf. yeah on that last

279
00:25:53,035 --> 00:25:58,175
class. yeah yeah it's interesting I mean there so

280
00:25:58,175 --> 00:26:03,435
anyway we can go on about that for a lot more but there's but there's other versions and they always another one that they did

281
00:26:03,435 --> 00:26:08,995
do a few once you want to you like again like ten years ago if you'd rattled these off this is what everyone

282
00:26:08,995 --> 00:26:14,595
in the gene environment world study. yeah and they're like girlfriends sweaters and things

283
00:26:14,595 --> 00:26:19,735
biologically. yeah right for the future and respond for the big sun

284
00:26:19,735 --> 00:26:24,875
and make sure these have solid animal model work behind them you know so

285
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:30,015
there's a lot of reasons this is suspect these would be important genes.

286
00:26:30,015 --> 00:26:35,183
interestingly most of these do not ever show up and I need you walk us I seem to get talked about

287
00:26:35,183 --> 00:26:40,343
you off and if I kind of them show up in in any psychological due

288
00:26:40,343 --> 00:26:45,423
loss. there's a recent meta analysis just showing that night none of these pop might be a reason for

289
00:26:45,423 --> 00:26:50,423
that we'll talk about that in a second too or maybe at the end but that's how this all

290
00:26:50,423 --> 00:26:57,603
started. but it's also it's also done a very small samples little focus on your application.

291
00:26:57,603 --> 00:27:04,263
it's now still being done. although much less and really mostly in psychology interestingly

292
00:27:04,263 --> 00:27:09,383
there is some work to try to you prove registration and I'd like really think carefully about biological possibility

293
00:27:09,383 --> 00:27:15,403
but in general outside of psychology it on the psychology they're really not used as much anymore.

294
00:27:15,403 --> 00:27:21,043
um but now we're starting to use other things such as burden scores

295
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:26,283
or did you guys do like guess cat and things like that. talk about yeah actually

296
00:27:26,283 --> 00:27:31,383
that questions about the social genealogy came up inside.

297
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:36,640
yeah. um papers your paper. yeah and then um

298
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,120
we talked about you the know first course which college college. yes yes.

299
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:48,400
so people are using more and more these things haven't seen a Wendy 's candies but like that's like that's certainly kept coming.

300
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,540
so like doing like more sophisticated measures of jeans because one thing I did mention about these.

301
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:58,600
's tone and and anyway they used the name of the gene but if you actually read

302
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,780
the paper they use like one snap or one length polymorphism for

303
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:08,780
five HDT see one teases is almost always just one snap

304
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:13,840
and as you guys have now learned like one step does not make a Jean and so it

305
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,840
seems a little ridiculous but that's that's the way to describe it. also the animal models weren't

306
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:24,040
based on knocking out a snap. typically they knocked out a whole gene which you can imagine

307
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,180
has a very different affect enough and I can't once in. so the thing that I would

308
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:35,030
warn you about though is think carefully about how the genes were discovered

309
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:40,790
but I mean there's a couple things to think about first and foremost they're almost oldest

310
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:46,730
discovered and non- representative. European ancestry

311
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:51,950
samples right so it may not apply to every single population

312
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:57,030
and it may not actually even applied to like a lower SES European

313
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:02,090
ancestry samples. so think carefully about that but also the way that we

314
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:07,690
do typically do genetic studies. we're not accounting for the environment in anyway.

315
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:12,750
so there is a potential that we are actually finding across I can did you ah 's. if

316
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:17,990
you're doing this and the million people you're finding signals that have to essentially

317
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:23,010
make it through all environments or you know they have to penetrate all these

318
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:28,970
different types of environments if you have a mix of studies. you might actually be purposefully

319
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:34,388
or not purposely but accidentally removing a lot of the gene environment

320
00:29:34,388 --> 00:29:39,668
genes that are actually interacting with the environment and picking up things that have made a fax on something

321
00:29:39,668 --> 00:29:44,988
carefully about that um the people are still doing but that's always one concern

322
00:29:44,988 --> 00:29:50,028
I have um yeah constraint yeah that's that's

323
00:29:50,028 --> 00:29:55,088
what I just said get um another thing to think carefully about display natural

324
00:29:55,088 --> 00:30:01,648
behaviors talk about this I don't wanna yeah we deliberated you know. um okay.

325
00:30:01,648 --> 00:30:06,768
yeah I remember the set I mean so there's several distraught leave this up there. yeah did I talk about that.

326
00:30:06,768 --> 00:30:11,808
so this version of it well actually if you could call them are gonna do like

327
00:30:11,808 --> 00:30:16,948
score. okay. great great. so this is agreed to talk about it yeah

328
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:22,048
so we'll talk about it a little bit. because you can go on and on for a long time so on this you have the blue

329
00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:27,128
bar is Jean is Star the cost variance which we

330
00:30:27,128 --> 00:30:32,262
almost never get to observe it would be great if we could just you know type those

331
00:30:32,262 --> 00:30:38,122
and then the S is the step that we have identified in some some way.

332
00:30:38,122 --> 00:30:43,602
right and so just keep keep keep looking at where the stars are and where the assets are

333
00:30:43,602 --> 00:30:48,902
you know so you have one biological try to apply actual be which is a single variant actually causes

334
00:30:48,902 --> 00:30:54,022
multiple phenotype types right and you can imagine different ways that I can happen

335
00:30:54,022 --> 00:30:59,102
um and you're capturing so. so that's fine. which is like a lot of what we used to

336
00:30:59,102 --> 00:31:04,342
yeah the time we talk about leisure and were kind thinking about that. yes yep

337
00:31:04,342 --> 00:31:09,342
another one is that there's action two calls a variance and you have a snip that is maybe associated with both of

338
00:31:09,342 --> 00:31:14,442
them and that can certainly be problematic. trying to tease out which one which

339
00:31:14,442 --> 00:31:19,722
calls a very interested in another one is within the same gene

340
00:31:19,722 --> 00:31:24,842
maybe. 's have some solid LP. you have two steps

341
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:30,042
but they're related to to call variance the again the point is is that these are variants

342
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:36,716
that you're measuring that may end up having um you know multiple from the types

343
00:31:36,716 --> 00:31:42,016
because yes they don't always just have one mediated tightrope trophies a little bit harder but it's essentially

344
00:31:42,016 --> 00:31:47,076
that the calls of very it's costing one phenotype and asking a of type

345
00:31:47,076 --> 00:31:53,176
leading to another screen type through another process and that that's the second process actually could be so

346
00:31:53,176 --> 00:31:58,176
this could be someone from the time because of the environment that you're living

347
00:31:58,176 --> 00:32:03,516
in results the different. I mean the city biological

348
00:32:03,516 --> 00:32:08,516
system something else. so maybe you only ever see this one. that's why gets a

349
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:13,596
little complicated to try to tease that out. um miss classification I think that

350
00:32:13,596 --> 00:32:19,976
one's a little more obvious like sometimes you just you think it's once you decide but it's really something else

351
00:32:19,976 --> 00:32:26,336
and it's very it's these two things are just correlated. this is actually very similar to this

352
00:32:26,336 --> 00:32:31,518
different genes different keys I don't know. mostly

353
00:32:31,518 --> 00:32:36,638
back on everything because sometimes people are defined as well sometimes

354
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:42,178
team of the in finest the region. Jews are strongly released.

355
00:32:42,178 --> 00:32:47,858
you can't really tell the difference like where the police are right. yeah.

356
00:32:47,858 --> 00:32:52,878
my point behind this is just to say like think now back to that original gene

357
00:32:52,878 --> 00:32:57,898
environment interactions that are sure where they grab the one one snips

358
00:32:57,898 --> 00:33:02,898
and then the interacted with one environment and and protected one outcome. they're

359
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:07,898
all sorts of potential problems and then it's not really a surprise that things aren't replicating

360
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:13,570
right you have a different steps you have a different environment and you have a different outcome and then it's not surprising that

361
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:18,930
there's kind of a mess. so let me talk a little good about

362
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:24,250
the environment in general I'm interactions. I'm one of the things that I think is really really important

363
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:29,590
and that's this is my molecular biology training freaking in

364
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:34,730
Sudan sedan not minimalist. he still is for blacks or biologist that work with he

365
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:40,210
would always say like you need to stop. he's need to stop talking about it. these things are not biological

366
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:45,470
we don't know what they are it's the status it is it's a statistical interaction but doesn't

367
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:50,750
actually mean that the environment somehow is doing anything with Jean.

368
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:55,970
in fact most of the time it's not doing anything with it right. so but it's weird because we talk

369
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:01,110
about Jesus the last like to have like a personality and they're like out in the world interacting with

370
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:06,450
like this site but that's not true. so it's have to be really careful

371
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:11,869
not actually gets back to the tightrope tropic component right there so many different mechanisms in between gene

372
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:17,189
and and it's been type and it somewhere at some point that happening

373
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:22,489
and I would argue that most of the time we we don't know a lot about how an environment somehow

374
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:27,529
is influencing Jean and most of the time at least the way

375
00:34:27,529 --> 00:34:33,009
sociologist would think about is that doesn't matter what really matters is more like here's this social

376
00:34:33,009 --> 00:34:38,109
environment and people are responding to it or are interacting in

377
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:44,309
it you know like like I was saying about like a law about you live in a place where

378
00:34:44,309 --> 00:34:49,469
alcohol is illegal. you know it doesn't matter how the gene 's

379
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:54,489
is responding to it. it's just that's the social environment that's what they care about and

380
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:59,549
and another one the. jeans are predicting an outcome but it's

381
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:04,549
still a statistical interaction. so one of the things I usually argue

382
00:35:04,549 --> 00:35:10,423
for is if you're doing a Jean my interaction

383
00:35:10,423 --> 00:35:16,303
what the environment be interesting or convincing. if you didn't have to gee.

384
00:35:16,303 --> 00:35:21,623
the reason why raise this is again if you go to kind of early the literature a lot of times people would just say

385
00:35:21,623 --> 00:35:26,743
I'm gonna grab any old environment and any old jeans interact and I'm just gonna

386
00:35:26,743 --> 00:35:31,783
keep interacting these until I find something right so preferably you would

387
00:35:31,783 --> 00:35:37,103
pick an environment that you know matters for the outcome. because otherwise you're

388
00:35:37,103 --> 00:35:42,843
you know you're just hurting yourself why would you test things that you don't think matter.

389
00:35:42,843 --> 00:35:47,903
another there's a whole another set of literature mostly from economics folks focuses on the Dodge and

390
00:35:47,903 --> 00:35:53,003
eighty. um I can't remember if you give me let you guys talk about things you know it's

391
00:35:53,003 --> 00:35:58,303
about the Dodge and eighty. don't you don't. okay. so.

392
00:35:58,303 --> 00:36:03,423
so we'll talk about this Gina Farmer correlation but essentially the idea is. so economist care

393
00:36:03,423 --> 00:36:08,881
tremendously they would they would trade everything else mechanism

394
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:14,061
the understanding of like being general will to anyone they really would trade

395
00:36:14,061 --> 00:36:19,201
just about everything else to know that they have a consulate fest right to the way you get a calls

396
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:24,821
affected you have something that clearly no one can either select into the treatment

397
00:36:24,821 --> 00:36:29,981
or no one can um somehow influence like the person 's own

398
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:35,281
characteristics can't be in Dodge. so they study things like

399
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:40,321
earthquakes and the of like a policy where it's like seems like it's

400
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:46,921
a random assignment of which policy you guess for they they do CT our and

401
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:51,921
so those are all excited you know environments. the

402
00:36:51,921 --> 00:36:56,961
reason why you're interested in that is what if your jeans are correlated with the environment that you're in.

403
00:36:56,961 --> 00:37:03,461
do you really know that it's Gina by interaction for you just capturing a gene environment correlation

404
00:37:03,461 --> 00:37:08,767
and I'll get to GM army correlations in the second and the problem is is

405
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:13,807
how exhausting this environment it is and how generalized bull are usually at odds with each other.

406
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:19,287
so in an environment that's like you know poverty or something like that.

407
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:25,447
rarely and exhaustion us right we don't randomly select people into poverty or not.

408
00:37:25,447 --> 00:37:30,507
so something that's really interesting to study because it applies to so many people

409
00:37:30,507 --> 00:37:37,247
rarely is exhaustion us. that's the problem so which one do you go with

410
00:37:37,247 --> 00:37:42,387
him and then yes do you. and then the other thing is if you're thinking about this the paying

411
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:47,647
model you have do you have harsh version of that. you have a nurturing version

412
00:37:47,647 --> 00:37:52,687
of that to be able to test some of these different statistical models you can start to see how this

413
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:58,127
becomes like really challenging to pull off thoughtfully.

414
00:37:58,127 --> 00:38:03,719
but that's that's I told you guys I warned you that you would be like the past

415
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:09,959
after this but one of the things I like a lot of sociologists have gone into

416
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:15,099
and demography versus they look at like really big environments so not

417
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:20,639
like what what parenting did you experience or even poverty but like historical context

418
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:26,639
because clearly your genes didn't select you into what birth your you had um

419
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:31,899
there's actually just went down the path where that could happen but let's let's ignore that for second. um

420
00:38:31,899 --> 00:38:37,759
you know so they look at like historical things so these are different cohorts in the house firemen study.

421
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:42,899
this is your genetic risk for like a few my college for different

422
00:38:42,899 --> 00:38:48,379
pools. how big of the fact that pledge course has

423
00:38:48,379 --> 00:38:54,819
it different for different colors right. this by the way is it for

424
00:38:54,819 --> 00:39:00,339
sample sample. um

425
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:05,535
this actually all of this you know held nice and orderly like so

426
00:39:05,535 --> 00:39:10,715
far. this is primarily driven by food that score was

427
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:16,035
right. so it's not that this is true this is more like the score that was created

428
00:39:16,035 --> 00:39:21,415
one. Austin doesn't work quite the same and then other.

429
00:39:21,415 --> 00:39:26,955
so that's a little bit why that can be confusing and that seems to be true whenever we

430
00:39:26,955 --> 00:39:32,115
plus force from one group to another. maybe Federal and you can they sample size

431
00:39:32,115 --> 00:39:37,155
issues to yeah although you have you have this day. yeah the confidence intervals. so you can

432
00:39:37,155 --> 00:39:43,155
see that there little more spread to what they do this like smoking.

433
00:39:43,155 --> 00:39:48,515
you can see how G how the genetic liability for smoking has changed

434
00:39:48,515 --> 00:39:53,753
as laws have become more lax and then more rigid for smoking and who could

435
00:39:53,753 --> 00:39:58,913
but who could smoke and how much smoking cost and things like

436
00:39:58,913 --> 00:40:04,033
that. whose the same the people who are for and leave cold war you have

437
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:09,693
bigger probably potentially where we are

438
00:40:09,693 --> 00:40:16,013
not exercising as much for a wide range of whatever. yeah yeah

439
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:21,033
so that's one way that people kinda get around it that some of that discussion but you have people

440
00:40:21,033 --> 00:40:26,153
use all sorts of things there's people who abuse like the Vietnam draft. there's a random

441
00:40:26,153 --> 00:40:31,393
elation component or the use policies that interviewed on the whole like

442
00:40:31,393 --> 00:40:36,473
they do in the UK there's educational policies that change like how long you had to go to school and

443
00:40:36,473 --> 00:40:42,233
you see how that interacts with jeans. it's pretty interesting

444
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:47,313
for now I think I'm gonna skip this week and come back to it essentially the main

445
00:40:47,313 --> 00:40:52,562
point behind this this is whatever model you have often you don't get to see the full environment

446
00:40:52,562 --> 00:40:57,842
you only get to see part of it and then see only gets the part of the interaction and that may not convey

447
00:40:57,842 --> 00:41:03,062
all of the information so

448
00:41:03,062 --> 00:41:08,182
you know I think you guys understand that. okay let's talk a little bit about gene environment

449
00:41:08,182 --> 00:41:13,242
correlation because I think I I don't know I feel like this is where a lot of work

450
00:41:13,242 --> 00:41:18,262
that I'm saying like it's coming out is like okay we really can't figure out all the interactions

451
00:41:18,262 --> 00:41:23,342
us to start with the environment. so first of all you should know like if they're strong and armor

452
00:41:23,342 --> 00:41:28,382
correlation. your gym I'm interactions are not gonna be well powered. I mean it just

453
00:41:28,382 --> 00:41:33,782
makes sense but let's ignore that for second that's just kind of the minor point.

454
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:39,342
so there different types of gene environment correlation to you guys talked about this at all.

455
00:41:39,342 --> 00:41:44,542
please. okay. so the one is is probably one that makes the most

456
00:41:44,542 --> 00:41:49,718
sense to you. your jeans drive you for

457
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:54,878
I mean I can see I'm even giving jeans personalities that you know but our character

458
00:41:54,878 --> 00:42:00,298
if you and are you know part of you know your characteristics are are

459
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:05,558
are encouraging which way which environment you select right so you can imagine

460
00:42:05,558 --> 00:42:10,618
whether or not you have a propensity for enjoying certain types of food

461
00:42:10,618 --> 00:42:15,698
which I know there's no specific score for that but imagine that versus um you know maybe you

462
00:42:15,698 --> 00:42:20,698
have fancy towards ADHD so that dries that that seems to like promote you to go to going to

463
00:42:20,698 --> 00:42:26,358
certain fields. you can imagine lots of different versions. this is why most people talk about

464
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:32,258
a bucket if it's a slightly different version. it's the same thing. your own jeans

465
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:37,978
are producing a phenotype of some sort whether that's behavioral or physical

466
00:42:37,978 --> 00:42:43,038
in the environment is responding to that. if you and and

467
00:42:43,038 --> 00:42:49,918
changing in response to that. like if you have a child

468
00:42:49,918 --> 00:42:54,978
yeah for example concert sheet yeah. so I don't know any

469
00:42:54,978 --> 00:43:00,058
can notice also. so parenting is one that that

470
00:43:00,058 --> 00:43:05,138
we that we use a lot as an example it's a really good example right so kids often don't get

471
00:43:05,138 --> 00:43:10,178
determined. don't get to determine like what what environment you know

472
00:43:10,178 --> 00:43:16,178
they don't get to choose that but the environment doesn't morph around how they are acting

473
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:21,338
but if you take a step further vaccinate that. I'm gonna challenge you guys about the something

474
00:43:21,338 --> 00:43:27,118
haven't I really spoken as much about they're all sorts of other genes that are related to physical traits

475
00:43:27,118 --> 00:43:32,198
from gender to race to all sorts of things right then

476
00:43:32,198 --> 00:43:37,198
the environment response to that phenotype and says

477
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:42,678
you can only do so much for you go here or this is what happens to you. that's Jean environment correlation.

478
00:43:42,678 --> 00:43:47,758
it doesn't mean that those jeans are causally related to the outcome of

479
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:53,230
the phenotype you know the alternate like environment that you're interested in like directly

480
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:59,570
from that Jean. but their environment is responding to.

481
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:05,550
so that's an evocative spot that's a much larger like social like evocative response.

482
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:10,650
you know some parenting is kind of a Michael environment a larger social. the one that's

483
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:15,650
kind of the most exciting and also the most challenging to kind of tease out is that our

484
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:20,690
jeans are passed down from our parents. by the way most of our environment is passed down from

485
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:25,870
our parents. 's or jeans and our vitamins are are are strongly correlated to pass

486
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:31,270
up my relation I'm gonna show you some really cool work because there's a lot of studies now that have parent and child

487
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:36,310
genotypes you and there's doing some interesting stuff there. so I think what's

488
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:41,410
really cool is more recently this work is kind of gotten us phone like set legs instead of saying like

489
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:46,430
we need to get rid of gene environment correlation studied you know my interaction people are saying actual that

490
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:51,502
you studied your environment correlation because that seems to be a leash with the social side because

491
00:44:51,502 --> 00:44:56,602
that seems to be where this is where we can actually find something reasonable

492
00:44:56,602 --> 00:45:02,182
selection into different environments mediation and you know some mediation

493
00:45:02,182 --> 00:45:07,242
of jeans into search like to to environments and to outcomes flush a little bit what

494
00:45:07,242 --> 00:45:12,882
I mean so great paper. if you ever wanna read this is Dan Belsky 's. the genetics of success.

495
00:45:12,882 --> 00:45:18,062
he states that he called that but it's genes related to education and all those of the life

496
00:45:18,062 --> 00:45:23,162
course environments and developmental processes that

497
00:45:23,162 --> 00:45:28,182
we're tied to this. gee walks of education. so you

498
00:45:28,182 --> 00:45:33,902
know from earlier talking and reading to cognitive development so they're actually select prediction bring

499
00:45:33,902 --> 00:45:40,682
size and actually have in our study to non- cognitive controls academic performance.

500
00:45:40,682 --> 00:45:46,122
this is an interesting one. I just thought presented not not too long ago. so this is the project

501
00:45:46,122 --> 00:45:51,370
score for education. if you go talk about this before that. if you also education

502
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:56,530
no I'm not as like not like yeah well so you know I. have okay

503
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:01,670
see you guys know that you know so you understand how apologetic scores that's messed that I have you mind that save

504
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:06,930
apologize for predicting such a hellfire school disconnected and adults. this is now applied

505
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:12,050
to these kids and so this is education genetics and and boatman the of behavioral problems.

506
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:17,510
kids with a lower apologetic scores are in red. they have more

507
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:22,730
contact disorders or contact us to dispense with convictions

508
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:27,850
as it goes goes up right so that's pretty interesting so this is development trajectory

509
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:32,966
there and let me show you something else so this

510
00:46:32,966 --> 00:46:38,366
is from this is from the Moffitt and Cassidy groups said Tammy Moffett

511
00:46:38,366 --> 00:46:43,506
Terry Moffett. you know one of the things that she was famous for status showing using

512
00:46:43,506 --> 00:46:52,166
behavioral data. how different groups of people have kind of different

513
00:46:52,166 --> 00:46:57,366
kind of role line like never really do much of anything in the group that's high exciting that's

514
00:46:57,366 --> 00:47:02,606
that red line right. so that's like classic psychology and those jeans

515
00:47:02,606 --> 00:47:07,966
and your education school or jeans are related to which group you seem

516
00:47:07,966 --> 00:47:13,046
to see such predict about that. not choosing out why that is whole

517
00:47:13,046 --> 00:47:18,246
different story. it's predictive like the people are now starting she's out like what is it about

518
00:47:18,246 --> 00:47:24,346
these which jeans if we separate the score to different types of jeans too restarts are able to predict

519
00:47:24,346 --> 00:47:29,403
which ones are related to cognition which ones are related to behavioral concerns things like

520
00:47:29,403 --> 00:47:39,263
that so that's kind of the world that we're living in right now. yeah so head

521
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:44,503
yeah yeah like how you guys can redo the sort of papers right down here you guys should really read

522
00:47:44,503 --> 00:47:49,843
it. so I can go that's a pretty pretty intense is now this is

523
00:47:49,843 --> 00:47:54,943
to be fair. this is a cohort of about a thousand people in New Zealand

524
00:47:54,943 --> 00:48:00,383
New Zealand. so maybe not like

525
00:48:00,383 --> 00:48:05,883
kids in inner city Detroit and their experiences fishing village.

526
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:11,403
but it's still you know we're actually showing that it's protected in Detroit bike right now.

527
00:48:11,403 --> 00:48:17,043
you would be shocked at home while the educational ones are actually

528
00:48:17,043 --> 00:48:22,163
fax a in variety of environmental crime you see Friday of each other. yeah

529
00:48:22,163 --> 00:48:27,223
it's actually sunny but why would that be now now that you

530
00:48:27,223 --> 00:48:32,655
guys know about GM impression why would it be the apologetic score for education would protect just

531
00:48:32,655 --> 00:48:37,815
about everything just about every age it feels like it's not quite sure but like it takes

532
00:48:37,815 --> 00:48:45,955
a lotta different ages and a different environment.

533
00:48:45,955 --> 00:48:51,315
well what does it take to get a college degree.

534
00:48:51,315 --> 00:48:56,855
you kinda have to have a lotta different things going on right. you can't just be smart.

535
00:48:56,855 --> 00:49:01,895
you guess guys since you guys are here. you're not just smart but you had a whole

536
00:49:01,895 --> 00:49:07,175
bunch of other things some of those things are like your own behaviors. other things

537
00:49:07,175 --> 00:49:12,435
are it's kind of carried along with you from your environment. so it's all mixed and

538
00:49:12,435 --> 00:49:17,535
yeah. yeah so this is yeah

539
00:49:17,535 --> 00:49:22,575
this is in New Zealand. yeah now how well has it been like tested and

540
00:49:22,575 --> 00:49:27,843
let's say Latin America Africa

541
00:49:27,843 --> 00:49:33,243
not really Europe for sure a rubble of Europe critics pretty well in united states

542
00:49:33,243 --> 00:49:38,403
and I mean so like in our study. I run a child study will they're not kids anymore they're all

543
00:49:38,403 --> 00:49:43,583
eighteen. um but we fallen since birth and um

544
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:48,703
the like sample these predicts just like this and the other samples

545
00:49:48,703 --> 00:50:09,243
and the other portions they don't protect nearly as well.

546
00:50:09,243 --> 00:50:15,263
's. we kind of asking about like

547
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:20,763
like this is a educational achievement which in the is concept it's not necessarily intelligence

548
00:50:20,763 --> 00:50:32,989
is not necessarily right yeah. yeah if you. so

549
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:49,549
yes yes that's actually right

550
00:50:49,549 --> 00:50:55,429
right. so pretty it's

551
00:50:55,429 --> 00:51:04,869
's

552
00:51:04,869 --> 00:51:09,909
right right I think that's so. so your test you're tapping into this idea that you know so

553
00:51:09,909 --> 00:51:15,009
the temptation is for people to say well this education is the score for intelligence but it's

554
00:51:15,009 --> 00:51:20,009
far more complicated than that. there might be a little bit of cognitive memory capabilities mixed in

555
00:51:20,009 --> 00:51:25,069
there but there's behavioral things and there's also environment mixed into that too right for some

556
00:51:25,069 --> 00:51:30,225
people never had a chance to go to school and if that is something that's pretty consistent with

557
00:51:30,225 --> 00:51:35,405
in their genotype because of like to have evocative you know environment correlation.

558
00:51:35,405 --> 00:51:40,445
that's gonna show up in there too. so this is where like trying to Jesus out is kind of

559
00:51:40,445 --> 00:51:46,285
become a big thing. just relay this is a slightly different paper by the same group.

560
00:51:46,285 --> 00:51:51,705
actually I'll ignore this for now. talk time

561
00:51:51,705 --> 00:51:57,585
change for education. actually predict migration out to different places.

562
00:51:57,585 --> 00:52:02,785
so this is how far like it's predictable wide range of things.

563
00:52:02,785 --> 00:52:08,425
I just wanted to cover quickly into passage and I know we're like getting close to the time but I have fine.

564
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:13,725
I also know that I like well no I just I also know that at some point I have to

565
00:52:13,725 --> 00:52:18,805
leave because my daughter 's playing volleyball game. so I wanna catch that too. so you guys are gonna

566
00:52:18,805 --> 00:52:24,145
hang with me a little bit longer. so so this is a really

567
00:52:24,145 --> 00:52:29,185
new papers like was the twenty nineteen. yeah. 's publishing twenty nineteen I just reviewed this

568
00:52:29,185 --> 00:52:34,685
paper before a few months ago it's not published which is great. so this is

569
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:39,905
a different group of people. um but actually it's the same group is still the Caspian

570
00:52:39,905 --> 00:52:45,985
massacres like they they started early and they're still getting lots of papers

571
00:52:45,985 --> 00:52:51,265
but this was using they have sent where they have the parents

572
00:52:51,265 --> 00:52:56,405
jeans and the kids jeans and they this right here. you can't really see we can maybe

573
00:52:56,405 --> 00:53:01,485
see it on your screen. this is just a child's Paul education apologetic score.

574
00:53:01,485 --> 00:53:07,197
protecting several different types of parenting behaviors. so you might say

575
00:53:07,197 --> 00:53:14,437
this could be a evocative gene environment correlation right so the kids jeans are somehow

576
00:53:14,437 --> 00:53:19,637
causing the parent to resulting in a phenotype that then cost of the parent

577
00:53:19,637 --> 00:53:24,637
either provide more cognitive stimulation more sensitive parenting lower household

578
00:53:24,637 --> 00:53:29,857
chaos safe tidy right that's the idea but then what they did is they said well

579
00:53:29,857 --> 00:53:34,937
actually less control for both the mother 's college escort and the kids apologize for what you see is

580
00:53:34,937 --> 00:53:40,217
for things like cognitive stimulation. both of them are predicting that so it's not just

581
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:45,237
provocative and it's not just passes. if they were all passive. it would be the

582
00:53:45,237 --> 00:53:50,237
mom 's Jean pricks the behavior and protect the kids jeans

583
00:53:50,237 --> 00:53:55,557
right. but it's both both are going on and I'm gonna show you one more thing which is the final

584
00:53:55,557 --> 00:54:01,217
kind of conclusion of the whole paper is that they take the mom 's college and the score

585
00:54:01,217 --> 00:54:06,297
right looks and produce the kids which then produce outcome so this is where

586
00:54:06,297 --> 00:54:13,240
now so clearly apologize for dicks whether or not to keep graduates from school or academic performance

587
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:18,240
repair process and then they actually I don't think I have in it goodbye. no I don't. so

588
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:23,300
one of the things that they go through us and they tried to um mediate this with all of the different

589
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:28,380
parenting other so they take this and try to get this to go to zero by controlling

590
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:33,760
for cognitive stimulation tardiness of things like that. it's so pretty cool

591
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,780
and actually show a lot of big a lot of this whole relationship because

592
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:45,240
this is an independent of the fact that the parents Jean on child academic attainment.

593
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:50,480
not just through the purchase own jeans but directly in the way that see you that is a change

594
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,600
through parent. that's so what you would imagine but this is all gene environment correlation right now

595
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:01,100
Jean environment or action. so it's a pretty cool for you guess.

596
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:06,269
yeah so we're starting to we're trying to do some of this right now to it's exciting. okay um

597
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:11,408
interactions I will try not to spend too much time on this but one

598
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:16,608
of the things that I think she should remember is that I mean this is not just for Gina Fire

599
00:55:16,608 --> 00:55:22,848
interactions section for calling her actions intuitions from experiments

600
00:55:22,848 --> 00:55:27,848
about interactions rarely play out in field studies. that's what you need to

601
00:55:27,848 --> 00:55:33,128
remember. so up here in this kind of weird blocks you could these blocks and

602
00:55:33,128 --> 00:55:38,128
kids. anyway um so absurd that's kind of the perfect design

603
00:55:38,128 --> 00:55:43,368
right and experiment you have these four quadrants and that

604
00:55:43,368 --> 00:55:48,368
is that's powered at one. okay since a number of people. the power is perfect it's

605
00:55:48,368 --> 00:55:54,448
really strongly powered. so that's what we're going for the experiment right here.

606
00:55:54,448 --> 00:55:59,868
we rarely have like four equal groups that we can test in

607
00:55:59,868 --> 00:56:05,924
the same way the experiment night. ours typically looks more like the

608
00:56:05,924 --> 00:56:12,184
we have kind of this different range of outcomes in environments

609
00:56:12,184 --> 00:56:17,404
to environments whatever it maybe. so just looking at the different distributions of what might that

610
00:56:17,404 --> 00:56:23,204
look like. you can see how close to being the same power study

611
00:56:23,204 --> 00:56:28,264
the experiment would be right in other words if you're saying something like this which

612
00:56:28,264 --> 00:56:33,424
is more normally distributed. you're probably not powered nearly as well as everyone

613
00:56:33,424 --> 00:56:39,364
thinks you are. so you have a lot more people so here's a general rule stuff.

614
00:56:39,364 --> 00:56:44,404
yes you believe that you have a main effect of data and you believe that

615
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:49,424
the interaction is the exact same size as the estimate fact of

616
00:56:49,424 --> 00:56:54,544
Casey had made a fax. you have the interaction. if those two things are the same

617
00:56:54,544 --> 00:57:00,044
you need four times the sample size to detect that interaction.

618
00:57:00,044 --> 00:57:05,104
yes which is more likely you have a main effect and you have enough in the interaction that's

619
00:57:05,104 --> 00:57:10,398
half the size and I don't know Jim what would you say it's like awesome like a quarter of the size

620
00:57:10,398 --> 00:57:15,698
or far less yeah let's you're saying you have a main effect and have you an interaction that's half the size

621
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:21,898
you need to sixteen times the sample to detect it. so you need to really really big

622
00:57:21,898 --> 00:57:27,098
things. um thinking that so your guys remember this.

623
00:57:27,098 --> 00:57:32,638
I think for cash and interest I don't know I can reach jump um might let you guys

624
00:57:32,638 --> 00:57:38,278
look at this another time but essentially all are showing is this is

625
00:57:38,278 --> 00:57:43,298
probably than the you expected to interaction readers so partial I'm our square. like so the

626
00:57:43,298 --> 00:57:49,318
change in our square one percent change in our square. it's like almost

627
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:54,498
impossible to get you know as much more livable interaction with this kind

628
00:57:54,498 --> 00:58:00,338
of like this is a proportion of overlap like what what is the

629
00:58:00,338 --> 00:58:05,506
population. so study

630
00:58:05,506 --> 00:58:10,826
and the point behind this is sample size probably closer to five

631
00:58:10,826 --> 00:58:16,646
cells in person range. two thousand personally shot

632
00:58:16,646 --> 00:58:21,686
detector significant. if that's kind of the take a message but if

633
00:58:21,686 --> 00:58:26,726
you wanna dig into it. references there. okay. last

634
00:58:26,726 --> 00:58:31,726
couple slides a promise. this is related to replication reproduce ability. if you're talking all

635
00:58:31,726 --> 00:58:36,826
about this. yes. okay. great. so I got she got this from the open

636
00:58:36,826 --> 00:58:42,266
science foundation framework for science framework unless you know we've heard some of the that

637
00:58:42,266 --> 00:58:47,266
um yeah. so you know this is how they do

638
00:58:47,266 --> 00:58:52,426
things to think you know those people to find things in slightly different way we'll try to talk about it but I thought this is a

639
00:58:52,426 --> 00:58:57,646
interesting way of thinking about it. but the key thing to pull is remember

640
00:58:57,646 --> 00:59:02,706
if the open science framework was built up on experiments

641
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:08,282
not on observational data like we don't okay

642
00:59:08,282 --> 00:59:13,442
so so a lot of the way they're thinking about it it's like an experiment and you just saw me talk about

643
00:59:13,442 --> 00:59:18,482
like interactions and power experiments or different souls to keep in that

644
00:59:18,482 --> 00:59:24,262
mind but if it's the same data in the same code.

645
00:59:24,262 --> 00:59:29,922
that's reproducible. that's that's your true for disability. stability can you get the same result

646
00:59:29,922 --> 00:59:38,502
is different data with the same code. that's a replication

647
00:59:38,502 --> 00:59:43,522
the same data slightly different code and just robust to different changes. this is

648
00:59:43,522 --> 00:59:48,531
how general life was differed a different code how how often do see you me take that

649
00:59:48,531 --> 00:59:54,311
just one step further. um another this is another citation from another group.

650
00:59:54,311 --> 00:59:59,391
so replication is also called statistical reproduced ability which is confusing

651
00:59:59,391 --> 01:00:04,490
when you think about the other type of reefer disability but statistical reproduce possibility. are

652
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:09,551
your results marriage using the same message and the same I would say maybe not the same data set but the same target

653
01:00:09,551 --> 01:00:14,571
population so this is where epidemiologists monger first come in and we say oh yeah

654
01:00:14,571 --> 01:00:19,611
and maybe a different data set but it's a totally different target population and so I wouldn't expect

655
01:00:19,611 --> 01:00:24,690
it to be the same. so this is really rare and epidemiology is rare in the social sciences

656
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:30,791
because date are almost always designed to be distinct from each other.

657
01:00:30,791 --> 01:00:35,911
we will not be funded for the health and retirement study number two. so we don't

658
01:00:35,911 --> 01:00:41,151
actually have a data set that we can reproduce and that's

659
01:00:41,151 --> 01:00:46,462
because it's built on the greatness on the experiments where you can redo it again real quick so we typically

660
01:00:46,462 --> 01:00:51,622
try to use cross validation message holdout message like you supposed to data set. leave out

661
01:00:51,622 --> 01:00:56,662
cross validation so there's lots of different types extra replication.

662
01:00:56,662 --> 01:01:01,802
this is comparable reproduce ability see see how confusing I guess people call different things but this

663
01:01:01,802 --> 01:01:07,021
is what this person called do your results extent other measures other environments

664
01:01:07,021 --> 01:01:12,182
and this is particular hard for and I mean action because often the population of interest

665
01:01:12,182 --> 01:01:17,482
and the environment and the gene is what was interesting about the paper to begin with and so

666
01:01:17,482 --> 01:01:22,562
moving into a totally different measure. who cares that's how the person

667
01:01:22,562 --> 01:01:28,942
's worse. so is that the ease where the G which one you know.

668
01:01:28,942 --> 01:01:33,942
I replicated. okay. so I'm gonna go to questions for you guys but here the questions

669
01:01:33,942 --> 01:01:39,062
like this is the slide to keep in mind when you if you're ever gonna go on to this. so what kind of what

670
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:44,122
model and general I mean action do you want to test what do you think is actually going on or and this is perfectly

671
01:01:44,122 --> 01:01:49,456
reasonable. you don't have any idea so you're gonna test them all. just make sure your power to do that.

672
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:54,855
do you have the proper environment to test the model that you think you want to test.

673
01:01:54,855 --> 01:02:00,015
where did your genetic measure come from and to what extent is

674
01:02:00,015 --> 01:02:05,735
there. junior member correlation and maybe should you start with that to begin with.

675
01:02:05,735 --> 01:02:11,216
your power to detect this given your previous answers. I think that's it.

676
01:02:11,216 --> 01:02:16,875
okay. so questions okay.

677
01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:27,755
will come on now. okay.

678
01:02:27,755 --> 01:02:32,975
yeah so it's a great question. I know it's old I mean I clearly like the process

679
01:02:32,975 --> 01:02:38,035
is always been there but I mean. okay this

680
01:02:38,035 --> 01:02:43,275
is this is the sociology of science right so give you a little bit like how that happened I. think

681
01:02:43,275 --> 01:02:49,233
um social sciences and love love

682
01:02:49,233 --> 01:02:54,694
Intra general like psychologists also like I don't know if you have you guys ever been to a psychology

683
01:02:54,694 --> 01:03:00,394
conference ever seen the second you guys should go sometime every time I've ever seen the paper.

684
01:03:00,394 --> 01:03:05,714
it'll it'll literally be like to share my twenty subjects didn't find anything. so

685
01:03:05,714 --> 01:03:11,094
I didn't interaction with gender and items every every single talk.

686
01:03:11,094 --> 01:03:16,094
it's kind of remarkable um and so part of it is just people up the idea that

687
01:03:16,094 --> 01:03:21,394
interaction because I think the fundamentals like a lot of social science. like jeans

688
01:03:21,394 --> 01:03:26,454
matter not. all the time. it only matters because of the environment and this way and this way they

689
01:03:26,454 --> 01:03:31,513
hate the idea that like jeans my future deterministic so better find an environment where it doesn't work

690
01:03:31,513 --> 01:03:36,894
and one that it does. so I think part of it was as a way to

691
01:03:36,894 --> 01:03:42,293
just maybe that what you're asking but it's a way to avoid comfortable of Ness like jeans

692
01:03:42,293 --> 01:03:47,527
predicting what place you live how far you going to school which is very

693
01:03:47,527 --> 01:03:52,567
uncomfortable for a lot of social sciences and instead of jumping to no jeans work

694
01:03:52,567 --> 01:03:58,327
differently in different places because then that means the environment smoking again the queen

695
01:03:58,327 --> 01:04:03,427
size um and so I think that's why I went there and then

696
01:04:03,427 --> 01:04:08,767
like the people who are getting into this for like yeah I don't think we're here yet.

697
01:04:08,767 --> 01:04:13,767
let's take a step back kind of revise how we think about you know fire interactions and

698
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:18,827
and then people started but he likes going to acknowledge like a week and then she teased we can still show that the

699
01:04:18,827 --> 01:04:23,927
environment matters by looking at gene environment correlation.

700
01:04:23,927 --> 01:04:29,307
so hold her head for Europe isolation. yeah have a statistical ones I guess which is that

701
01:04:29,307 --> 01:04:35,067
if you and if you get a significant humor of interaction obviously

702
01:04:35,067 --> 01:04:40,167
my abuse you deserve a correlation. so people have to you have to look at that chart

703
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:45,347
and make sure there was the due action. I don't confess.

704
01:04:45,347 --> 01:04:50,729
we will call as well yeah which is wisely seen other fields

705
01:04:50,729 --> 01:04:55,770
and also looking at that we had a face realize it looks like that was the reason

706
01:04:55,770 --> 01:05:02,790
therefore that's a real reaction yeah. wow. so if your son 's better. no no.

707
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:19,590
yeah.

708
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:25,030
so I'm not exactly sure what you mean but let me take one seven and then see if it works on someone

709
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:30,330
when we're talking about. Jean about my Croatian most often we're talking about measuring my jeans and predicting

710
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:36,490
like either some some actual like environment like are you moving

711
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:42,530
in migrating which is like not really environment but it's a process of getting to the environment

712
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:47,637
for you parenting difference. that's that's kind of that it's it's

713
01:05:47,637 --> 01:05:53,337
a weird like behavioral substitute for an environment but it's a regression.

714
01:05:53,337 --> 01:05:58,438
it's like yeah I like the correlation coefficient yes just

715
01:05:58,438 --> 01:06:03,458
a very useful for your genotype and the environment so you're trying to you're that

716
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:11,218
you're spending the rest. yes

717
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:17,577
uh-huh.

718
01:06:17,577 --> 01:06:22,597
I think it's I think it's as complicated as your environment measure it is.

719
01:06:22,597 --> 01:06:27,889
so I think you're right like if you have very complicated censoring data

720
01:06:27,889 --> 01:06:32,990
then it gets complicated just like any statistical model more complicated outcome is like maybe

721
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:39,669
we'll call for the time it would just call the telco outcome could actually be like a measure of

722
01:06:39,669 --> 01:06:44,790
your parents. you know cognitive stimulation and

723
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:50,030
you know it's not really your phenotype but it is and outcome

724
01:06:50,030 --> 01:07:04,510
and maybe there's a lot of censoring so then you have to worry about

725
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:20,869
sure sure. so help. page

726
01:07:20,869 --> 01:07:29,351
not sure how much

727
01:07:29,351 --> 01:07:34,551
yeah so that's a great question in fact I gave a talk we you what you were getting

728
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:39,791
go to this year that's. us we had to talk it I searched for someone else which is advertise

729
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:44,931
a lot however it was interesting will I thank you. um because a it's Robert Coleman is not naming

730
01:07:44,931 --> 01:07:50,010
about anyone my know you would recognize that and then it was

731
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:55,091
just wrote a book called blueprint. that's all about like a conclusion is we should start

732
01:07:55,091 --> 01:08:00,250
using these genetics course for educational interventions

733
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:05,351
and let's just say a lot of people thought this is a bad idea. I'm one of those people who think is

734
01:08:05,351 --> 01:08:10,551
a bad idea. the reason why I think it's a bad idea. or several different versions.

735
01:08:10,551 --> 01:08:16,650
the easiest one to like deal with but still would require probably a decade and a billion dollars

736
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:21,851
is the fact that um. remember who all these scores come from

737
01:08:21,851 --> 01:08:27,407
non- randomly sampled for the most part European upper

738
01:08:27,407 --> 01:08:32,447
upper middle class European ancestry people right

739
01:08:32,447 --> 01:08:38,646
so so we're talking about maybe what is maybe one

740
01:08:38,646 --> 01:08:44,047
twelve for one tenth of the whole human population and we're gonna base and educational

741
01:08:44,047 --> 01:08:49,187
interventions on their scores. um the last time I were with ever

742
01:08:49,187 --> 01:08:54,927
done that the soldiers tend to increase the quality much health qualities

743
01:08:54,927 --> 01:08:59,927
by using one are best test subject and applying it to one of us. so that's

744
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:04,947
my first thing is like a maybe if we can get all the genetics all figured out.

745
01:09:04,947 --> 01:09:10,467
maybe then we can do it. but then there's also some other issues that come into play here. um

746
01:09:10,467 --> 01:09:16,087
it's the difference between knowing something is true. add on an average like a group average.

747
01:09:16,087 --> 01:09:21,467
so this is like to get into like you guys do this really real specificity sensitivity

748
01:09:21,467 --> 01:09:27,264
right we have no evidence that that's true. this is like on improve average if you're higher

749
01:09:27,264 --> 01:09:32,524
you'll tend to go farther but that doesn't mean that if you have a higher score than you have

750
01:09:32,524 --> 01:09:38,644
that you are definitely gonna go higher farther. we have no evidence of that stuff by

751
01:09:38,644 --> 01:09:44,124
and then you know then there's other more like interesting ethical concerns what I'm saying like

752
01:09:44,124 --> 01:09:49,444
like this is even a non- stars like if we got the science all figured out.

753
01:09:49,444 --> 01:09:54,644
maybe then we can start having this conversation but I don't think there's any to suggest we have the size

754
01:09:54,644 --> 01:09:59,744
worked out yet so it's pretty premature but when you come back to the sub

755
01:09:59,744 --> 01:10:04,984
education people are freaking out about um precision medicine

756
01:10:04,984 --> 01:10:10,264
is this is exactly what I just described not using education

757
01:10:10,264 --> 01:10:15,304
but using like offices of different diseases. they all still have the same

758
01:10:15,304 --> 01:10:20,444
problems I just said. so should we be nervous

759
01:10:20,444 --> 01:10:25,452
about precision medicine I would

760
01:10:25,452 --> 01:10:30,492
be very nervous about precision medicine um that doesn't mean that it's not generally a

761
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:35,833
good idea to try to imagine like a an individual comes in a week it helps like Taylor response

762
01:10:35,833 --> 01:10:41,272
I've totally in favor of that the idea of using jeans to do that.

763
01:10:41,272 --> 01:10:46,353
I'm not sure where they're in general. maybe for a few things like you know there are men dealing in trade

764
01:10:46,353 --> 01:10:51,853
center someone walks in and I do a genetic test and I say yeah if you have um

765
01:10:51,853 --> 01:10:57,092
Huntington's disease. I'm sorry you're gonna get this. you're gonna have this you have this version of the Junior deaf like

766
01:10:57,092 --> 01:11:02,132
have Huntington's disease. let's start treatment for for you early. I'm all in favor of that. we've

767
01:11:02,132 --> 01:11:07,672
been that through for years now. these other like apologize for one's

768
01:11:07,672 --> 01:11:12,672
promotional. yes and we should proceed. for

769
01:11:12,672 --> 01:11:17,893
food incremental evidence. yes yes I mean extra measuring

770
01:11:17,893 --> 01:11:22,932
biomarkers and other things that are potentially protect you know it seems

771
01:11:22,932 --> 01:11:28,572
like a recurring heart attack so

772
01:11:28,572 --> 01:11:33,572
it's a pieces or something special about it. I don't I don't know I mean yeah the thing that

773
01:11:33,572 --> 01:11:38,712
worries people about genetics is of course you know this is like something that you're you're born with right

774
01:11:38,712 --> 01:11:44,312
and she yes she's just deterministic and that's I think that's the thing that people

775
01:11:44,312 --> 01:11:49,512
worry about and it's a legitimate concern but after I've just described all of the gene environment correlation

776
01:11:49,512 --> 01:11:54,772
goes on you can imagine where you're like oh yeah I know there's there's a whole bunch of other potential mechanisms

777
01:11:54,772 --> 01:11:59,812
that we might be thinking there's an association when there's not and wouldn't that be sad if we

778
01:11:59,812 --> 01:12:05,412
start making treatments based on that. so I love the idea

779
01:12:05,412 --> 01:12:10,432
in general that we could somehow tailor our our responses to an individual.

780
01:12:10,432 --> 01:12:16,652
I love that. I think we all looked I think teachers love would that doctors are certainly love that but

781
01:12:16,652 --> 01:12:21,672
using Polly Gen X course created from G. Ross

782
01:12:21,672 --> 01:12:32,973
you know I would argue in general. we definitely not yet. there

783
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:41,312
alright thank you for nothing. you enjoy your volleyball yes yes I you hope last

784
01:12:41,312 --> 01:12:47,093
back in the road since. I

785
01:12:47,093 --> 01:12:52,153
always for so feel like I don't

786
01:12:52,153 --> 01:12:57,312
watch

787
01:12:57,312 --> 01:13:05,744
show so this is right

788
01:13:05,744 --> 01:13:12,304
I'm very good at as fast food smog.

789
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:17,724
I don't know.

790
01:13:17,724 --> 01:13:46,404
hey..

791
01:13:46,404 --> 01:14:12,364
I

792
01:14:12,364 --> 01:14:17,744
so I

793
01:14:17,744 --> 01:14:36,724
go to

794
01:14:36,724 --> 01:14:42,384
go over there

795
01:14:42,384 --> 01:14:47,804
you

796
01:14:47,804 --> 01:14:57,644
know I thought he was

797
01:14:57,644 --> 01:15:16,892
involved

798
01:15:16,892 --> 01:15:22,152
additional jobs and

799
01:15:22,152 --> 01:15:39,191
more competitive jobs

800
01:15:39,191 --> 01:16:05,080
where you went to school that is a

801
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:10,179
had

802
01:16:10,179 --> 01:16:15,299
virtual for for the life of a virtual

803
01:16:15,299 --> 01:16:22,339
who's in a long way for

804
01:16:22,339 --> 01:16:28,819
us is

805
01:16:28,819 --> 01:16:43,199
one of the most royal blue

806
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:48,779
streak

807
01:16:48,779 --> 01:16:54,159
it was all over it all it

808
01:16:54,159 --> 01:17:00,786
all you know I don't see how

809
01:17:00,786 --> 01:17:06,386
far behind. audio I gonna work that out here right now we're supposed to

810
01:17:06,386 --> 01:17:27,605
solve all the labor utility

811
01:17:27,605 --> 01:17:39,886
board.

812
01:17:39,886 --> 01:17:49,646
so

813
01:17:49,646 --> 01:18:04,505
yeah it is also my own

814
01:18:04,505 --> 01:18:17,625
who

815
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:22,646
I'm the learning hard the

816
01:18:22,646 --> 01:18:38,625
money in regards

817
01:18:38,625 --> 01:18:44,857
especially

818
01:18:44,857 --> 01:18:58,257
here's a little huge

819
01:18:58,257 --> 01:19:03,958
part of it and all that kind of any kind of which

820
01:19:03,958 --> 01:19:10,717
I

821
01:19:10,717 --> 01:19:21,917
what I was like I

822
01:19:21,917 --> 01:19:39,781
I'm on the you know are going it well

823
01:19:39,781 --> 01:19:45,617
yeah

824
01:19:45,617 --> 01:19:51,777
well I don't know

825
01:19:51,777 --> 01:20:18,657
what kind of

826
01:20:18,657 --> 01:20:23,997
used

827
01:20:23,997 --> 01:20:41,317
to go you to

828
01:20:41,317 --> 01:20:47,554
know cold okay this week Olds

829
01:20:47,554 --> 01:21:04,894
years.

830
01:21:04,894 --> 01:21:09,974
alright. you ready ready for the season the right

831
01:21:09,974 --> 01:21:18,114
to enjoy that kinda different right and and they still to have a difference in perception of

832
01:21:18,114 --> 01:21:23,614
any questions or anything before we get started on this next set of topics.

833
01:21:23,614 --> 01:21:28,634
okay. so this is gonna be our last module um was hoping we

834
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:33,734
would have more one more which was kind of more integrated all next kind of like up and you know

835
01:21:33,734 --> 01:21:38,814
make strange script. um I'm putting all that together but with our snow day that we

836
01:21:38,814 --> 01:21:44,134
had. I wasn't able to fit everything in and so sorry that we don't know how about last

837
01:21:44,134 --> 01:21:49,204
section I think um this'll this'll be nice because these

838
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:54,224
are really important pieces for when you're reading the epidemiology you can I got literature

839
01:21:54,224 --> 01:21:59,404
and really tracing through some of these more advanced concepts. either some message that you're gonna

840
01:21:59,404 --> 01:22:04,644
see a lot in the literature so I think that would be good. 's some day.

841
01:22:04,644 --> 01:22:09,724
I think in the department I'm gonna try to give some like a social actors lecture. I'm

842
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:15,384
sorry so short that you know makes sure like which I'll just invite you all to which would be a good

843
01:22:15,384 --> 01:22:20,804
behalf of what I would've covered in that last own next module so

844
01:22:20,804 --> 01:22:26,444
I'll let you know case you feel like you wanna stop by him.

845
01:22:26,444 --> 01:22:31,544
okay. so this we were gonna kinda talk about three basic that's I guess

846
01:22:31,544 --> 01:22:36,644
one is sort of this concept here ability and the sniff world because we discussed here in ability in the family

847
01:22:36,644 --> 01:22:41,664
kinda context. now we're gonna discuss that using sip data. um we're gonna

848
01:22:41,664 --> 01:22:48,356
talk about concepts. please trophy and dealing renovation

849
01:22:48,356 --> 01:22:53,416
so in terms of the first thing heard you ability so we discussed this a lot in the class

850
01:22:53,416 --> 01:22:58,456
um. remember that we have just a basic

851
01:22:58,456 --> 01:23:03,556
concept of the worst interest stuff you know two big variation explained by genetic variation. remember we talked

852
01:23:03,556 --> 01:23:08,856
about the broad sense here in ability that includes dominate added and up the static the fax

853
01:23:08,856 --> 01:23:14,016
right and then we also have this narrow sense ability hurt and remember we do find that

854
01:23:14,016 --> 01:23:19,036
only having the additive genetic effects you remember that like pearly off fax all added

855
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:24,156
together in the winter action so nothing. so we can think about.

856
01:23:24,156 --> 01:23:29,436
I never since heard ability and I can be sort of conceptualizing you work Russian model

857
01:23:29,436 --> 01:23:34,936
where you've got some fuel price wise. um you got other covariance

858
01:23:34,936 --> 01:23:41,056
that you wanna drop for and then here are some

859
01:23:41,056 --> 01:23:46,276
beta coefficients and genetic information. it's really

860
01:23:46,276 --> 01:23:51,936
the additive component so that's you okay um

861
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:57,176
but you know hearts here. eyes raises which you know to -

862
01:23:57,176 --> 01:24:02,536
because the locus or some locus it's contributing to the herd ability right um.

863
01:24:02,536 --> 01:24:07,776
so this is Gina sizes some suppliers say and then all sizes

864
01:24:07,776 --> 01:24:12,836
for size for the snap right so it really if this truly out of component and you can

865
01:24:12,836 --> 01:24:18,816
just kinda visualize it and think about it and that way and then the outcome is gonna be here. um

866
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:23,976
influenced by that heritage. um charitable added different

867
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:29,236
holder as well as the environment and so we can think about this um

868
01:24:29,236 --> 01:24:34,556
the genetic as some of those where to fax sizes of these calls genetic whole

869
01:24:34,556 --> 01:24:39,776
loci rates because we're comparing the genetic areas to the Phoenix been very

870
01:24:39,776 --> 01:24:47,298
and very clear some kind

871
01:24:47,298 --> 01:24:52,438
so um I'm talking to you about it and regression framework because we're gonna eventually

872
01:24:52,438 --> 01:24:57,718
get to um some envious um heard

873
01:24:57,718 --> 01:25:02,858
ability and shared heard ability please trophy models that use this kind of linear regression

874
01:25:02,858 --> 01:25:08,578
modeling so I'm kind of giving you a sense of how we can

875
01:25:08,578 --> 01:25:14,178
think about her ability in in the context of a linear model. so remember that we

876
01:25:14,178 --> 01:25:19,198
have so far talked about us we need heard of them would be through family studies right.

877
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:24,278
so um we've looked at family pedigrees

878
01:25:24,278 --> 01:25:29,778
and we've estimated short ability based on relationships

879
01:25:29,778 --> 01:25:35,898
and we never had major genotypes for what we were doing in those heard ability analyses your member

880
01:25:35,898 --> 01:25:41,018
um. so I'm gonna talk a little bit about the a heard ability so

881
01:25:41,018 --> 01:25:46,018
instead of using families or related individuals in the classic sense we're gonna

882
01:25:46,018 --> 01:25:51,144
actually estimate heard ability using the sample of unrelated individuals and

883
01:25:51,144 --> 01:25:56,644
we're gonna use measure genetic variation. so it's a little bit different and then

884
01:25:56,644 --> 01:26:01,644
we're gonna talk about the first way which is only for groceries how

885
01:26:01,644 --> 01:26:08,284
many people have used that on that. you heard of all these corporations for

886
01:26:08,284 --> 01:26:13,984
maybe maybe. okay um. so we're gonna actually

887
01:26:13,984 --> 01:26:19,184
talk about this whole field of using summary statistics and few studies

888
01:26:19,184 --> 01:26:24,204
so when we say summary statistics were talking about the results from to

889
01:26:24,204 --> 01:26:29,584
study so not the raw data but the beta has to match and the standard error from age

890
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:34,624
and it's association with the outcome from you. we do need those

891
01:26:34,624 --> 01:26:39,704
some recent essays and there was a special kind of correction that uses patterns of known

892
01:26:39,704 --> 01:26:44,824
linkages equilibrium across next. we can also use that to estimate hurt ability. so we're

893
01:26:44,824 --> 01:26:53,404
gonna go through all three of these different kinds of approach the biometric when we've done already.

894
01:26:53,404 --> 01:26:58,684
and we've talked about this stuff before too. so we talked about um the expected

895
01:26:58,684 --> 01:27:03,844
proportion. bye-bye Deedee sherry and right we did this and um

896
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:08,924
exam to overall excepted proportionally allele shared. I to

897
01:27:08,924 --> 01:27:14,384
reach low test for people and remember we had looked at him like for first cousin cousins

898
01:27:14,384 --> 01:27:19,504
that was one eight and then we have this um kinship coefficient

899
01:27:19,504 --> 01:27:24,635
which is the probability that you bills from a relatively selected low okay our individual are

900
01:27:24,635 --> 01:27:29,755
um identical by the cents for individual Byron Jay so we've already

901
01:27:29,755 --> 01:27:34,955
had these concepts for what I would want you to get from it is that you'll hear this all the time

902
01:27:34,955 --> 01:27:40,015
to ship me drugs or a genetic relationship major you know based on

903
01:27:40,015 --> 01:27:45,955
um. page forms and which I forgot what a call.

904
01:27:45,955 --> 01:27:51,495
bye. yeah that five six one. um

905
01:27:51,495 --> 01:27:56,795
the kinship matrix or the genetic relationship matrix is actually the estimates of all the people

906
01:27:56,795 --> 01:28:02,015
that you have any studying hell related they are to each other. essentially. so

907
01:28:02,015 --> 01:28:07,635
um so we can make a pedigree based kinship matrix. right. um

908
01:28:07,635 --> 01:28:13,155
because we are do you know how to do this right so we have

909
01:28:13,155 --> 01:28:18,415
our fair and offering sure one half of their genetic information for

910
01:28:18,415 --> 01:28:23,495
cousins one afraid we have like that known set of relationships

911
01:28:23,495 --> 01:28:28,513
right so what we do in the sort of biometric model essentially

912
01:28:28,513 --> 01:28:33,553
is look who the relationships and then I've trying to estimate the

913
01:28:33,553 --> 01:28:38,593
covariance and whatever for you know try for interest today. they do the share genetics right that's what we've

914
01:28:38,593 --> 01:28:43,773
done before and so um this kinship made tracks

915
01:28:43,773 --> 01:28:49,073
is based on expected relationship right. everything we've done before.

916
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:55,573
has been like that. um.

917
01:28:55,573 --> 01:29:00,673
um so the way that we might actually set that up in terms

918
01:29:00,673 --> 01:29:05,933
of of aggression or sort of setting is again this idea

919
01:29:05,933 --> 01:29:11,233
where you got some phenotype as a function of your cold area it's of interest on your genetic

920
01:29:11,233 --> 01:29:16,793
fax anywhere and environmental effects right so that the cold reads the fax.

921
01:29:16,793 --> 01:29:21,873
our um your genetic models that

922
01:29:21,873 --> 01:29:27,357
sort of the society of a um a brand of the facts and

923
01:29:27,357 --> 01:29:32,897
and this kind of um regression I'm gonna tell you about an environmental

924
01:29:32,897 --> 01:29:38,637
resort of your individuals. so what you have is your transfer model of the variances.

925
01:29:38,637 --> 01:29:44,337
- the function of the universe area. you can just cool efficient. um

926
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:50,217
and this is sort of your individual level and fire Ray portrayed actually break.

927
01:29:50,217 --> 01:29:55,377
this is a sort of a model we we're trying to look at the variation in the future. -

928
01:29:55,377 --> 01:30:00,437
break sounds like a generic environment. as a function of

929
01:30:00,437 --> 01:30:05,477
the relationship matrix and then people 's individual level environmental

930
01:30:05,477 --> 01:30:11,237
stuff right. so we can actually estimate that

931
01:30:11,237 --> 01:30:16,537
a genetic experience using the map and like research and

932
01:30:16,537 --> 01:30:21,677
maximum likelihood right where you actually are just um

933
01:30:21,677 --> 01:30:27,143
well you know set of models and trying to find the model that

934
01:30:27,143 --> 01:30:33,803
explains the genetics. and for purposes right.

935
01:30:33,803 --> 01:30:38,903
so you could have heard have some kinda great experiences your genetic experience over

936
01:30:38,903 --> 01:30:44,603
the years of experience and here you got again continue this relationship based matrix

937
01:30:44,603 --> 01:30:51,963
from Patrick. okay. so

938
01:30:51,963 --> 01:30:57,323
your heritage ability that you get using this kind of approach

939
01:30:57,323 --> 01:31:02,683
is actually a sort of an upper bound for the true hurt ability because

940
01:31:02,683 --> 01:31:07,823
they heard ability that were trying to estimate word for it for estimating in the model that I did have heard ability

941
01:31:07,823 --> 01:31:13,103
place for train station there sort ability but we probably have dominated on static

942
01:31:13,103 --> 01:31:18,143
and some shared environmental facts that are um creeping in. when we do

943
01:31:18,143 --> 01:31:24,069
this family base modeling. the other thing is that

944
01:31:24,069 --> 01:31:29,429
it's pedigree a -based kinship matrix is based on expected I'll be sharing

945
01:31:29,429 --> 01:31:34,789
right. but we know that that actual identity sharing is an important parameter

946
01:31:34,789 --> 01:31:39,869
so for example you have siblings that on average for they share fifty

947
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:44,949
percent of their illegal but in reality it can actually be

948
01:31:44,949 --> 01:31:50,309
anywhere from like thirty thirty five percent up to like fifty five sixty

949
01:31:50,309 --> 01:31:55,909
percent sixty sixty five percent. if you look at real sibling date on

950
01:31:55,909 --> 01:32:01,129
their actual sherry and he is a range right.

951
01:32:01,129 --> 01:32:06,249
so siblings are actually physically in truth Cheryl and here they

952
01:32:06,249 --> 01:32:13,089
should be worse and more than simply to actually share last year. right. okay.

953
01:32:13,089 --> 01:32:18,169
so Tom so there are some issues with using a family based approach to

954
01:32:18,169 --> 01:32:23,209
estimating cared about money but um

955
01:32:23,209 --> 01:32:28,425
we've been able to do now is that we can actually measure steps across to GM right.

956
01:32:28,425 --> 01:32:33,945
so we can calculate realized Kay. so instead of the pedigree based

957
01:32:33,945 --> 01:32:38,945
estimated kinship matrix we can look at their genetic information

958
01:32:38,945 --> 01:32:44,865
and we can actually get observed in pure call.

959
01:32:44,865 --> 01:32:51,605
okay. in a set of individuals they don't have to be related to each other. so

960
01:32:51,605 --> 01:32:57,665
we can look at the set of people who are not family

961
01:32:57,665 --> 01:33:02,683
and we can't find people who are more genetically similar to each other and more people and people who are less

962
01:33:02,683 --> 01:33:07,863
genetically similar and this is assuming that we've properly accounted for things like population

963
01:33:07,863 --> 01:33:13,503
stratification and that next right which can cause people to look more similar different.

964
01:33:13,503 --> 01:33:18,663
but we're trying to do is get rid of any advanced fax or a population stratification

965
01:33:18,663 --> 01:33:26,083
or fax. I imagine you had a sample of just like super homogeneous.

966
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:31,263
you know one antitrust recent group of people they would still have genetic differences. rates

967
01:33:31,263 --> 01:33:36,923
were trying to separate people into who are more or less alike genetically.

968
01:33:36,923 --> 01:33:42,543
so the case then that's the relationship

969
01:33:42,543 --> 01:33:47,743
matrix that we estimate using since a dog um one kind

970
01:33:47,743 --> 01:33:53,203
of differences that we actually used talk to you know realize

971
01:33:53,203 --> 01:33:58,303
that he likes to eat right we don't have identity by response and the way that we did

972
01:33:58,303 --> 01:34:03,506
we were looking at family right we can actually trace it back to a shared probably test

973
01:34:03,506 --> 01:34:09,026
so there's um there's realized that

974
01:34:09,026 --> 01:34:14,266
relationship matrix is actually based on how many wheels do you share

975
01:34:14,266 --> 01:34:19,426
like if your genotypes the exact same. you shared do you share in the state. zero and

976
01:34:19,426 --> 01:34:24,426
one or two wheels at this particular okay. what about the next one

977
01:34:24,426 --> 01:34:29,826
right. so we look for each snap for each pair of individuals

978
01:34:29,826 --> 01:34:35,126
whether they share zero one or two alleles and then we look across our

979
01:34:35,126 --> 01:34:40,227
whole entire genome and print create um. 's relationship matrix

980
01:34:40,227 --> 01:34:46,667
for all the people in our study and how genetically similar they are to each other.

981
01:34:46,667 --> 01:34:51,667
that makes sense. okay. um so now we have this

982
01:34:51,667 --> 01:34:57,366
weird thing where we can do this family concept of parrot ability

983
01:34:57,366 --> 01:35:02,529
but using unrelated people because we have all these people that are like a little bit more

984
01:35:02,529 --> 01:35:08,109
similar or a little bit less similar to each other than other people in the sample frame.

985
01:35:08,109 --> 01:35:13,208
so one program that has sort of popularized us and with

986
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:18,329
the first of its kind to do that since college easy. you know like complex trading also. have you guys ever

987
01:35:18,329 --> 01:35:23,689
done use PTA or heard that of before. okay well used to get a lot in the literature

988
01:35:23,689 --> 01:35:28,769
because it was kinda the first account. I'm taking don't really

989
01:35:28,769 --> 01:35:33,769
people and and trying to get the sights this thing stirred ability and you heard

990
01:35:33,769 --> 01:35:39,309
ability estimation proper Tracy. so this was

991
01:35:39,309 --> 01:35:44,409
early work that we did in the health and retirement study so what we did was we

992
01:35:44,409 --> 01:35:49,409
took people in a trust. we calculated their genetic similarities

993
01:35:49,409 --> 01:35:54,809
after accounting for principal components for him. population stratification

994
01:35:54,809 --> 01:36:00,608
in next. we were moving anybody who had

995
01:36:00,608 --> 01:36:05,768
similarity that was greater than oil pipe so this is people that

996
01:36:05,768 --> 01:36:10,868
were um sort of at the extremes of variability. this is

997
01:36:10,868 --> 01:36:19,928
I just think I'm probably gonna get it wrong but it's a

998
01:36:19,928 --> 01:36:25,988
maybe fourth degree relationship something like that. why do you think we were move anybody

999
01:36:25,988 --> 01:36:31,028
that had a like they could offend practically related at

1000
01:36:31,028 --> 01:36:38,308
all. lakes. I think it was fourth degree or something like that or more.

1001
01:36:38,308 --> 01:36:44,148
why do you think we would've taken those people out

1002
01:36:44,148 --> 01:36:49,528
or you can read the slide and say it out loud. Becky right

1003
01:36:49,528 --> 01:36:54,628
face your child really. so um because we're we were worried that like

1004
01:36:54,628 --> 01:37:00,068
if people work actually relating to each other. there could actually be some kind of shared environment

1005
01:37:00,068 --> 01:37:05,124
they could creep in and we didn't want that right so anybody who was

1006
01:37:05,124 --> 01:37:10,184
kind of even a distant relative of anybody else in the sample we just used one of those people right.

1007
01:37:10,184 --> 01:37:15,304
so we have all these people who are unrelated but you can kind of look um

1008
01:37:15,304 --> 01:37:21,084
these are the histogram. also genetic relationships of the people so they're kind of um

1009
01:37:21,084 --> 01:37:26,284
the center of the materials used people. these are pairs of people who are more similar to each

1010
01:37:26,284 --> 01:37:31,324
other these user cursed people who are less similar to each other. and you can see that like there's a

1011
01:37:31,324 --> 01:37:36,324
couple of things you know that some African-Americans have a slightly wider variability

1012
01:37:36,324 --> 01:37:41,504
than the white race sex due to increase genetic diversity in the population.

1013
01:37:41,504 --> 01:37:46,584
so there's a bigger spread of how people are related to each other. um

1014
01:37:46,584 --> 01:37:51,844
most people are nervous kind of like the saw most many

1015
01:37:51,844 --> 01:37:56,964
people have sort of average usually related to other people in the sample

1016
01:37:56,964 --> 01:38:01,990
but there are these groups that are a little bit more and on average right so we

1017
01:38:01,990 --> 01:38:06,990
did that in the whole summer term and study we estimated that relationship matrix there and then

1018
01:38:06,990 --> 01:38:12,270
we watched it heard ability for a bunch of different traits this is not that resolved

1019
01:38:12,270 --> 01:38:18,110
the whole thing with her and study was a little tricky because we had

1020
01:38:18,110 --> 01:38:23,330
probably at that time we had about nine thousand whites and about twenty

1021
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:28,630
five hundred African-Americans turns out they twenty five hundred African-Americans

1022
01:38:28,630 --> 01:38:33,790
is probably not enough to reliably estimate. treat her to the using said based approach.

1023
01:38:33,790 --> 01:38:39,270
so we said based approaches takes pretty big sample sizes. I would say

1024
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:44,790
upwards of three thousand people at least to give him reliable stable estimates

1025
01:38:44,790 --> 01:38:50,530
of heard ability and they're very very sensitive to any kind of an extra population stratification

1026
01:38:50,530 --> 01:38:55,990
so you have to be really careful. so

1027
01:38:55,990 --> 01:39:01,152
um when we look at her and ability. I asked across

1028
01:39:01,152 --> 01:39:06,833
what we get from pedigree studies and what we get from G watch studies

1029
01:39:06,833 --> 01:39:12,192
which I don't really see this kind of trend where there's ability from the pedigree studies

1030
01:39:12,192 --> 01:39:17,533
tends to be the highest um and that's because you're probably getting some shared an environmental

1031
01:39:17,533 --> 01:39:22,552
component that's creeping into those here ability studies you can't really greatly

1032
01:39:22,552 --> 01:39:28,433
separate out the shared environment um very well from

1033
01:39:28,433 --> 01:39:33,752
then we can look at the herd ability for the trades

1034
01:39:33,752 --> 01:39:38,914
when we are just looking does you know why significant that's that we find

1035
01:39:38,914 --> 01:39:44,174
right. so remember member for hate we had like seven hundred to you know wide significant and replicated both

1036
01:39:44,174 --> 01:39:49,534
sides. so we can estimate her to believe just use you know set looking at people similarity

1037
01:39:49,534 --> 01:39:54,534
across those steps we calculate our relationship matrix from those that's gonna give us probably

1038
01:39:54,534 --> 01:39:59,654
lawyer 's estimate of her nobility from genetic data because

1039
01:39:59,654 --> 01:40:04,714
it's only capturing in the variability that is reflected in those top. so

1040
01:40:04,714 --> 01:40:10,354
remember we talked about how there could be lots of um genetic loci

1041
01:40:10,354 --> 01:40:15,394
that are related to trades but they don't reach that super high stringent bar having

1042
01:40:15,394 --> 01:40:20,414
those super low key value rates they're still information. um in

1043
01:40:20,414 --> 01:40:25,894
in that you so maybe when talked about that's when we should did the presentation on genetic squares.

1044
01:40:25,894 --> 01:40:31,074
so remember she talked about probably that if you like you can include just the top edge

1045
01:40:31,074 --> 01:40:36,234
like those significant hits or you can include further down like ones that work to reach significance

1046
01:40:36,234 --> 01:40:41,434
and that you tend to gain information that way that's true for her and ability to break.

1047
01:40:41,434 --> 01:40:47,434
so um so do you want talk

1048
01:40:47,434 --> 01:40:52,773
heard ability is also an underestimate because I think that's it is and we could just

1049
01:40:52,773 --> 01:40:58,073
people overlook these topics is not contributing to your hard ability now you they said

1050
01:40:58,073 --> 01:41:03,833
gee you know why they turned abilities so you would consider the relationship matrix.

1051
01:41:03,833 --> 01:41:09,133
you take every step in that you know and you look at the relationship based matrix based on everything

1052
01:41:09,133 --> 01:41:14,233
that you much. this will get you closer probably to

1053
01:41:14,233 --> 01:41:20,033
those public relations measures. you will still fall short. if you haven't measured

1054
01:41:20,033 --> 01:41:25,894
all the genetic variation and that you know right. so like if we're doing chips off

1055
01:41:25,894 --> 01:41:31,113
um. we might be messing a lot of rare variant information. so that

1056
01:41:31,113 --> 01:41:36,414
can't be used to calculate the current ability if we haven't captured it through linkages equilibrium in the steps

1057
01:41:36,414 --> 01:41:41,861
that we've measured right so they could still be of the rest and sort sort of like that.

1058
01:41:41,861 --> 01:41:47,682
probably an over us and I definitely don't underestimate severely underestimate

1059
01:41:47,682 --> 01:41:53,481
for most trade some some for time

1060
01:41:53,481 --> 01:41:59,341
when you don't see this that relationship. so. - one diabetes

1061
01:41:59,341 --> 01:42:04,441
um pedigree studies inability ability to complete the. if you just look at

1062
01:42:04,441 --> 01:42:09,841
him. she walked off to her abilities please. but they goes

1063
01:42:09,841 --> 01:42:15,062
down when you consider all the snacks and that you know do you have any idea

1064
01:42:15,062 --> 01:42:20,262
why that maybe is what of if you trace on this

1065
01:42:20,262 --> 01:42:26,981
list that has that weird relationship. so you actually lose

1066
01:42:26,981 --> 01:42:37,983
harried ability when you consider all the steps together. you know why that might

1067
01:42:37,983 --> 01:42:43,184
sure. so I'm asking specifically about um you have or do you

1068
01:42:43,184 --> 01:42:48,343
watch like the really strong well if I don't have a higher herd ability

1069
01:42:48,343 --> 01:42:53,543
when you asked me that thing with you all the sense in that you know remember how said he usually gain information

1070
01:42:53,543 --> 01:42:58,743
from using some that you know for some first like from what I did if you lose information

1071
01:42:58,743 --> 01:43:03,743
to think of another reason why doesn't have to do with the firm. 's just about since

1072
01:43:03,743 --> 01:43:08,883
probably although it could be something to do what you can fireman or actually how

1073
01:43:08,883 --> 01:43:17,263
that

1074
01:43:17,263 --> 01:43:22,624
exactly. so for the news. gee these diseases

1075
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:28,164
like type one diabetes that have only a few genes that are actually associated

1076
01:43:28,164 --> 01:43:33,383
with you when you estimate the kitchen matrix based on the job so genes that actually are associated

1077
01:43:33,383 --> 01:43:38,724
you do better then if you estimate across the whole genome because the hold you know it's kinda making

1078
01:43:38,724 --> 01:43:44,067
this implicit assumption basically everything 's associated right.

1079
01:43:44,067 --> 01:43:49,288
so for many age to portray sort of highly probably dramatic. you can information when you use

1080
01:43:49,288 --> 01:43:54,387
all the steps in the genome and for the trades that are really just to do a few jeans and you've you've

1081
01:43:54,387 --> 01:43:59,507
already you very found them through July then you're gonna lose information when you include

1082
01:43:59,507 --> 01:44:04,607
more sense but we know that most of the time reading information

1083
01:44:04,607 --> 01:44:10,728
and that's because most most of the trades that we look at are quite apologetic

1084
01:44:10,728 --> 01:44:17,248
apart. so here um this is looking know

1085
01:44:17,248 --> 01:44:22,308
this one is twenty sixteen. I think it was maybe maybe it was as recent

1086
01:44:22,308 --> 01:44:28,107
as twenty sixteen. from a course in twenty six. I have a closer to twenty fourteen where.

1087
01:44:28,107 --> 01:44:33,567
I would say so you have things like human height the Friday obesity a whole bunch of diseases

1088
01:44:33,567 --> 01:44:38,748
were interested in looking out. you can see from the spot that there's like a slice that we

1089
01:44:38,748 --> 01:44:44,452
kids are doing fire about and then slice that seems to be due to genetics right um.

1090
01:44:44,452 --> 01:44:49,652
so when we find you watch that's like these of the top heads from two half citizens on the streets

1091
01:44:49,652 --> 01:44:54,932
and you can see that they had filled her some portion of that punitive

1092
01:44:54,932 --> 01:45:01,752
experience rabies highs for the theater experience. so um when we actually

1093
01:45:01,752 --> 01:45:07,252
use the whole genome to estimate

1094
01:45:07,252 --> 01:45:12,352
her in ability. we can feel it a lot more of that height in general. so this is showing

1095
01:45:12,352 --> 01:45:17,432
you know um the pages from just that you walk process and the green is now

1096
01:45:17,432 --> 01:45:22,712
from using the hold you know this is shifting for a lot of treats now could work it in

1097
01:45:22,712 --> 01:45:27,732
bigger and bigger sample sizes. so this team. this actually is you

1098
01:45:27,732 --> 01:45:32,812
significant. this is probably races we're able to the types more

1099
01:45:32,812 --> 01:45:37,892
loci because we have bigger sample sizes but still the point remains

1100
01:45:37,892 --> 01:45:43,032
but there is that sort breast or the genome that is contributing beyond that was due

1101
01:45:43,032 --> 01:45:49,394
stop headset we find okay. so

1102
01:45:49,394 --> 01:45:55,594
this is GC. must say this.

1103
01:45:55,594 --> 01:46:00,614
there's different ways that you can use it so you can use it to just estimate her inability ability. like I

1104
01:46:00,614 --> 01:46:05,753
showed you can use it to partition herd ability. so um. so

1105
01:46:05,753 --> 01:46:10,914
we to kinda talk about that. so we look to heard ability using just the top stance versus the whole

1106
01:46:10,914 --> 01:46:16,005
genome. you can look at her and ability using just steps in the axle versus the

1107
01:46:16,005 --> 01:46:21,186
person that you know or just chips on from someone or just systems are coming

1108
01:46:21,186 --> 01:46:26,545
from to write so you can take you can take people

1109
01:46:26,545 --> 01:46:31,866
like groups of snaps and look at the herd ability and you do that. so one thing that people

1110
01:46:31,866 --> 01:46:37,085
are kind of waking right now is things like categories right. so you

1111
01:46:37,085 --> 01:46:42,166
just her all the stuff from Brock about functional characterization. so if we just take the functional

1112
01:46:42,166 --> 01:46:47,346
steps do they do better then look you know that you know non- functional

1113
01:46:47,346 --> 01:46:52,585
or different pathways right you can do that. um

1114
01:46:52,585 --> 01:46:59,025
we can also look at gene environment interactions. so um

1115
01:46:59,025 --> 01:47:04,286
you never did do that in the model that I showed you know they Gigi about you come home it is infiltrated

1116
01:47:04,286 --> 01:47:09,726
that's another random facts that says that this program easy use last meeting

1117
01:47:09,726 --> 01:47:15,055
using that restricted maximum likelihood approach that I told you about um and estimate

1118
01:47:15,055 --> 01:47:20,395
the variance is Judy gene environment interactions on the pieces of hired could be like

1119
01:47:20,395 --> 01:47:25,555
um here's a environment here's the top ten it's

1120
01:47:25,555 --> 01:47:30,935
kinda like the prices not like this person. if you have interactions and the spurt we don't know

1121
01:47:30,935 --> 01:47:36,035
for him. so

1122
01:47:36,035 --> 01:47:41,234
there's a lab that we had designed for you which we probably won't have time to really do

1123
01:47:41,234 --> 01:47:46,435
unless we do a little bit on the last day of class but you can look at it and it's um it's

1124
01:47:46,435 --> 01:47:51,675
a 's ETA lab I think it's five seven and so it kinda goes through how to run

1125
01:47:51,675 --> 01:47:56,935
some of the stuff and she CTS. um the other interesting thing

1126
01:47:56,935 --> 01:48:02,035
about this is that we can start to look at the society fleet trophy. so they said I'm

1127
01:48:02,035 --> 01:48:07,234
doing to serve regular model we do a library at model so we have two outcomes that we're interested

1128
01:48:07,234 --> 01:48:12,378
and we wanna look at GE whether there's a shared genetic factors

1129
01:48:12,378 --> 01:48:17,458
for these two different traits right so we're estimating instead of just

1130
01:48:17,458 --> 01:48:23,278
genetic variance component segment square G. we're actually

1131
01:48:23,278 --> 01:48:28,698
looking at a component that estimate shared Jeanette experience between two trades.

1132
01:48:28,698 --> 01:48:35,678
so it's not just a shared ability it's the shared heard ability right it's called a genetic correlation.

1133
01:48:35,678 --> 01:48:40,698
so just gonna tell you to your slides. so this one is um

1134
01:48:40,698 --> 01:48:46,039
partitioning here in ability across functional categories. so um

1135
01:48:46,039 --> 01:48:51,039
this one was looking at all the published you studies in twenty fourteen and

1136
01:48:51,039 --> 01:48:56,198
they had looked they've taken all the steps that had been found in these you started for a whole

1137
01:48:56,198 --> 01:49:01,358
bunch of different diseases they look that up and heard ability that was due

1138
01:49:01,358 --> 01:49:06,638
to all these different friend. um. so what's in the courtroom

1139
01:49:06,638 --> 01:49:11,638
manager and promoter region or the virgin is hyper sensitive place which I think you talked

1140
01:49:11,638 --> 01:49:17,562
about in the last class um when you can see that they actually

1141
01:49:17,562 --> 01:49:22,642
were much much colder represented and that you are finance and other kinds of

1142
01:49:22,642 --> 01:49:27,802
functional categories for you even way back in twenty fourteen. so

1143
01:49:27,802 --> 01:49:32,982
there was and then um I just wanted to tell you

1144
01:49:32,982 --> 01:49:38,002
a couple of things I talked about an extra population stratification. this set

1145
01:49:38,002 --> 01:49:43,162
of assumptions is um really important so this is what I came up and

1146
01:49:43,162 --> 01:49:48,222
said that before there's this assumption and this message for all the steps are

1147
01:49:48,222 --> 01:49:53,542
possible or that they had called various break that's why when you only have a couple genes

1148
01:49:53,542 --> 01:49:58,902
that are important to look across and you know make dilutes the facts right because it's crazy waiting everything

1149
01:49:58,902 --> 01:50:05,042
equally like all the simpler way to peacefully breaks which assume that everything is basically possible

1150
01:50:05,042 --> 01:50:10,103
and that they usually contribute to good you know experience um but that's obviously

1151
01:50:10,103 --> 01:50:15,415
not true yeah um there's issues of leadership equilibrium

1152
01:50:15,415 --> 01:50:21,094
and ways minor low frequency that because these assumptions to be violated. so for example

1153
01:50:21,094 --> 01:50:26,514
if you got a whole bunch of steps that are in strong correlation with each other. they're all couch and

1154
01:50:26,514 --> 01:50:31,854
you to that heard about it. ability estimate right. um but it's just that you've measured

1155
01:50:31,854 --> 01:50:37,554
a whole bunch of steps that are highly correlated and then you might have another group the steps where you've only measured one of them

1156
01:50:37,554 --> 01:50:43,915
and then next step only comes once so you have over representation of what you measured. essentially

1157
01:50:43,915 --> 01:50:49,134
um and then the minor little frequency issue is another issue entire. but

1158
01:50:49,134 --> 01:50:54,214
there are some newer benefits to address that. so in the next class.

1159
01:50:54,214 --> 01:50:59,754
do all these celebration and we do even the lean minimization and um

1160
01:50:59,754 --> 01:51:04,854
but hope that you're extending family content fast and

1161
01:51:04,854 --> 01:51:10,094
that will be something if you completely on your own and only talk to Scott or

1162
01:51:10,094 --> 01:51:15,985
I about it. um not not allowed to talk to each other about it or

1163
01:51:15,985 --> 01:51:21,505
anything like that and it will be due like way a long time later

1164
01:51:21,505 --> 01:51:29,225
um which is on the syllabus but you'll have lots of time to work on

1165
01:51:29,225 --> 01:51:35,405
May second. yeah. so. okay. sounds good.

1166
01:51:35,405 --> 01:51:40,583
okay
