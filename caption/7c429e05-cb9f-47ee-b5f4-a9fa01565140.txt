1
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:09,217
There is, over time, a basic policy

2
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:13,980
analysis process that people have used.

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,720
And now I'm trying to build out what we've said so far.

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,330
Again, you start with problem definition,

5
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,810
what's the policy problem you wanna address?

6
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:32,530
Second what are the objectives, what are you trying to do?

7
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,330
Are you trying to mitigate the opioid crisis?

8
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:41,290
Are you trying to help vulnerable populations avoid,

9
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:46,100
that is, prevent the crisis from spreading further?

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,360
Are you trying to change physician prescription practices?

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,680
Specifying your objectives is really key to the policy process.

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,113
Third, what's your rationale for intervening?

13
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:06,072
Do you have a good rationale that you can sell to

14
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:10,152
both the politicians and the public?

15
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:16,860
Asking yourself why we want to intervene seems simple, but it really helps.

16
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,760
Why do we care?

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,570
It helps the policymaker, and the community understand why.

18
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:28,420
And it ties back to why there's a problem, what the objectives are.

19
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,410
Fourth, what method are you going to use?

20
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:37,550
And in your starting, you'll learn about a variety of methods.

21
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,940
One of the most important is the cost benefit, cost effectiveness,

22
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,910
analysis process.

23
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,540
But there are many other methods and we'll look at a few of them later on.

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,580
Next, as have been arguing you wanna build evaluation criteria.

25
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,845
How will you know whether your policy is successful?

26
00:01:58,845 --> 00:02:03,285
And you want to establish this criteria up front.

27
00:02:03,285 --> 00:02:10,580
You can put in the process and then use criteria when we experience evaluation.

28
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,575
It's simply, you won't be able to tell anything.

29
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:16,985
In contrast, when you set your criteria up front,

30
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:22,020
then you have a much better sense of what worked and what didn't.

31
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,770
Of course you need to assess the current stage of the policy process.

32
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,190
But more importantly, what are the alternative policies?

33
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,503
You should be prepared to tell the decision maker,

34
00:02:36,503 --> 00:02:41,026
the health officer if you're a public health staff.

35
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:44,756
Remember, the politician if you're the health officer speaking

36
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:46,530
to the politicians.

37
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,570
Why did you select this alternative over others?

38
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,620
To do that, the analyst needs to compare the alternatives

39
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,520
against the criteria that you've set as to why one policy

40
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:06,190
should be better than another, and what the caveats are.

41
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,620
For each potential policy that you've identified, you want to have

42
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:17,380
a set of policy options listing the pros and cons.

43
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:23,320
That way the policy maker will understand better the costs and benefits.

44
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,620
The potential benefits to the community

45
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,080
relative to the cost of that particular policy.

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,190
And significantly relative to other options.

47
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,016
So that when the politicians ask them, why didn't you go in this direction?

48
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:46,892
You'll have that ready, you the analyst will have provided that for

49
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:49,220
the policy maker.

50
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,570
But I expect each policy analyst to make a recommendation.

51
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:58,000
After all, you're the one that will have conducted the analysis,

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,500
who will have gone through all of the options.

53
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,070
Why do you select one over the other?

54
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:11,770
And then, we've already talked about the evaluation and the implementation plan.

55
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:17,950
Okay, as I said, defining the problem is not as easy as it seems.

56
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,100
There's often a lack of consensus, particularly politically.

57
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,990
Data are not always available.

58
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,320
And as I said at the beginning,

59
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,440
most analyses involve a certain degree of uncertainty.

60
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,640
That's the world we live in, don't let it bother you.

61
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,102
We use policy analysis to make the best decision possible.

62
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:47,350
We've already talked mostly about this,

63
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,220
again the data source are important.

64
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,120
When you establish her evaluation criteria, you

65
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,710
really do wanna look to what is the most cost-effective alternative.

66
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,020
And I mean to strengthening the benefits and

67
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,710
the costs fairly across populations and sub-populations.

68
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:15,420
Remember one of the keys to being an effective public health policy maker and

69
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,330
public health official is fairness in process.

70
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,160
We will come back to that when we think about public health ethics more broadly.

71
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,890
But for now, you wanna think about how the burdens and

72
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:35,500
benefits of any policy that you want to develop and implement when we distributed.

73
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,498
If too many benefits go to one sub-group,

74
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:42,210
another sub-group will bear the burden of that.

75
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,020
Is that what you want?

76
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,160
Is that fair?

77
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,800
Because fairness is an important issue.

78
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,330
And can it be administered feasibly?

79
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:59,690
There's both a political feasibility that is politicians will resonate and

80
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:05,021
be willing to support the policy you want to Implement.

81
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:07,920
And what about the administrative feasibility?

82
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,810
Do you have the staff who can implement the policy?

83
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:17,667
Is the community ready to facilitate the implementation?

84
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:24,310
In any given policy, you will have to **** tradeoffs.

85
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,742
It's rare that you're going to have a very clear and

86
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:35,080
linear set of benefits that don't require tradeoffs,

87
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,600
either for various subpopulations.

88
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,100
Or as I said before how they're distributed.

89
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:50,427
And a good policy analyst will think about the tradeoffs upfront and

90
00:06:50,427 --> 00:06:55,200
be prepared to discuss why he made the tradeoffs and

91
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,176
why that choice is the right one.

92
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:06,530
Let's look at some of the classic frameworks for policy analysis.

93
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,780
One of them is by Stokey and Zeckhouser.

94
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,050
They talk about first, establishing the context, well,

95
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,810
we already talked about that.

96
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,700
And what does that mean?

97
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,550
It means defining the problem and determining the objectives.

98
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,460
Developing alternatives, what are the most likely courses of action?

99
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,710
We talked about the data gaps.

100
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,810
How can you go about obtaining further information through

101
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,990
the published literature, through secondary databases?

102
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:43,110
Or you have the staff capacity to build and gather new data.

103
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,100
How do you predict the consequences?

104
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,270
There are techniques for estimating cost benefits and all other aspects.

105
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:59,290
Do you have current staff who can build those alternative scenarios?

106
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,630
If not, can you partner with academics to conduct those analyses for you?

107
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,360
And again, how do you measure success?

108
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,750
What are your criteria for determining whether your policy is successful?

109
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,930
What are the barriers?

110
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,370
What are the constraints?

111
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:19,430
Again, political feasibility and the implementation challenges.

112
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,980
And finally, once again, sort of beating this point, but

113
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:30,073
what are the tradeoffs among alternative scenarios need to be considered?

114
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:34,640
You can [INAUDIBLE] primarily

115
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,440
in implementation, also has some practical guide for analysis.

116
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,150
Well, you can look at this, and it's define the problem, gather the evidence,

117
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:48,360
construct alternatives, select criteria, what are the outcomes?

118
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,200
What are the tradeoffs?

119
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,400
What should decide?

120
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,910
And what's the narrative?

121
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:57,800
And, a lot of this and a lot of [INAUDIBLE] go take us right back to that

122
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,760
initial framing that Walker had of the definition of policy analysis.

123
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,372
You can also note the common threads and

124
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:11,455
themes between.

125
00:09:11,455 --> 00:09:17,990
So you can start to get a sense of agreement and consensus among the experts.

126
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,880
I would be remiss if I didn't talk about the caveats.

127
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,415
Remember, I'm a big proponent of building the skills for policy analysts.

128
00:09:28,415 --> 00:09:31,710
Doing this while doing it iteratively,

129
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:36,440
repeatedly with those skills that are helpful for

130
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,850
you no matter what direction your career takes.

131
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,054
At the same time, those of you who will be analyzing policy for

132
00:09:46,054 --> 00:09:50,071
a living need to understand the basic caveats.

133
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:54,310
You will never have perfect data, never.

134
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,760
Your model specification will vary.

135
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,850
You need to understand what the assumptions are that go into any model

136
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,340
that you develop.

137
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:10,120
There'll be inevitable time and organizational resource constraints.

138
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,120
You simply won't have enough time or

139
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,030
resources to conduct the perfect policy analysis.

140
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,470
There are always political constraints.

141
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,870
Politicians have to face the voters.

142
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:27,650
If your policy impedes the politician from being reelected,

143
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:31,300
you can anticipate push back.

144
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,130
You can never examine all of the alternatives.

145
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,020
It's just not possible.

146
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,730
So you have to pick the primary alternatives, so two, three or

147
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,560
four alternatives that you think are the most likely.

148
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,820
Along with the model specification,

149
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,030
any policy analysis is only as good as the underlying assumptions.

150
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:58,530
We should document the assumption here, making inherent with the ultimate user.

151
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:05,310
So the user really understands what your analysis is based on.

152
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,450
Iteration is really important.

153
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:12,110
You just don't use the first policy analysis you develop.

154
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,130
You need to redo it, refine it.

155
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,340
And it takes a lot of time to get right.

156
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,470
Beware of being an advocate as opposed to an analyst.

157
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,900
They're very different roles.

158
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,540
You can be an advocate in terms of setting the agenda.

159
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:39,460
Saying that the opioid crisis is more important than the obesity crisis.

160
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,550
But once you've made that choice, you're not an advocate.

161
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,980
You're an analyst.

162
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,640
You've got to be as objective as possible.

163
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,850
Policy analysis is not a substitute for expert opinion.

164
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,980
Rather, it's a tool for decision making.

165
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,500
That's all it is.

166
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,130
It gives the decision maker better information.

167
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,780
And as we said in the policy process module,

168
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:13,090
the issues take time to get on the policy agenda.

169
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:17,330
Don't get enamored with any particular policy alternative.

170
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:23,225
In fact, I think you'll be surprised that when you conduct the iterative process,

171
00:12:23,225 --> 00:12:27,970
you're notion of which policy alternative is better will change.

172
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:33,210
And that's a good thing, you wanna be responsive to your own analysis.

173
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:37,540
And if you get locked into a particular policy option,

174
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,310
you won't effectively analyze the alternatives.

175
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,316
And that's really where I think you can make a contribution,

176
00:12:45,316 --> 00:12:47,713
by having gone through the process.

177
00:12:47,713 --> 00:12:52,585
You can then tell the decision maker that you really thought

178
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:57,555
option X was the most likely, but after your analysis option

179
00:12:57,555 --> 00:13:02,940
Y turns out to be better, and here are the reasons why.

180
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,780
Along with that, be transparent.

181
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,910
Let everyone know what your assessments are based on,

182
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:15,560
what data you use, what do you think the shortcomings are?

183
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,470
And finally, you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

184
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,410
A lot of people have build valid and

185
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:28,310
reliable processes, models, and approaches, unison.

186
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,720
There's no reason for you not to,

187
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,115
they're robust, they work, and they'll help you be a better policy analyst.
