1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,310
Because we're going to do labs now. This is part of the most important part to record.

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:16,980
Right. Okay. So let's go to our our canvas website under modules and download HB 1866 flag.

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,970
Once you download it, you can say show in folder.

4
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:32,890
This is the easiest way for me. Can right click it and go to extract all.

5
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,460
And place it in a bit of browse and place it in the sea drive.

6
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,800
Okay. The precious strapped.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,390
It may take a little while because I've had a lot more data to this this time.

8
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:18,469
To replace? Yes. Okay.

9
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,730
I'm just double checking that. There it is.

10
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:29,350
There. And make sure all the if this is the current one and then open up ArcGIS pro.

11
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,120
And we're going to work with lab activity 21.

12
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,330
Once you get to our kids pro, I'll give you guys a few seconds to catch up.

13
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,760
We're going to open up a file called World Projections Projects.

14
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:45,160
Okay. So we're going to compare some popular projection systems from a planetary perspective.

15
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:56,110
So go to open another project down at the left corner and find your 46 to 6 lab folder.

16
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,600
And under projects, there is a folder called Projections.

17
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:12,310
And there is a full of file within there called world projections that appear so open that.

18
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:37,230
Okay. So you'll see three different maps here and label them DataFrame one, two and three.

19
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,670
And right now they're displaying the same information in the same projection.

20
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:50,710
What we're looking at right now are cumulative numbers of HIV AIDS cases, HIV AIDS cases in each country.

21
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:58,030
And these data are quite old. So this is, you know, not representing the current reality of things.

22
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,730
So let's go through the first data frame. Data frame one.

23
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,960
You can zoom in a little bit if that helps, depending on your on your screen.

24
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:20,770
Okay. Now try to find the meridian, which is basically the primary Indian, which is the center line.

25
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:27,670
And find this intersection with the equator. Okay. So this is where the zero zero is about right there.

26
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:36,900
Okay. So that's kind of the center of the planet, right to the intersection between the equator in the prime iridium.

27
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,150
And if you go left all the way and you follow, look at the numbers at the bottom here.

28
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,280
Right. If you go to the left, those numbers should go all the way to 180.

29
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:55,510
Okay. You're close to it. If you go beyond the map, it'll keep going forward higher.

30
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:02,850
If you go right, it should also go 100 and. So these are your lat long.

31
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,060
So this is the, uh, I guess the longitude, right?

32
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:15,630
The longitude goes from 0 to 180, and the latitude goes from 0 to 90.

33
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,580
Okay. So if you go all the way that the top should be about close to 90.

34
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:29,670
Right. So just give you an idea of how this system is organizing, uh, places on the planet.

35
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:39,270
Now, in the contents plane, you can right click on data frame one where it says data frame one and go to properties.

36
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,360
And so this is different than clicking on each layer.

37
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:50,190
Okay. So these are the properties for the whole data frame or the whole map that you're working with.

38
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:58,860
Okay. And for that data frame, there's a coordinate system option for map properties.

39
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:09,420
And in there, you can see. And under layers, it'll tell you all the different layers in and what system they may be in.

40
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:15,480
And this is under the the WG is the world geodetic system 1984.

41
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,630
Okay. And we want to change that.

42
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,770
So this is the default projection. Let's change it to Mercator.

43
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:32,730
We're a number four. Okay. To change it, you go to projected coordinate systems right here.

44
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,190
And you can open up the list. So there are many different projected coordinate system, as I mentioned.

45
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,330
And you want to go all the way down to where it says World in Underworld.

46
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,110
There are many different options as well. And we want to find the Mercator System.

47
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,750
Looks for Mercator World.

48
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,210
Then push your kid and you should notice that the map changes, right?

49
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,590
It looks like the UTM system that we looked at in the slides.

50
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:18,230
But what you probably also noticed is that is that the northern and southern part of the map is kind of extended out to look bigger.

51
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:31,530
Right. And this is one of the things that people always criticize this projection system for is that it makes things that are small.

52
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:44,200
Most of the developed, quote unquote developed world is in the is in the northern part of the planet and more the northern extreme.

53
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:50,209
So the countries like United States and Canada and Greenland and Europe,

54
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:57,050
they look a lot bigger than they actually are relative to, let's say, the continent of Africa.

55
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,020
Right. And which is actually the biggest in the planet.

56
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,530
So this is kind of distorts the way things appear.

57
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:13,520
Okay. So let's check out another system. Well, before we do, let's bring rename this once a week and keep track it.

58
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:25,010
Um, think you can just. I can go to properties here and just go to General and rename it to work.

59
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,360
We can track what we're doing. All right.

60
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,010
So let's go to the second DataFrame. DataFrame, too, and change that to something else.

61
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:42,780
We're going to apply the cylindrical import area projection to DataFrame to do the same thing.

62
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:54,420
We right click on DataFrame to in the contents pane, go down to properties, go to coordinate systems and go to projected coordinate systems.

63
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:03,830
Find world. And find the cylindrical equilibria.

64
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,790
Cylindrical ecology world system pushback.

65
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,060
So here, that's kind of the opposite of what the Mercator System does.

66
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,900
Where the northern and southern parts are squished.

67
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:29,710
Okay. So they're actually distorted and biased to look a lot smaller than they are.

68
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:36,550
And things that are closer to the equator are extending, attenuated and look bigger.

69
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:46,690
Okay, so we can rename this one between going to properties general and call it the cylindrical.

70
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,110
Let me. Okay.

71
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,980
And then let's change the last one here. DataFrame. Three, two.

72
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:07,090
I think it's the Robinson system, right?

73
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:17,860
Let's go to properties again, coordinated systems and projected systems.

74
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:32,910
World Brothers. Okay.

75
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,150
So this is kind of trying to look like it's a globe, right?

76
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:43,080
Um, so things are appearing like it's sitting on a globe.

77
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:50,630
Countries appeared like they're sitting on a globe. So there is also distortion here.

78
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,340
Right. But I think distortions are occurring in multiple ways.

79
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,290
This is a more of an esthetically pleasing kind of map rather than showing

80
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:10,430
the actual size and maybe distances between different countries in the world.

81
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,030
So let's rename that one. Robinson.

82
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,460
Okay. All right.

83
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:32,180
So just take a moment. You know, you can compare the three systems just in one, two, three.

84
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:41,690
This is representing the same, uh, you know, geographic coordinate system, but projected in three different ways.

85
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:52,820
And I think the most commonly used one is this one in control, one when you try to look at the whole planet or even countries within the planet.

86
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:57,080
So you can see this fuzziness just gives you an idea how projection systems,

87
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:06,350
how you can change them and also how, how, how they distort things relative to each other.

88
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:13,580
Okay, let's move on to I guess I've messed up on the numbering.

89
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:23,060
This should be lab activity. 2321 is about the United States and U.S. state projection systems.

90
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,200
So let's go to projects. You can open up a new project.

91
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:39,140
Go to your computer, I guess. Open another project at the bottom here.

92
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:50,720
Let's see. See, I think 50, 66 lab projects, projections.

93
00:12:51,400 --> 00:13:00,750
You're going to go to use U.S. projections. So here I have four different men.

94
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:12,670
Okay. My friends. Well, one is quote unquote, the UN projected that using the default system provided by Israel.

95
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,910
The second one uses the USA contiguous Alba's equal area system.

96
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:25,360
This is the U.S. contiguous equidistant conic system.

97
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:33,850
And here is the world Robinson system. It's so cold.

98
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:40,000
Robinson system is kind of nice in a way, because it kind of shows that the, you know,

99
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:45,040
where the country might be on the globe, if you can imagine the rest of the globe.

100
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:53,950
But I think the ones that are most useful and they, they retain distance and area information.

101
00:13:53,950 --> 00:14:02,260
Well are the are the the contiguous Alberth is the equidistant column systems.

102
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:15,100
Okay. So let's measure things just to see how the distance is distorted based on the projection system that we use.

103
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:25,240
If you go to geographic coordinates that now and in the map toolbar appear, there is a measure button.

104
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,800
So you can click measure and select to measure distance.

105
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,580
And we're going to keep it a geodesic.

106
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:42,069
Let's change it to Miles, because we're more familiar with Miles in the U.S. and measure the distance between Los Angeles.

107
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:48,460
So maybe zoom in a little bit, get kind of as close to the center of the dot as possible.

108
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:59,430
Click once and then let go and then travel all the way to New York and try to get the center of that dot and see what you get.

109
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:12,640
I get about four. It's not going to be accurate because we're just going to hovering very good above for 2450, 55 or a little bit above that.

110
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:20,260
Okay. And do the same thing now with the next map, the equal area map.

111
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,430
So click on Los Angeles again.

112
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,840
I'm going to zoom in for myself because it's going to help.

113
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,610
And try to measure the distance in what we see.

114
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,559
So you get you know, this is in kilometers.

115
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,830
I'm sorry, Miles.

116
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,660
So I get 2044 2442.

117
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,510
I'm sorry. Okay, then let's look at the.

118
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:02,560
It. And see where we get.

119
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:14,259
I get about the same 2446 this time and then the world.

120
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:20,560
Robinson. We get.

121
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,970
2600. Okay.

122
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:38,690
So the the real distance estimated real distance is about 2441.

123
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:47,059
So which projection systems kind of get close to that are the middle to the first one is using a default system.

124
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:51,650
It's a chordal system the U.S. Pro uses because we didn't project that map.

125
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,820
So so when you come across this issue about that,

126
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:06,320
the distance is important for you in your analysis using equal area and or equal distance, uh, projections are going to be helpful.

127
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,250
Okay. All right.

128
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:21,560
Now, one thing to note is these are projection systems that are for the whole country, the contiguous United States.

129
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:31,219
So if you're working in a specific part of the country and you want to look at the projection systems for specific parts of the country,

130
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,400
you can go and find them in the same way. Right.

131
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:45,049
I think we did this in class once before. Just to revisit that, you would click on the the the map frame and then go to properties,

132
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:58,760
go to Cornett Systems and then go to a projected coordinate systems and go down to state plains or state systems and find the one you would like.

133
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:09,650
Okay. So if you click on, let's say, state systems, there will be one for almost all of the states in the whole country.

134
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:15,090
You go find something there, you can go to the state plates.

135
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,299
And these are based on different recorded systems.

136
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:36,990
So here is the most recent one. And I think some of you already projected your states to specific systems for that.

137
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,459
So you should all be doing that.

138
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:48,420
I noticed when you guys turned in your maps, some of the maps were look good, correct for the state and some of them kind of looked odd and different.

139
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:56,280
It might be that you didn't projected properly for that state. So next time, when you work on this for your final project,

140
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,360
make sure you use the right projection system for the area of the world that you're working in.

141
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:07,799
Okay. And so right now, I think you should have a pretty good introductory idea about how to choose

142
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,670
the right projection system for the place on the planet that you're working.

143
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:23,470
Particularly the U.S. Okay. So now let's go to the Michigan projection system here.

144
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:30,260
So I have go back to projects, go to open another project and go to my projection.

145
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,910
Okay. Save changes and I'm going to save my changes.

146
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,850
And here we have Michigan.

147
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,880
Looks kind of odd. It's tilted to the left. Right.

148
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:53,460
My math, correct, I think is using the whole U.S. projection system rather than the state system.

149
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,120
So that's right. Click on where says lung cancer mortality.

150
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,490
Go to properties and let's change that and make it make it correct.

151
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,959
Okay. So we're going to go to state systems.

152
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,640
We're going to find NAD 1983 Michigan view RF meters.

153
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,300
So under projected coordinate systems,

154
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:30,600
there is a area called sorry state systems and we're going to go down to mid 1983 and they've already passed in Michigan to your push.

155
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:40,530
Okay. And you'll notice that it's kind of straight now and looks more like what you might be used to seeing in maps of the entire state of Michigan.

156
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,610
Okay. So that's kind of how you you change your projection system for any state you're working on.

157
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:56,730
So let's do this. Let's try to combine all the work that we've learned so far, including projections and do an exercise.

158
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:07,860
There's the next slide. On the slide, that should be an exercise where you are working with HIV AIDS data from the pep fire data repository.

159
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:15,720
Okay. So I think we worked with this repository before we did, I think was in Mozambique and Zambia.

160
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,830
At this time, you're going to do some mapping for Indonesia.

161
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:27,480
So go to the FA spatial data repository and access HIV AIDS data for Indonesia.

162
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:33,840
And do the five steps there. Create a geo database containing the necessary spatial files.

163
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:48,210
Create a corporate map of percentage of ever married women who have no education, which is a risk factor for for HIV aids.

164
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:59,070
And then created graduated symbols map showing percentage of ever married females who have comprehensive and correct knowledge of HIV AIDS.

165
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:07,860
Now, if you don't find those two variables, you can also you can map out two different risk factors that might be relevant to HIV AIDS.

166
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:14,080
The other pieces project your map to UTM Zone 50.

167
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:20,190
Yes. Okay. And that zone should be the zone four for Indonesia.

168
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,410
Okay. So how about you guys? I think it shouldn't take that long.

169
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:36,530
Maybe give you about 20 minutes to work on this and then we'll go on and start geocoding after that.

170
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:46,850
So let me just get you started. It's.

171
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:30,210
So I tried USAID for spatial data repository, and it takes you to this page that we are familiar with and you can go to indicator data.

172
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:48,000
Single country, right? Find Indonesia in this list and let's see what are the.

173
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,120
Select 2017. Look at the indicators that are here.

174
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:19,000
So there is an education question, women with secondary or higher education.

175
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:25,960
And I don't think the knowledge of of HIV AIDS is in here.

176
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:31,690
I was trying to get you to use more recent data, but you can map out the the HIV aids.

177
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:40,590
Testing and receiving test results in the last 12 months, which is a screening question.

178
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:44,420
Okay. She can continue.

179
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:51,290
And I think the last time we did this, we went to select Subnational.

180
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:57,680
The geo databases were not working right. So we said like ship buttons and then download now.

181
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:06,230
So you should get a shape file that's being created or a zip file that's being created with all your shapefile.

182
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:32,020
Hmm. Anybody succeed? Yeah.

183
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:37,750
I think maybe we're all trying at the same time. But, yeah, I think it'll work.

184
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:44,240
I'm going to go. I'm going to keep trying. The biggest thing.

185
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:49,620
Subnational means you get provincial information record.

186
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:11,190
How many people got to download? Oh, that's good.

187
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,600
Good. Good. I think I'm low on the queue here.

188
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,740
It might be good to work in pairs actually.

189
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:31,589
So I think maybe everybody's not getting the download because there is a lot of steps and I think you guys can learn from each other.

190
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:40,700
So how about you work in pairs, right? Line still, I just.

191
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:52,080
Similarly, I have another.

192
00:26:52,830 --> 00:27:02,580
I don't know. We're just waiting to hear from them.

193
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:19,250
Yeah, I'm still willing to see that, because if you take something like this, if it's.

194
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,150
If you know mine, I just did it. So maybe just try doing it again.

195
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:33,780
If you're still hanging high, if it's still kind of spinning because mine worked after just like just reloading and going through the process again.

196
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,259
So as you know, once you get the data, the files,

197
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:52,190
you should look at what files you were given and look at some of the field names and any other metadata information before you start working.

198
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:57,050
And these shape files are here in the CHP folder.

199
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:08,750
Okay. And the if I imagine the shape file at the F, each shipshape file will already have the data merged.

200
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,580
So all the indicators will be in this file here. Okay. Once you bring it into our jazz pro.

201
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:40,290
Somebody had their hand up. No. Okay. Yeah.

202
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,370
So what I did first, they create a new project, right?

203
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:18,000
And then I'm going to put that new project in my HB 866 lab folder under my JS Files project.

204
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:24,660
Okay. And it was called Project Folders.

205
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:30,950
Indonesia. Yes. Oops.

206
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,570
Looks like this generic. Projects.

207
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:49,720
It. Okay.

208
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,800
So I have a new map, both projects.

209
00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:02,410
The first step is to look at the you know here that Indonesia you have a geo database here.

210
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:09,669
You can bring in the shapefile from the shapefile you downloaded into this geo database.

211
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:21,820
Right. So you can right click on it import feature class and then you'll find the feature class.

212
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:32,400
I think it's in the downloads folder very similar.

213
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:47,020
You have to unzip your hair. I kept open it and they kept doing that to me as well.

214
00:30:47,030 --> 00:31:02,970
Like not sure why but I think go to go to right click extract at all and just push extract it.

215
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:09,260
So then downloads, there should be a unzipped folder and then try to find it.

216
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:21,420
He doesn't get. In the middle.

217
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:31,070
This time. So you have to refresh if you don't see it right, click refresh.

218
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:36,310
Right. The shape files.

219
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:53,870
And then this is the file you import. I'll put name you can call it Indonesia HIV and push run you putting it into this database.

220
00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:11,410
I think the percentage from. So if I look at my catalog page there, this this file is appearing.

221
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,010
Anybody need help? Raise your hand. How can I help these two?

222
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:27,270
And then I'll come up with it. You might be stuck at the same thing. All right, so what do you do first down?

223
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,860
What is the extract that comes there in time?

224
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:45,520
I put in parentheses here. Where is the shape that you don't that you should be in doubles from here is okay so just right click on it.

225
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:57,820
You have it to download. I haven't been downloaded. I also had to learn how many times and then whenever I'm going to need to write it down.

226
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:04,320
Yeah. Okay. So let's go to download. It's for you to see if it's there in the open project.

227
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:10,150
Now, right here. Let's make sure we know where to go. Okay, good.

228
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:16,210
So we got it. Yeah. Okay, so just unzip it.

229
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:26,350
So right click on that file and just. Yeah, just through that extract, right click on on the zip, the whatever extract.

230
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,730
Okay, just cool. Okay.

231
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:38,320
Because you're going to bring these data into the project, view their source or yeah, that's all.

232
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:44,620
So now go to our finance pro containing the features and create a new project.

233
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:52,700
Okay, so open a project to go to new information.

234
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,390
Anything that I put your. You didn't mind? Yeah.

235
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:12,070
It's five divided by 86 to 6 lab you can go back to right here why this fails projects and this is interesting.

236
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:16,680
Oh, I think you're doing one of the lessons. Yeah.

237
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:22,690
Just right now. I mean I prefer to select.

238
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,770
Right, right. And then so because we didn't drag it in there yet.

239
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:40,390
Okay. Here is new to type in Indonesia canceled the new map.

240
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:49,090
Oh I can call it Indonesia I think I want to put it to my phone.

241
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:55,000
So patience. Prashant.

242
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:01,510
Okay. Okay. So you have a new project you created during.

243
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,240
So. There you go.

244
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:13,710
So now the next step I did was bringing my shrink file into the GIO database for this project.

245
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,420
Okay, so here are your folders, and here's your folder.

246
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:33,510
Right. Yeah. That's what you call the employer minimizing feature class and say, hey, I find that cheap file to extract.

247
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:49,800
So you're figuring out the menu that right click and refresh there next year.

248
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,790
And then that might be like, I don't know. There you go.

249
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:06,460
I recall over there in Indonesia, you can write down here the code I'm looking at right here.

250
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:15,820
But look that you can't recall. No wonder this is something new for me.

251
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:22,290
But you did a little bit, because in my office, I think even with the program, I feel like I'm not sure.

252
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:27,140
Yeah, that's very attractive.

253
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:44,700
I think about your voice. Everything else is okay in your project, and more than anybody need some assistance.

254
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:59,390
Oh, yeah. And I definitely think, like I said, you know, I downloaded data.

255
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,870
I tried to. Insisted.

256
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:23,260
He resisted. So we just left, conceded that we still don't understand what justification that right is a key.

257
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:32,610
Hundred ever made a.

258
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,330
So you can call you can change the company.

259
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:46,080
And then there is this media reference here.

260
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:58,230
Well, there are exercises where you can create in movies for of better.

261
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:06,840
And that I think, you know, you may have been branded and I don't think so.

262
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,930
It's like I said.

263
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:20,290
Yeah. Then you can select a different variable in different directions.

264
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:25,340
Oh, yeah.

265
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:39,000
Yeah, I guess you did. I think the reason. You know, I think they do the math.

266
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:49,110
I just think, you know, you are just doing that. So, yeah, you know, I'm sorry.

267
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:56,820
You know, I guess you have to you have to believe that, actually.

268
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:14,580
And I was just, like, doing the math. You know, if I didn't like it, I was just like like this is my 93 year old, right?

269
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:17,820
And so that had to go into my family all the way.

270
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:24,130
Because I don't like fighting, but others always are.

271
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:31,790
Yeah, I think I know what want to be very excited.

272
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:40,210
I think that I was going to say no excitement.

273
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:53,240
Jennifer So I hear it's like the married one in.

274
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,970
Wasn't on the government side, so I just don't know.

275
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:05,760
Yeah, well, I was looking at it even though it wasn't like the first marriage was like the media agent.

276
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:10,290
Yeah, it's. Oh, yeah, it is. But I don't know.

277
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:19,730
I mean, now I just get my degree or if I get.

278
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:33,650
Right. I mean, that's cool. Yeah, right. Like, maybe. Okay, so losing control is one thing at a time.

279
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:43,750
So I just want to say, you know what I mean is that people will with.

280
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:48,610
I just don't I don't think that. I'm just retired from.

281
00:40:51,670 --> 00:41:10,690
Well, you know how you know, I feel like this is a race that they want to figure out where and how they relate to people and stuff.

282
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:19,470
So I think he says, I don't have a perfect family so I can your.

283
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:25,660
You know, it'd be easy. Yeah.

284
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:30,610
Yeah, well, I wouldn't have something for you or, you know, what they're doing over here.

285
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:43,670
So that is the significance of what we're hearing, which is that the.

286
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,090
I need to update that because there was an explosion that happened.

287
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:00,850
I think it was like and I don't know. Okay.

288
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:08,180
Oh, my God. I thought they were there, but. So we're just having two different variables on top of each other.

289
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:12,690
That's right. Okay. So how do you do that?

290
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:29,450
Good question. I think we're shooting now, so I think we should have two copies.

291
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:34,300
Disappointed when we make a difference in volunteering.

292
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:50,540
Yeah, I think, you know, I feel comfortable coming in and make sure I don't break because I have to try to find something that makes sense.

293
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:57,400
I was trying to decide, I don't know, but also related to that sort of thing.

294
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,100
Okay. That's okay. That some of what you do.

295
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:08,980
Maybe she. Why do you symbolize the state?

296
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:13,280
I never graduated, so there's like a grain of.

297
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:19,830
So I was like, yeah, copy the copy said it all.

298
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,420
And we have people in my family.

299
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:30,270
And so now I have a copy of these different variables in different places.

300
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:42,569
And I want a way for those who are trying to get the graduated symbols on top of the graduated colors.

301
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:50,309
Right. So here you can though I haven't symbolized anything, but the procedure is you're right.

302
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:55,260
Click on the layer for Indonesia HIV.

303
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:01,740
Copy it. Oops, copy and paste.

304
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:12,420
Click on map and then push case. You have two copies of that same feature class and you can symbolize each one differently.

305
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:20,160
Different variables. The one, the top one could be educational attainment as a clear path map,

306
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:28,410
and the bottom one could be something like HIV prevalence as a graduated symbols symbology.

307
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:33,780
So then the symbols would overlay the graduated colors.

308
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,130
Okay, I'll give you an idea here.

309
00:44:49,430 --> 00:45:27,280
It's cool. Yeah.

310
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:45,680
This is. I didn't know about this.

311
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:57,000
So this morning I was like, I really like this stuff.

312
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:07,630
But this was a military coup. But we don't have any data forces more educated.

313
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:14,810
What is the age of Americans and retaining the place?

314
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:21,680
Oh, that's interesting. I get it and I'm excited.

315
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:36,770
I guess I just want to try this one and it's just going to be only the parent that you did.

316
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:42,110
That was like anything times. We can differentiate between.

317
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,120
But I think. Yes.

318
00:46:50,980 --> 00:47:06,000
Yes. Just so you know, it's just.

319
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:21,790
In the prevalence data for HIV are missing.

320
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:29,470
So I may suggest you map out women receiving HIV test and receiving test results in the last 12 months.

321
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:46,570
Just AJC. All the HIV data is missing.

322
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:52,060
Unfortunately, I apologize for this. I just pick a different variable for this matter of a.

323
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,300
Even total fertility rate. What's that? 12.

324
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:10,090
If the. Oh.

325
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:44,770
She? Is not easy to address.

326
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:59,150
You know, it's not this. And this is a bunch of 99 years old.

327
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:05,770
Oh, yeah, of course. We should.

328
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:26,970
Yeah. Yeah.

329
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:34,090
I'm sorry. The HIV data are kind of missing. So just map female education and another variable of interest.

330
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:43,250
So I mapped. Which one was it?

331
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,190
Married women currently using any method of contraception.

332
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:14,560
This is. Shopping trends and.

333
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:38,670
You know you're here, and you can show me something that you.

334
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:51,440
What's. So you you know, it's an educational.

335
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:58,540
I think it's very important to remember that you're small.

336
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:05,990
All right. Once you get some, you know, symbolize try to project this to the correct projection system.

337
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:14,330
I think that's the last one of the year.

338
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:35,750
Because we don't match something cool.

339
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:41,920
I mean, imagine there was.

340
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:49,950
You for your.

341
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:15,740
We ought to do something to make the two different institutions.

342
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:34,650
In the final. Oh.

343
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:40,560
Now to change this again. Yeah.

344
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:58,140
So, you know, they said, you know, sometimes you continue.

345
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:17,680
Has. It was a.

346
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:32,900
Oh, and then it as a result. And I think there's little doubt Lawrence is making fun of it for you.

347
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:38,089
Oh, yeah, I think you might.

348
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:46,770
Five in particular. Oh.

349
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:53,390
That's because I do.

350
00:53:56,770 --> 00:54:07,920
Sounds better. Which I think they're going to do.

351
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:12,990
I did the same with dollars $0.50.

352
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:35,620
I'm sure. Yes. He's going in Indonesia and he's going to find out.

353
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:41,200
And then now for base maps, I think there were two base maps that are default.

354
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:45,410
I deleted those by right clicking them and pushing remove.

355
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:54,080
And you can select different base maps from maps and then go to base maps and you can change your base maps here.

356
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:58,520
I chose like gray canvas.

357
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:04,549
So this sometimes helps when people don't know where the country is located and so forth.

358
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:08,570
Right. You over time.

359
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,100
Yeah. So I remove the default based maps.

360
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:19,160
It was like world topographic and hillside by right clicking and pushing remove.

361
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:35,900
And then I went to map base map and I played around with The View and I landed on like great canvas and I'm like, You need to do the other ones first.

362
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,890
You know, you can just and tick them off with are other types.

363
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:50,569
Okay. Let's see.

364
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:54,380
Let's try to wrap up in a few minutes and then you can keep working.

365
00:55:54,980 --> 00:56:00,740
But then let's take a break. Okay. So if you're done, you can start your break.

366
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:06,560
If you're not done, you can finish it up and we'll come back at 420.

367
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:11,360
And when we come back, we'll do the students discussions.

368
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:19,310
Okay. I'm not really ready to go to school.

369
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:28,480
And I believe that you will hear from me.

370
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:35,350
Did both students send me your slides for the car for.

371
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:40,100
All? Well, I think you might have already.

372
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:44,590
Let me double check. No, I.

373
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:50,059
Yeah, I have Patricia's, and I make sure that you're doing an ulcer test,

374
00:56:50,060 --> 00:57:00,230
and I guess I wanted to send those like this after they had to give it to me, so.

375
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:05,570
Okay. Yeah, I know I didn't.

376
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:17,830
I guess because I was. Get in the spirit of God that we've been married for my whole life.

377
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:25,800
You should have, like, you know, to be smart in a wig.

378
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:34,290
Yeah. You know, this specific lady, you.

379
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:46,110
Professor vary based on what happens if he says there's no base match available for him to deal?

380
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:57,840
I don't know. Let me see what happened. I mean, I'm telling you, he have the weird stuff and to be like, oh, 90 days out there.

381
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:14,540
Why is the moment that an assignment one time crime and trying to give yourself permission.

382
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:22,970
I was so upset with me and boom done the exact same thing but I'd done like 97 times and it was like, oh well.

383
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:34,440
So if this happens, I would say what you're doing is probably not going to be the same story because,

384
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:43,060
you know, if I go back and show you how to do this or stuff like that,

385
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:56,370
like I like that, I feel as if I'm getting this all the time, actually doing it as yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

386
00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:06,370
I think you're missing internet connection. That's what I. I can smell it.

387
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,610
And it connected to the Internet.

388
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:21,470
Can you just make sure you're not just floating around, losing someone before the end of the night, hoping to be able to get anywhere?

389
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:27,150
I think the cables are new diplomatic cables, I think.

390
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:32,060
Is it plugged into something? Yeah, it wasn't anything.

391
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:41,940
Like, I have a connection now and they're just going to go, oh, right now.

392
00:59:42,200 --> 01:00:04,020
Like I think I was a young executive in London and they didn't have an interesting in like a lot of people like to go and work environmental stuff.

393
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:17,260
What you want to know what's right is nothing more than that just because you want to do all that, but you have all these people sitting around.

394
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:23,640
I'm just very open about like I can only use like I don't come to Egypt every year because the next time he says,

395
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:46,860
like 15 years I've been watching it and I was like, Yeah, I decided not to find out, like yoga classes and the like.

396
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:52,320
And it's about earlier. We're right here on the right.

397
01:00:52,360 --> 01:01:00,300
Yes, correct. So it was just, you know, you came next.

398
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:04,550
Yeah, we know that. You know, literally there's my here.

399
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:09,120
Oh, my God. And so the Manhattan Project or national historic.

400
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:14,990
That's really important. And I think that not the case.

401
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:22,220
And I think you just see more interesting.

402
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:28,320
You hear that Colorado year have just that.

403
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:35,940
I feel like, you know like lord of the although you will give the day a minute Joe Zane and this guy was like,

404
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:41,280
I think you got that where the wind comes with you.

405
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:47,309
And he's like, Oh, it's like a song to me.

406
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:56,670
It's like it's like when you play in the basement, you've got to keep your.

407
01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:07,010
I remember how the child stared at me. I was like, Okay, I'm going to send this to you that you've seen.

408
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:12,670
Yeah, I'm sorry, because I just think something's wrong.

409
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:23,700
It's sort of a weird thing where like anything that you just said to do something

410
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:33,750
like this is a good way to say it doesn't really change who is correct.

411
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:43,670
It can be like picking what we're going to do with our data. It's like I think about, Yeah, yeah, I think you could give us an extension.

412
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:49,790
So yeah.

413
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:58,940
Because I think that also has a tremendous point of.

414
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:15,440
Where is the. Community has become.

415
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:52,900
The Israelis tend to be. For.

416
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:14,410
So I'd like to say that we've had a good friend of mine, which was in New York.

417
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:23,040
Oh, yeah. And yeah. So, you know, but it wasn't until, you know, I didn't realize.

418
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:31,070
Oh, said, oh, yeah, because I think but I don't really like somebody at all like yeah.

419
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:35,660
Like somebody that's putting in a lot of money that would have to add something, delete like the,

420
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:39,730
like the names and all that and like whatever it was, I mean, it had been deleted.

421
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,930
So I was just like, it's killing me. There has to be something wrong with I should have had a better place to go.

422
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:55,120
But I think it was like you would go to a table in like you Clipper's specific place you wanted and then had any, you know, what exactly happened.

423
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:58,660
That was like one of my answers. I was like, Oh, can I not know what to delete?

424
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:03,400
So yeah. So yeah. So you don't have.

425
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:14,380
Yeah, sure. Oh, no, I think so.

426
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:18,260
Descriptions like production specifications.

427
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:32,820
Yeah, I had this whole I went to this whole extensive thing to write because I'm like, that's what I'm leaving here.

428
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:41,690
And as a result of stuff. But because I'm like always, like I know a lot of governments so they can spin it because then she's talking about,

429
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:49,000
like, data and nothing works for me. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

430
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:56,060
And okay. Yeah. I follow some records, but I also found like, Detroit MI.

431
01:05:56,090 --> 01:06:03,620
Yeah, one man deep dove inside of the Salt Lake.

432
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:22,190
From. I think it was a very liberating offer for them.

433
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:29,720
But the thing with it, because I found this part of it is the policy trade news article first and then it was linked in there, I think.

434
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:38,450
Yeah. And I was like, oh. And then I felt like this as a capitalist to the group that has that foundation.

435
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:51,460
And Detroit wasn't going to be the metropolitan segment that if it was one.

436
01:06:54,640 --> 01:07:08,920
I think he just has a feeling for like somebody like, you know, Texas on the brink of hydrofracking.

437
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:13,240
It sounds like the potential deal that might.

438
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:29,909
And that here, just like the period of poverty before, we had seven times more capital mandatory hotel quarantine.

439
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:39,330
But it seems like I guess like because I mean, they're not those kind of Hollywood people.

440
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:58,120
Oh, yeah. It was like, oh, yeah. I was like, Oh, yeah, that's where I worked for years.

441
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:04,510
Well, I think it's probably a people.

442
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:06,295
Yeah. And I just felt bad because it was an ally, and I was like, anything that's going on movies.

443
01:08:17,446 --> 01:08:20,716
This is your right here.

444
01:08:33,326 --> 01:08:44,576
Hmm. Okay. So I covered the reading from currently 2012 Chapter five, which was the chapter on analyzing Spatial Clustering of Health event.

445
01:08:46,976 --> 01:08:51,896
Just for an outline, I'm going to go through an introduction to the definitions.

446
01:08:52,356 --> 01:08:58,076
I'm going to jump into the content of the chapter. So the first thing they covered was the small numbers problem.

447
01:08:58,106 --> 01:09:00,466
Then the spatial methods of cluster detection.

448
01:09:01,166 --> 01:09:08,516
Then applications for space time, like looking at clustering throughout time and then ending on strengths, weaknesses and conclusions.

449
01:09:10,766 --> 01:09:17,636
So for the introduction, just to define a cluster, a cluster is an unusual concentration of health events in space and time.

450
01:09:18,866 --> 01:09:23,546
And in the chapter, they talked about how public health departments can become alerted when citizens

451
01:09:23,546 --> 01:09:30,296
become concerned or through surveillance systems and FDA develops innovative spatial

452
01:09:30,296 --> 01:09:35,785
statistical methods has been linked with graphs to analyze spatial clustering of disease

453
01:09:35,786 --> 01:09:41,126
in populations and to assess changes in health status and disease prevalence over time.

454
01:09:42,666 --> 01:09:48,686
And so to do these like cluster analysis, you need several important bits of information.

455
01:09:49,406 --> 01:09:54,956
First, you need the number of cases of the disease or whatever relative to the population at risk.

456
01:09:56,066 --> 01:10:00,236
And this was just a diagram they had in the book that I thought was really helpful.

457
01:10:00,266 --> 01:10:03,636
So you can see, like all the cases, cases are here.

458
01:10:04,286 --> 01:10:09,476
But on the right map, that kind of makes sense because that's where all the population who could have the cases are.

459
01:10:09,626 --> 01:10:17,816
Whereas on the left the populations are could have the cases in the is in the center, but the cluster is still further out there to the left.

460
01:10:19,886 --> 01:10:26,296
So in addition to the number of the cases, you also need to define the geographic extent or the scale at which you'll do the analysis.

461
01:10:26,366 --> 01:10:33,706
And you need a set of criteria for judging how much clustering exists for the geographic extent or scale.

462
01:10:33,716 --> 01:10:38,816
They talked about how you could do more of a localized analysis and look at like a specific community or city.

463
01:10:39,086 --> 01:10:47,826
Or you could do an analysis of a whole region or state. So I've wondered how does the scale of analysis affect factors influencing health?

464
01:10:47,846 --> 01:10:55,076
Like what might you be looking at for cities, communities, or what might you be looking at for factors influencing how a region or state level?

465
01:11:07,986 --> 01:11:11,885
So one thing they had talked about a little bit was like cities are communities.

466
01:11:11,886 --> 01:11:18,156
You might be looking for sources of pollution like hazardous facilities, dumpsites.

467
01:11:19,056 --> 01:11:25,446
Whereas if you're doing a region or statewide analysis, you might look towards like political affiliations or bigger trends.

468
01:11:27,756 --> 01:11:31,146
And then moving on to the smaller numbers problem.

469
01:11:33,066 --> 01:11:41,496
So in small population areas, a difference of one or two cases can make a huge impact on incidents or prevalence rates.

470
01:11:42,306 --> 01:11:44,106
So if we're doing like portable plus mapping,

471
01:11:44,526 --> 01:11:52,206
that means the year you pay for like the year of data you use could be hugely different from another year for those small population areas.

472
01:11:53,196 --> 01:11:59,226
And because those maps don't show the varying degrees of reliability, they could give a really false impression of the data.

473
01:12:00,726 --> 01:12:07,896
So one thing we can do about that is probability mapping. That's a well-established statistical method for addressing the small numbers problem.

474
01:12:08,886 --> 01:12:13,776
And it maps the statistical significance of the rates rather than the rates themselves.

475
01:12:14,526 --> 01:12:19,776
And so it compares like the rate in that area and measures the probability that that would occur.

476
01:12:19,776 --> 01:12:21,036
Given the population rate,

477
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:30,936
like the overall rate in the population and values that are close to zero or one are significantly different from the population rate.

478
01:12:32,166 --> 01:12:37,716
And we can only use point zero, 5.0 where I'm just like normal, like probability toss.

479
01:12:40,086 --> 01:12:43,296
But there are some important limitations with probability mapping.

480
01:12:43,836 --> 01:12:50,136
It does not preserve the original content of the data. Like the only way it's linked to the original data is through the statistical test.

481
01:12:51,096 --> 01:12:57,635
And then it also tends to really overemphasize the significance of rates in areas with big populations,

482
01:12:57,636 --> 01:13:03,006
because so much of statistical significance is based on population size.

483
01:13:05,316 --> 01:13:07,056
So in light of those limitations,

484
01:13:07,176 --> 01:13:17,856
another way to address the small numbers problem is empirical Bayes estimation is a compromise between probability mapping and simple complex mapping.

485
01:13:18,666 --> 01:13:25,716
The rates are adjusted upward and downward, so they're kind of smoothed based on the size of the population that the original rate came from.

486
01:13:26,376 --> 01:13:32,166
And they're pulled toward the national regional rate rates and areas with smaller populations.

487
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:38,496
Are we more greatly impacted? I might put it more toward the average than if the area had a larger population.

488
01:13:40,176 --> 01:13:43,736
And there is an apparent issue of defining like what rate you'll pull others to.

489
01:13:43,776 --> 01:13:48,696
Because if you use the same rate across the whole area, you can wipe out the geographic variation.

490
01:13:49,296 --> 01:13:54,306
So it's better to use slightly localized rates. So you can still see some of the geographic variation.

491
01:13:56,106 --> 01:14:05,556
And on the rate here, I have a figure from the book and on the top is just the normal mortality rates due to fire.

492
01:14:05,826 --> 01:14:08,016
Yeah. Fire and burn related mortality rates.

493
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:14,606
And then on the bottom they did the empirical base estimation and you can see a lot of those like high risk areas went away.

494
01:14:16,096 --> 01:14:24,006
So I just wondered what are the implications of this? And so when and when you want to use the unadjusted readings.

495
01:14:25,446 --> 01:14:33,966
So when would you want to see all those areas or would it be better to just have a the does anyone have any thoughts?

496
01:14:35,106 --> 01:14:41,886
Yeah, I think when you're trying to decide where you're going to put in services or.

497
01:14:43,756 --> 01:14:50,736
Where you're directing funding at the top in the bottom row.

498
01:14:52,006 --> 01:14:56,385
I guess you could argue that you could put in like a regional location and you really have the bottom out.

499
01:14:56,386 --> 01:15:06,705
But I don't think that would be particularly difficult for a regional location is probably not as helpful for media services.

500
01:15:06,706 --> 01:15:12,346
And so I think just when you are smoothing that out, understanding that as you mentioned,

501
01:15:12,346 --> 01:15:19,336
like what the moving rate is based on the localization, how was that chosen?

502
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:22,996
Who is it excluding, whether it's intentional or not?

503
01:15:23,866 --> 01:15:27,016
Yeah, for sure. Yeah.

504
01:15:27,016 --> 01:15:32,865
I was thinking like pretty similarly, like you can see like the more high focus areas here,

505
01:15:32,866 --> 01:15:38,806
but you're also losing a lot of rural areas and it really undercounts like areas with small populations

506
01:15:38,866 --> 01:15:43,186
and basically says like they can't be significant because they have two small populations,

507
01:15:43,946 --> 01:15:46,366
one which is important for some like big picture stuff.

508
01:15:46,366 --> 01:15:54,016
But you're also really missing a lot of data, which is already such a problem for people that live in rural areas.

509
01:15:57,166 --> 01:16:00,466
Moving on to spatial methods of cluster detection.

510
01:16:01,036 --> 01:16:06,376
Broadly, these are divided into three groups global methods which assess overall clustering,

511
01:16:06,376 --> 01:16:13,366
local methods which identify cluster location and focus methods which assess clustering around a point source.

512
01:16:14,146 --> 01:16:17,926
And the local methods and focus methods are more applicable to GIS.

513
01:16:18,466 --> 01:16:24,616
But this chapter pretty much only focused on the local methods which they divided into field based and object based.

514
01:16:26,116 --> 01:16:30,106
Both field based and object based methods need spatial weights,

515
01:16:30,196 --> 01:16:35,176
and these are numerical values that indicate how close to areas or points are to each other.

516
01:16:35,596 --> 01:16:45,645
Higher values means they're closer. Um, and you can either do that based on contiguity or adjacency or based on proximity distance.

517
01:16:45,646 --> 01:16:50,866
So contiguity like whether two areas or touching. So for area data, you can just observe that directly.

518
01:16:51,556 --> 01:16:59,086
For point data, they like to make polygons and see if those areas touch for proximity front with

519
01:16:59,106 --> 01:17:03,436
area data you need to calculate centroid so it can be population weighted too.

520
01:17:04,156 --> 01:17:09,226
So the centroid would be closer to the population for that area.

521
01:17:10,216 --> 01:17:13,906
And then you can calculate distance based on the center or with point data.

522
01:17:13,906 --> 01:17:15,526
You can just observe it directly.

523
01:17:18,286 --> 01:17:23,646
An important thing about spatial weights is that they can either be defined based on like a critical cutoff distance,

524
01:17:23,646 --> 01:17:30,976
so we could either be zero or one, or you could define the weight based on a formula, including distance, so that it could vary.

525
01:17:34,936 --> 01:17:38,625
Field based methods. Basically, overall,

526
01:17:38,626 --> 01:17:43,756
they scan the study region moving from area to area or point to point and assess the

527
01:17:43,756 --> 01:17:51,196
clustering at each location that starts with localized measures of spatial dependance.

528
01:17:51,916 --> 01:17:57,046
And they gave to sort of statistical values, tracked about two statistical values for that.

529
01:17:57,796 --> 01:18:01,866
One of them was the g sub I star and one that's positive.

530
01:18:01,906 --> 01:18:06,346
You have a high rate cluster or a hotspot and then it's negative. You have a low rate cluster or both.

531
01:18:06,446 --> 01:18:13,186
But they also talked about the Lisa statistic for local indicators of spatial order correlation.

532
01:18:14,506 --> 01:18:19,335
Um, and that one, when it's positive, you just have a cluster of similar values.

533
01:18:19,336 --> 01:18:21,315
So it could be a hotspot, Oracle hotspot.

534
01:18:21,316 --> 01:18:29,986
And when it's negative, it means you have a cluster of dissimilar values and both of those are used in the other field based methods.

535
01:18:31,676 --> 01:18:37,126
One of those methods is kernel estimation, which is really a cluster detection method.

536
01:18:37,366 --> 01:18:40,936
So it's more of a method for displaying data,

537
01:18:41,566 --> 01:18:49,756
but you can use it for cluster detection by creating a map of risk population similar to the map of health events and then overlaying them,

538
01:18:50,956 --> 01:18:59,536
and then current estimation, a spatial window. The col like moves over the area and calculates the density of health events in five.

539
01:19:00,496 --> 01:19:09,606
So then you get like a bunch of numbers and you can smooth those using country software rather than just having the points.

540
01:19:12,006 --> 01:19:19,206
And there is also the spatial scan statistics that scan in the Disease Mapping and Analysis Program D map.

541
01:19:19,956 --> 01:19:23,286
And both of those were more specific for like specific software.

542
01:19:23,316 --> 01:19:28,416
So there's some information about them up there, but I don't think they'll be as applicable to what we do.

543
01:19:32,326 --> 01:19:40,846
Moving on to object based methods. The search for clusters by grouping nearby cases of disease which are objects and then testing

544
01:19:40,846 --> 01:19:46,906
whether the group cases represent a statistically a statistically significant cluster.

545
01:19:48,406 --> 01:19:56,386
The first one by and Newell's method is based on the premise that clustering can only exist in places where cases exist, which makes sense.

546
01:19:57,286 --> 01:20:04,336
So it searches for clusters around cases and it tests the number of cases relative to the risk population for that area.

547
01:20:05,356 --> 01:20:09,706
And for that one, there's a critical issue of like how big do we want the cluster size to be?

548
01:20:10,276 --> 01:20:18,856
Usually it's like 3 to 5. The benefits to this method are that it's more conservative, it's less likely to identify false positive,

549
01:20:19,666 --> 01:20:24,166
and it's easier computationally because you're only starting with the cases instead of the whole area.

550
01:20:26,416 --> 01:20:33,766
There's also the Amoeba method, which grows the cluster outward from the seed location and uses an algorithm to track

551
01:20:33,766 --> 01:20:39,316
contiguous areas so that areas next to that location to see if health indicators are similar.

552
01:20:40,996 --> 01:20:46,066
And that keeps combining until the highest absolute value of a star is reached.

553
01:20:47,416 --> 01:20:56,776
And it prefers non-overlapping clusters. So it keeps the most the highest values of die star and designates those as significant

554
01:20:57,826 --> 01:21:02,206
in the mean benefit to the amoeba method is that it can detect clusters of any shape,

555
01:21:02,326 --> 01:21:08,806
and that reflects the uneven social and environmental geographies of risk that we see in the real world.

556
01:21:13,456 --> 01:21:22,456
And then one particular application for spatial clustering is that we can start to do space time clustering.

557
01:21:23,656 --> 01:21:31,606
And so if we think back to the original definition of cluster, it included unusual concentrations of health events in space and time.

558
01:21:31,996 --> 01:21:34,366
So sort of getting into that time aspect,

559
01:21:35,536 --> 01:21:41,446
space time clusters are clusters that emerged during particular time interval intervals in particular places.

560
01:21:42,736 --> 01:21:49,516
A lot of the methods, field based or object based, could be used for this just by adding we're kind of stacking them on top of each

561
01:21:49,516 --> 01:21:53,476
other and adding a time window in addition to the spatial windows they use.

562
01:21:55,036 --> 01:21:59,236
But traditionally, these methods have been plagued by issues with latency and migration.

563
01:21:59,386 --> 01:22:07,126
So latency like the disease doesn't start right away. Like you could live somewhere and it'll start, but it doesn't show up till like way later.

564
01:22:08,116 --> 01:22:15,166
And migration, like people move in and out of areas so their health events might not reflect the area they're currently in.

565
01:22:17,086 --> 01:22:21,856
And then one way to deal with this is the space time path which is seen over here,

566
01:22:22,376 --> 01:22:27,226
and it's like a 3D representation of a like individuals migration history,

567
01:22:28,216 --> 01:22:36,526
and they're starting to use these with case control studies more so you can account for personal risk factors, but then also geographic analysis.

568
01:22:40,496 --> 01:22:48,475
So overall the chapter was really strong because it presented the background of the jazz technology.

569
01:22:48,476 --> 01:22:56,576
And I talked about like some earlier methods like the Geographic Analysis Machine, which also used like fields and windows.

570
01:22:59,186 --> 01:23:06,266
And another strength was that it covered the methods like rate from the statistical equations up through real world examples and maps.

571
01:23:06,806 --> 01:23:13,766
And it discussed the considerations for how to choose a clustering method like financially and based on the data.

572
01:23:15,836 --> 01:23:25,826
So based on like just what clustering is, those have any thoughts for what health issues might lend themselves to the spatial cluster analysis?

573
01:23:36,066 --> 01:23:40,136
Sorry. Yeah, thank you. Fine. I study maternity care.

574
01:23:40,146 --> 01:23:47,066
Medicine is sorting out that. And something interesting that I worked with.

575
01:23:48,046 --> 01:23:57,346
Her first assignment was looking at spatial clustering for maternity care in the sense that if you're living in a county that's a desert,

576
01:23:57,706 --> 01:24:00,466
but you live right next to a county that's not a desert,

577
01:24:01,006 --> 01:24:07,006
then your access to that may be very different for someone who lives in the desert, in the county.

578
01:24:07,006 --> 01:24:11,986
Surrounding them were also desert, so like a spatial analysis could be.

579
01:24:14,086 --> 01:24:21,176
For understanding whether or not. That doesn't status necessarily is going to have the same.

580
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:32,245
Yeah, that's a great application. I haven't thought about it as much with like health care use or like access to health care.

581
01:24:32,246 --> 01:24:36,866
I was thinking more like communicable disease, but that's super important and a great application for sure.

582
01:24:39,586 --> 01:24:47,056
Some weaknesses of the reading. Like pretty much everyone else's, technology advances really quickly and now the chapter is ten years old.

583
01:24:47,506 --> 01:24:54,346
So I'm sure it's like a little behind on spatial clustering methods, but it did give a nice background up to the current of 2012.

584
01:24:56,476 --> 01:24:59,446
Another weakness a small number of clusters will occur by chance.

585
01:24:59,566 --> 01:25:06,796
So each cluster, like even when using a program, needs to be evaluated and really thoroughly looked at to make sure it's not chance.

586
01:25:08,116 --> 01:25:14,806
And then another weakness was that it introduced a lot of equations and statistical concepts that went right over my head.

587
01:25:15,106 --> 01:25:21,436
And Sigma is in there. No, thank you. But beyond that, it was really easy to understand.

588
01:25:23,266 --> 01:25:29,296
And are there any health issues that you guys think might not benefit from a cluster analysis like don't even bother.

589
01:25:40,216 --> 01:25:46,576
That's fair. That's a harder question. I was thinking like maybe purely genetic disorders, but even then you might want to know where people are,

590
01:25:46,576 --> 01:25:54,736
like getting tested for them and getting treated for them. So I think it really just depends on what sort of research question you have.

591
01:25:56,986 --> 01:26:06,016
And then lastly, the implications. Spatial cluster analysis can help researchers and policymakers make sense of complex geographic patterns.

592
01:26:08,266 --> 01:26:11,865
Cluster detection also needs to be incorporated into public health surveillance,

593
01:26:11,866 --> 01:26:15,916
so we don't miss clusters in communities that lack political or economic clout.

594
01:26:16,846 --> 01:26:21,616
So they talked about, like communities are really concerned, they can advocate for a cluster analysis.

595
01:26:22,006 --> 01:26:30,046
But if that concerned community doesn't have political or economic power, it's just going to keep happening and the health event will get worse.

596
01:26:31,306 --> 01:26:36,525
And then lastly, Google Earth and other emerging technologies for linking cluster investigations to

597
01:26:36,526 --> 01:26:41,146
detailed geospatial information means that cluster analysis will only continue to grow.

598
01:26:44,086 --> 01:26:52,016
Thank you so much. Great job and I think that was a difficult chapter.

599
01:26:52,016 --> 01:27:02,246
And when he did it really well. We're not going to cover all of these methods, but we're going to talk about local and global clustering statistics,

600
01:27:02,666 --> 01:27:09,655
things like the global marine statistic and the GI statistic.

601
01:27:09,656 --> 01:27:13,766
We'll be doing a version of the LISA statistics.

602
01:27:13,766 --> 01:27:19,646
So look at some of this information. I think also clustering analysis, I think relevant everyone.

603
01:27:20,216 --> 01:27:26,096
I think the point of this is to look at statistically significant differences between regions.

604
01:27:26,096 --> 01:27:31,466
I think that sort of helps us identify where so far we're just kind of mapping, you know, rates.

605
01:27:31,916 --> 01:27:35,696
We can't really tell if one area is statistically higher than another area.

606
01:27:36,146 --> 01:27:45,176
And this clustering analysis will let us do that. I think to answer this question, maybe rare events because they rarely play don't cluster enough.

607
01:27:45,686 --> 01:27:49,406
So great, but excellent job.

608
01:27:49,526 --> 01:27:54,596
Sam, you're next whenever you're ready. Come on up here.

609
01:27:54,596 --> 01:28:00,275
Slide show. Apologies already.

610
01:28:00,276 --> 01:28:05,536
I'm not as creative with my PowerPoint, so this is a template from itself.

611
01:28:07,626 --> 01:28:14,046
Every day I'm like, Holy cow, these are gorgeous. This is my go to one every PowerPoint every day.

612
01:28:16,116 --> 01:28:21,275
So I had a research article or more of kind of took a step through and how spatial analysis can be used in research.

613
01:28:21,276 --> 01:28:25,296
And specifically they wanted to look at how it can be used in health promotion, health education.

614
01:28:27,036 --> 01:28:32,046
So it's a road map. We're going to lead some foundation, one for news and information that they provide us.

615
01:28:32,346 --> 01:28:39,125
And they're going into the methods and how I got the information and then the data to use for the example of the use going to the results of it.

616
01:28:39,126 --> 01:28:42,336
Strengths, limitations and some key takeaways I had from the article.

617
01:28:44,046 --> 01:28:47,466
So spatial analysis at six. It's pretty much what we're doing here.

618
01:28:47,466 --> 01:28:52,266
It seeks to describe making princes about variables, respect to where they're located.

619
01:28:53,316 --> 01:28:59,076
So, for example, looking at different geographic differences or proximity issues and access to resources,

620
01:28:59,856 --> 01:29:07,806
and then the article, they go over four different main ones. And then with any of those four main labels, there is a spatial analysis within it.

621
01:29:08,256 --> 01:29:13,085
So first one, descriptive mapping, this is what we've been doing all year so far seeks to visualize,

622
01:29:13,086 --> 01:29:17,676
represent data of particular region using lines, polygons and shapes.

623
01:29:19,926 --> 01:29:23,766
Then this is usually useful, I guess a bit later.

624
01:29:25,536 --> 01:29:35,946
And then so going into the global spatial articulation, this identifies where or there are not significant patterns across a large region.

625
01:29:36,846 --> 01:29:42,305
And then based on the features associated with looking at the features in the attributes,

626
01:29:42,306 --> 01:29:48,156
if it was clustered, dispersed or kind of random correlations.

627
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:58,866
And then kind of going into that with your basic understanding, what are some on uses, descriptive mapping and or global spatial autocorrelation?

628
01:30:03,046 --> 01:30:08,955
Okay. So this is what we do. I'm speaking of descriptive mapping and this is what we're doing today.

629
01:30:08,956 --> 01:30:12,676
It's what we're looking at. So there's so many different ones.

630
01:30:12,676 --> 01:30:18,136
And then global spatial correlations, they really focus on health promotion, education.

631
01:30:18,766 --> 01:30:26,146
So identifying unusual patterns of recognizing that need a statistic, strategic allocation of resources based on geographic location.

632
01:30:26,476 --> 01:30:35,916
So kind of looking at how different regions and compared to one another and then descriptive mapping, they want to look at that.

633
01:30:36,016 --> 01:30:39,465
It's really useful for communicating the findings to any new members,

634
01:30:39,466 --> 01:30:44,896
policy makers and kind of leverage and funding sources how we use this in public health.

635
01:30:46,396 --> 01:30:52,306
And there's also so cluster detection and identification and then we're just going to focus on two of those in it.

636
01:30:52,606 --> 01:31:03,016
So Spatial Spatial Association seeks to describe the connectedness, connectiveness and relationships between and among variables over space.

637
01:31:04,846 --> 01:31:11,085
So this is kind of just looking at how this one region compare to other ones.

638
01:31:11,086 --> 01:31:14,266
So and then Patty brought up Lisa.

639
01:31:14,266 --> 01:31:21,556
So local indicators of spatial articulation that compares observed values in geographical space with observed values in neighboring regions.

640
01:31:22,036 --> 01:31:27,586
I'll give you an example in a little bit. So make more sense by just looking at different regions on a local level and how those

641
01:31:27,586 --> 01:31:32,806
regions compared to the ones around it and then go to the spatial scan analysis.

642
01:31:33,196 --> 01:31:37,756
This is uniquely sized windows can move across landscape in section cluster.

643
01:31:37,756 --> 01:31:45,495
So looking at a different like a broader view of the field and then it calculates a maximum likelihood

644
01:31:45,496 --> 01:31:51,796
of ratios of case well relative to the underlying population to identify areas in this cluster.

645
01:31:51,806 --> 01:31:59,716
So I'm looking at the variable and seen how over time or over regions how it identifies two different clusters.

646
01:32:00,016 --> 01:32:07,396
It's very similar to the spatial association, but it's just kind of done a little bit differently on the back side.

647
01:32:09,226 --> 01:32:12,316
And then going down, especially regression, the fourth one they focus on,

648
01:32:12,856 --> 01:32:17,536
it seeks to predict and explain while accounting for geographical spaces of observations.

649
01:32:17,926 --> 01:32:20,716
So not going into too much detail for these.

650
01:32:21,556 --> 01:32:28,965
So main ones they included were a lag regression, geographically weighted regression, spatial error models or multilevel modeling.

651
01:32:28,966 --> 01:32:33,496
Those are just for ones that they said. These are really commonly used and it really get into what they are.

652
01:32:33,676 --> 01:32:41,326
They're just beyond the scope of the paper. But those are some in ones that is used with this in specialist of analysis.

653
01:32:42,256 --> 01:32:47,296
Okay. So then to the purpose of the papers, we have the foundational information.

654
01:32:47,776 --> 01:32:54,466
So this part, this paper was provided as an example of how spatial analysis can be used for health promotion, education.

655
01:32:54,796 --> 01:32:59,656
And by doing that, they wanted to have an illustrative example of spatial analysis of motor vehicle

656
01:32:59,656 --> 01:33:05,535
collisions in different neighborhoods in Cincinnati and then kind of going back.

657
01:33:05,536 --> 01:33:09,346
So they just did an overview of 30 different studies determine commonalities,

658
01:33:09,346 --> 01:33:13,035
methods and how spatial analysis aided in answering these research questions.

659
01:33:13,036 --> 01:33:17,296
So kind of just given definitions of those for spatial analysis.

660
01:33:18,346 --> 01:33:24,736
Yeah. And from those studies, you have to have a working definition for their paper and then the data.

661
01:33:25,156 --> 01:33:32,205
So they got data of the motor vehicle equations from the Cincinnati Police Department and then they have address,

662
01:33:32,206 --> 01:33:36,466
location, date and time, and then they're able to use that and put it into a map.

663
01:33:37,396 --> 01:33:43,766
And then they also have census data of population density, poverty rate and commute to work rate kind of.

664
01:33:43,816 --> 01:33:51,136
These are some limitations kind of get ahead of myself, but they never defined what a motor call motor vehicle collision was.

665
01:33:51,176 --> 01:33:55,155
I don't know if it was just a really simple one or if it was more severe one.

666
01:33:55,156 --> 01:34:00,256
Is this kind of in general motor vehicle collision? And then they only looked at these three variables,

667
01:34:00,256 --> 01:34:06,705
which I thought would be a lot more variables into what would cause high rates of motor vehicle collisions.

668
01:34:06,706 --> 01:34:11,926
But they only focus on these three variables in the paper, which I thought was interesting.

669
01:34:11,926 --> 01:34:16,786
So after they got the data, they're able to bring it over to guys.

670
01:34:16,816 --> 01:34:22,875
So this was where they were, just wanted to plot it on the map and see where they're happening.

671
01:34:22,876 --> 01:34:27,436
So I guess just what are your first impressions of this map?

672
01:34:30,346 --> 01:34:33,586
Mm hmm. It's a lot of collisions. Like collisions? Yeah.

673
01:34:33,596 --> 01:34:38,516
It's kind of all over the place. It's a lot of purple or pink, depending on the shade.

674
01:34:39,346 --> 01:34:42,486
Um, so I thought it was really overwhelming.

675
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:46,586
So it's a lot. And they actually didn't even include this, but it was like supplemental.

676
01:34:46,586 --> 01:34:51,176
And that might be why they didn't include it, because it is not really pushing their information.

677
01:34:51,746 --> 01:34:53,846
So this is kind of looking at general.

678
01:34:53,856 --> 01:35:00,896
Yeah, we can see up and now this is why we need spatial analysis to kind of understand how these regions differ because you can kind of see that,

679
01:35:01,646 --> 01:35:05,366
you know, we have a lot down here and this is a downtown region of Cincinnati over here.

680
01:35:05,786 --> 01:35:13,706
And then they also have this over here with high rates. So it's just kind of we can visually speculate where these are happening,

681
01:35:13,706 --> 01:35:19,256
but we need further analysis to really get the concrete statistics, and that's what we did.

682
01:35:20,516 --> 01:35:28,405
So they use the global spatial autocorrelation to determine the rate of motor vehicle collisions and if there were uniform,

683
01:35:28,406 --> 01:35:34,676
random or clustered, and they're able to determine that there were inequities among the different regions.

684
01:35:35,006 --> 01:35:43,076
So these regions of the neighborhoods of Cincinnati, and then they're able to kind of experiment that there were clustering inequities between

685
01:35:43,946 --> 01:35:48,056
just the different where they're at and the kind of the variables that they're looking at.

686
01:35:48,986 --> 01:35:54,805
Um, so then, so now we have, going back from here, we have the regional,

687
01:35:54,806 --> 01:36:02,126
we know kind of understanding of where the collisions are happening, but now kind of want to compare these different regions to each other.

688
01:36:02,486 --> 01:36:10,705
So that's why we did the Lisa the location we they did location indicator spatial articulation was able to identify hotspots of clusters,

689
01:36:10,706 --> 01:36:17,186
motor vehicle collisions. So if you're like me, I had no idea what the high, high, high, low, low, high and low, low meant.

690
01:36:17,456 --> 01:36:19,256
So I had to go back and kind of read into it.

691
01:36:19,256 --> 01:36:28,016
So this is the understanding that there is a high rate of collisions within each of these and there's a high rate of collisions in their neighborhood.

692
01:36:28,016 --> 01:36:31,916
And so we can see that these all are pretty similar except for this one low, high.

693
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:36,506
So as low amount of collisions, but high amounts things in the neighborhoods around them.

694
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:44,035
And this one is a high amount of collisions compared to low amount of in their neighborhoods.

695
01:36:44,036 --> 01:36:47,906
So we can kind of go back to this one and see this was an upper outlier for them.

696
01:36:48,146 --> 01:36:51,386
And this is kind of going into more evidence of why that's an outlier,

697
01:36:51,746 --> 01:36:54,926
seeing that there's a high amount of collisions here compared to the ones around them.

698
01:36:55,316 --> 01:37:06,145
Same with this one that little bit higher. And also is the outlier there um similar kind of based on this map where would

699
01:37:06,146 --> 01:37:10,406
you want to direct some of your resources knowing that there's outliers here.

700
01:37:10,406 --> 01:37:16,286
We have a high concentration down there. Might want to donate more where you want put the resources.

701
01:37:19,896 --> 01:37:25,115
I think that like I was originally thinking, like I would want to be direct resources to the right areas,

702
01:37:25,116 --> 01:37:30,186
but I'm also thinking like maybe it'd be more effective to the high, low areas because the surrounding are low.

703
01:37:30,486 --> 01:37:32,586
So like using what we know about the surrounding areas,

704
01:37:32,586 --> 01:37:40,896
help me implement like some things that like that make that is probably going to be more feasible than to make some of the rent like a lower level.

705
01:37:41,346 --> 01:37:48,125
Yeah. No, I totally I had that seems like okay red that's giving me my attention but to allocate resources here but then

706
01:37:48,126 --> 01:37:52,776
kind of thinking more that this is an outlier over here and that there's something kind of going on over here.

707
01:37:53,726 --> 01:37:55,176
So I guess I'm hearing this next question.

708
01:37:55,176 --> 01:38:00,396
So what other information would you wish to see in this map to kind of help us guide where those resources should go?

709
01:38:05,066 --> 01:38:07,856
I mean, we're in the demographic here that you mentioned. Yes.

710
01:38:08,336 --> 01:38:15,076
So I want yeah, I want to know more of demographic information of maybe we don't have like low education rates.

711
01:38:15,086 --> 01:38:22,736
Maybe there is a high teenage drivers in this area kind of just looking into those kind of the other variables of why this might be an outlier.

712
01:38:23,646 --> 01:38:28,945
You know, down here, this is the downtown. It's really they have high population density and stuff.

713
01:38:28,946 --> 01:38:32,336
So we can kind of assume that this is kind of it happens everywhere.

714
01:38:32,336 --> 01:38:35,516
But over here, this is an outlier. And so there's there's something going on.

715
01:38:37,946 --> 01:38:44,036
Yeah. So and then we get into the results. So we're able to kind of see it on the map and stuff of where statistically it's

716
01:38:44,036 --> 01:38:49,436
happening and now kind of a deeper understanding of what the variables are.

717
01:38:49,436 --> 01:38:53,816
That's the census tract information. How is that causing the higher rates of collision rates?

718
01:38:55,796 --> 01:39:04,646
So going back, so because in rate per neighborhood were used as a dependent variable in the neighborhood variables,

719
01:39:04,646 --> 01:39:09,356
the population density, poverty rate and community rate were all used as independent variables.

720
01:39:10,016 --> 01:39:15,296
And then they were able to do it.

721
01:39:17,096 --> 01:39:23,036
They did a special regression model and they used both the ordinary least squares and spatial lag models.

722
01:39:23,546 --> 01:39:26,816
I don't have a good enough understanding to tell you what those are,

723
01:39:26,816 --> 01:39:30,716
but I do know that they use them in this article and these are the results they got.

724
01:39:32,636 --> 01:39:39,955
So with their spatial regressions, we they were only determined that the poverty was the only significant independent

725
01:39:39,956 --> 01:39:44,126
variable of causing or having a relationship with the collision rate.

726
01:39:46,316 --> 01:39:54,506
So then I guess, does anyone have an idea of why only poverty was significant for these causing collision rates?

727
01:40:00,346 --> 01:40:05,296
There's an article looking at, like, collisions between, like, vehicles, and people were, like, riding a bicycle.

728
01:40:05,326 --> 01:40:11,086
Mm hmm. And so maybe, like, the poverty of, like, higher poverty, like people can't afford cars, so they're more likely to be riding a bike.

729
01:40:11,116 --> 01:40:14,896
Yeah. So there's, what, like, less likely to have cars when they're getting run over?

730
01:40:15,556 --> 01:40:19,246
Yeah. No, exactly. I thought that. And then I think population density.

731
01:40:19,696 --> 01:40:24,976
I don't know if it's right to think that maybe it's just higher, you know, higher population density.

732
01:40:24,976 --> 01:40:29,956
So you'll have more of your stuff just within walking distance and maybe you're just gonna be walking, not really driving as much.

733
01:40:31,006 --> 01:40:36,825
But yeah. Then, um, going into a strength of this article,

734
01:40:36,826 --> 01:40:43,275
they did provide a very detailed background for the reader to go before they going into the key details of how they produce the examples.

735
01:40:43,276 --> 01:40:47,626
So they were able to lay down the foundational information for the reader to

736
01:40:47,626 --> 01:40:52,456
understand kind of how they went about their examples and how they did it.

737
01:40:53,886 --> 01:40:56,926
And then they again provide information about where they collected data,

738
01:40:56,926 --> 01:41:01,516
how they created their maps, and more of like how they're able to come to their conclusions.

739
01:41:01,876 --> 01:41:07,936
So they're able to kind of step through their thought process and methodology of why this is an issue.

740
01:41:08,896 --> 01:41:13,486
And then I thought this was really helpful for myself. They gave me real world examples of different research,

741
01:41:13,786 --> 01:41:19,236
of different researchers using speech analysis and what the results were able to come to with these features analysis.

742
01:41:19,236 --> 01:41:25,176
So within all the different speech analysis they went over, they usually had a little tidbit,

743
01:41:25,176 --> 01:41:29,266
but like, this is where it's been used before, this is what it was also that was only helpful,

744
01:41:29,266 --> 01:41:39,166
just kind to see it in real world, not just seeing hard data all the time of seeing what it can be to um, then going through our limitations.

745
01:41:39,526 --> 01:41:43,426
This was something that they brought up that yes. Is becoming a more popular tool in public health.

746
01:41:43,426 --> 01:41:48,975
You still need the resources and the knowledge to use it. So it's just a limitation of the people that can use it.

747
01:41:48,976 --> 01:41:53,146
Even though it's a great tool. You need to have the expertize or at least partnerships with people that have that.

748
01:41:54,026 --> 01:41:56,566
Um, then they gave examples of different spatial analyzes.

749
01:41:56,566 --> 01:42:01,576
They did not give information about how and what makes each one different and the pros and cons of each one.

750
01:42:01,576 --> 01:42:04,365
So I kind of just get a general overview of each one,

751
01:42:04,366 --> 01:42:10,246
but I don't really have an understanding of why they use them or kind of what the pros and cons for using these,

752
01:42:10,246 --> 01:42:14,376
say, Lisa, for example, why not use a different one? So there's kind of pros and cons of those.

753
01:42:15,446 --> 01:42:23,116
Um, and the third one, they did not provide detailed explanation about why they chose a different I got ahead of myself the different specializes.

754
01:42:23,116 --> 01:42:26,666
In example, they still had very technical, um,

755
01:42:26,756 --> 01:42:33,886
technical information in our article and required a basic understanding of statistics and you have to fully grasp with the fine details.

756
01:42:34,526 --> 01:42:40,096
So they're able to kind of see and they do a good job of laying it out, but having a good understanding of what they're talking about,

757
01:42:40,156 --> 01:42:48,856
um, itself kind of above my level at least the key takeaways this was, this first one is just kind of from them.

758
01:42:48,856 --> 01:42:51,885
This was something that they kind of wanted to push forward.

759
01:42:51,886 --> 01:42:57,646
That speech analysis methods, some health promotion. Health education can help provide a framework for identifying where the greatest needs are

760
01:42:57,646 --> 01:43:02,775
in a community where resources should be allocated and targeted health interventions,

761
01:43:02,776 --> 01:43:03,806
prevention programs.

762
01:43:03,806 --> 01:43:13,876
So I thought she was just in general, this is is a good, great tool that we can use to help allocate funds and, um, advocate for resources and stuff.

763
01:43:14,866 --> 01:43:17,896
And then the second one, although spatial analysis requires a,

764
01:43:18,166 --> 01:43:25,756
a learning curve as a tool to be used for understanding the observed data by exploring regional, social and cultural differences.

765
01:43:26,146 --> 01:43:29,986
So we're able to kind of see the under the story and the data through the maps and stuff

766
01:43:29,986 --> 01:43:34,366
to see how the regional information can have an impact on the population's health.

767
01:43:35,356 --> 01:43:40,095
Uh, last one. Overall, this is a great article for public health professionals trying to understand local and

768
01:43:40,096 --> 01:43:44,446
regional differences with spatial analysis and how it can be used to advocate for change.

769
01:43:45,256 --> 01:43:55,066
Um, yeah. Another question what ways could you use spatial analysis in your own final assignment or maybe in your own personal interests?

770
01:44:03,606 --> 01:44:09,936
I think for my own personal interests, I've always been interested in environmental justice and kind of everything that goes into that.

771
01:44:10,746 --> 01:44:18,485
So I would want to use spatial analysis to kind of determine different regions that have a greater cumulative impact compared to other regions,

772
01:44:18,486 --> 01:44:25,295
say Detroit, for example. We know Southwest Detroit has a great much greater amount of cognitive effects from other areas.

773
01:44:25,296 --> 01:44:30,126
So kind of just understanding the spatial analysis and differences for that.

774
01:44:31,176 --> 01:44:36,746
And then. Yeah, any questions? Okay.

775
01:44:41,636 --> 01:44:44,346
Thanks for your call.

776
01:44:44,866 --> 01:44:54,576
Yeah, I think the second paper I felt was applying some of the stuff that the chapter was trying to describe in a more concrete way.

777
01:44:56,076 --> 01:45:00,786
I was hoping we would get the cluster analysis by this time in our class, but we were a little behind.

778
01:45:01,266 --> 01:45:04,686
But now you have to pose your questions for your final project.

779
01:45:04,686 --> 01:45:12,846
And I would really take the information presented today and in those readings as you formulate those questions,

780
01:45:13,236 --> 01:45:17,076
because you will learn how to do cluster analysis,

781
01:45:17,946 --> 01:45:28,746
we will learn how to do hotspot ID, cold spot analysis and the outlier analysis that was described in this paper on motor vehicle collisions.

782
01:45:29,196 --> 01:45:33,486
So when you pose your questions, think about posing descriptive questions, right?

783
01:45:33,756 --> 01:45:37,686
What is a variation of X over some geographic region?

784
01:45:39,066 --> 01:45:46,536
Then you can also pose questions around either clustering of that specific event over the geographic region.

785
01:45:47,616 --> 01:45:53,376
Third, you can also pose questions on the correlation between the two, the two variables.

786
01:45:53,946 --> 01:46:01,686
In this case, they looked at poverty density and so forth in relation to motor vehicle collisions.

787
01:46:02,226 --> 01:46:08,886
We won't be able to we will learn how to do the regression analysis necessary to look at the relationships.

788
01:46:09,216 --> 01:46:15,366
But you can use bivariate maps or overlay maps to look at some visual correlations.

789
01:46:15,666 --> 01:46:23,376
All right. So as you pose those questions, think about not just describing the variation in something, but clustering of things.

790
01:46:23,496 --> 01:46:29,016
Okay. And we'll learn how to do that probably by in the next two weeks.

791
01:46:31,056 --> 01:46:39,096
I know that we have about 20 minutes left, and I want to give you time to work on your second assignment here.

792
01:46:39,576 --> 01:46:44,376
So how about we do that for the remainder of the class and leave geocoding until next time?

793
01:46:44,766 --> 01:46:48,125
Because if we start it now, we'll have to stop in the middle. All right.

794
01:46:48,126 --> 01:46:54,906
So let's. How about you break up into your final project teams and look at what you have in terms of the data.

795
01:46:55,806 --> 01:47:00,336
Finish your first assignment if you have intended already and start working on

796
01:47:00,336 --> 01:47:03,816
assignment number two and I'll come around and help you guys out if needed.
