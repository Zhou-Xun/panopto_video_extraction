1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:49,700
We're going to give people two more minutes to get here. It is so nice outside, just beautiful.

2
00:00:49,700 --> 00:01:20,840
It's supposed to be up over 60 on Wednesday and Thursday.

3
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:29,690
OK, before we get started, if there's anyone that hasn't gotten the copy back their first test in this class, I've been carrying them with me.

4
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:40,140
Please see me after class. OK. But the second test I just handed them today, and, you know,

5
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,450
she's working on them and then I go over and I and I do the ones that you have to write up the answer.

6
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,960
And then I look, I I think I told you all this last time. I looked through all the questions and see how many people missed each question.

7
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,850
And if a majority of the class missed one question, I take it out.

8
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,380
And that yeah, and and probably next week, I would imagine.

9
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:09,500
Look, we're going to get started and I have to tell you, mycology is my favorite subject.

10
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,810
I did all my graduate work masters and doctoral with Cryptococcus neoformans.

11
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,310
And so anybody ever wants to hear about it for maybe three or four hours?

12
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,260
Just let me know. OK, general properties of fungi.

13
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:30,710
So terminology first in Greek midcoast equals fungus.

14
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:39,470
So, so many words come from the Greek. So my process of reform of fungus, my courses are diseases caused by fungi.

15
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:45,570
Mycology is the study of fungi. And next slide.

16
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:53,730
So fungi are everywhere around us, they're in the air, they're in the soil, they're in the carpet, in this room, they're everywhere around us.

17
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,480
They help in decaying organic debris.

18
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:04,230
It's not just back to the front. I do. And also there are over 400000 types of fungi.

19
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:10,590
And with all of the molecular testing that has gone on, the names have gotten quite confusing.

20
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,080
Many of us are refusing to go to the new newly designated names for fungi because we can't remember them.

21
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:26,280
So instead of prokaryotic organisms, these are eukaryotic, OK, they're more than one cell and they have a highly developed cellular structure.

22
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,170
They may be facultad of animals. They may be strict Arabs.

23
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:40,000
Or they may be a combination, and they acquire their nutrition by absorption.

24
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,410
So when they're eating off of the human, they're getting it through my absorption. And they are don't they are non photosynthetic.

25
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:52,610
Next slide. So what are the major developments in psychology?

26
00:03:52,610 --> 00:04:00,920
Well, because of new therapies for cancer and other diseases, we have a lot of immunocompromised patients.

27
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,960
And along with those increased numbers of immunocompromised patients,

28
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:17,150
we have increased numbers of fungal infections because fungi like to infect people whose immune system is not working well.

29
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:23,030
We have a whole variety of newly developed antifungal drugs, which helps with that situation.

30
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:31,190
We can do antifungal susceptibility testing now, but unless your laboratory is doing a lot of them, it's recommended that you send them to it.

31
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:38,780
I to reference lab. And there is growing resistance, as you might expect to the antifungal drugs.

32
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:45,530
Next slide. So a little bit about fungal biology. As I said before, these are eukaryotic, OK, not so curious.

33
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,730
Are you fear that they are not moral? They are Arabic.

34
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:55,660
They may be sap or phytic or parasitic. So you may have yeast growing in you that aren't doing you any harm.

35
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:04,730
But most people generally do have that or that if the situation changes and something changes within that person, they may become parasitic.

36
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:10,220
The cell phone, a cell wall in fungi, contains both glucan and hiten.

37
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:18,410
OK. That's what gives it that, particularly for the mold that rigid formation form and the cell membrane also contains their nostril,

38
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:25,850
which is handy because we have after terrorism b that attacks the all next slide.

39
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:33,860
So pathogenesis, some of the fungi produce toxins, but they're not really relevant to human infections.

40
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,990
We know that they can be there, but they don't really act very much in disease production.

41
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:44,750
Fungi produce disease from the bulk of organisms that might be growing in a site.

42
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,170
OK, so they're taking over the metabolism.

43
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:55,610
They're taking over the metab, excuse me, the metabolites that are produced and not only from the bulk of organisms,

44
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:03,710
but from the immune response to them or their byproducts. Next slide.

45
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:10,430
So overview of fungal infections, they can be superficial, setting the skin or the mucosa.

46
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,150
They can be subcutaneous or they can be systemic.

47
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:22,400
And these are the true pathogens. They infect healthy hosts. Although the disease will be worse if the patient is immunocompromised,

48
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:30,620
but a healthy person with no immunity problems can develop very serious disease from these true pathogens.

49
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:40,170
And then we have the opportunists, and these cause disease almost exclusively in people who are immunocompromised.

50
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:48,450
Next slide. So I hate to get into morphology produce with all new names, but I don't use a lot of the new names.

51
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:56,980
We have three forms of fungi. We have yeast which are like large cacti and reproduce by budding.

52
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,560
OK, we have molds. You all know what a mold is.

53
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:10,830
And we had the dimorphism list of plasma caps, a lot of blast of mice's dermatitis and so on that when they're in a human or an animal,

54
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:16,740
they have a yeast form when they're out in nature. They grow as a mold.

55
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,970
And those are the dimorphic fungi. Next slide.

56
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:33,970
So here we have my very best schematics of a yeast cell unicellular, and they reproduce by budding and you can see a little bud there.

57
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,820
They're not always real. They may be oval.

58
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:47,410
And then we have molds and these can be infectious either by the release of spores or if the mycelium breaks off and gets in there,

59
00:07:47,410 --> 00:08:00,670
that can infect a person also with some types of fungi. And then in the dye morphs, they have both the yeast form, as I said, and the mold form.

60
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:06,730
So let's first talk about yeast. They are, as I said, unicellular,

61
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:15,970
they are microscopically you can see round two oval cells that they but they may be anywhere from three to 15 microns in diameter.

62
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:21,490
They said once again, they reproduce by body. The butt is called a blast, the spore.

63
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:28,090
But most people don't use those those newer terminologies, but a blood is a blast sport.

64
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:35,230
They may produce pseudo hyphae. So how do you determine whether it's a pseudo hyphae or a true high?

65
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:43,600
So you look at where the the wall is between the two cells and if it in dense?

66
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:51,670
It's pseudo high fee, and if there's no indentation where that scepter is, this it's true hyphy.

67
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:59,840
And so if you look at used on a plate or on a deceptive scope, they have very tasty looking khabazela,

68
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:10,630
kind of like Staphylococcus, a bit more pasty and they resemble bacteria and they can grow on just about blood chocolate.

69
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:18,310
Of course, aborode, they don't do well on gram negative media like Markakis, but they grow pretty well on everything else.

70
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:22,120
Next slide. So this is true hyphae right here.

71
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:28,390
There's no indication, but you can see the septum. And here we have pseudo hyphy.

72
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,410
You see how it indents there, where the new cell is formed.

73
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,840
And if you follow this up, you can see that there's a yeast form on the end of it.

74
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,330
So that's a different thing, true high fee and pseudo hyphae, then you won't always see this warm up here.

75
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:48,480
It just happens to be in this photograph. Next slide.

76
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,100
So let's start with candidiasis. Very, very common.

77
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,710
The most common fungal infection worldwide worldwide, OK?

78
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:06,900
The organism that generally causes candidiasis is Candida albicans, but as you know, there's a lot of other species of Canada.

79
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:13,440
And if a patient is immunocompromised or is on chemo or some of something else is going on, it may not be Candida albicans.

80
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,020
It's infecting the patient. It may be another one of the other species in Canada.

81
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:25,350
And it's where is it from? Is from normal human flora. We all we all have came the species in our bodies.

82
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:37,860
What's the pathogenesis here? Well, in a colonized area such as a yeast infection, in a wound on your arm, it's just overgrowth from what's there.

83
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,380
And particularly the patients on antibiotics.

84
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:46,110
You may have knocked out the normal flora that kept that yeast in in a controlled amount and that would like,

85
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:51,540
Oh good, I could eat all this and I can grow and grow and grow. My take on what you see.

86
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:57,530
And then in non colonized areas, they can actually invade. Next slide.

87
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:07,460
So we have a comparison of how real it compares to talking about pathogenesis and what do we see in the clinical settings.

88
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:16,910
So pathogenesis you can get disease by a breach in cellular structure can affect the skin or any mucosal surface.

89
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:23,720
If there's a breach, it will compete with normal bacterial flora that is there.

90
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:32,420
And as I said, if patients on antibiotics for bacteria, the yeast can say, Oh good, I'm going crazy here now, and they're also affected.

91
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:37,550
Pathogenesis is affected by neutrophil function and cell mediated immunity.

92
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:45,950
So if the patient is a cancer patient and they're on drugs for cancer, the neutrophil function function may be altered.

93
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:53,000
There's so many that immunity may be altered, and that would lead them to having a greater chance of having Candida infection.

94
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,400
In what settings do we see this? We see whenever there is a lot of moisture or overuse of antibiotics,

95
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,320
we see can see yeast infections and pregnant women have a tendency to get yeast infections.

96
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,820
Also, you think about what a pregnant woman her body is going through all these changes, there may be more moisture, particularly around the vagina.

97
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:23,090
There's a greater chance that they can have a yeast infection. Patients with HIV, oftentimes Candida infections, patients with intravenous catheters,

98
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:28,280
particularly if they're not handled correctly, not changed regularly, not changed as frequently.

99
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:34,430
They can get a yeast infection. And that's not just a change in the handling of the catheter, but what's in the catheter.

100
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:40,250
And if they're getting something that's altering cellular immunity, it's going to set them up for a fungal infection.

101
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:47,720
And then, as I said, chemotherapy or nail ablation can also serve patient up for a yeast infection because we really

102
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:57,270
rely on our cellular immunity to decrease the amount of fungal infections in the human body.

103
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:03,990
Next slide. So how do we diagnoses well, we have to get a good specimen.

104
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:08,310
And you can look, you know, we do ramsdale in the microwave to a gram stain on everything in the ground.

105
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:16,560
They may show it, but there may be so much other material there that you can't really get a good picture of what's going on.

106
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:23,910
So sometimes you have to look at what's going on the cultures before I, the patient's got a yeast infection,

107
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:32,130
and it's really sometimes it's very difficult to differentiate between what is the patient infection infected or is this just colonization?

108
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:41,360
But if the colonization gets bigger and bigger and bigger and there are other signs, medical signs, good side that there's an infection going on.

109
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,560
Well, treatment, what about treatment? Well, we all know about antifungal drugs.

110
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:52,070
But if there is a breach and the defenses? That needs to be taken care of.

111
00:13:52,070 --> 00:14:01,160
OK. And that breach in defense is maybe a skin wound that's not being adequately taken care of a mucosal wound.

112
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:07,740
It may be too many antibiotics that are knocking out normal flora. Next slide.

113
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,140
So here's Candida albicans.

114
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:19,650
It grows as this pasty white colony on FDA has several extrasolar, which is the most common auger that we use to grow fragile.

115
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:25,830
And it's growing at 30 degrees centigrade and it will grow on blood longer.

116
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:31,380
It will grow on top of the organ. But when we set up a fungal culture, we always include several tiger.

117
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:38,160
And here it is in a cage of oral scrapings. So somebody had lesions in their mouth and they did a scraping of it.

118
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,640
Scraping is not deep. It's just surfaced very lightly.

119
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:49,110
And then we always add potassium hydroxide to break down the skin cells so we can see what's going on.

120
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:55,150
And you can see these long highfill forms. And there's a lot of this budding yeast right there.

121
00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:01,410
There's yeast coming off. The high feed is budding yeast everywhere, but you need to right here, more down here.

122
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:13,650
And this just looks like Candida. Now from that, we can't say it's albicans, but albicans is certainly the most common species of Candida.

123
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:18,480
And I have to give people credit, if you want to know about, find out and you want to know if something can be done.

124
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,490
Go to Dr. Fungus. It's a great website and down here.

125
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:30,060
Mike McGinnis was the director of Mycology, where I did my fellowship at University North Carolina in Chapel Hill,

126
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:36,230
and Wylie Schell was the supervisor of that lab. OK.

127
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:45,710
My favorite fungus, Cryptococcus, produces a very bad disease, Cryptococcus, cryptococcal, generally meningitis.

128
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:54,740
So yeast with a very thick polysaccharide capsule. And because of that very thick, slimy polysaccharide capsule,

129
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:02,330
neutrophils and other white blood cells have trouble getting around that to actually kill the cell that they can't.

130
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:11,390
They can't. So it's associated with pigeon droppings, as with if you've ever taken a fungal force of its associated pigeon droppings out in nature.

131
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:16,820
And so how do people get if they inhale the yeast it gets when the dust is up in the air and it's inhaled,

132
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,120
and if they're immunocompromised, they may come down with this.

133
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,720
This is a terrible disease, but it can be cured.

134
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:31,640
Generally, when they get it, they get it from the UN encapsulated form because that is much easier to get all the way down into the alveoli.

135
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:37,730
Because with that big, juicy capsule around the yeast cell, it can't get all the way down to where it needs to be.

136
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:44,910
True story. So I said I did all my master's in potato research with Cryptococcus neoformans.

137
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:54,920
We knew my major professor was was very interested in finding an encapsulated yeast cells of of Cryptococcus neoformans,

138
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:00,320
and they're very hard to find. So we heard about people would tell them where there was an outbreak of Cryptococcus new forms,

139
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:08,090
and he sent us the grad students, of course, how to take some soil samples and we found an encapsulated C. neoformans.

140
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:14,210
And when we inoculated them into mice, we were able to get an immune response.

141
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,800
When we inoculated encapsulated ones, we got no immune response.

142
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:25,520
So there was a lot of great students, including me, who got doctorates off this OK.

143
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,010
Next slide. What about Cryptococcus pathophysiology and clinical?

144
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:36,800
There may just be transient colonization. People don't know that they've been infected.

145
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:45,470
Their immune system fights it off. They're fine. Or there can be an acute or chronic lung disease or worse than that invasion of the central

146
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:52,230
nervous system because generally the form of cryptococcal disease that we see as meningitis.

147
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:58,350
Clinically, it might be meningoencephalitis, it can be acute or chronic.

148
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:03,060
There will be fevers, headache, stiff neck loss of vision,

149
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:08,850
and this is also complicated by hydrocephalus because there's not enough room for those

150
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:14,790
Cryptococcus side to grow in the in and around the meninges and around the brain.

151
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:26,130
And it's, well, there's swelling. So you get hydrocephalus also, and we use a he very easily a cryptococcal antigen tests can be done on CSF.

152
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:33,760
It can be done on serum. We've done it on urine, but it's not as good of a test on urine.

153
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:42,100
And of course, cryptococcal, you've got an Iceland infecting a body that is highly encapsulated,

154
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:47,980
it's not going to be very easy to pick up the antibodies to that antigen. Next slide.

155
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:57,160
OK. Mold. And this is the fungal spelling of mold and mildew, all the everybody else felt it moldy, but I found the spell.

156
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,180
These are multicellular organisms, OK?

157
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,960
They are. They can be microscopic or macroscopic. So many of the same with microscope.

158
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:12,490
You could just look at growing on a plate. They can have high two to 10 microns in diameter and spores.

159
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:23,770
And once again, the spores are called chlamydia. OK, if they're macroscopic, they can grow on an outer plate well on someone's skin.

160
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:27,820
They might have a cottony wooly or velvety or granular.

161
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:35,260
You ever see it growing on Brad or anybody how you generate penicillin that's going on bread texture?

162
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,720
They may be pigmented. The pigmentation is due to the spores. That's where the color comes from, is the spores.

163
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:49,750
And if it's growing on a plate, you see if it's a pigmented fungus by turning the plate over will use generally using Savasana,

164
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:56,310
then you can see the color on the bottom side of the plate.

165
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:08,870
So a few more definitions of more a high fall in the single or high fee are plural filamentous structures of a fungus.

166
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,810
And if you have many of them together, that's the mycelium.

167
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:18,560
If you have fungus mold growing on a plate, you're seeing the mycelium in a mat growing there.

168
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:26,090
The mycelium may be vegetative below the surface of the agar, or it might be areall above the surface of the water.

169
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:34,130
Anything that's Ariel can release spores into the air, which just this must change in air.

170
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:39,740
OK, so it's very easy for fungi to release those spores just like you breathe.

171
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:45,960
I'm going to get you. So here's an example of Aspergillus hyphy.

172
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:52,470
This is a sputum specimen, and they they put a drop of sputum on the slide with a drop of potassium hydroxide.

173
00:20:52,470 --> 00:21:01,590
The potassium hydroxide breaks down the human cells so you can actually see the fungus and you can see that it is multicellular.

174
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:10,170
You can see some spores. You can see that there are very few white cells have all been broken down by the potassium hydroxide.

175
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,660
Now we cannot identify it from this.

176
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:22,170
We can say it's separate, but we have to grow it and we have to visualize it microscopically without all the other tissue components.

177
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,060
So on the right hand side,

178
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:33,160
we have a El-P KBE like Tofino cotton blue lack of yellow cotton blue is the most common stain used in mycology for wet mouse.

179
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,890
If you put a specimen, this idea a drop of Latino can't really put a cover slip on it.

180
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:41,570
You look at it. And what we're seeing here is a rise of mucus like a combination of rise.

181
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:48,120
A person Bucor disseminates very easily, as do rise new four and so on.

182
00:21:48,120 --> 00:22:01,590
It is a separate hyphae, etc. If you can see them here and here, there's some of them, but it is very easy to dispense into the environment.

183
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:10,790
Once this breaks, the spores go everywhere. So here's a picture of Aspergillus.

184
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:21,350
It is a mold. And you can see from where it was inoculated out to almost the edge of the when the colony, it's green.

185
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:26,360
And then beyond that, it's white and the green is from the spores.

186
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:33,140
And out here, where it's white, they're younger cells and they have not made spores.

187
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:43,070
So that area is not green yet. If you were to have this growing on a petri dish and you open up that plate, you've just inoculated the room.

188
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:50,680
That's why we don't open them on the open bench. We only open them in a laminar falsehood.

189
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:57,440
Next slide. So let's talk about classification, which is generally not my favorite subject,

190
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:06,140
but we have to talk about it in psychology classification of how it is based on whether or not the high school forms have septa the class walls.

191
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:13,730
Are they separate or non separate? So here on the left, we see separate hyphae with all the cross walls.

192
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:18,620
And on the right we see no cross walls, so they are aseptic subject.

193
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:26,180
OK, without the scepter you see on the left and on the left hand, the high here all the same shape.

194
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,100
There's no bulges or anything.

195
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:40,510
And on the right, you see bulges coming in different places because you don't have those septa to maintain the rigid form of the cells.

196
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:50,080
Next slide. So we have terms for Hyphae, just because somebody like to make them up, I guess up on the upper right hand side,

197
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,650
we have racket shape on the next nodule, you can see they're tied up like a knot.

198
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:02,620
Patnaik, I don't really know how to describe pectin, except it has multiple forms.

199
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:11,110
Then we have spiral hyphae on the left and down on the bottom. We have resources and this is what you might see and I suppose also.

200
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:22,120
So we have the stolen that goes along the surface of the auger, and there are high flow elements coming up with the spores will be released from then.

201
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:31,900
We have rice voids down below that grow into the auger and keep it from where it's growing.

202
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:41,860
Yes. Let me go back. Bracket creep feels like the prize.

203
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:52,510
Oh, this is a stolen vehicle stolen in stolen, they run along the surface of the auger, just underneath the surface of the auger.

204
00:24:52,510 --> 00:25:02,490
OK, OK. Sure. OK, now we get to the dimorphic, and this is where it becomes much, much more serious.

205
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:08,640
Dimorphic fungi are capable is growing as a mold or yeast flood of nature.

206
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:17,340
It grows mold. But they grow as a yeast when they're in highly favorable conditions.

207
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,830
So out in nature, they're relying on.

208
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:26,650
Rotting wood or grass or dirt or in the soil or someplace like that,

209
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:36,370
you get the mold with all the spores when comes along blows the spores, person inhales them, they inhale down into the lungs.

210
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,580
These are very favorable conditions in the lungs.

211
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:48,640
So now you have a yeast form, so that is how you define a dimorphic now it can be a dimorphic based on temperature,

212
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,500
the amount of carbon dioxide or nutrients. OK.

213
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:59,190
So with a lot of the systemic fund, it's both temperature and nutrients,

214
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:07,530
and then thermal dimorphism is a are the really serious Cronjé like all these emitters.

215
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:14,490
It's just a very the most pathogenic fungi that temperature and other conditions.

216
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:22,650
But it has to be differences in temperature makes them change their shape.

217
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:32,880
So then we go to sub cellular structure for angina, so capsule Cryptococcus neoformans has a big white capsule.

218
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,160
What that capsule does is it prevents the cell from being engulfed by white blood cells.

219
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,640
They can't get around it.

220
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:51,170
When we found an encapsulated senior Forman's in soil and injected it into mice mice to get rid of it because they could get around it,

221
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,730
so also in the end, fungi, we have cell walls,

222
00:26:53,730 --> 00:27:02,990
cell membranes and then the nuclear plant cytoplasm, which contains the very structures seen here that you see in other cells the nucleus,

223
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:08,320
a nuclear membrane, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria and vacuoles.

224
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:20,930
You see those in other forms of life also. So more about the capsule, so it is a polysaccharide capsule.

225
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:26,510
And we know that polysaccharides do not induce good antibodies.

226
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:31,880
It's also Anti-Flag acidic because you think you've got a cell here with this big phony capsule around it,

227
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,720
white blood cell comes up and it's trying to engulf it, but it just slides off.

228
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:42,310
It can't engulfing. So it is and also the capsules also virulence factor.

229
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:54,170
And so these capsules exist only in some species of fungi, and Cryptococcus neoformans is the main one.

230
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:59,180
So let we have a cell wall. We know that generally cell walls are produced.

231
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,770
Yeah, induce the body to form good antibodies.

232
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:08,840
It's good. They're very energetic. So all may be multi-layered in many fungi.

233
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,780
It is contains polysaccharides.

234
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:20,360
HEXO's and HEXO's new polymers, and that's about 90 percent of the structure is polysaccharides may have proteins in glycoproteins,

235
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:27,990
but that's a very small percentage. And we also know that polysaccharides do not induce good antibodies.

236
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:36,240
So what are these these and so well, does it provide state provide rigidity, strength and protection from osmotic shock?

237
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:43,590
So it goes from a human into water, but that capsule is protecting it so well, it's always protecting it,

238
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:47,340
and hopefully it'll get out just to infect somebody else or some other animal. Not really.

239
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:54,870
That's not good, but it does protect. OK, then we have the cell wall is so interesting and.

240
00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:07,230
It's very complex. It has polymers and monomers, the polymers or titan, hydrazine, cellulose, alpha and beta glucan and mannan.

241
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:13,170
And then the monomers are still glucosamine decompose mainly glucose to glucose to glucose,

242
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:23,880
different forms of the three different forms of the glucose and D.N.A. and the amount of each of these varies from one fungal species to another.

243
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:36,740
What they do is they help build a very strong cell wall so that it exists in nature when it's outside of an animal's body.

244
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:42,770
And this is a cow floor white stain of Aspergillus, and you say, well, this is fairly difficult to see it, I say yes,

245
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:49,680
it is unless we're working on a document scope and then it's very easy to see because sometimes when you do have a specimen,

246
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,660
you want to do a quick trip to see if there's fungal in there, you don't see them.

247
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:59,780
But this is much more sensitive and you can see not only the hyphy and the cross walls.

248
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:03,860
You can see cross hairs, but you can also see butting heads here.

249
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:11,180
It's an Aspergillus. Next slide.

250
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:16,370
So from so we go to the cellular membrane and it is by layered.

251
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,810
So it's got a couple of layers in it.

252
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:27,350
It has phospholipids and sterols and the main sterile and most of our days are strong, but some of them may have zone maestro also.

253
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:33,090
What are these these? So what of the cellular membrane do that protects the cytoplasm?

254
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,060
Hey, we're not going to get through me.

255
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:48,380
It regulates the intake of the secretion of solids and facilitates the synthesis of the capsule in the cell wall, which helps the fungus to survive.

256
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:57,110
So what do we do in the well we will do? Honestly, what assessment comes into the lab or hundreds of specimens direct microscopic exam?

257
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:04,440
We will do a gram stain and then a variety of different types of worms and clearly for bacteria.

258
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,960
And some yeast will pick up a brand and used to pick up grams name,

259
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,240
but if it's a single cell mold, it won't pick up the gram since we have to do something else.

260
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,800
We'll do a potassium hydroxide, which will break down other tissue components.

261
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:24,190
You reduce the light in the microscope and you can see from the hyphae we can do a scalpel for Y,

262
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,570
which is the same thing, but we can do it on a fluorescence scope. They really pick it up very nicely.

263
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:35,980
And if it's a spinal fluid, the most serious type of specimen we will also do in India Inc because with any egg,

264
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:43,900
we will pick up this Cryptococcus neoformans is there. We will pick up a cell with a big capsule.

265
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:49,900
We will culture on several extra saga, which is the routine mycology medium,

266
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,440
as well as michael biotics, it has a variety of different antibiotics in it.

267
00:31:53,440 --> 00:32:00,100
So if you're culturing urine or sputum or anything that's not from a sterile site, you can get rid of the bacteria.

268
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:05,150
Yes. We use both.

269
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:10,160
Yeah. Sometimes they're in by place where you know, the, you know, all know what a buy plate is.

270
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:16,850
Give them a plate. It's got a plastic divider, so you have to separate half plates.

271
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:21,950
You can have several dozen on one side and macrobiotic on the other side.

272
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:28,350
OK. And then of course, there's theology, and now there's molecular analysis also.

273
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:36,480
Next slide. So how do we identify these Mr identified almost the same way bacteria are,

274
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:45,360
we can do biochemical identification that takes the longest time we can do metabolic and we can identify them on my friend maldi-tof.

275
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:54,300
I love it. And so three different ways to identify these, and they all work very well.

276
00:32:54,300 --> 00:33:02,580
OK, now with MALDI-TOF and all the molecular research that has gone in the last 15 or 20 years, names change rapidly.

277
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:11,580
So if you get out of it well, when you get out of here and you become infection prevention as you don't recognize a name up on a report,

278
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,880
make sure you call the laboratory and say, What did what was this? What did you?

279
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:21,960
This used to be called? And they will be able to tell you because the names are changing rapidly in the labs have to use the new names,

280
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,660
but they have to have a period whereby they report that organism by the old name and the new name.

281
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:35,220
OK, OK. So if it's a mold, we're going to identify it, phenotypically.

282
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,840
What is the colony look like? Is it green? Is it white? How well is it growing?

283
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,970
You know, does it grow on several that has antibiotics in it?

284
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:49,320
Or does it just bone fibers and so on? And microscopically, what does it look like?

285
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:57,480
And then we do a little mobility's pathway and we do it like a final cut blue because then we sit down and look to see what the morphology is.

286
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:04,840
Are the hyphae substrate or aseptic, one of the spores looks like and so on.

287
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:16,950
Looks like. So here is a fungal cell, OK, and it has spores and the spores are here inside the Sparano gene.

288
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:24,990
So this brand engine is the thing that holds the spores, the structure that holds the spores, and it is on top of the Carmilla.

289
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:29,550
And as you go down, you've got it. I've never been able to pronounce this able fizzes.

290
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,270
Then the septum and then and GM and substrate mycelium.

291
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:41,820
Now when you look at the substrate mycelium and the spore engine, you look to see whether there are any crosswalks.

292
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,250
If there are no cross walls, you just got much more serious.

293
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:51,880
OK, Aspergillus has crossed walls, rise the plus Nucor and so on do not have crossed walls.

294
00:34:51,880 --> 00:35:01,320
And if it's growing patient is probably immunocompromised and in very, very serious.

295
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:08,040
Next slide, so here we have Canaria, these are the sports, remember they formed by differentiation from the tip or the side of a hyphen.

296
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,390
So Aspergillus, these are a little bit small, but you can probably enlarge on your computer screens.

297
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:21,720
The Canadian are the spores, OK? And they come out of firewood, which come out of Metula, which come from the vesicle, and this is the floor.

298
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,700
So I went backwards. But that's what you're seeing here.

299
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:31,560
Here's Penicillium. It doesn't have the enlarged vesicle like Aspergillus does.

300
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:43,240
It has these bottle shaped things. And these are called phthalates, and they form on Metula down here, and they release the spores from penicillium.

301
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,630
Arthur Kennedy is just scepter that break up into pieces and are infectious.

302
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:56,970
And that's what city where these images does. And then McCracken India are seen primarily in tribal fighting, which is a dramatic fight.

303
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:04,130
Now we have microkernel idea and then the big macro Canadian.

304
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:12,350
Next slide. OK, antifungal agent, my friend Amphotericin B, which is not it's a great friend if you have a bad fungal infection,

305
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:18,440
but it's extremely difficult to take and has lots of side effects, lots and lots of side effects.

306
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:24,200
It is a large molecule. It is hydrofoil hard to fill up on one end and lipophilic on the other.

307
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:32,300
OK, so it attracts water and attracts fat. You can get it as a native compound without being mixed in anything or is a little bit complex.

308
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:38,480
Most times it's given us a lipid complex because it's easier to take the less side effects for the patient.

309
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,810
And whenever you give Amphotericin B, you are going to be more.

310
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:47,600
The physician will always be worried about the side effects of this drug mechanism of action that binds.

311
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:53,990
Remember, I mentioned the Orbost role in the cell membrane and binds to that Castrol and takes it out of action.

312
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:59,810
OK. Removes that lipid from Australia, not from the structure, but B from being useful.

313
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:04,670
It also destroys the osmotic integrity and leads to cell death.

314
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:09,380
So electricity is a very powerful drug, but it also has powerful side side effects.

315
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:15,680
So when it destroys the cells, it leaves ions, sugars and metabolites, which may also affect the patient.

316
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,970
And there are, as I said before, there are a lot of side effects with Amphotericin B,

317
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:28,350
but for a long time it was the only antifungal that was effective against Cryptococcus neoformans, only one.

318
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:37,740
That's good. So it is active against most species of Candida, Cryptococcus Aspergillus.

319
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:42,000
You see the list, there are Bucor blast of mice, these cracks, it all seems to play a pair of Crocs situation,

320
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,940
which fortunately we don't have in this country, but some yeast are resistant to terrorism.

321
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:53,970
So that would be Canada given by Canada, Lusitania, Canada, cruzi and Aspergillus terrorists.

322
00:37:53,970 --> 00:38:01,590
So Aspergillus is not a cancer, obviously, but these are isolates the species that we know are resistant to amphotericin B.

323
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:11,780
It is not absorbed orally so people can not take it in a pill if given, potentially through an I.V. and it does not penetrate the CSF, hardly at all.

324
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,890
So if a patient has very bad cryptococcal meningitis,

325
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:24,020
they will have trouble getting this into the central nervous system to get rid of that organism has a lot of adverse effects.

326
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:29,420
But the adverse effects can somewhat be combated with other therapies,

327
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:36,500
but it is never toxic so it can destroy kidneys because it also binds to to the sterols in the human cells.

328
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:43,810
However, if you give a liquid form of after some b, it reduces that toxicity.

329
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:51,940
Next slide. So here is the structure of amphotericin B, and as you can see, it is a massive molecule.

330
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:56,440
And there are problems with administering it. But if it works, it works.

331
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,590
Now we have other antifungals that work also.

332
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:08,340
But after somebody is kind of the backbone of, you know, it's it's up to somebody or nothing in some cases.

333
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:13,800
So the next one that came on the Martin was fired from cytosine or five is in that both names.

334
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:24,030
It's fluorinated pyrimidine and its mechanism of action is they're shown it disrupts pruning metabolism and inhibits both protein and DNA synthesis,

335
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:31,670
which is a good way to stop growth. It is has a narrow spectrum for Candida species,

336
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:40,710
Cryptococcus and the diminishes fungi that cause from a blast to my closest, which I haven't talked about yet.

337
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:47,560
So it has this narrow spectrum of activity, but if you do that patient, the one who is more susceptible, it won't get it.

338
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:55,530
It does not have to be given I.V. and there aren't oral formulations, penetrates well and it actually penetrates the CSF.

339
00:39:55,530 --> 00:40:08,190
So if a patient has cryptococcal meningitis, they're generally given after some B and C because it will get into the spinal fluid very well,

340
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:13,740
whereby amphotericin B won't put after somebody will get it when it's in the lungs and other sites.

341
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:18,840
So far, they've seen is not perfect. It does have some adverse effects can cause depression of the bone marrow.

342
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:24,600
Obviously, very serious. Also apparent toxicity, GI intolerance.

343
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,660
And you have to watch kidney function because it's clear through the kidneys.

344
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:38,760
OK, so as you may be appreciating, anti-fungal therapy is more difficult because we're not talking about primitive organisms.

345
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:46,780
We're talking about organisms that are getting closer to to ourselves to human type.

346
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:54,100
Next of this, OK, so this is the structure of facade is in, it's got a millennial one side and you can see the general structure.

347
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:58,000
It's a very simple structure.

348
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:08,230
OK, then we come to the Azar's, and these have been recognized as having antifungal activity relatively recently in the in the history of mycology,

349
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:13,360
but it's not that recent, actually. So these are fun to static so they can seize the growth,

350
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:20,650
but they don't actually kill them because partial-birth inhibition and so they have a variety of different type, different ones.

351
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:27,940
Fluconazole itraconazole comes on onboard all you may have heard about one or several of these elsewhere.

352
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:38,010
So how do they how do they kill? They inhibit cytochrome P450 and that it functions in the synthesis of their gastro?

353
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:48,250
Castrol is in this fungal cell wall. If you don't have gastro, you don't know so well, and so it terminates fungal cell wall synthesis.

354
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:51,880
OK, yeah. So then we have Lucozade. It's very common.

355
00:41:51,880 --> 00:42:02,400
It's very soluble in water can be administered orally or if it's active against it basically yeasts Canada and Cryptococcus, and it does penetrate.

356
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,380
While it does get in to the central nervous system, which is great and there are very few side effects.

357
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:17,050
However candidate Libratone can recruit, you are more resistant species of Candida may have resistance to some of the Azizah,

358
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:22,390
so that's why antifungal susceptibility testing is not mandatory for every organism.

359
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:27,050
But for some, it is the certain situations.

360
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:36,450
Next slide, so here's for a console and full console, and I would never actually ask you the structures, never, not a million years.

361
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:42,900
Next slide. Then we have the kind of candles and these are fun to sail, not static recital.

362
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:47,580
OK. And the one that's most used now is cast function.

363
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:52,170
It hasn't been on the market very long in the history of antifungal agents.

364
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:58,650
How does it work? It inhibits synthesis of beta one 3D glucan, and this is used to form cell walls.

365
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:05,100
And so if you don't have a lot of one three data, one 3D glue, can orphans harmed?

366
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,250
You don't get good cell wall formation.

367
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:16,710
So the other thing about the kind of candles is that it is useful and active against fungi that are resistant to some of the other antifungal agents.

368
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:25,440
We do have some topical antifungal, for example, for dramatic phytic infections or superficial infections that can be a cream

369
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,230
or lotion suppository of spray because people can get rectal infections also,

370
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:33,990
and those would be nice then mechanism.

371
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:42,520
Both are used very commonly for women who have yeast infections, vaginal yeast infections, but they can use these and other sites also.

372
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:47,350
Next slide. So what about susceptibility testing, I did mention it.

373
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:58,570
It's not done on every isolate, every isolate from a human, the way bacterial susceptibility testing is done, but the methods are standardized.

374
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:05,380
There are documents that tell you how to do susceptibility testing. There are some commercially available antifungal susceptibility testing plants.

375
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:11,890
I've listed a couple of them. The study used one by Thermo Fisher and the Fighter two is powered by Bio Marry You.

376
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:16,960
But we also, if you're the male like male, will set up micro dilution testing.

377
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,420
You have a wonderful mycology lab at Mayo, but they're also remember I told you about it.

378
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:30,550
It's a strip of paper still from a paper that has an antibiotic and it depending on where the growth of the organism is on.

379
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:35,170
When you put it on the plate and how far it goes up the strip, you can tell what the message is.

380
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:43,230
And so there are tests available for some susceptibility testing with some of ongoing.

381
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:48,990
And I will tell you, not every lab does antifungal susceptibility if you're not doing a lot of it.

382
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:54,390
Don't do it, send it out because it would take too much of your employee time, too much space.

383
00:44:54,390 --> 00:45:00,210
Not that it's not not good to have it on site, but if you can't afford to do it the right way, send it out.

384
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:08,330
You can overnight anything to me or lab or some of the big labs and get the testing done correctly.

385
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:16,640
Next slide. So my co-host finally find out about the drugs anymore, the fungal diseases, we classify them superficial,

386
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:22,700
subcutaneous, true, systemic, which would be endemic illness or opportunistic.

387
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:30,480
So superficial will be hair, skin, nails and the cornea. Basically, we're talking about dramatic flights, plus whatever gets in the cornea.

388
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,280
OK, subcutaneous. We have a special group of organisms.

389
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:44,630
We'll talk about those two systemic pandemic ones. We are not in an area where we have very much endemic systemic fungal diseases.

390
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:53,720
We do have his the plasma capsule out of here in Michigan, and we have a little bit of blast of ices down around the southern border of Michigan.

391
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:59,180
That's it for India, but we don't have any city authorities or any of the other big ones.

392
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:11,700
And we have opportunistic fungi and that'd be like penicillin or Aspergillus that gets into the wrong place and grows wild in.

393
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:18,540
So let's talk a little bit about superficial Michael, since we've got to matter of fact to us, is it clear at all my closeness?

394
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:22,800
So the Madoff ketosis is also known as tinea or ringworm.

395
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:29,100
It's an infection of the hair, skin and nails caused by a group of funds that like keratin, called the amount of fights.

396
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:34,140
I cannot pronounce that words I in settlements if three species are all you have to worry about.

397
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:40,380
The three year all you have to worry about here, like a sperm nut butter knife at them and try to fight.

398
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:48,300
That's it for demand of fights. And as you see, on the right hand side of the slide, like a swarm infects hair and skin up a time often,

399
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:58,590
in fact, skin and nail and try to fight and infects all three. I've tried to get a micro spawn to infect here, and I can't do it, so it can't be done.

400
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:06,270
If I can't know, it just can't be done. It's in all of the psychology textbooks, micro form, hair and skin and skin to nail.

401
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:11,300
Find all three. Sure.

402
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:17,930
So, but here you go. Yeah. Or pubic hair, either one.

403
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:25,220
And how did the dramatic fights work? They died just keratin by hitting enzymes keratinocytes so they can digest the

404
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:30,470
keratin they're resistant to cycle hex my dad since a lot of antifungal drugs,

405
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:40,850
and they're classified into three groups, depending on their usual habitat. Three groups in middle one make it to, I guess, here hair, skin and nails.

406
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:52,040
OK. So they're also divided down by where they come from, so micro gypsum is comes from the soil, OK?

407
00:47:52,040 --> 00:48:01,480
And that's to fill it. Answer fulfills me that comes from an arthropod like organism, OK,

408
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:11,180
and do feel it comes from dogs, cats, humans, horses, swine, whatever it is, comes from animals.

409
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:21,170
Next slide. So is there a scientific name, scientific and medical name for a fungal infection on your skin is dramatic psychosis.

410
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:29,770
And we can talk about both the pathogenesis and immunity. So together, fungal infection, you have to have contact with that fungus.

411
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:33,930
It can be on bed linen that have not been washed and somebody has skin infections,

412
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:41,770
slept in them, can be transmitted by clothing, by beds, by toilet seats, by, you name it.

413
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:45,580
There's a lot of ways that it can be transmitted. They like moisture.

414
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:53,470
They like crowded living conditions because it's much more easy to spread when people are forced together.

415
00:48:53,470 --> 00:49:03,820
If a patient has a cellular immunodeficiency, they may have a chronic infection with these one of these fungi,

416
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:10,890
which will be very difficult to treat and cure until the immunodeficiency is taken care of.

417
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:16,950
So patient, say, has ringworm on their foot to man fight infection.

418
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:27,810
They treat it, goes away. Then they walk barefoot on the carpet, where they used to walk barefoot when they still had it, and they can get reinfected.

419
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:31,290
So if they are infected, a larger iPhone is needed.

420
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:35,460
But the course of infection is generally slower for shorter.

421
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:43,470
Excuse me. So here's the clinical classifications of dramatic fights, demand if I chose this.

422
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:48,840
And so as I said before, infection is named according to the anatomical location.

423
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:54,780
OK, so if its head is infected, is it ringworm, they're also ringworm.

424
00:49:54,780 --> 00:50:02,370
It's called tinea capitals. Yeah, if its face ringworm again to the Barbie, I don't know why they do that for women,

425
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:08,220
but tiny Barbie skin ringworm again to the caucus on the skin.

426
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:13,770
If it's on the soles of the feet, we've got athlete's foot or tinea pedis.

427
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:18,720
If it's on the hands of the palms, it's tinea. Manam, it's in the nails.

428
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:30,930
It's tinny and we have onychomycosis. And then if it's in the groin area jacket or tinny occurs, I think those are the medical names,

429
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:38,280
the general names and then the party, a body that's infected.

430
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:43,140
So what are the clinical manifestations of a ringworm infection?

431
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,930
I demand a fight, we can win whatever we want to call.

432
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:56,730
If it's a skin infection, the lesions will generally be round circular, dry, scaly, itchy, maybe a slightly red for the erythema.

433
00:50:56,730 --> 00:51:04,320
If you scratch them, it'll be even more. If you scratch them enough, they will bleed if it's hair.

434
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:09,270
The typical lesion is in the carrion. There can be scarring.

435
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:13,770
There can be loss of hair alopecia loss. If you're OK.

436
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:17,490
If it's a nail, the nail may be thickened or discolored. It might be.

437
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:21,210
Friable means it breaks off a little pieces that can be discolored.

438
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:24,360
I've seen them kind of a yellow orange color.

439
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:31,980
There can be some angel debris accumulation that's underneath the nail where you generally see the not the front part,

440
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:45,630
but the pink part of your nail that can be debris underneath there. And so here is a picture of a skin infection with fungus,

441
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:51,660
and I should also tell you look at the website down below from my college in Adelaide in Australia.

442
00:51:51,660 --> 00:52:00,720
Fabulous website if you want to look anything up, absolutely fabulous.

443
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:05,690
So how hard to modify it's transmitted? Well, close human contact.

444
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:11,690
OK. And be sharing clothes, combs, brushes, towels, bed sheets, you name it.

445
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:16,580
That would be indirect transmission. That's bed sheets, but we live in a shared animal to animal.

446
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:26,130
So once that animal, the animal, we may be human to human or maybe down to human, to human, but it's animal to animal or animal to human.

447
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:31,150
Yes. Something like really, really small, like our big.

448
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:35,730
They just come from where I like the.

449
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:40,460
They're just the fungus. So they like they're called reforms, but they're not.

450
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:44,870
Well, what do you see it on the skin? It's a round circular creature.

451
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,660
OK. I didn't understand what you were asking.

452
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:58,570
Generally, it's it's it's reddish on the outside, which is a big, active growing area and more normal looking toward the center, but not always.

453
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:04,900
So how do we die diagnosed the demand for the convention? We look at it, what does it look like?

454
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:10,750
We can use the words lab, which is specialized UV light, not just for tanning.

455
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:19,000
It's at 365 nanometers and half the strains of microbes collected and cast strains will fluoresce.

456
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,220
So if you shine on a legion of fluorescein, it's a good chance to compare like this one?

457
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:33,460
Very cool. We can do a direct microscopic exam, and for this, we use Kawase anywhere from 10 to 25 percent,

458
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:41,050
depending on how thick the tissue is to break it down. And all we do is we take a skin scraping, take a scalpel, very gently go like that.

459
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:47,860
You get some of the scrapings on a slight drop of potassium hydroxide on it covers the bottom.

460
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:52,060
It's good to heat it up a little bit, but not boil it heated up.

461
00:53:52,060 --> 00:54:00,520
If you have something warm that you can just a little bit warmth will help put the potassium hydroxide penetrate into the cells.

462
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:07,020
And then you can see if there's a dramatic fight growing in the cells in the skin scraping.

463
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:13,680
So here's a skin scraping. And these are we have clusters of yeast cells and what mycelium?

464
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,030
Now you cannot call a round selling yeast unless you see it, buddy.

465
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:24,730
If you don't see anybody, it's not easy. OK? And these cells are larger than bacteria would be.

466
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:33,330
But that's your much smaller. These are 20 30, sometimes even 50 microns in size, much larger than the hand staph or anything like that.

467
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:41,020
So you can see a budding here. There are the places where it's budding and you can see that these are simply high speed.

468
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:47,470
So we see that say, hey, patients got going through their culture and also what we would do anyway.

469
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:54,220
We grow on several dextrose salvia, which is the standard medical logic, medium and microbiota.

470
00:54:54,220 --> 00:55:03,340
It's also known as micro cell, and that is suborder plus antibiotics generally cyclohexane and protocol to get rid of that bacterial growth.

471
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:09,580
OK, so when to use both types of media, sometimes by playing with one side, one medium on each side,

472
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:16,020
sometimes you have to use two separate plates, whatever it works both ways. Next slide.

473
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:24,150
So then we look at colony characteristics is that white is a colored gem like its color and has spores.

474
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:29,160
Is it growing above the surface of the water? It's a growing up area or just on the surface?

475
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:35,730
Or is it going down into the water? We look at the spores. If they're small, they're micro canaria.

476
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:42,630
If they're large, they are macro Canadian and we look at the shape.

477
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:50,130
If they're the cell shape, the macro Canadian for microbes form will be fusiform and we'll also have micro Canadian.

478
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:59,670
So it has both large and small Canadian. If it's often the macro Canadian club shaped ware club.

479
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:09,160
No micro Canadian. OK, if the team tried fighting, there may be just a few macro Kennedy, but they're not real common with tobacco fighting.

480
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:18,940
But the micro Canady are single and in club clusters. So here is Micro Forum.

481
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:26,170
You can see these large almost club shape, but not quite. Now with multiple cells in each one, Cresswell's.

482
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:32,400
OK, here we have peppered him. Often they're club shaped.

483
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:42,710
And here we have probably a track of Patrick fighting with macro Canadian and micro Canadian.

484
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:49,130
Now, the only one that you could speak yet is that often because there's only one species,

485
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:58,950
the form in the Francophone have multiple species and you'd have to do a little bit more work, more cultural work to actually species them.

486
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:06,030
OK. What about treatment for dramatic fights, it can be topical if it's a topical infection on the skin.

487
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:10,470
Multiple agents are drugs are available. Mechanical is very common.

488
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:16,860
Very few side effects. But there's also full time as a volunteer benefit if it is a more serious infection.

489
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:23,850
Yeast infection and it's infecting more of the body than just a single patch or a single place on the head.

490
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:27,630
The physician may want to give an oral agent and they are listed here.

491
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:32,680
Gives you a full forward has been around for a long, long time. The easels are much newer.

492
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,220
If they came in when I was in my master's program.

493
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:45,750
A million years ago, they'll be key to console and itraconazole to benefit even newer than the ease.

494
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:54,640
But they all work very, very well, and the Aizawl, I think, work better than Brazil for, but it's been around for a long, long time.

495
00:57:54,640 --> 00:58:07,440
Next slide. So exam type question to the AP, this is a fungal infection of which tissue, skin, subcutaneous muscle and bone.

496
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:15,300
Shouted out, whoever you can, boom, you all passed.

497
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:20,160
OK, now let's talk about something that's even more serious, my colleague keratitis.

498
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:27,690
It's an eye infection of a fungal infection that I think can be post-traumatic following sports following a car accident.

499
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:34,200
Any kind of thing like that can be post-surgical corneal infection very, very serious.

500
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:40,680
Generally, it's caused by sympathetic fungi. These are ones that don't normally cause much disease, but they can.

501
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:46,410
So Aspergillus generally can cause a lot of things, as can beneficiary. But we don't see too much alternative Candida.

502
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:56,040
Yes. And then who's the plasma caps lock is a major fungal pathogen, so there's a wide variety of fungi that can cause kurram psychosis.

503
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:05,220
What do you see? You see a corneal also, the doctor will see a corneal ulcer. He or she will have to get a specimen from that corneal ulcer.

504
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:13,220
Probably very painful. The eye needs to be numbed up and patient probably need some tranquilizers for that one.

505
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:18,920
But get the disbursement to the lab level, to the micro level jump right on that one,

506
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:26,570
especially if they're called ahead of time and said, Hey, we're sending you a specimen for a while, also the patients in the O.R.

507
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:32,240
Can you look at it right away? No, no. I'll do it. What do you see if it's a fungus?

508
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:37,650
You see hyphae in the perennial scrapings. Clearly, fees should not be there.

509
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:45,320
And what are we treated with? We can treat it surgically and remove the lesion that may cause other problems for the for the patient.

510
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,390
Or we can try topical antifungal things.

511
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:58,460
Certainly, they would try topical antifungal first unless the patient is immunocompromised or has something else going on.

512
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:05,260
Next slide. OK, now we're going deeper into the body, subcutaneous my causes.

513
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:12,130
Is sport, because this is the most common one that we have Chroma blast on my courses and mycetoma.

514
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:15,720
And we do see a little bit of sport because there's very little here in Michigan.

515
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:23,650
We don't see from blast or mycetoma unless they've traveled somewhere or they're working outside, like on a farm or in the woods.

516
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:30,070
Never hurt, injured. Next slide, so.

517
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:34,270
These funds are actually in subcutaneous fungal infections, are introduced through the skin.

518
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:36,970
So there's got to be some entry through the skin of wound of some sort.

519
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:43,150
They grow in the subcutaneous tissues spread via the lymphatic, so it's getting much more serious.

520
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:51,100
They may reach distant organs, especially bone and joints, and this is most common in the non industrialized world.

521
01:00:51,100 --> 01:01:02,140
So in India, they have disease called Madura Foot, which is a subcutaneous fungal infection.

522
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:07,930
So, but we do have sports across this here and here are some general features of sport or process.

523
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:14,950
It is a chronic infection involves cutaneous subcutaneous and lymphatic tissue.

524
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:22,370
It always follows a wound of some sort. OK, that fungus has to get into the body, and it's generally not by eating or drinking.

525
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:28,690
There's a wound of some sort. See frequently gardeners putting out mulch.

526
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:37,650
It's almost too much time. Wear gloves, please. It can develop an otherwise healthy individuals you don't have to be immunocompromised to get.

527
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:43,720
Spartacus is most common in Mexico, but also endemic in Brazil, or a good point in Salvador.

528
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:54,690
And we do see it in Michigan, but it's not endemic. It's due to an accident, a break in the skin while working outdoors.

529
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:59,610
Excellent. So the causative agent, one causative agent for third, Shanghai.

530
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:03,900
That's it, I know why you have to remember for this is thermally dimorphic.

531
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:09,090
So when you grow it on enriched media at thirty five to thirty seven is the yeast.

532
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:16,680
When you grow on several dogger at room temperature 30 degrees, it is a more that's a thermally dimorphic fungus.

533
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:25,800
At thirty seven degrees, the yeast is around Si or cigar shaped yourself really small, but it's larger than bacteria at room temperature.

534
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:37,720
It has something high feed. It has rosette like cluster clusters of Canady at the tips of the Air Force.

535
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:48,130
So where does it occur? It is in the soil and it is worldwide, and it particularly likes rotting wood,

536
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:57,070
so pathogenesis here is splinters with thorns inoculated the organism in subcutaneous tissue.

537
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:59,240
And if that happens?

538
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:06,320
Wash it extensively and look to for the first sign of infection, the first sign of infection, you go to urgent care, you go to your doctor,

539
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,560
you go to infectious disease and say, I was working in my garden,

540
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:21,660
I got my arm injured with whatever and I've got this happening and they'll start thinking, forget.

541
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:25,400
Slide. So. What is the path of physiology?

542
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:32,030
The yeast cells, once they once the fungus, the mold is in your body, it grows as a yeast at thirty five to thirty seven.

543
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:37,430
So the yeast cells travel along the lymphatic, where the lymphatic school they can go.

544
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:43,610
You can get both a pathogenic response with a fever and so on and granuloma this tissue reactions.

545
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:49,110
Okay, so it can do both. So do we see it and we see it in Gardners and if?

546
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:56,970
And it causes all 380 nodules on the hard core surface, Susan's not only on interiors on this,

547
01:03:56,970 --> 01:04:03,630
but on the surface you see this hard core sort of tissue and nodules while threading nodules can destroy bones and joints.

548
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:10,350
So not something that most people would want to. Any person would want to have happen. And it can occasionally be somebody to other sites.

549
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:20,650
So if the patient is immune compromised, she has dissemination is greater.

550
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:28,880
So here is what it looks like it's a mold. High feed and the spores are very small at 25 degrees, so it very small spores.

551
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:37,150
One comes along. Oops, they're everywhere, OK? As a yeast, it has multiple shapes, but they also, you know,

552
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:47,420
they you can have any size shape of yeast when it's in the body, but it's the mold that infects humans or other animals.

553
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:52,550
So it's mother of pathogenesis and clinical features, so if you see it in skin,

554
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:57,620
it follows a minor trauma, getting scratched or scraped, putting a band together.

555
01:04:57,620 --> 01:05:02,960
So please go when you're working with multiple wear gloves, please.

556
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:09,500
There can be a nodule at the site of infection, then it will form an ulcer and then you will get in the process at that site.

557
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:18,380
The patient will not you. Hopefully it goes through the lymphatic channels to the lymph nodes from there and disseminated throughout the body bones,

558
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:25,610
Joyce Mitchell, joints and meninges. There is also a primary pulmonary form of Sportico assist,

559
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:31,910
which is seen in chronic alcoholics because their immunity is somewhat compromised and they'll be outside.

560
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:41,170
They bring it in through the spores in bank can get a primary pulmonary form of sports ecosystem.

561
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:49,510
So this is what a lesion looks like on skin, and as you can see, clotted blood, you can see the lesion,

562
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:59,900
you can see erythema around it and even more erythema and it will spread unless it is taken care of and treated.

563
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:06,270
Next slide. So how do we diagnose sport precocious? We may get various samples into the laboratory,

564
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:14,840
they may be aspiration samples from us could be aspiration from other infected tissues that can be a biopsy sample.

565
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:22,370
We're going to do a direct microbe microscopic exam with both potassium hydroxide, as would for any kind of a skin scraping.

566
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:29,750
And then the pathologist, when they do histopathology, will have been informed by the person who ordered the test.

567
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:37,240
We're concerned about a fungal infection and they will use a silver stain or other fungal things to see it in tissue.

568
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:42,190
The cells for specific cells are very, very small, they're smaller than other yeast cells,

569
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:48,820
and they may be very difficult to see through their small size and in culture, it's going to grow mold.

570
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:59,050
We can also convert it to a yeast. But generally, the first time we isolated, it's going to grow as a mold on several Typekit.

571
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:06,640
So with treatment, patient can heal, can heal, but they will be on therapy for a long time.

572
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:12,490
If it's a cutaneous infection, they can be treated with oral potassium hydroxide can be either oral.

573
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:20,750
It can also be put down on the lesion itself. However, if it disseminates your to amphotericin B.

574
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:30,180
Which many people call and terrible because of the side effects, but it will keep you alive.

575
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:37,450
Next slide. So let me get into even more serious infections, caramel blast on my coasts.

576
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:41,200
You get an extra point if you can spell that. Just kidding.

577
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:51,240
And this is due to chronic infection following a trauma and the trauma has gone into the subcutaneous tissue that's not on the surface subcutaneous.

578
01:07:51,240 --> 01:08:00,050
And it will form part fuels. And then we'll form very close cauliflower lesions on the lower extremities.

579
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:11,390
Very rarely will there be systemic invasion. But wherever the lesion that first started, it will get bigger at that site.

580
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:16,010
So here's one that was allowed to go on for quite some time.

581
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:20,210
I always wonder why, why, why did you go on this long?

582
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:27,310
But clearly people didn't have access to medical care or was before the days of modern antifungal therapy.

583
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:34,220
This this this is a picture from 2000. I'm sure Carlin Holiday had it for a long time before that.

584
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:45,290
And so if you're going to do a skin scraping from this, you want to take it from the very edge of the lesion, not the very center.

585
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:52,730
So what causes Cromwell Blast to my closest, and we see almost none of it in this country is very rare in this country.

586
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:57,440
Fonseka of laughter and class form. And these are all the maddi is just one.

587
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:05,990
I remember the malicious means black. OK, so the girl with black spores, they're pigmented fungi in soil.

588
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:11,510
You have an injury in soil like in the woods or something. You have a chance of picking this up.

589
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:15,740
And how do we identify whether it's conseguir for a law, for a plus for him?

590
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:23,570
We look at the arrangement shapes and spores. Once we have grown in culture, we cannot identify it typically any other way.

591
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:29,270
Now there may be, although I haven't heard of it, a molecular tests identify them.

592
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:33,920
But because it is so rare in this country, I doubt if there's a molecular test for this.

593
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:45,010
However, specimens are going to see to see the mycobacteria and see if they can do a lot of testing that are hospital labs.

594
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:53,230
That's right. So how does it diagnose what we can do with microscopic exam with potassium hydroxide and be put high tech

595
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:58,600
potassium hydroxide on a skin scraping it dissolves the skin and then you can see what else is there.

596
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:06,100
And if you do that in the lab, we lower the light underneath the scalp so we don't have as much light, more.

597
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:13,060
It's more of a diffused light so we can see other structures, and we're looking for a round body with a set what's called a sclerotic body.

598
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:17,890
We can also brought on Sabato's are unique here that we use for everything.

599
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:24,060
It takes four to six weeks to grow, but it will grow at 37 degrees.

600
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:35,430
And these are the school about sclerotic bodies, and this is a can't wage preparation from a patient at University Texas Medical Branch in Texas.

601
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:40,470
And you can see they have kind of a brown coal field. So if you see this, you say sclerotic bodies.

602
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:52,780
Our present patient has a fungal infection called make sure there's an infectious diseases physician on board.

603
01:10:52,780 --> 01:11:00,040
OK, what about treatment for Chrono Blast and Marcoses surgery? Sometimes people lose limbs.

604
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:08,680
There is antifungal therapy with the agents shown here after some his ideas even cure cancer, but they may not work.

605
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:14,950
So last resort sometimes people lose limbs to suffer from low infection.

606
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:23,050
Heat therapy is said to work, but I don't know how well it actually works.

607
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:30,220
OK, now we go to mycetoma, which is similar to it from a blast of my closest but a little bit different scientific name is Majerle,

608
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:39,580
my closest alma mater, Madura Foot. And this is a post-traumatic chronic infection of subcutaneous tissue.

609
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:45,370
So somebody gets injured, seems to heal up and then other things happen, and it looks like your skin is breaking down.

610
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:52,840
Your tissue is swollen, it's red, it's inflamed and so on. This is common and more common in tropical tropical climates.

611
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:56,770
Not so much here in mid-Michigan or southeastern Michigan.

612
01:11:56,770 --> 01:12:06,700
Well, actually, southeast Michigan is tropical side of Michigan and conservation for the specific fungi, the ones that are out in nature all the time.

613
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:17,170
OK, so patients may lose a limb due to this disease, but fortunately, it is not very common.

614
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:19,350
So causative agents are shown here.

615
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:27,320
Majerle, mycetoma this suit while sharing body, I does exist here in Michigan, but we don't see it in this type of infection.

616
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:36,670
We see it in other types of infections. Ethanol ammonium sociologists tell me I left Syria and Aspergillus and Aspergillus is everywhere also.

617
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:40,270
But we just don't see much mycetoma here in Michigan,

618
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:49,160
and I don't know whether it's a difference in the strains or what it is that we don't see much, but fortunately.

619
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,890
So what are the clinical findings from all?

620
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:59,420
Generally, you see it in injured parts, so that would be feet that are injured, people walking around barefoot or they they get smashed outside.

621
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:05,720
Whether doing some work outside in their foot breaks through the boot, the extremities in the hands.

622
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:13,700
There could be abscess formation and from that abscess formation there are draining sinuses containing granules.

623
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:21,770
And as it progresses, there will be deformities. They also can disseminate to muscles involved.

624
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:28,810
This is a very serious type of infection, but as I said, we don't see very much of it, fortunately.

625
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:32,110
So here's one, though, that was allowed to go on for many, many years,

626
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:39,430
and you can see it is progressed from the initial sign was here and it is that has the

627
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:45,190
lesion has enlarged and it's progressed down the person's leg and up the person's leg also.

628
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:55,680
And I never asked Carla Ali if they were able to treat this or whether they had to do an amputation.

629
01:13:55,680 --> 01:14:05,580
So next, we we're going to talk about his mycetoma and these in the mycetoma clinical findings are really not very helpful.

630
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:10,980
They're not really nonspecific, but what we need to do is get the fungus out and identify it.

631
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:20,190
So there may be multiple cultures that have a patient where they're trying to think there are signs of a fungal infection, but nothing seen yet.

632
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:26,430
Multiple cultures and probably multiple path pathology specimens.

633
01:14:26,430 --> 01:14:33,090
There can be a granule that's formed in this infection, and that is helpful also if we get it in the lab.

634
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:40,590
We look at the colony morphology. We look at physiologic tests used for identification, and if we need, we send it off to a major reference lab.

635
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:47,530
OK, we don't wait too long to do that because the patient really needs appropriate therapy.

636
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:57,240
So what do we treat mycetoma with? Surgery is the easiest way to stop a mycetoma if it hasn't gone on too far.

637
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:05,660
OK, but people lose limbs with mycetoma. There is anti-fungal therapy and that will be tried first before they say We've got to have surgery.

638
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:14,100
And after the anti-fungal therapy, or some of these are shown here, there are also newer, antifungal agents that are even more more effective.

639
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:22,450
But it depends on what the infective fungus is, what antifungal agent they use.

640
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:24,940
So another exam type question,

641
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:33,700
microscopic exam with a college prep of a patient sample from a product very close lesion demonstrates brown sclerotic bodies.

642
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:45,350
What's the agent? I'm glad you told me this on Wednesday.

643
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:52,360
OK, so we have some of the answer on Wednesday.

644
01:15:52,360 --> 01:16:01,870
And for more information that's in the cell is like 88 sites go to Mycology Adelaide, they have a fabulous website.

645
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:10,290
You can go to see the fungal labs and you can go to Dr. Fungus that the fungus went offline for a long time and now I've found out is back online.

646
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:21,050
You can send them questions, you can ask questions and so on. There is a lot of information, do you have any questions?

647
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:29,850
I would definitely read the chapters in the book, you will help. OK.

648
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:34,860
OK, I will see you on Wednesday. I'm trying to get through both.

There's supposed to be three lectures on mycology,

650
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:46,170
but because the test was a day late and I screwed things up when they're trying to get through all three, mycology lectures in two.

651
01:16:46,170 --> 01:17:00,280
And get us back on Twitter, and I hope everyone can enjoy the nice weather.
