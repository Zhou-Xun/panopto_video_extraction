1
00:00:03,292 --> 00:00:06,495
Hey everyone, I'll be going over fiber.

2
00:00:06,495 --> 00:00:13,040
This is the quick review.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,761
So the fiber structure, it's resistant to digestive enzymes.

4
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:21,709
And so the enzymes and our gut cannot really detect.

5
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:24,410
They look like slick bonds and can't break them down.

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:32,040
And to other sources that can be absorbed through the enterocytes.

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,117
So when we're having the wheat flour, we're basically

8
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:42,000
removing the outer layer which has the highest fiber.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,426
And so we're just eating a chunk of the whole thing which is not,

10
00:00:48,426 --> 00:00:53,789
if it's definitely if it's not a whole green wheat.

11
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,191
Basically unrefined versus refined.

12
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:59,130
So the refined leaves you with the endosperm and

13
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,530
removes the bran as just mention and removes the germ.

14
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,950
So they really have vitamin B.

15
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,784
The germ has vitamin E, it's really it's nutrient dense, and

16
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:10,280
the bran has the fibers.

17
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,722
So removing both of those and ending up with just the endosperm,

18
00:01:15,722 --> 00:01:18,740
That just contains carbs and protein.

19
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:25,090
And so fiber properties so solubility as a major property.

20
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,741
Some fibers can be soluble in water.

21
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:36,103
So think of it as so the ability as when you add milk to oats.

22
00:01:36,103 --> 00:01:40,381
And let's assume you have a cup of oats and you add a cup of milk to that, and

23
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:42,050
you keep mixing and mixing.

24
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,786
The oats will become very it becomes like soluble, so

25
00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:50,153
it becomes like kind of a mixture, and

26
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:56,171
then the milk turns into like a more tan color due to self liability.

27
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:59,800
So that dissolves in water basically is what this means.

28
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,539
And then insoluble, if you put like a broccoli and water and keep mixing it,

29
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:05,734
nothing happens.

30
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:10,502
The water is still transparent and the broccoli is still

31
00:02:10,502 --> 00:02:15,180
a big chunk as is, so nothing really got solubilized.

32
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,273
And then fermentability, this really pertains to the colon and

33
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,651
the gut microbiota.

34
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:27,481
Whether the bacteria is capable of fermenting the fiber and

35
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:33,771
utilizing it for itself and for other purposes or not.

36
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:37,971
So this is fermentation and it's not digestion.

37
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:42,488
So this really talks to how much bacteria there is in the gut, and

38
00:02:42,488 --> 00:02:47,342
what type of bacteria is capable of fermenting the fiber that's been

39
00:02:47,342 --> 00:02:51,040
digested and definitely the type of fiber.

40
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,667
And then the functionality, so dietary fiber is basically

41
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:59,850
the naturally occurring fiber, functional fiber.

42
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:06,117
It's either created in the lab, so it's synthetic or

43
00:03:06,117 --> 00:03:11,860
it's been isolated by man from a natural source.

44
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,170
So it's not naturally existing.

45
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,470
Man has done something to it.

46
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,121
Either to isolated or to make a synthetic form out of it.

47
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:23,870
So that would be the functional fiber.

48
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,121
So they're both nondigestible.

49
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:29,563
It's just one is like naturally occurring in its natural habitat, and

50
00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:36,240
the second is either isolated or man made and synthetic.

51
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,180
So cellulose we've mentioned has beta1-4 links.

52
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,401
It's water-insoluble,

53
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:43,647
it doesn't get fermented because the bacteria just can't ferment it.

54
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:46,543
It's like very solid, basically.

55
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:52,474
Hemicellulose is water soluble and preventable, and those are some sources.

56
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:55,946
Gums as well are water soluble and fermentable,

57
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:58,493
and usually those two go together.

58
00:03:58,493 --> 00:04:01,470
Water soluble and fermentable,

59
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,261
usually they just go together those two properties.

60
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:12,228
And pectins are linear chain just like a melo's for

61
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:16,963
example is linear but it's not a fiber.

62
00:04:16,963 --> 00:04:20,667
So, And

63
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:24,870
then other properties, so water solubility, the viscosity.

64
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,391
Do they make like a gel like mixture or not?

65
00:04:29,391 --> 00:04:31,630
And usually if something is water soluble,

66
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,207
it will become viscous just because it's just like get solubilized.

67
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:40,267
And then makes a thicker like a thick texture,

68
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:43,001
and its ability to bind.

69
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:45,793
So if something is viscous, makes a thick texture,

70
00:04:45,793 --> 00:04:48,277
it's more likely to trap a few things into it.

71
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:53,369
So it absorbs molecules and fermentability is whether it ferments,

72
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:57,244
and usually those all four go really well together.

73
00:04:57,244 --> 00:04:59,786
Something is not soluble, it's usually not viscous,

74
00:04:59,786 --> 00:05:04,740
doesn't bind and it's not fermentable.

75
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,241
So that's distinguish a few things.

76
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:14,001
So if something is insoluble, it basically just doesn't get.

77
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:17,740
It doesn't become viscous,

78
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,681
it doesn't really adobe to anything.

79
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:26,859
So it just goes as is, and basically that would be water insoluble and

80
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,451
that would be cellulose.

81
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:30,920
And they just add to the bulk of stools.

82
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,562
And so they add they make the transit time less, so

83
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:39,450
they decrease transit time because they add to the bulk of stools.

84
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:44,303
And you can imagine if you keep adding to the book of stools eventually that

85
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,191
would push them downwards.

86
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:50,740
And so it decreases transit time.

87
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,752
And so water-soluble properties as mentioned, they're usually gonna

88
00:05:55,752 --> 00:06:01,102
be viscous, absorb, they absorb and they're fermentable at the same time.

89
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:05,111
And viscosity, since it becomes really this thick gel.

90
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:07,974
So think of this thick gel as being in your stomach.

91
00:06:07,974 --> 00:06:10,823
If it's really thick and viscous, it's harder for

92
00:06:10,823 --> 00:06:13,421
it to like pass through to the small intestine.

93
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:15,597
So it delays gastric emptying and

94
00:06:15,597 --> 00:06:20,193
decreases nutrient absorption rates because usually fits viscous.

95
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:24,805
It also absorbs, so it can decrease them absorption of

96
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:29,540
certain nutrients, which can be a good and a bad thing.

97
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,154
So if it's absorbing to fat, then that's a good thing because

98
00:06:34,154 --> 00:06:38,521
you're not really absorbing all of the fat, for example.

99
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:42,460
And on the other hand, if it's absorbing to iron, that's not really great.

100
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,931
If you just had steak to alleviate some of the anemia,

101
00:06:45,931 --> 00:06:49,440
then that's not really what you're looking for.

102
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,577
I will talk more about in absorption.

103
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:57,505
And so if something is viscous, it delays gastric emptying and

104
00:06:57,505 --> 00:07:02,171
causes you to feel full for longer periods of time, just because the food is

105
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:06,271
still in your stomach, and you feel that like, volume in there.

106
00:07:06,271 --> 00:07:09,614
And so you send signals to the brain to reduce intake,

107
00:07:09,614 --> 00:07:12,540
because there's a lot of food in there.

108
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,676
And then this is adsorption, as mentioned, it binds so

109
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:19,671
let's talk about like bile excretion.

110
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:23,087
So if it's bind to and adsorbs to bile,

111
00:07:23,087 --> 00:07:27,651
then it will limit the entire hepatic circulation.

112
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:31,620
And its limit the fact that bile will go back into circulation and

113
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,760
be reabsorbed through the liver and then goes to the gall bladder.

114
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,055
Which is good for someone who's trying to lower their cholesterol because there's

115
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:42,061
more bile being excreted in the feces.

116
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:46,601
Which means that the liver has to make more bile,

117
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:55,048
using the fat that's in the body which will ultimately reduce cholesterol.

118
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:58,346
Which is exactly what we just mentioned and

119
00:07:58,346 --> 00:08:02,811
enterohepatic circulation, Fermentability, so

120
00:08:02,811 --> 00:08:06,041
if something has fermentability, it has a prebiotic properties.

121
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,330
So let's distinguish prebiotic from probiotics.

122
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:14,486
Probiotics is basically the actual bacteria that's found in yoghurt for

123
00:08:14,486 --> 00:08:18,750
example, and that's the bacteria that lives in the colon.

124
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,741
The prebiotic is the food that this bacteria will use.

125
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:28,355
So it will ferment and use this prebiotic food basically

126
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:33,390
to ensure that it's alive and functioning well.

127
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:38,310
So probiotics use probiotics to survive basically.

128
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:43,378
So the prebiotic is what we extract from fermentable fibers,

129
00:08:43,378 --> 00:08:50,120
because it's basically when you ferment the fiber the bacteria is getting food.

130
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,667
And when the bacteria gets the food for the bacteria then that's considered

131
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:58,640
a prebiotic because it's feeding the bacteria.

132
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,139
And usually when fibers are fermented, they become butyrate, acetate and

133
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:07,240
propionate which are short chain fatty acids.

134
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,163
And they can be used for energy of the common cells, or they can be used for

135
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:13,551
energy in the body.

136
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:18,448
So it really depends on the needs of the body at the moment when the fiber

137
00:09:18,448 --> 00:09:19,946
has been fermented.

138
00:09:19,946 --> 00:09:24,137
And also probiotics play a major role in immune function, and

139
00:09:24,137 --> 00:09:26,001
they lower the pH and so on.

140
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:29,391
And there's the barrier that's in the colon.

141
00:09:29,391 --> 00:09:34,518
So since it's providing food for the bacteria, the bacteria doesn't

142
00:09:34,518 --> 00:09:39,150
really need to eat the the colon barrier to ensure its survival.

143
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,900
So it will have something to feed off, and

144
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:47,440
this ensures that the barrier remains intact.

145
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,561
So other effects of probiotics are definitely they can regulate behavior.

146
00:09:53,561 --> 00:09:55,180
There's some studies about this.

147
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,606
They can maybe manage some allergies, and

148
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:03,849
they have some the mechanisms underlying exactly how they work.

149
00:10:03,849 --> 00:10:10,140
And what they can do, show that they can alter some gene expression and so on.

150
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,378
And basically if something is non-fermentable then it will increase

151
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:17,968
the fecal volume as mentioned and decreased transit time,

152
00:10:17,968 --> 00:10:20,440
just like cellulose.

153
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,240
This is the adequate intake and I believe that that's it.

154
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,711
So just something to mention.

155
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:32,740
If someone has constipation, then you would want the fecal transit

156
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:38,251
time to be decreased so that they get rid of the constipation.

157
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:43,759
So you would recommend that they have non soluble non fermentable,

158
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:48,900
basically fiber which will add to the bulk of the fecal matter.

159
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:54,132
Whereas if someone has diarrhea and has very loose stools,

160
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:59,571
then you'd want something to make those tools more viscous,

161
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:02,630
and make them into certain shape.

162
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:07,424
So you'd recommend that they eat viscous soluble fiber that

163
00:11:07,424 --> 00:11:11,750
can catch the loose tools and increased transit time.

164
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,003
I hope that this makes sense and that's it.
