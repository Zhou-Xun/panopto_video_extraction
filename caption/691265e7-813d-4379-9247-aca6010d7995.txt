1
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:14,553
After watching this video,
you will be able to use IF, THEN,

2
00:00:14,553 --> 00:00:19,730
ELSE statements to create new
variables in a data step.

3
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,457
You remember from the previous
video we started with this example

4
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:26,380
to show you the structure of a data step.

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,948
As a review, we already know that here

6
00:00:28,948 --> 00:00:33,800
you're first creating a new
temporary dataset called temp.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,665
Second, you're telling Sass to get
data from an existing dataset called

8
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:41,440
variation from the br library.

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,543
And finally, we are creating
a new variable using our if,

10
00:00:45,543 --> 00:00:47,312
then, else statement.

11
00:00:47,312 --> 00:00:54,050
So with this code you are telling Sass
to create a new variable called obesity.

12
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,860
Obesity will be one when
an existing continuous

13
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:04,610
variable called bmi is equal or
greater than 30.

14
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,487
Or it will take the value 0 otherwise.

15
00:01:07,487 --> 00:01:13,090
That's what the if, then,
else statement is doing.

16
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:18,872
In this other example, we're creating
another new categorical variable

17
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:24,630
that we will call CALCAT based on
the continuous variable costs.

18
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:32,240
With this code, calcat takes on the value
of 2 when cals is larger than 2000.

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,970
Calcat takes on the value of 1
when cals is larger than 1000 but

20
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,916
not larger than 2000.

21
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:44,250
Calcat takes on the value of 0
when cals is smaller than 1000.

22
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,970
Note that we are assuming there
are no missing values for cals.

23
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:55,188
If you cannot assume or you know that
there are missing values, you can

24
00:01:55,188 --> 00:02:00,849
always add another else if statement
to keep the missing values as missing.

25
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:03,577
Note that us uses the dot as missing.

26
00:02:03,577 --> 00:02:12,030
So this code will create one category of
missing values in the new CALCAT variable.

27
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:18,348
Finally, there are other ways of
coding the same if, then statements.

28
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:23,404
In this example,
the statement obesity = bmi greater or

29
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:28,248
equal than 30 in parentheses
is equivalent to what we

30
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:32,775
saw before to the if bmi greater or
equal than 30,

31
00:02:32,775 --> 00:02:37,770
then obesity equal 1,
else obesity equals 0.

32
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,203
Basically you're telling Sass
to create a dichotomous variable

33
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:46,151
that will be 1 when the condition
in parenthesis is true,

34
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:50,520
that is when bmi is greater than 30,
and will be 0 otherwise.

35
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,024
As you can see,
this is a more let's say, elegant or

36
00:02:54,024 --> 00:02:57,539
at least shorter way of
creating a binary variable.

37
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:02,520
And you may want to use this in future
examples when we talk about dummy or

38
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,840
indicator variables.

39
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,133
In summary,
in this video we learn two different ways

40
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:13,243
of creating new variables for
an original variable in a data step.

41
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:17,497
In the next video we will learn about
logic and numeric operations and

42
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,789
statistical functions in Sass.
