1
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:11,850
All right. Let's go ahead and get started, everybody.

2
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:23,040
Very punctual because I see some light. Go on. I guess the Panopto recording comes on at a certain time, so I feel a need to fill the airtime.

3
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,300
It is 1:00, so let's go ahead and get rolling. So, yeah, I thought we could start today.

4
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:34,340
I'll show you a link.

5
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:47,300
I've got the right slides. So I was able to assign you two different groups for the group presentation assignment so you can see them listed here.

6
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,250
And there are also on the canvas site.

7
00:00:52,670 --> 00:01:00,559
And so the way it shook out was we did have a couple folks dropped.

8
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,890
So I think we just had enough for seven rather than eight groups.

9
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:09,049
And we did have one group with just two rather than three members, although historically,

10
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:15,110
sometimes that actually works to that group's advantage, less chaos and finding times to meet and so forth.

11
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:23,360
But I was pleased because I think everybody got one of their top three choices and most of you got your number one choice.

12
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:30,140
And I think for the most part, the groups also feature students across units.

13
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:38,030
So I think that will hopefully be part of the learning experiences that you learn from one another, from your own disciplinary perspective.

14
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,730
But given that you were still learning who each other is and you may not even know who your other group members are,

15
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:50,300
I thought maybe I'll go and maybe just raise your hand to kind of indicate to your other group members who you are.

16
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,299
So the first one is this disability rights critique.

17
00:01:53,300 --> 00:02:04,070
So can Jessica morgan and Marcella go through their WHO on their cascade screening would be Zainab and Shuki.

18
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:12,080
So you're our only group where you're both efforts so sorry for not having a speech or person to fit with you.

19
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,270
High school science education. We've got Andrew, Helen and Satara.

20
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,050
I think. I think, Helen, I'm looking to where she was last time.

21
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,970
Hopefully she'll be joining. But those are the three students for that.

22
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:34,330
Uh, neutral genomics. We've got Hayley, Bella and Jennifer.

23
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,399
Okay, so. So who each other is? Pharmacogenomics.

24
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,390
We've got Alexandra, Bridget, and with Deka.

25
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,650
And so I think with that Alexandra just. Yeah, I just want.

26
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,970
Okay. The President. Vinick is over here.

27
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,470
COVID. We got Julie, Sarah and Sarah.

28
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,930
But as we hear. She'll be joining.

29
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,750
And then finally, the mosquitoes go to Cali, Maddy and Katy.

30
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,349
Okay. All right. Any questions? On what group?

31
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,680
Your hand. Who's in your group? Hopefully.

32
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,230
You know, it's a little bit. A roll of the dice when you do this before the final drop in ad.

33
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:32,610
So if you are thinking of dropping the class, let me know, because that would have kind of repercussions for for the group assignments.

34
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,049
But yeah,

35
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:42,300
I think this will be know this is a major part of the semester and a chance for you all to learn more about a topic that's presumably of interest.

36
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:47,670
And, you know, like I said earlier, I'll turn it over to you to lead the group.

37
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,250
We the A session for that particular day and Morgan I think that the women

38
00:03:53,250 --> 00:04:00,150
group peer evaluation form that links to like genetic engineering on humans.

39
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,740
Okay. So it's a broken link. Yeah. Can you just email me that and I'll, I'll change that.

40
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:15,900
But within group peer evaluation form is a chance for you all that's not do the day of the assignments, do two days after.

41
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:23,370
But it's a chance for you all to reflect on how did things go in terms of your group process, what worked well, what could be improved.

42
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,090
So thanks, Morgan, for drawing that to my attention.

43
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,690
All right. Well, hopefully we'll have some great group presentations over the course of the term.

44
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,469
Also in terms of announcements. I may have mentioned this LC Hub website.

45
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:48,670
So, you know, I talked about the world of LC research standing for ethical, legal and social implications of genomics.

46
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,170
So there's a great website called LC Hub dot org.

47
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,360
It's run by some researchers at Columbia and Stanford.

48
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,460
And so they have this Virtual Friday Forum series that's done monthly.

49
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:10,880
And so this Friday, it turns out they're having a really interesting discussion on social and behavioral genomics.

50
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,990
So if you're interested, you might want to check that out.

51
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:23,170
Also, there's a whole like they've got a whole archive of their past year and a half of various topics they've done in case you're interested.

52
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,590
Com. All right. So today's focus is going to be on history.

53
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,790
And so I thought I would start with a couple quotes here.

54
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,680
So you may have heard these before it.

55
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,780
William Faulkner is a famous novelist from Mississippi.

56
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:48,280
So in the post-Civil War South, the kind of the ghosts of the past were really important to life there.

57
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,940
So he has this quote, talking about the past not being dead or not even past,

58
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:59,320
contrasted to our our local celebrity, Henry Ford, saying that history is is more or less bunk.

59
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:06,190
I think I mentioned I was an English major, so you can probably guess which perspective I'm going to espouse in today's class.

60
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:11,709
I'm going to be talking about the importance, I think, of history for our current day activities.

61
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:20,560
But actually, from hearing from you all, why might it benefit health professionals or researchers to be more steeped in the history of genetics?

62
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,750
What might be some reasons why that would be important to do?

63
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,030
Yeah, probably from a health professional standpoint,

64
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:41,799
thinking about patients who may come in with any hesitations or misinformation regarding the technology,

65
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,860
just to be able to know the history where it came from, what led up to where we are now,

66
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,160
to be able to address those hesitations and misinformation with the truth.

67
00:06:52,330 --> 00:07:02,630
So you think some of these historical experiences might shape both knowledge and attitudes regarding what technologies or treatment options or yeah,

68
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,969
about the integration of genetics into medicine.

69
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:15,340
And as it becomes more prominent, having it become more of an option for patients who would then be hesitant or spread misinformation about it,

70
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:20,200
or fall victim to misinformation like people with the COVID vaccine and think, Yeah.

71
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,150
So yeah. And sometimes it's not even about misinformation, sometimes.

72
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:33,149
Certain groups have had truly horrible experiences, and so it wouldn't really necessarily only be about counteracting misconceptions,

73
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,890
but maybe reckoning with some of those historical adverse experiences.

74
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:46,969
Yeah. Satire outside of clinical settings, knowing how your patients may or their families may be treated in the past and

75
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,440
would love genetic resources and testing for genetic knowledge can give you

76
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,549
an understanding of how you can treat them now and the results you have from

77
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,820
the past or the family history and how you found this link between these two.

78
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,020
Yeah, that's a great point. How many kind of illustrative example you can think of?

79
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:13,459
Yeah. So for example, I saw a case I think last summer saying one of my rotations that the patient was a 75 year old

80
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:23,840
woman with a history of breast cancer and she did testing before in her 30 so like 47 years ago.

81
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:29,260
And she was trying to make either a BRCA one being.

82
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,300
So her sister was in the clinic with us that semester.

83
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:44,840
And I think the discussion that was with the genetic counselor was that that genetic testing initially was identified as viable and of significance.

84
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,180
But now we have more information on those.

85
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:55,120
I guess, although they were not classified and other genetic testing on this is that in the third generation,

86
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,970
they give us more understanding of maybe there are other genes that I also think that that

87
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,950
they are not tested like that because back then it was only BRCA one or two or No 76 genes.

88
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:13,510
So we talk with a sister that actually spoke to first, says the original patient with the whole panel and then the testing.

89
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:23,059
Mm hmm. So I do like this discussion of even though they have the testing results and we can see the results because they've

90
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,770
done in the past and maybe updated results can give us a better understanding of what's going on in the family.

91
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:38,510
Yes, I think that's a great example of how given the rapid pace of advancement in both technology and kind of just scientific knowledge,

92
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:46,460
that that can really change the terms of how we interact with patients now versus even just a few decades ago.

93
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:54,200
Other arguments for the importance of a historical perspective in genetics?

94
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,550
Yes, you can. Not so much practical but very general thinking.

95
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,390
I could work kind of through a friend for a long time,

96
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:09,860
knowing the history of genetics can join the map or to bring something bacteria which we can't

97
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:16,240
exactly know where we are and where we're going to be and how far we have been that way.

98
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,600
So we'd have to come and look.

99
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:31,210
Yeah, definitely. I think kind of going on there without knowing history, all of those things, additions or whatever knowledge of yourself,

100
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:38,420
your genetics and then also where it could be, I think just being more conscious of our current attitudes in light of history.

101
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,140
I think one thing ever given,

102
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:47,749
I know we talked about it and what's really going to create a space for conditions like Trisomy 21 or other possibilities,

103
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:55,579
I think how do we work with patients that are in those decisions and how are we doing it in a way?

104
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:01,130
So it's not coming off from like this eugenics perspective that you used in the past?

105
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,900
Yeah, great. Great point, Jennifer. I think also in regards to research,

106
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,629
you can kind of look at and start approach to it in terms of like the differences between sickle

107
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:17,840
cell disease versus fibrosis research and kind of how not even just the history of genetics,

108
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:24,829
but also whether socioeconomic factors have played into how funding for that type of research.

109
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:35,629
And how does both genetics kind of and more societal factors have different positions that are in research terms,

110
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:42,200
what treatments are out there for patients and even out in the health care system, they're treated much differently.

111
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:48,440
Okay. Yeah, well, that's a great point. The sickle cell example, I think it shows how when we talk about the history of genetics,

112
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:54,650
it's hard to get away from the history of systematic racism in the US, which is certainly shaped.

113
00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:02,030
I think the Markle peace talks some about how sickle cell screening was initially rolled out and then even to this day,

114
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:06,140
the kind of differential resources that have been allocated over time.

115
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,680
So yeah, those two conditions similar in a lot of respects,

116
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:17,630
but we're we've seen arguably more progress on the cystic fibrosis front given the greater social investment.

117
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,639
All right. So I think you guys are preaching to the choir here.

118
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:29,450
And it sounds like in terms of, you know, having a sensibility of of of wanting to think about the history of genetics,

119
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,980
I think we've already hit on some of these points.

120
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:40,250
But yeah, I think this idea of trying to figure out what are the historical origins of clinical practice, you know,

121
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:46,700
I think medical genetics is distinct from other realms of medicine in how it treats genetic information.

122
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,620
I think there's been more kind of caution, this idea in other realms of medicine and genetics,

123
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:57,919
there's this term of inflected insight or, you know, saddling people with toxic information.

124
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:06,049
I don't think that's kind of a mindset that we generally have in other realms of medicine when we're delivering, you know, potentially bad news.

125
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:10,070
I think obviously we'll talk about the historical roots of certain policies.

126
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:15,559
But then also, as some of you were mentioning, just how the public reacts and what their attitudes are,

127
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,920
what their knowledge is, I think is important to keep in mind.

128
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,570
And so some examples of this, you know, when we talk about genetic counseling,

129
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:31,010
we'll talk about this ethos of non directive ness, this idea of the idea that the goal often in genetic counseling,

130
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:40,430
not always but often, is to present information and kind of let the patient decide to not kind of push one response over another.

131
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:45,139
And I think historical experiences around prenatal genetic testing,

132
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:53,870
I think are really behind that kind of wariness of being too interventionist and nudging people in one direction or the next.

133
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:57,980
And we'll talk about how in HB sometimes that creates conflict is an age we're

134
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,909
often wanting to nudge people to do the right thing in terms of health behavior.

135
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:06,110
We want people to take action in terms of health behaviors or screening.

136
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:13,610
And so some of those tensions might then arise over how directive should we be or even just national reactions.

137
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,940
On the policy front, you direct to consumer testing was rolled out.

138
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,880
Germany basically said we don't have anything to do with this. Given their troubled history of genetics.

139
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:31,819
They banned outright, all direct to consumer genetic testing as opposed to the U.S., where we saw it flourish in a lot of ways.

140
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,970
And we'll talk about that more next session.

141
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,740
There's been, of course, you know, a lot of controversies over the use in genetics.

142
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:48,140
And so, Carly, your point earlier may be relevant here, thinking, particularly when we're talking about underrepresented minority groups.

143
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:55,720
Their historical experience, I think has a lot to do with why are they not excited about signing up for, you know,

144
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:00,770
all of us or other kind of research projects where in medicine and public health we're saying,

145
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,990
oh, this is a great thing to do, we're going to learn more.

146
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:10,070
But I think those historical experiences might lead to understandable reservations in this area.

147
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,120
And along with this, I think, Marty, you maybe brought up Tuskegee last time.

148
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:21,889
This is kind of the classic example that's used in public health to describe kind of a historical tragedy,

149
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,660
really shaping even modern day views on participation in research.

150
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:36,140
But I think what's less appreciated is that, you know, the Tuskegee study actually did have kind of a genetic angle to it.

151
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,860
You know, the rationale for the study, which went on for 40 years and it was, you know,

152
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:47,510
conducted by the U.S. government, which made it particularly horrifying that it was a kind of a state sanctioned study.

153
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:55,129
But the original rationale was basically, well, black people are inherently biologically different than whites.

154
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:03,350
So we need to see how this, you know, disease syphilis plays out in blacks because we think it's going to be different than in whites.

155
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:10,850
And of course, they found that it really wasn't essentially, you know, fundamentally a different experience in black bodies versus white bodies.

156
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:16,250
But that kind of racist thinking, which was along the lines of kind of genetic differences,

157
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:22,760
I think helped provide the initial rationale in the 1930s when it was started.

158
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:34,610
So when we talk about some of this history I mentioned last time, I'm going to be the kind of go blue champion and know some of our our local experts.

159
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,840
We have a fantastic center for the history of medicine.

160
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:44,809
It's actually, you know, if you go towards the cardiovascular centers that rotary they are right before I think it's if it's still there

161
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:49,490
it's it's housed in that building right before that Rotary is where the Center for History of Medicine is.

162
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:54,710
You read Howard Markel. He's actually better known for his work on the history of infectious disease.

163
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:00,020
So he has actually been, you know, testified before Congress, I think, during the COVID crisis,

164
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,280
because we were trying to think back, well, how did things play out in the 1918 flu epidemic?

165
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,809
But as you saw from one of the readings for today, he's also written on the history of genetics.

166
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:17,690
Alex Stern, we'll talk about her work, which is very relevant for reparations for victims of forced sterilization.

167
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:23,059
Sadly, we we. He lost her to UCLA just in November. So she's recently departed the U.

168
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,709
But for many years she was here.

169
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:31,400
And to the counselors in the room, you might already be aware that she wrote a book about the history of genetic counseling in particular.

170
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,610
And then Martin Penick, Dr. Stern and Dr. Penick were both on that S.S. little piece that you read for today.

171
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:47,469
So we do have some great experts here who look at the history of medicine in general, but the history of genetics in particular.

172
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:57,170
And of course, a lot of their work and other historians work has really focused on this theme of eugenics, which I'm sure you've heard of before.

173
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,919
You know, the idea behind it is, you know, kind of a benevolent one in some ways,

174
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:11,600
this idea of how can we improve the human race via controlled reproduction and selective breeding?

175
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:18,530
But of course, we've seen how even though the intentions might be towards a quote unquote unproven improvement,

176
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,759
the way it's played out is in really harmful ways.

177
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:28,520
And of course, most famously, it was this underlying philosophy in Nazi Germany.

178
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:38,209
But what's perhaps less appreciated is just how popular a viewpoint this was in the United States in the 1920 or the 1920s especially,

179
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,300
but right up to the the Second World War.

180
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:48,139
And, you know, a lot of mainstream scientific leaders in the U.S. were a card carrying eugenicists,

181
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:53,810
if you will, including, of course, some folks here in our Michigan world.

182
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:57,230
So it's I'm going to say go blue for certain things.

183
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,980
This is not so much a go blue mindset here.

184
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:08,149
But we did have eugenics thought leaders right here at U of M so one of our school public buildings is the von building.

185
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,900
It turns out that was the the son of Victor von.

186
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:20,090
But Victor Von himself was the founding who was a founding dean of the University of Michigan Medical School.

187
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,399
So for 30 years he was the dean of the medical school.

188
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:29,300
But then he was also very much promoting, you know, the state to sterilize, you know, feeble minded people.

189
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:40,700
And in a perverse way, this was kind of in with the public health goals of prevention and but the coercive nature of it and the kind of ways in which

190
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:50,300
it really went against the autonomy of the unfortunate people who who were victims really kind of is offensive to us today.

191
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:57,470
And then, of course, there are S.S. Little, who you many of you wrote about who was briefly our president in the 1920s.

192
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:09,799
And he also kind of spoke out publicly about the importance of, oh, we need to prevent the reproduction of these, quote unquote, undesirables.

193
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,260
And you can see this this quote here.

194
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:23,599
So, you know, how many of you were actually undergrads here a few years ago when this controversy all played out?

195
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,960
So Sarah Haley. Alex.

196
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,300
Anybody else? What do you all remember at the time?

197
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,509
But did it really kind of penetrate the student body in terms of like being something that was talked about?

198
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:44,750
Or was it more kind of a niche discussion or. I had never heard of it until I read that until this this class.

199
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,390
Okay. So even though it's happening, it wasn't on your radar.

200
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,830
Okay. How about you, sir? I remember people talking about it a decent amount.

201
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,910
Definitely not as much detail as the actual report went into to.

202
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,330
People really does mention that like he was a racist and a eugenicist.

203
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:06,600
But I feel like most people that I talked to anyway were fine with the renaming and didn't really have any opposition to it.

204
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:10,830
Mm hmm. Yeah, I didn't really hear a lot.

205
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:16,170
It was just kind of like the name of the buildings changed, and there was a lot of emphasis on why.

206
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:25,950
Okay. Okay. So maybe that speaks to there could have been more aggressive efforts towards public engagement in education.

207
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:34,709
But anyway. Yeah. So as you you read about, you know, in some respects he was a, uh, an accomplished leader.

208
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:41,700
He, you know, he founded, I think, Jackson Lab, which to this day is still kind of a major genetics research hub.

209
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,780
He was a leader in some of these really important societies.

210
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:55,319
He did some work around like mouse genetics research. But I think what made his tenure troubling from historical perspective was his role leading,

211
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:02,220
you know, the American Eugenics Society and then later on also working for the tobacco industry.

212
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:11,849
So what I thought we would do is have you kind of further discuss this debate over should the building have been renamed,

213
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,770
because as I'm sure you all know,

214
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:21,090
this has become kind of a broader debate in our society where we're kind of reconsidering historical figures and what they represent,

215
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:26,430
and are they consistent with the values we'd like our institutions to to uphold?

216
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:33,750
And so I think even though this is just this is just one case example in kind of a broader societal debate that we're having.

217
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,479
So what I'd like you to do is, is get into smaller groups one of these days,

218
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,709
I'll maybe have you count off so we can mix it up where everybody sits in the same place.

219
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:51,390
But for convenience sake and given, it's kind of hard to move around, you can just kind of continue with sorting yourself as you as you wish.

220
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:56,450
But in these groups, what I'd like you to do is to kind of debate this.

221
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,450
You reflect on the readings, and many of you have already written some about this,

222
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,610
but these were kind of the main questions that I posed to you online.

223
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:11,489
But I'd like to hear you bring some of your reflections into discussion with your classmates.

224
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,200
So why don't you take some time to to talk about these questions in the smaller groups,

225
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,560
and then we'll we'll come back together to hear what you had to say.

226
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,910
I do.

227
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:32,140
I do. I mean, I feel free to mix it up a little bit.

228
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:37,880
Your daughter's talking to the book? I guess.

229
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,010
No argument. I ask again. Yeah.

230
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:47,500
I mean, there's a lot of stuff.

231
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:54,790
I just I don't know. I don't you like.

232
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,970
I want to tell everybody that apologize.

233
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:02,410
Yeah, that's what I meant. I think.

234
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:12,970
Yeah, I think the worst part. Yeah, you probably know more than I do.

235
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:20,400
Yeah. That really bothers me.

236
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:39,670
You know, maybe he learned that not all of us, like your favorite actors and actresses, are just like us.

237
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:44,140
Yeah, I know, but it really wasn't really good.

238
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:50,210
Especially not a good job.

239
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,830
I invite you guys here. You are weird.

240
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:06,880
Yeah. I guess what I'm hearing right now is not as important as I.

241
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:31,280
I thought, you know that know that in 2000 and and nine.

242
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:42,850
Now. How did you decide to play guitar?

243
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:49,660
Yeah, I was like, I was either that or something.

244
00:25:50,200 --> 00:26:00,909
I don't think so. But there's nothing like that.

245
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:06,730
But it's not like, yeah, yeah.

246
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:14,670
I like it more that I have speculated, expect, you know, we don't want to bring it up.

247
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:22,200
I think. I think so.

248
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:37,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

249
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:54,670
But in terms of course, I just I know that I know that they like that.

250
00:26:54,670 --> 00:27:09,880
And, you know, like, I took some time trying to get to a point.

251
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:18,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree with that.

252
00:27:21,560 --> 00:28:06,150
I just sat there and that was when I was like, how to get through it and how it's going to be back in my room because I didn't.

253
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:10,270
The U.S. Capitol Building. Yeah, it seemed to that.

254
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:42,030
But inside your mind in those hammerheads, when you get a little bit more out there and, you know, like the rest of this year, I think you're right.

255
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:52,920
I felt like I said something that's been a nightmare for me.

256
00:28:53,640 --> 00:29:00,790
Don't you ever get there? Yeah. This is like this kind of girl.

257
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:10,049
Very strange event. And she was, like, all in.

258
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:15,480
And they just let it be, like, how you get around.

259
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:37,400
Like, yeah, they're almost like, yes.

260
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:47,400
It's like you don't want the overall you never thought I was the last brass band.

261
00:29:47,550 --> 00:30:02,370
I think that happens. And I was like, I was I imagine how they could never happen.

262
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,130
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I remember that.

263
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:19,560
I'd have to say something like, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

264
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,640
And I don't know that they were right here.

265
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:36,940
I know they don't have any of the rest of this.

266
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:46,170
All right, let's come back together then, you know?

267
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:51,659
So why don't we start maybe considering the first two questions together?

268
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:58,590
Because often whether or not you agree might depend on do you kind of make this argument?

269
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,350
Well, hey, they were just kind of a product of their historical era.

270
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:09,060
So can we kind of, you know, use our modern day conventional wisdom and apply it retroactively?

271
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:14,880
But what were the groups talking about in response to these first two questions?

272
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:34,540
Key points. Remember, we discussed that, look, despite his impact in biomedicine and experimentation in immunology and essential and in that work,

273
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:47,880
we agree that it still didn't outweigh his extracurricular involvement in that eugenics society is like he also wasn't like anti-immigration.

274
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:56,740
He had just like a lot of different figures and a lot of ties that we felt weren't really

275
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:05,380
like reflective of the Michigan Michigan's like value system and that by removing the name,

276
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:19,720
it could potentially like signal like a sense of like atonement in terms of like respecting history and understanding that institutions change.

277
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:25,389
So let's basically see it. Yeah, it sounds like you were supportive for a variety of reasons.

278
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:31,330
I mean, you mentioned the extracurricular, though, although I think he did incorporate some of his thinking into his teaching.

279
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:40,450
So it wasn't only about his involvement with the American Eugenics Society outside of his role at Princeton.

280
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:47,290
But yeah, so I think a lot of people, judging from the responses, agree with your basic points there and here in the class.

281
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:52,150
And again and more broadly, there's not seem to be, even though interestingly,

282
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,380
as we know, like in certain parts of maybe the region of the country or what,

283
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:02,630
you know, historical figure, you're removing the statue over the name of it, really kind of like maybe Haley nearby.

284
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:06,720
It wasn't like a lot of hubbub about this. It seemed like it kind of happened.

285
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:14,200
People accepted and it didn't really generate, you know, huge backlash as some of these other decisions have.

286
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,790
How our other groups building on what Bridget was talking about,

287
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:26,800
any other points you your groups were making and kind of either supporting or questioning this U of M decision?

288
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:35,580
Yeah. Or so on something we've talked about a lot in terms of like why we support the decision is because like anyone even building after a person,

289
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,700
it's like saying, look,

290
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:45,340
you honor them and it kind of this meant to like acknowledging the positive impact that they've made and like make this kind of meant to honor them.

291
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:54,100
So you're kind of supporting their belief system or their accomplishments and like having his hand, as they were saying earlier,

292
00:33:54,130 --> 00:34:00,970
and like eugenics and those like the tobacco industry and saying like smoking doesn't cause cancer.

293
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:05,290
You kind of say like, oh, we support those beliefs as well.

294
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,180
So like it can give the university that space to maintain that name.

295
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:14,770
Yeah. And I thought, yes, sir.

296
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:23,290
I also think that a name change is just a very simple change to make, like it involves changing a few signs on the building, like updating websites.

297
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:28,240
So if it's a name that's standing for things that are disturbing or harmful to some people,

298
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:33,819
it's a pretty easy change to make to benefit those people who see it.

299
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:40,750
It's maybe some low hanging fruit here, but dot over here that it still comes up on our web searches.

300
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:46,810
Yeah. If you type CC little building in on Google Maps, it takes you to it doesn't call it that, but it takes you to the building.

301
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:54,040
Okay. So that's probably just like a relic of like if you didn't know the name had changed, like, you would still want to know where you were going.

302
00:34:54,070 --> 00:35:00,850
Yeah. Do they some of you wrote about, you know, the report talked about, oh well maybe we should have a plaque there.

303
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:04,720
Does anybody know if there is really a plaque on site,

304
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:10,210
even though the name has been stripped to maybe kind of have some discussion of this controversy?

305
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:17,800
I don't think there is. For those of you who don't know much about geography, I have a terrible sense of direction, so I'm probably one of them.

306
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,430
It's the buildings. It's right near the main bus stop.

307
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:26,710
Right. It's kind of right off of not far from this this building here.

308
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:32,500
Yeah. Right. And a question kind of a follow up to this is like.

309
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,330
Because I watched the documentary. I had never heard about any of this.

310
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:43,050
Obviously, we have the Kellogg Ice Center, which is named after W.K. Kellogg, who is also in this.

311
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:49,230
Now, obviously, that one was paid for by the Kellogg Company, but it still has the name.

312
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:56,070
Right. So if you're going to have the conversation about this, I feel like you also have to have the follow up conversation about that one as well.

313
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:01,469
But I don't know the I don't know if there ever was that point raised.

314
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:05,490
And they certainly didn't talk about it in their article, which I thought was really curious.

315
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:11,550
Yeah, well, I think and I mentioned kind of Victor von, you know, there's others.

316
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:17,620
So I think you raise an excellent point like and some critics say, well, you know, where does the slippery slope end?

317
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:21,779
We could are we going to end up like having none of our buildings named?

318
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:30,269
But I think you're raising an excellent point that to be consistent, maybe we do need to revisit some of these other examples and try to think,

319
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:34,169
well, what's the criteria by which you would decide in this case to not name it?

320
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:38,100
But I think more cynically you would say political power.

321
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,659
Everybody talks a lot.

322
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:48,750
And so the Kellogg family is such a luminary family in the state of Michigan that maybe there's less political will to want to take that on.

323
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:53,250
But what are what are others thoughts on this idea of should we be revisiting

324
00:36:53,250 --> 00:37:00,390
other honorifics here within the U of M beyond just the Masisi little building?

325
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:06,330
You know, just wonder if it's because like in the paper,

326
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:14,170
they can talk about how he didn't really have much of a legacy at U of M and it's a building that he didn't have much involvement in.

327
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:21,540
I think it's like the geology building and the geologists were like, No, don't name our building after him.

328
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:27,850
So like, I don't know, maybe the other people have more of an involvement in, like, the actual building they're named after.

329
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:36,389
Mm hmm. And that might continue. So it might be to consider a renaming might ruffle more feathers in terms of the

330
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:42,780
descendants who might still be engaged with the community and certainly plausible.

331
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:50,670
Other thoughts here again on maybe this starts to lead into, well, what else should we be doing?

332
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:55,170
I think your point is well taken care that this is a relatively easy change to make.

333
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:03,089
To my mind, a relatively uncontroversial decision given both the modest historical achievements and

334
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:09,990
the really concerning baggage with the eugenics and the anti or the pro tobacco piece.

335
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:17,040
But what other options do you think are important for the U of M to consider or even broader groups?

336
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:23,370
Because we're certainly talking about a lot of different ways in which injustices were perpetrated in the name of eugenics.

337
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:32,610
Morgan I think beyond the basic need for sanction protocol, for naming of buildings,

338
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:37,740
so that when asked for a cause or a reason, they have a justification for that.

339
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:50,580
There also needs to be. A reckoning with how well we can put that name in its historical context.

340
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:57,720
I think while that that name is harmful now and it was also harmful then in the paper,

341
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:08,300
they talked a lot about like how people might not have come to realize if they did, that could have caused a student to feel unsafe on this campus.

342
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:12,810
And that's worth noting, as if that is historical context.

343
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:19,380
And that's true now as well and important to recognize.

344
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:29,040
Mm. Yeah. Any thoughts then though on so you're talking about like having kind of procedural justice around moving forward with

345
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:38,819
naming of other sites and also like that names are meaningful and that even though people might not know who that is,

346
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:48,620
it's not a justification to yeah. Willy nilly naming things and naming buildings after people that are going to make other students feel unsafe.

347
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:55,890
Other thoughts here on. And yeah.

348
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:02,290
Bridget And we thought about providing like a name and financial aid mechanisms

349
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:09,219
in place for like students who identify in groups that were most impacted by the

350
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:15,940
eugenics movement and that sort of history and sort of like sort of shifting funds

351
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:24,850
from certain areas to be some sort of for like reparations or something like that.

352
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:33,260
And I know that that can be kind of like a radical idea in some eyes, but that's what, you know.

353
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:39,670
Yeah, I think it's become less radical in recent years and we'll talk certainly about it in just a few minutes

354
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:46,090
about some of these state programs that have been built around reparations for direct victims of eugenics.

355
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:52,419
But it sounds like you're thinking also more broadly about kind of the pipeline of scientists in a field.

356
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:59,020
And can we have, you know, maybe some support for groups who've been historically disadvantaged?

357
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:10,850
Yeah. Sorry. Similarly, we were talking about how much manpower and time and energy went into writing this 20 page supplement.

358
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,150
Mm hmm. And I think the writers were right.

359
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:22,490
Is that true? The ones I know, I don't know all the authors, but certainly I think I mentioned Martin Koenig and Alex Stern are the historians.

360
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:34,909
Yeah. So. And how things like white supremacy and weathering could prevent a student of color from

361
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:41,870
participating in a discussion like this just because of how much it requires from someone.

362
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:49,490
Mm hmm. And also, it took, like, two years for them to from writing to, like, getting the building changed.

363
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:59,330
Changed. And that seems like such a small thing to me that doing something like this, like providing financial support,

364
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:11,460
feels so much farther away because of this remedial change, taking up so much time and space and effort and energy on the part of so many people.

365
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:17,930
She sounds like you're questioning if it took this much time, this much labor to enact,

366
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:22,309
what in your mind maybe could have been a relatively simple decision and change?

367
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:26,570
What is what is it going to take to make more meaningful or substantive change?

368
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:36,590
Fair question. Yeah. I think the university, by laying out this process, was trying to have something that they could point to,

369
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:43,220
that it's not going to be kind of arbitrary random decisions like subject to the whims of the day.

370
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:48,740
But I think at the end of the day, you also have to look at your points about, you know,

371
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:56,840
how high is the bar going to be and does that really mean that it's going to be very infrequently pursued as a result?

372
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,740
Other thoughts here.

373
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:09,670
Any other based on these questions, any other interesting tidbits come out of your groups you think might be worth sharing with everyone?

374
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:20,230
All right. Well. I think you hit a lot of these.

375
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,680
So I'm just kind of summarizing.

376
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:29,149
Again, a lot of this comes from the the report, some of the kind of pro and con views I think you've hit on most of these.

377
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:33,440
We haven't talked a lot about the reasons to retain it,

378
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:42,320
but these are some of the reasons on this side where maybe proponents of keeping it might say that they should.

379
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,370
Although interestingly, I think somebody made this point in your your writing that even maybe some of

380
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:50,569
these things we see as pros are still consistent with the eugenics mindset.

381
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:55,490
And we'll talk about kind of birth control as one example of of that.

382
00:43:55,790 --> 00:44:03,200
Yeah. Andrew, I mean, I take issue very much with the it's not fair to judge him based on the present day historical context.

383
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:10,040
As we saw in the documentary, there were people at the time who were like, this is not the right thing to be doing.

384
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,760
And eventually, you know, we're glad that those people won out.

385
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:21,620
But I would say we can pretty much all equivalently agree that like we judge the Nazis on what they did and we don't have any we don't say,

386
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:27,949
well, we can't judge the Nazis on what they did. So why should why should we even have that argument to try and defend him?

387
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:32,780
It's like, oh, he was just doing what everybody else did. I think that's a very valid criticism.

388
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:38,030
Mm. No, I think I think you're honest.

389
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:42,700
And I'm not advocating it by myself. I think that you're advocating point.

390
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,920
I just think it's a completely fallacious, ridiculous argument to even make.

391
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:56,249
Yeah, I think well, I think you're making a good point in that you're saying that it's not like nobody was decrying this,

392
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:00,360
but I think even more he had ample opportunity.

393
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,440
It wasn't like he died in 1935, but we never know what he thought.

394
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,600
He you know, he kept active in the scientific world for decades after.

395
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:14,460
And so he had multiple opportunities to kind of disavow his views.

396
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,250
And I think that fact that he never did, I think is is particularly bad.

397
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:24,630
I mean, that's what they were. But I felt like one of the most interesting pieces of the whole documentary was I think it was Goddard.

398
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:28,710
Goddard, yeah. He eventually changed his mind.

399
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,110
He was one of the founders of the American movement,

400
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:37,019
and he was so convinced by the critique to their argument that he actually completely changed his mind on it.

401
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:45,060
And I think that's there's certainly some level of redemption in that in being willing to acknowledge that you were making a mistake.

402
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:50,520
Mm hmm. Yeah. And again, maybe he would still say it's worth renaming the building,

403
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:59,489
but at least there would be some value in someone kind of admitting wrongdoing, trying to make some kind of amends.

404
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:05,460
And it seemed like there was a stubborn clinging to some of these troubling views.

405
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,790
Are there other reactions again?

406
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:19,270
These are and again, it's not hard to imagine how you hear these arguments in these broader debates that we seem to be having a lot more these days,

407
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:25,280
whether it's on, should we take down this statue of some, you know, civil war figure or not?

408
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,090
And so I think even though we're talking specifically about sick little,

409
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:34,900
I think hopefully it's helping you think critically about some of these broader debates and they're certainly happening at other universities.

410
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:42,780
So Cal Tech, they made the decision to remove the names of several leaders at their campus.

411
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:50,559
I think it was a more challenging case for them because, you know, they had the I think I don't know much about the history of Cal Tech,

412
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:59,420
but I think this Robert Millikan had a more prominent historical record than CC Little in terms of the development of that university.

413
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,509
And so I think it was a more controversial decision, but for some of the same reasons that you all are bringing up,

414
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:12,820
I think they ultimately decided to remove the names of Milliken and others on major buildings on the Caltech campus.

415
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:20,050
So I think these these debates are happening at multiple universities across the country.

416
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:26,280
All right, let's let's keep going here. Let's keep going with this eugenics theme.

417
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:34,889
But again, expand it from U of M to talk about more broadly what happened in the U.S. And when I mention eugenics, I mean,

418
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:45,930
these are some of the really difficult aspects that eugenics thinking has informed and some of the harms that have occurred.

419
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:55,560
So I'm going to be talking about, you know, some of these really difficult areas where we've seen these kinds of harms occur.

420
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:04,940
And I think it's hard not to start with the Buck versus Bell case when we're talking about forced sterilizations.

421
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:09,990
How many of you before this class had heard of this case?

422
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:23,959
So maybe about half of you. So it's kind of this classic disturbing case where you saw Carrie Buck was this adolescent who was

423
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:30,470
in kind of a state run institution called the Virginia Colony for Epileptics and Feeble Minded.

424
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:35,360
And so she was sterilized against her will.

425
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:41,930
And again, the thinking at the time was, are we really we don't want to have these, quote unquote,

426
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:47,780
feebleminded or undesirable people procreating because that's just going to create a drag on society.

427
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:56,479
We're going to have to care for them in institutions. So in the name of prevention, let's just make sure that they can't give birth.

428
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:02,810
And, you know, today that sounds like a horrible violation of civil rights and autonomy.

429
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:11,200
But at the time, not only was it done, but it was the highest court in the land is upholding the constitutionality of it.

430
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:15,680
So I'm an almost unanimous vote in the Supreme Court in 1927.

431
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,850
To say what the state did in this case was was fine.

432
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:30,230
And they cited this precedent of this 1905 Jacobson versus the state of Massachusetts case as anybody know what that case is about?

433
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:41,560
Arguably the most important public health law decision of all time this year in trivia 90 year.

434
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:52,559
So in that case, Jacobson was this resident of the state of Massachusetts who was being asked to be vaccinated against smallpox.

435
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,540
There was a smallpox outbreak at the time, and so he was resisting.

436
00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:03,480
It sounds kind of familiar in our COVID era. He's like, you can't tell me what to do or not do with regards to vaccination.

437
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,780
And so this went all the way up to the Supreme Court.

438
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:17,069
And the Supreme Court said, well, actually, the benefit to the public is so great to avoid the spread of this terrible fatal disease.

439
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:24,270
We actually think it's justified to compel Jacobson to be vaccinated against smallpox.

440
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:27,630
And so we're giving the state the power to force this.

441
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:32,520
So in some ways, the court was saying, well, it's kind of the same here.

442
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:40,440
Even though Carrie Buck doesn't want this, it's for the good of society that her kind of quote unquote, you know, are not reproducing.

443
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:46,080
And so the public benefit outweighs her private rights and interests.

444
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:52,170
And here's kind of a quote from the Chief Justice Holmes of the Supreme Court who wrote the majority opinion.

445
00:50:52,890 --> 00:51:06,360
And it's yeah, it's pretty, pretty awful language to read today, because you can see the real kind of moral judgment that kind of suffuses this.

446
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:14,819
And I think the kicker is this kind of last line of this become infamous, you know, three generation of imbeciles are enough.

447
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:19,750
So that's, you know, chief justice of the Supreme Court saying this is why we think this is a good thing.

448
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:26,370
So really, really disturbing. But again, the here's where there's the nod to that Jacobson case.

449
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:32,440
The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the fallopian tube.

450
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:38,580
So this is kind of direct appeal to a Supreme Court precedent case around prevention.

451
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:44,880
So so that's, you know, the most famous example of forced sterilization.

452
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,250
But of course, that was in the twenties.

453
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:55,770
But sadly, we saw many states having these kind of programs that went in to, you know, several decades beyond that.

454
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:59,580
So North Carolina is one example of this.

455
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:04,709
They had several hundred sterilizations into the 1970s.

456
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:13,500
And as you might suspect, sadly, these are disproportionately borne by minority populations,

457
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:18,670
populations that have lower scores on the more positive side.

458
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:21,990
I don't think in the interest of time, I don't I probably won't show this.

459
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:26,730
But if you're interested, there was a CNN news story on North Carolina's debate.

460
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:32,940
They ended up being the first state to offer reparations to victims.

461
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:43,530
So they ended up creating a pool of $10 million and offered up to $50,000 to living victims of this this program.

462
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:47,610
So that's one state that's kind of reckoned with this.

463
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:56,550
Another was Virginia. They ended up a year later creating a smaller pool of money, but then at least putting some towards reparations.

464
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:01,200
California had thousands of cases into the 1970s.

465
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:07,560
They initially had a governor apology in 2003, but it really took it actually.

466
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:11,610
Here's back to Alex Stern, who I mentioned earlier, the historian here at U of M.

467
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,819
She and some of our colleagues here, you know,

468
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:23,760
they really did some great historical digging and were able to find you looking at kind of state records that,

469
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:29,580
hey, even though it was decades ago, we still have hundreds of survivors who are out there.

470
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:36,120
And so they were able to make the case that we have enough folks who are living victims,

471
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,890
that it might make sense to think about some kind of reparations payment program.

472
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:51,270
And so just a couple of years ago, they passed legislation to create this fund to compensate victims to $25,000 each.

473
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:56,810
So on one hand. You could argue maybe some progress in the name of justice.

474
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:00,230
On the other hand, it's decades after the fact.

475
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:06,080
These are relatively modest funds. And Morgan made it to your point earlier about just the labor involved to do this.

476
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:14,150
It was a years long process and a lot of effort to be able to get these states to this point.

477
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:26,090
But any any questions or comments on this idea of kind of financial reparations for victims and some of the the pros and cons of doing this?

478
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:42,650
CROWLEY One thing I thought of was like, is there really any amount of money that can justify or ease the anguish of victims and their families?

479
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:48,959
And if. People who are not them say that, oh, it is.

480
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,760
They just try to pay them off every time.

481
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:58,350
Is that going to become a common rule for, oh, we did something questionable, but we have enough money to pay off some people anyway,

482
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:02,490
so let's just continue doing questionable things as long as we have the funds to make it better.

483
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,670
Yeah, that's a great, great question.

484
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:15,120
I think a lot of even people who are proponents of reparations, I think would argue this is not sufficient to really kind of make things right.

485
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:21,250
But it's that I guess they would argue maybe some symbolic gesture in, you know,

486
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:28,650
in the name of justice that might still be useful even if we're not saying we've kind of justice is completely done here.

487
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:36,450
But I hadn't really thought about the angle, though. Are we like incentivizing people to continue to to act?

488
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:41,940
You know, I think about that more in kind of maybe like big corporations that might you know,

489
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:49,530
it's like if they paid whatever fines for for wrongdoing because it's like their financial profit might still outweigh you only pay if you get caught.

490
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:57,250
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I just think about are some of these people like fully or meaningfully consenting.

491
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:03,000
They may have more than like normal cognitive function.

492
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:06,629
Yeah. The just been like, oh, this is good.

493
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:16,620
And yeah, I think that's what often did happen was that a lot of the victims were in institutions,

494
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:20,399
you know, geared for people with intellectual disabilities.

495
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:29,520
And so they were a more vulnerable population to begin with, maybe more easily coerced or more compliant with authority kind of doing.

496
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:38,010
And then maybe they if we had a news clip, kind of shows one example of this of a person who kind of didn't really realize what was happening.

497
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:42,299
And she was kind of going along with the procedure, the vasectomy procedure.

498
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:46,740
And then one later realized, wow, I was kind of duped into this.

499
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:55,680
But yeah, these issues of kind of cognitive capacity and informed consent I think are challenging to contend with.

500
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:01,890
Are there other thoughts on this issue of reparations?

501
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:12,770
So shifting gears from forced sterilization to talk about birth control, you know,

502
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:17,969
there have been historically some examples of birth control programs that,

503
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:23,370
again, from our current perspective, we might feel like, oh, this is kind of progressive.

504
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:27,810
This is enhancing women autonomy and other people who are pregnant.

505
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:36,330
You know, Planned Parenthood is kind of an example here. But Margaret Sanger, you know, kind of a luminary figure in founding Planned Parenthood,

506
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:43,889
I think she is on record as having some views on eugenics that are kind of questionable from today's standpoint.

507
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:54,840
And we and more recently, we've seen examples of there was an effort to try to promote the use of nor plant this birth control method in the 1990s.

508
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:58,440
But again, it was earmarked more towards kind of poor black women.

509
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:05,410
And so the the African-American scholar Dorothy Roberts has kind of written a lot on this issue of, you know,

510
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:16,200
there's been a lot of different ways in which there have been concerns about kind of the reproductive decisions of kind of minority groups.

511
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:24,660
And so, again, even historical figures who those on the progressive left often kind of championed Planned Parenthood.

512
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:30,540
And I think the political right is then used some of these historical examples to try to kind of as a wedge issue,

513
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:34,559
to try to, you know, get people to question Planned Parenthood.

514
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:40,110
So a lot of controversy from that standpoint, from birth control.

515
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:47,189
We can talk about immigration control because, again, some of these eugenics theories are used to kind of guide public policy.

516
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:51,450
We we don't want certain types of people coming across our borders.

517
00:58:51,450 --> 00:59:01,140
This is the kind of ugly mindset we see. And we really saw this in the 1920s where there were very explicit kind of quotas by countries of origin,

518
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:04,920
again, informed by these eugenicist theories that said that,

519
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:13,559
you know, certain groups are more likely to be violent or or intellectually defective or otherwise and of course, characters.

520
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:17,700
So we want to kind of, you know, promote these groups, but keep these others out.

521
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:21,900
And of course, it's not hard to see that line of thinking in today's debates as well.

522
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:27,810
But the 1920s legislation was very different than what we saw passed in the 1960s,

523
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:31,500
where the priorities were not so much on, well, what country are you coming from?

524
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:35,180
But thinking about what skills might you bring to the U.S.?

525
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:42,420
Or could we have family reunification through through immigration with those who are already here?

526
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:48,000
Another aspect where eugenics has come up, too, is around marriage laws.

527
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:59,160
And so it took until the 1940s for California to become the first state to declare interracial marriage laws unconstitutional.

528
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:08,640
And back to the Supreme Court. It took to the 1960s for the Supreme Court to rule that these kinds of laws were unconstitutional.

529
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:14,849
Again, talking about Supreme Court precedents, the more recent Supreme Court decision upholding same sex marriage,

530
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:18,780
you know, directly cited this 1967 Loving versus Virginia case.

531
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:24,860
Loving is actually the last name of the couple that that was the focus of the suit.

532
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:33,329
So even though we've seen, you know, progress legally, sometimes if you're looking for if you're like me, I was I was born not long after this.

533
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:37,620
So it's not that long ago where this wasn't even the law of the land.

534
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:43,170
If you take the real big, big picture. Yeah.

535
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:48,479
So any questions or comments on any of the I know these are kind of difficult topics to to wrestle with.

536
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:54,030
And but again, I think when we think of eugenics, I want you to be thinking beyond just,

537
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:58,560
you know, a lot of people's minds goes to these issues of of kind of the Nazis.

538
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:02,130
But obviously, I think it can play out in a lot of different ways.

539
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:11,280
Let's talk a little bit more about more recent history moving beyond just eugenics.

540
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:19,070
So I think the Markle Peace talks about, you know, different developments in the field.

541
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:22,580
So it talked about, you know, kind of sickle cell screening being launched.

542
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:33,770
It talked about Tay-Sachs screenings. And so I think what that piece I think highlighted was really the importance of attending to some of these

543
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,990
kind of social and religious issues and like how different groups are going to be differently impacted.

544
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:47,120
And you saw these programs be rolled out in very different ways with very different levels of success and uptake.

545
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:53,030
And so the idea of kind of thinking about the importance of community partnership and planning.

546
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:58,650
I think the piece also highlighted the importance of kind of education at multiple levels.

547
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:06,380
So because even among professionals, you were seeing people misconstrue things like, you know, sickle cell.

548
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:14,209
They were kind of conflating sickle cell trait and sickle cell disease in a way that had really harmful effects where you had, you know,

549
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:23,270
like black men in the like being denied entrance to the Air Force because the assumption was they wouldn't be able to kind of handle the rigors.

550
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:29,030
But that might've been the case for sickle cell disease, but not necessarily sickle cell trait.

551
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,690
So again, I think that was an important historical theme.

552
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:36,680
And of course, across a lot of these, whenever we're talking about prenatal testing,

553
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:45,560
really what's going on historically in terms of the politics of abortion of the day really I think is important to keep in mind.

554
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:53,549
Any I'm kind of going quickly through the Markelle piece, but any other reactions folks had from reading that again,

555
01:02:53,550 --> 01:03:00,930
what he was talking about, kind of the history of sickle cell screening, the history of kind of Tay-Sachs screening.

556
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:12,270
And that brings us to the later nineties. And I have already alluded to the Jesse Gelsinger case.

557
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:17,070
So you had a separate article just on that case because it was such a notable one.

558
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:19,290
From a research ethics perspective,

559
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:26,460
and I think it was alluded to remember in the the code documentary that interviewed the Penn researcher who was involved in this case.

560
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:31,110
So this was this really unfortunate case where this gene therapy was being tested out.

561
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:40,770
Jesse Gelsinger was this 18 year old patient who agreed to be part of this study of an experimental therapy and then died as a direct result of the,

562
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:44,370
you know, the side effects of the the the therapy.

563
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:53,729
And I think this really, as I think the piece talked about in the film, talked about really put the brakes on gene therapy research writ large.

564
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:59,459
And so we saw a lot of increased regulation because of the concerns that were raised.

565
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:05,940
And what did you see as the most important ethical concerns from this case that stuck out to you?

566
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:16,349
What? Yeah, Alex, I think I mean, they just didn't explain the full risks they had already, you know, kind of seeing the risks in previous studies.

567
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:23,550
And there had already been reactions to the vector before and did not include the potential health risks and the concern,

568
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:29,610
like there was no mention of potential death and they had no idea what they were signing on for.

569
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:36,950
So it sounds like you're thinking that informed consent was a real problem here because

570
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:42,170
people weren't getting the best available information about the risks of the study.

571
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:49,870
Yeah. He had also mentioned that Jesse shouldn't have even been included in the study

572
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:56,320
because his levels were too low or something when they when he went to get the shot.

573
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:59,440
So they shouldn't have even given it to him, but they ignored it.

574
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:10,090
So and it had also said that they were supposed to like make more stringent exclusion criteria according to the IRP.

575
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:13,240
That's what they told them to do, what they did, and they ignored that as well.

576
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:22,270
So that was a big one too. So yeah, so also related to this principle of risk benefit ratio,

577
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:27,740
but moving beyond just the informed consent, you're saying like being around the decision about eligibility.

578
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,750
I mean, know, they kind of just blatantly didn't follow protocol.

579
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,120
So why do you think that would be the case? Why would researchers be tempted to do that?

580
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:42,090
My guess would be for money much the success of their study.

581
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:49,950
They wanted to include him in it. They thought he was a good candidate, so they ignored the warning signs.

582
01:05:52,250 --> 01:06:01,250
Yeah. Seems like a good guess. The Sea Shepherd, also just changing the protocol and not informing the hierarchy.

583
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:12,830
And just once you establish a protocol, don't you hear from the senators that you do that not everyone results according to their reasonable side?

584
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:20,809
Yeah. And so there was certainly. So it's not like there weren't regulations in place to try to govern this.

585
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:31,060
But if you're not being upfront with the IRB, who is the governance body, then it kind of sadly, that's that's relatively easy to do.

586
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:39,500
I think a lot of our regulatory system around research relies kind of on kind of good faith reporting from from scientists.

587
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:51,870
And so if if there is kind of deliberate suppression of relevant information, that's not that hard to get away with and certain conflicts of interest.

588
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:59,420
Yeah. And there was, that was not so much of a prevalent idea back then.

589
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:07,130
So even if they considered it, it wasn't something that was fully explained to the extent that someone would reasonably understand.

590
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:11,829
So yeah, financial conflicts of interest were certainly key here.

591
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:18,819
How when you say explain what are what are ways in which things could or should have been explained differently?

592
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:23,129
So do you think Jesse Singer's family should have been explained something?

593
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:29,170
Which should it have been? The ISB should have been notified, or how could these conflicts have been better managed?

594
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:38,290
Do you think that the start of a very big sentence and because that wasn't a very common.

595
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:49,340
Conflict in a scientific work that this just wasn't something that people were known to look for or what it meant.

596
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:56,120
So I think on all levels it should have been more expressly stated.

597
01:07:56,270 --> 01:08:01,069
Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of different ways to manage financial conflicts that we have in place now.

598
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:03,200
So it really all starts with disclosure.

599
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:13,100
I mean, there needs to be some upfront disclosure both to ideally to the participant who's weighing whether to take part and to the regulatory bodies.

600
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:18,829
And then sometimes when the disclosure occurs, the regulatory body ideally would say,

601
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:25,880
hey, we need maybe you can't be the pi of this study, maybe you need to find some other,

602
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:32,120
you know, team that's less financially conflicted, that's actually on the front lines,

603
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:38,120
kind of making the decisions about eligibility criteria or or whatnot.

604
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:44,179
And so there's different remedies, you know, for once a conflict becomes apparent.

605
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:51,020
And I think Morgan's points are good ones in that. Part of this had to do with this was still relatively early on.

606
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:53,390
So we had maybe developed these kind of systems.

607
01:08:53,870 --> 01:09:00,320
But again, it also, I think comes back to the researchers themselves were maybe not as forthcoming as they might have been because again,

608
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:07,310
back to these fears of, well, maybe they fear well, we kind of fully divulge, then people aren't going to want to take part if we don't get data.

609
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:11,670
We're kind of stuck. And they were, you know, very excited.

610
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:16,690
I think they really saw this promise. I think they they felt like they were helping patients.

611
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:23,900
I don't think it was only about the money. But on the other hand, I think they had some blind spots because of these financial conflicts.

612
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:29,550
Are there other thoughts on this case?

613
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:38,060
So I think you you've all hit on on all the main the three main points I wanted to to talk about.

614
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:46,299
Well, this this session is always kind of a bummer. We're talking about some really difficult situations.

615
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:49,690
We're talking about some really horrible missteps.

616
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:54,520
And so maybe we can try to end on a slightly brighter note here.

617
01:09:55,060 --> 01:10:02,770
What ways do you think we either as researchers or public health or the genetics community,

618
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:10,270
what ways have we made some progress and learning from this really troubled history that we've been talking about?

619
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:20,260
Even if you don't think were maybe as far as we should be, what are some signs of the decay?

620
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:25,000
I mean, just the fact that we are acknowledging this past and we are calling it out.

621
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:30,510
I think there's still ways in which we need to continue to do so and have a continuing

622
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:36,940
indication of why what has happened in the past is going to allow you to move forward from it.

623
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:42,280
But I think in itself, we are more willing to acknowledge it in itself.

624
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:50,140
So you think there's a more openness in terms of dialog and communication where like what context are you seeing?

625
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:52,090
I think that this is a little building.

626
01:10:52,090 --> 01:11:01,540
For instance, I think there was like an acknowledgment that, yes, this was a person that did champion these efforts and was part of this.

627
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:06,820
And we don't condone that. We don't want to be associated with those beliefs.

628
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:11,080
And so I think the fact that there's a willingness to initiate that dialog

629
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:16,570
initiated those conversations to try to figure out what can be done forward.

630
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:19,740
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Yeah.

631
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:26,750
I also think that we may just order something like designing or clinical trials are like the genome project.

632
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:34,960
The more transparent, an informed consent form that is like a different, like, process of like, if any of those clinical trials.

633
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:40,389
And I think, like, we learned at some point in our lives things that we did wrong.

634
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:48,490
And we, we're trying to look up and talk through with all of us and like the the efforts they made to be more transparent and be more inclusive.

635
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:53,080
And I think that that that's a project compared to their previous examples.

636
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:55,840
So some of these research ethics violations we've been talking about,

637
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:03,760
you feel like there's been improvement in terms of both regulation and just the everyday practices of how research is conducted.

638
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:15,400
Katie. I do think that we have made some steps to protect more vulnerable populations and definitely not to the extent,

639
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:23,950
you know, in every case that we should. But I think like people of color, children and pregnant women, that kind of thing, I think we do.

640
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:31,750
I think those populations are more regulated in studies, and I think there are a lot more protections for those people.

641
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:39,479
MARTIN Yeah, I was just going to say the protections we have policies and laws and organizations

642
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:43,640
now that protect against this sort of this is absolutely horrendous.

643
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:49,259
Yeah. Yeah. Here you U of m we have a whole office for human research protection.

644
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:53,380
So beyond I mean, people just we just think of the IRB, but you have, you know,

645
01:12:53,430 --> 01:13:00,060
kind of multiple layers now built in where you studies might be that were already IAB approved, might still be audited.

646
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:04,980
You know, there's kind of continuing review. There's a lot of higher risk research.

647
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:08,850
Usually you have mandated data and safety monitoring boards now.

648
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:15,210
So I think I think this idea of kind of protection against research harms, there's certainly been some good progress.

649
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:23,250
Other thoughts here. I'm learning from this troubled history.

650
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:31,900
Some folks sadly have not really, to my knowledge, learned a lot.

651
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:38,549
When you think about James Watson, Nobel laureate, you know, Watson and Crick DNA, discovery,

652
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:45,180
fame, he's still recently making really troubling remarks about genetics and race.

653
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:51,040
And so has really kind of become an outcast in the community despite all of his achievements.

654
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:56,130
So he's he's somebody who I would say has not learned as much as he should from history.

655
01:13:56,790 --> 01:14:00,360
But yeah, I mentioned last time, you know, the all of us projects that are just mentioned again.

656
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:05,960
So I think I talked a little bit. MORGAN In response to your question about, you know, some some of the details here,

657
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:13,170
so they're kind of up front at the design phase, really building in attention to outreach and community engagement.

658
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:20,480
And so partnering with nonacademic groups who who are who have ties to the communities they've been interested.

659
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:24,959
So you can see some of the examples of both the populations they're trying to do outreach

660
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:30,780
to and the community partners that they contracted with and not just contracted with,

661
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:37,500
but also really given significant funds to help resource these organizations as opposed to just taking,

662
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:43,200
you know, just assuming on an altruistic basis that these groups are going to going to be helpful.

663
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:50,880
I think these issues of transparency and informed consent are greater in this project than than prior ones.

664
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:57,450
And we talked a little bit last time, too, about maybe doing more to give people direct benefits from research participation,

665
01:14:57,750 --> 01:15:04,200
not just saying, hey, you're benefiting science, or maybe one day will improve treatment because of your help.

666
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:08,099
But no, actually, we want to be able to give back to you, you know,

667
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:16,260
in the in the course of your study participation through giving you these results that may be of use to you or your family members.

668
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:24,180
And then here closer to home, this issue of kind of naming things rather than naming buildings after seeking little just this past year,

669
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:33,629
even though it's not a genetics example, we saw our community room renamed and this was interesting to watch because this was a process

670
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:39,720
that was really kind of a student initiated one where any of you involved with with this movement?

671
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:45,120
I think it was the the facade group public health students of African descent was one of the leading groups.

672
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:53,129
Does anybody know about Dr. Cornely here and who he was, or do you know what room I'm even talking about?

673
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:59,070
It's where I call it that, this great organ. And so I'm like I'm like the organ room is what I used to call it, but now it's this kind of,

674
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:03,240
you know, big gathering group as we come into the main atrium and each one.

675
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,720
But, you know, it's just last year that they had this kind of dedication,

676
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:14,040
but really a remarkable man and a michigan alum both I think under I think he had some undergrad time here.

677
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,090
But then he was the first black person to get a Ph.D. in public health.

678
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:25,530
And it was from the University of Michigan. And he was the first black person to be the president of the American Public Health Association.

679
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:34,259
Those are just a few of his distinctions. But, you know, given his ties to the university, it was kind of nice to see that, hey,

680
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:40,889
here's a name that we can get behind as opposed to have to worry about, you know, renaming, you know, in a decade or so.

681
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:47,280
So, again, symbolic and we could argue are we need to do more than just kind of symbolic gestures,

682
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:56,040
but hopefully that leaving you on a little bit more of an upbeat note than some of the and depressing topics we've been talking about today.

683
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:05,430
Well, speaking of kind of the importance of race and civil rights, I wish you a good MLK holidays.

684
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:10,259
We don't have class on Monday, but we will come back next Wednesday.

685
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:15,110
And so we'll be talking about genetic testing in general.

686
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:25,920
And this NOVA documentary, I'll have you view some of this is going to be kind of basic knowledge that a lot of you may have,

687
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:33,720
but I want you to view it not just for educating yourselves, but also as an example of public education about genetics.

688
01:17:34,170 --> 01:17:42,120
So be thinking about it not just from the content, but also critically like what are the pros and cons of this as a public education tool?

689
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:46,980
Because, again, this NOVA series has a relatively large viewership.

690
01:17:48,450 --> 01:18:06,690
All right. Well, that's all for today. We'll see you next time you want to hear from me and my parents.

691
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:13,010
Yeah. Okay.

692
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:17,570
I really. Am.

693
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:25,580
He does need some more natural gas.

694
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:31,669
Yes, I do. Oh, yeah.

695
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:34,670
Oh. Are you getting out of here?

696
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:43,610
Okay. Here. I have a great idea.

697
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:50,270
I want, you know, something? You know?

698
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:55,770
Yeah. Okay. Right.

699
01:18:57,230 --> 01:19:03,230
I don't know if this is how you sounded. Really know anything about it.

700
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:08,959
I think you can say.

701
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,890
I have no idea how I feel.

702
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:18,200
I don't know if. I don't know.

703
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

704
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:36,260
I want to say I'm glad you came back and finish.

705
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:42,290
Oh. Yeah, but that's all right. I wish I had a coffee dispensary.

706
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:47,360
I mean, I already had. I have to.

707
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:57,730
Yeah, I'm going on that.

708
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:08,760
Yeah. Yeah. So, like, I don't need to go to, like, yeah, I love you, and we're really to.

709
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:13,640
I love the dress. Yeah, I feel that soon.

710
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:16,850
And I know that it's something.

711
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:23,450
Yeah. So. Yeah. Yeah, I was.

712
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:27,690
Yeah. I think part of it is maybe like guys that were sanctions in place.

713
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:36,170
If you that I thought you were going to genocide in the act government regulation

714
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:41,000
the educational facilities for people like Wolf that you can't cross.

715
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:52,880
So if there was nothing to talk about you know, that's one thing I think you and I was at that time.

716
01:20:53,370 --> 01:21:05,540
Yeah. Yeah. I see loophole like get around questions and these areas where we don't know the experience.

717
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:13,550
They're like, they're on this thing. Like, John Kerry didn't make that connection between those two cases.

718
01:21:14,090 --> 01:21:30,400
Like, that's not the point. You know, like this, like you said, there are a lot of other like when you like your general.

719
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:36,050
Oh, I know. That's my favorite sport.

720
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:56,680
Yeah, I mean, I don't really know because of course the first season that we can just see that.

721
01:21:56,690 --> 01:21:57,830
How many. Very high.
