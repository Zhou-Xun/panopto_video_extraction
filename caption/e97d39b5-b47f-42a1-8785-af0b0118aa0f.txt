1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:13,320
We have a couple of students who do not tense or at least were also facilitators toward reviewing the class.

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:25,050
And I think most of you have everyone we have during the students aware come to the class.

3
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:34,100
And so what I would like to do today, I'm sure this is a yeah.

4
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,450
Today we have two very important things to talk to discuss.

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,520
The first one is facts and immunology.

6
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:58,400
Many of you indicate the limits and what you would like to learn most through this course.

7
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:15,150
Is that how vaccine works? And we will have to allow individual facts and example to talk about the different mechanisms or facts, you know,

8
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:27,020
based on which perhaps and we're able to take this to lectures where it provides a general discourse about what we will do,

9
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:43,220
what's the basis for vaccine development or design, and then the different type of side effects we want to achieve by giving vaccine to population.

10
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,129
You what's the situation?

11
00:01:46,130 --> 00:02:07,760
What's effective is so I know everyone, every one in this course has taken some pacifist theology class where immunology has been discussed today.

12
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:20,900
The vaccine immunology. It would it would not be a simple repeat patient of what you have to learn the discourse of details in your previous novel,

13
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,010
because instead we were put in the context of vaccine people.

14
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:35,050
What are the unique you know, we have a brief review of the human immune system with the help of them.

15
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:41,900
What's important is to recognize some key features from human immunity,

16
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:52,280
how those human immunity relevant to vaccine development and relevance to what we are learning from the COVID 19 vaccine,

17
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:02,210
you know, the pace of the approval for emergency use.

18
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,830
So then in the immunization,

19
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:19,100
how all these basic immunology knowledge guides our design for immunization program and

20
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:29,780
how we develop vaccine design effects based on our understanding of vaccine immunology.

21
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,760
But often they will talk about a little bit of pathogenesis for.

22
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,540
Bacteria disease and the bird species in general.

23
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:54,850
And then how important to understand understand understanding of cancer genesis of infectious agents could these.

24
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,500
Then how that knowledge can be used for vaccine development.

25
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,260
Okay, so that's the first to do a quick search.

26
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:15,800
You have to have access to what the tissue augments or to come to your mind if you saw the term human immune system.

27
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,500
This is a review of what you learned.

28
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,750
Well, maybe also think a little bit about. Sales.

29
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:38,550
Was good. Yeah I think we really get collectively there and that's the try to.

30
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,200
Usually up the cost. I also go back to look at what this is.

31
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:55,650
So now let's look and I think you have a couple of somewhat most important, for instance, tissues and organs in the system.

32
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:01,920
So we typically divide the human needs before we could conceive the primary.

33
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:13,270
Many of you mentioned the lymphatic system. So primary important organs, which is the place location where in you know,

34
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:23,940
competencies they obviously develop into, from, um, from precursor development to make sure.

35
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:32,110
In fact, except the become the reason for it.

36
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:39,190
Organs include the lymph nodes, not the you have to mention the spleen, mucosa associated,

37
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:52,060
lymphoid tissues, cutaneous, the immune system and the basis of the vessel to transport foods.

38
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:59,920
This is the site of antigen deposition and the initiation of response to antigens.

39
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:08,170
So primary is where our immune cells develop from precursor and while secondary,

40
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:15,510
this is the types of form of immune fights against infectious disease.

41
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,460
This why it's important to understand where this happens because when we design vaccine,

42
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:33,360
we also try to find it at the back of the vaccine to interact with the human community to maximize the vaccine effects.

43
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:45,819
So here is the and another important tool I would like to refresh your memory so we also

44
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:55,270
could consider the human immune defense system in this as illustrated by this figure here.

45
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:01,780
Basically, it illustrates the three members of the defense of human immune system.

46
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,490
That includes the physical virus.

47
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:17,920
Our skin is our physical appearance, then our unit's immune system and about adaptive immune system.

48
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:25,180
And the adaptive immune system is also what you call you are quite right.

49
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,250
So these are three and and.

50
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:42,480
Then under the the immune system, you have all the security molecules like the cytokines,

51
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:57,510
the bad karma interferon and the so chemokines and the complement to this and the molecules are useful for antibody response.

52
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:15,799
So these are different levels of human immune system and for a long time vaccine development has been focused on adaptive immune system wise.

53
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,930
So we we can discuss that shortly.

54
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:28,130
Just another quick review of you are basically the new knowledge is under the

55
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:35,810
adaptive or acquired to be able to have antibody mediates immune response.

56
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:44,870
We also have will say augmented response maybe start to send and the what you know one of the senses

57
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:55,370
impacts some immunology is to think for these particular diseases what kind of immunity we want to develop.

58
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:09,650
Right. And should we focus on to elicit antibody mediated your response or should we focus on some cellular response?

59
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:17,840
What's to determine which type of immune response that we need to generate or produce?

60
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:29,150
So vaccine that we're based on your understanding of the pathogenesis of a disease infection?

61
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:39,290
Yeah. Later when we talk about different example you would appreciate and the what to note here is we know

62
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:53,450
these cell is this major player in the human immune response while you know this but it's still

63
00:10:53,450 --> 00:11:03,979
required T-cell participation and some may not require some may require we will have different

64
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:14,959
types of different level of antibody response depends on for T-cell key helpers involved or not.

65
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,620
But this is also important for vaccine development.

66
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,170
I will give you short sleeve.

67
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:37,980
This is another thing is I just say all these are related for long time the vaccine development so pretty much you mean that all three the PCL units,

68
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:43,350
the exploration for T-cells, so it's more isolated.

69
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:58,070
But to date there is an increased understanding of all these different type of related and connected.

70
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:07,370
And so, so then of course, which types of immune, if vaccine development should be focused on?

71
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:15,690
Should we focus on know or acquire that immunity or should we focus?

72
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,049
If your answer is acquire the immunity, should we focus on Sunday?

73
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:21,980
No immunity.

74
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:38,600
So maybe I think unity or we should focus, you know, think about the immediate use or do we really have a simple answer and answers for all.

75
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:47,870
So yeah this is don't worry about to good you right for question I I have read spent in the

76
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:54,910
syllabus participation involvement engagement is more important than providing a protocol.

77
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,969
So I actually personally I prefer over to speaker to answer that I was you know,

78
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:11,000
sometimes the time is admitted so we feel more comfortable than others.

79
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,840
So. Yeah, I can tell.

80
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,490
Oh. Oh. Was a barbecue.

81
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:45,620
Now we see a lot of we see this have adapted for sure for use in couples.

82
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:52,910
Then you also can see that antibodies, some may also signal in your response.

83
00:13:53,300 --> 00:14:03,500
So the answer is, generally speaking, your work will focus on protecting you.

84
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:19,420
But recently, there has also been a lot more exploration on the Internet for your potential role in vaccine induced protection because of these links.

85
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:29,980
And then also of that, you should only focus on immune response or your response.

86
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,510
This. There is no an answer for all.

87
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:48,170
It depends on the pathogenesis of the the pathogen and the infection, which I will also discuss later.

88
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,030
So it could be both.

89
00:14:50,690 --> 00:15:04,130
It could be both, but maybe use the difference in different times and what kind of propensity we want to induce this immune response.

90
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:09,740
For what type of sense? To use the antibody.

91
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:16,130
Try to induce the antibody, induce the immunity.

92
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,659
That's something for you to start from thinking how we work.

93
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:26,990
It's a little too late, so I think it's no problem.

94
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:36,140
Everyone understands very well what's involved in immune response and the human immune system.

95
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:42,680
With your previous course work. So now let me ask you a quick question.

96
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:54,920
I could do up or I do that, which is the thinking about the human immune system or immune the immunity immune function.

97
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:00,770
What are some key features of specific immunity?

98
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,390
I mean, you have.

99
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,150
As well. Okay.

100
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:20,600
Let's think about. Okay. Maybe we can discuss the implications since I already show you the results of their memory.

101
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,889
That's no question. Right. Why?

102
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,450
We have a vaccine? Because we want to generate some memory to this passage.

103
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:42,560
And the specificity, diversity, mobility and self will limit discrimination of the self and the lung self.

104
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:50,090
Now, let's talk a little bit discuss a little bit of the what each feature means.

105
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,770
And what's the implication for vaccine development?

106
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:02,300
Just a quick couple of minutes to discuss before you start to see what memory mean.

107
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,900
Oh, well, I guess just briefly, within the context of memory and specificity.

108
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:17,640
One. So like the vaccine.

109
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:32,139
Explain the specificity of an antibody can be matched with a specific criteria that to do so can, because of the memory,

110
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:45,250
generate maximum response to the types of you have some good memory and what does that sense of specificity, what's the implication of that for?

111
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,630
You know, for vaccine development specificity.

112
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,710
We have heard so much about COVID 19 vaccine.

113
00:17:53,980 --> 00:18:07,480
The new variants come up and the concern, you know, could be, well, Ira, if I remember what happened in the.

114
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:39,070
Yeah. You. The this the space for good anthropology to work specifically we when we focus on diversity.

115
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:45,680
And so that you are facing issue if the and.

116
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:57,920
You know, immunity generated by, let's say, a laboratory response to all five previous COVID 19 vaccines.

117
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:03,880
Then when the new variants that developed start to circulate,

118
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:12,220
then the protection of the because these are specificity has to be to perfect to match generally

119
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:25,870
the antigen antibody or for the parts which you have to be antigen diversity a human.

120
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:37,970
This also has implication in addressing the concern of vaccine hesitancy and some parents

121
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:47,570
say the oh so many vaccination and with signs of this saturates my child's immune system.

122
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:55,540
Then when they later were exposed to real infection, they would not be able to respond.

123
00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:01,630
So this is that's true. We were talking about that.

124
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:11,890
I think you guys will. Well, let me go through some of the since summarize here, and this is important.

125
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:20,500
So expose your immune system to foreign antigen, enhance its ability to respond again to that antigen.

126
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:32,470
In this case, we use the vaccine. In immunization, we use vaccine because the vaccine is a pronounced or non harmful.

127
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,820
Generally speaking, it's the virulence, the fact that has been removed.

128
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:44,620
Oh, not the dysfunction then, but still in.

129
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:51,730
That's a specific immunity against the specific pathogen and pockets.

130
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,260
So the second immune response would be fast.

131
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:09,460
And because you have the memory of pieces, the soldiers succumb to exposure to the same and you will have a different response.

132
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:21,580
Much you rapid, more rapid, larger and often quantitatively different from the first one or primary immune response to that antigen.

133
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,470
This is definitely so.

134
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:36,250
And the specificity is basically in using a specific or distinct antigen because that is the feature.

135
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:44,739
Vaccine development always the face the possibility that for the previously developed

136
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:55,850
the vaccine may not be as effective in protecting against new variants or difference.

137
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:05,290
And even some vaccine is how do they target some particular pathogen for, for example, lung infection?

138
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:10,720
But it is a different attitude. So this is a distinct antigen.

139
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:15,820
When you talk about this type of antigen, it could be the very same antigen,

140
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:24,280
but it evolves so that the major epitopes in the antigen have been changed.

141
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,380
That won't be recognized by initially.

142
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,140
It gives the immunity.

143
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,040
So this is very important how we deal with this.

144
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,690
That's something we were discuss later.

145
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,580
And another thing is that for some,

146
00:22:44,950 --> 00:23:00,099
the pathogen that has so many different types like pneumococcal vaccine currently and also 23 billion and there are some countries but 100 differences

147
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:12,640
serotypes and when you target on particular one and then this immunity not necessarily protects against the other types of the same pathogen.

148
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:21,250
In that case, you have to monitor vaccine replacement, the disease have to introduce and successfully introduce events.

149
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:25,150
We have an excellent replacement.

150
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:32,410
So and then, you know, HIV influenza.

151
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:37,110
Yesterday we had the time of Francis of lecture in the morning there was a

152
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:44,500
session of some of the panelists discussing talking about the influenza vaccine,

153
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:53,900
you know, for 75. Years, we haven't solved the antigenic drift issue related to influenza vaccine.

154
00:23:53,910 --> 00:24:01,990
So every year you have to have this extensive surveillance program around the world and to

155
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:12,880
predict then the next year's strain so that that can be incorporated in the vaccine formula.

156
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:23,160
But sometimes that vaccine developed, did a good job, made the more cost cool over time.

157
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:32,970
A lot of times that's the prediction didn't hold true and then reduce the protective effects.

158
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:42,240
So one of the companies today is a microbiologist from Penn State, Pennsylvania.

159
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:58,310
I don't I think he's talking about a vaccine for cancer, incorporating 20 different types of 20 variants.

160
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:06,740
So a lot of work has been done to address this, including the COVID 19 vaccine.

161
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:15,120
Now, the use the boosting vaccine is the two variants that content the previous most

162
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:23,790
the best in the art history and also the more recent security only so variants.

163
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:31,370
So that's the specificity implication for vaccine development.

164
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:41,460
Of course, I could also tell you and it's a it's a also interesting development despite the vaccine,

165
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:48,900
that specifically immunity is specific to, you know, specific antigen.

166
00:25:49,440 --> 00:26:05,990
There has been some exploration to study the possibility to develop with disease or a focused vaccine, which means, for example, tuberculosis,

167
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,910
a microfracture to her can cause lung infection from the U.S. and many other passages,

168
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:18,510
including both bacteria and the virus, can also cause cancer infection.

169
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,540
So with today's new techniques,

170
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:38,219
next week we have like this lecture by Dr. Frieden from GSK to give a talk evolution of the vaccine pipeline from smallpox to COVID 19,

171
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:47,340
which is very exciting. And I used to practice and since I that's medicine I saw he works in pharmaceutical

172
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,410
company and you should have firsthand experience and it's been wonderful.

173
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:58,290
Everyone here is coming this time to giving this lecture.

174
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:07,380
I hope for everyone here at Penn. Yeah, it would be meeting remotely because he did not.

175
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,270
He used to travel to here,

176
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:18,860
but not since the last couple of years we were to stay in the costume through here because the next session will be in-person.

177
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,689
So I hope we will have a good attendance.

178
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:31,920
It's a wonderful opportunity to help people who are involved in the real work, this solution, funding for vaccine development.

179
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:45,110
So that's the specificity. So you could put potentially incorporates a different that you create then the interim vaccine that's a you know,

180
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:51,300
different specificity requirements and methodology.

181
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:57,210
Today, it's more possible than ever. And so we have a couple of lectures and the methods.

182
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:05,230
Which I simply would be very interested. Fear and perversity.

183
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:09,820
Like I told you, the public people's votes.

184
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:19,400
Oh, okay. My kids got so many actually saturates the news system and so worried.

185
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:34,600
But the truth is, the total number of antigenic lymphocytes, individual or lymphocyte repertoire is extremely large.

186
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:47,080
It is made that the immune system this formulates at least as distinct the action determines.

187
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,550
So this should not be really a reasonable person.

188
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:53,460
Anyways,

189
00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:08,650
talk to you about that concern you could then expect and the self limitation or normal immune response when with time after antigen stimulation.

190
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:16,600
What's the implication of this future for vaccine development and immunization?

191
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:21,730
More for immunization vaccination program for.

192
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:27,160
Yeah. You win. So what's that for?

193
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,490
We need to do something. Okay, now I'm trying to do prevention.

194
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:46,790
Flu vaccination. Both and depends how soon we need to have that.

195
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:53,420
That depends on how this work. Depends on the pathogenesis and nature of infection.

196
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,840
Some immunity could be long lasting.

197
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:08,000
And so you just the needs to get to try to do the vaccination and so that you don't have to do, you know, many years of vaccination.

198
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,260
And this is very important for the immunization program.

199
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,790
When we introduce your vaccine, we always need to monitor.

200
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:27,680
Ideally, if the if we saw something, as we heard from one of the speakers yesterday,

201
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:39,360
that we could include trials in different populations, including the twins for Pfizer and Moderna vaccine.

202
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,059
So one of the very big challenges in this is simply open.

203
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:51,910
No any. Could this surveillance system increase?

204
00:30:52,480 --> 00:31:02,740
So then you would not be able to really study how long the House can last?

205
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:12,310
This would require a lot of sort of thing. But the idea of you want to follow these so that you can determine when another dose should be given.

206
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:26,200
And that is it's also to realize even some vaccine that's originally designed to try to fool the pertussis vaccine,

207
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:41,890
which was really very successful, but then later found that, you know, in some adult population, also infection happened.

208
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,560
And so it's kind of like, you know,

209
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:55,830
the opportunity for infection control fight left to some and that population which you may have experience the

210
00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:07,360
winning immunity and to still have frequent contact with children who are high risk for the pertussis infection.

211
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:16,000
And so that's just the disease. So this is a very important implication for immunization program.

212
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:35,559
Discrimination from self. I'm sure you all have learned the autoimmune disease and the vaccine and now is also explored for autoimmune disease.

213
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:51,220
Some of the larger food disorders and or kind of chronic disease and the for autoimmune basically is to restore the self function in those patients.

214
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:55,420
So we'll talk more about this later.

215
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:05,620
Mobility, the immune system has to be able to respond to a form and produce any side in the body.

216
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,820
Mobility also important for lung specific immune response.

217
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:19,090
This has also very important implications for vaccine people because usually you if you remember the vaccine,

218
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:29,330
you got the new you could have full injection that's these and injected vaccine that can increase the protective,

219
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:37,960
you know, infection in the nervous system, in the lungs, different organs.

220
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:46,240
But there's one important observation is if we can't deliver the vaccine,

221
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:55,780
mimic the natural infection, you may have to benefit both the local response and the system.

222
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:03,590
Given this fact, yeah, this has something to do with vaccine research.

223
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:17,050
When we design what they can do with vaccine, any questions about all these features and implications for vaccine?

224
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:24,009
Why is it that when you get some vaccines, they put them in like different like what has to do in the back of your arm,

225
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:28,270
one in the front, like someone will go in your head, like, why do they put them in different spots?

226
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,240
It's more a practical reason.

227
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:49,780
Some may be a intradermal injection, some may be forced scarification on the surface, you know, like the small pox, it's really the surface of.

228
00:34:51,190 --> 00:35:00,140
The admission that now they're talking about you have monkeypox for different populations.

229
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:15,309
Intradermal vaccination usually require less bucks because it's much lower cost and it can keep the same response as opposed,

230
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:21,040
for example, like a key vaccine which is not used here but in developing countries.

231
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:29,530
I think for those of you from outside, from outside the U.S., you probably got the infection better already.

232
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:36,700
There's also scarification. It depends on the dose.

233
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:46,629
When you have a very relatively large dose matures to be injected, that may get you on your part of the faces.

234
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:58,870
Although that intradermal intradermal is really having a 100 to the surface, at least like a scarf encasing that comes.

235
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,080
Good. Any other questions? Yes.

236
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,510
Could you clarify the difference between the specificity?

237
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,440
I was just the diversity. I was a little bit confused about.

238
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:35,560
Yeah. This basically is talking about our immune system has the capacity to to respond to deal with large a big variety of different antigens.

239
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:47,410
And it's not like some people are worried about the metro system where be saturated by having too many drive through the vaccination.

240
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:59,020
Um, yeah. Another interesting thing, I think when we study, have the vaccine hesitation,

241
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:05,950
there's some question where the US is, you know, compared to earlier time, we have many vaccine.

242
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:10,630
It's the whole cell vaccine that's a huge vaccine.

243
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:16,300
Each pathogen vaccine can contains tens of thousands of antigen.

244
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:31,510
But today we have this, you know, subunit vaccine based on single vaccine or some recombinant vaccine still have much less antigen to be introduced.

245
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:38,649
So this is the diversity clear and no other question.

246
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:45,400
So I also want to see many of the concepts we discussed today will be revisited many times.

247
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:50,220
Okay. So for if it's not, yeah.

248
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:58,160
And we will also have a discussion session next week after that to support, to have.

249
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:05,460
I would be happy to answer any questions you had for previous sessions.

250
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:13,540
Um, yeah. Then now the questions we have for all these different features.

251
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:21,760
What's the basis of vaccination? I'm sure you all are great memory of infections.

252
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:31,959
So all we tried to do is to create a specific memory of a particular pathogen and then allow

253
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:37,780
the second immune to resistant to certain disease after having high once the result from

254
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:44,380
production or from memory B and the T cells during the first exposure to the antigen and a

255
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:56,440
major infection can do the job but the major infection is can cause harm to the host human.

256
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,130
That's why we want to use the vaccine.

257
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:05,860
There are many different forms of vaccine, but I don't think I we're a we're working with this terminology today.

258
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:13,240
Hopefully after that, the freedom hopefully we can have discussions that I can tell you more about it.

259
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:19,330
Then a second of the exposure to the same antigen produce a more massive and the faster response.

260
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:31,750
And the second response is the basis for the notion of vaccines stimulates the antibody production and form formation of memory cells without cause.

261
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,210
This is what's how vaccine in general works.

262
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:55,210
And we have the antigenic feature of the disease causing pathogen, but it doesn't have the virus that would have caused the or of this vaccine.

263
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:16,480
You probably we this and the procedure and the syphilis vaccine which is the toxoid but basically it's the modification inactivation for the toxin.

264
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:26,820
Awesome. And then it's a through some a chemical manipulation of anti to remove the disease causing

265
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:38,980
problems but to keep the antigenic that's part of the toxic toxin which is called the toxoid um,

266
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,300
kill eggs or topsoil.

267
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:55,000
So that's basically the concept when we do today's vaccine design, you can head for, um, you know,

268
00:40:55,330 --> 00:41:05,230
you have your vaccine basically based on a good understanding of what could happen to the genetic material some capacity.

269
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:16,450
And you could do, um, mutagenesis the study take a whole chunk of the genes, the coding, those of human factors.

270
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:29,600
COATES The news that when I told her about the tuberculosis vaccine, I will give you a comprehensive introduction of the strengthens the export.

271
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:37,820
So but now you just understand it's really taking advantage of the memory feature for humans.

272
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:50,000
And the goal is to generate the immune response that will be very robust, very rapid growth mass without cause.

273
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:56,900
And that's, of course, as we discuss further, understand that there's a tradeoff.

274
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:02,990
Sometimes more attenuation also could be associated, less the potent.

275
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,580
And, you know, it could go other directions. It's a challenge.

276
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,800
And otherwise, we should have a vaccine for over 36 months.

277
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:26,240
So this is a simple model that assumes that no major and vaccine use is lifelong, but it's a very simple one.

278
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:34,190
Once you have done that, as you say for ever, the truth is not always so.

279
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:46,010
And when you so when you're after the first a person was born, typically you are immune through some months of antibody,

280
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,129
through some major trauma, the disease like measles or the end of the world for that matter.

281
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:57,260
The antibodies disappear. You become susceptible to disease.

282
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:09,260
And at this time, before you can, it's just survival rates to vaccinate for the system of the people that they can get infection.

283
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:14,120
But so some of them may not develop for active disease.

284
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:30,260
So it's what we call the latent. And then if you break down as a disease and as people get older today, we are dealing with a more larger population,

285
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:38,150
a higher age than ever because the increased life expectancy across the globe.

286
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:52,040
So we have more people with the you know, once they at some point gets the work done due to a difference of reason, chronic disease, diabetes,

287
00:43:52,520 --> 00:44:05,390
cancer all through different mechanisms can reduce immunity and you can break down is a you won't be able to continue infection and then you you can,

288
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:15,290
you know, get a new infection. You can also become immune generating new infection in the community comes to this.

289
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,200
That's the humanity.

290
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:31,430
We also do a lot of sense that's the to change the past for example and the new infection could the boosting the previous immunity.

291
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:36,440
These actually this is what's that figure I took from this book.

292
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:46,670
Right. And today we are also do a lot of boosting, you know, the vaccination and the major infection.

293
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:54,580
Second episode could enhance the previously acquired immunity,

294
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:06,770
but the vaccine boosting that could also enhance the immunity of the individual so that, you know, makes them immune.

295
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:15,860
Again, like with the COVID 19, we have you probably have heard people cut, you know, more than one episode.

296
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:30,700
That's the disease. Or for that, you still vaccinated and you could also have some partial protection which make you still have the possibility here.

297
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:40,520
So that's the good news is all these repeated exposure, seconds of exposure,

298
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:47,839
secondary exposure to the same pathogen either through vaccination boosting also natural

299
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:58,600
infection could enhance your immune that's ideally booster because natural infection has.

300
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:11,140
And then for vaccination, we our goal is to induce that immunity in the vaccinated individuals.

301
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:18,730
And so we have two different approach in the vaccine vaccination immunization program.

302
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,870
Why is the active immunity this to generate?

303
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:33,370
So this through this active immunization which is a relatively long term and suggested be careful

304
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:42,400
with all the the discussed in biomedical science everything is relative that sun is absolute.

305
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:55,060
So you always have that concept of you assess, you know, interpret any sun or even with any special situation, you keep that in mind.

306
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:06,010
So we talk about a relatively long term, this type of immunity typically developed after yearly or vaccination with the vaccine,

307
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:12,910
basically exposure to the pattern switching or attenuated the form of the pathogen.

308
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:18,080
Brexit. And another is the principle in practice.

309
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:28,860
We also, you know, sometimes you don't have the opportunity to implement active immunization if more

310
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:40,390
people are trying to the area where wild animals move the dogs and even with the dogs,

311
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:52,400
I have been in some area like that. If you look at the fine and the dogs were not immune against rabies and if you are worried about that,

312
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:57,200
you could have a passable disruption to the antiserum injections.

313
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:01,500
So this is as a summary of that.

314
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:04,759
You had well, we had four in. That's the immunity.

315
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:13,340
We have acquired the immunity then through either passive or active.

316
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:19,910
And then the passive one, you could have a nature, you get antibodies from that other antibody,

317
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:28,040
the presence of ADT plus 88 and the activation of this is through the immunization program.

318
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:37,849
Immunoglobulin Like I told you, if you were born to HIV, Hepatitis B, seropositive or antigen positive,

319
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:44,900
your mother maybe is a newborn, which gets you to besides active immunization.

320
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:50,090
So the facts of vaccination or natural infection.

321
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:54,530
So this side has everything you have.

322
00:48:54,630 --> 00:49:06,080
Then just remember the self limitation of the feature that may require you given for the active vaccination.

323
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:11,630
The passive one doesn't do that. Even for the active one.

324
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:18,290
You need to have the boosting recognize one like a tetanus.

325
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:26,419
Every ten years you do something right and the other vaccine you need, you have reason.

326
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:39,830
Short term, you have multiple to multiple injection to get to the sophisticated sufficient to find the protection.

327
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:57,620
So it's it depends on others. Now we go back to the earlier course and what kind of food immunity we do need to develop to induce by vaccination.

328
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:04,010
In other words, when we do design our facts, when we try to develop a vaccine,

329
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:21,040
should we focus on generating antibody mediated immunity or should we focus on the generation and, you know, a immune response?

330
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:35,590
This. The answer is it depends on the pencil chances of passage in this it's a finger basically it illustrates two major types of food.

331
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:42,800
Mechanism. And why is the bacterium maybe AIDS?

332
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,640
Basically, it's a the toxin generated by the bacteria.

333
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:53,540
Like tetanus, like diphtheria, pertussis.

334
00:50:53,930 --> 00:51:01,190
All these are due to the toxin generated by the pathogen.

335
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:07,640
Mean they're, you know, it's natural growth or multiplication in humans.

336
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:21,050
So if this pox is in the bloodstream, you can make some antibodies that could neutralize this toxin.

337
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:26,270
We're very effective, but we have some pathogen there.

338
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:34,730
It's not the toxin based. And so here we have the host making pathogenesis basically.

339
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:45,900
Is this the host the immune response that caused the tissue damage and to the what we call the inflammation,

340
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:54,980
inflammatory response that leads to storm and that which is, you know, send in your colleagues.

341
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:00,680
And as you can see, this hypothetical persistence of COVID 19.

342
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:05,960
You're right, the three arrows point to the tissue damage.

343
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:13,190
One is the human immune. Besides, of course, the new infection also, of course.

344
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:18,010
But it's all these you don't have to remember the molecules,

345
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:25,430
but it's just appreciates the fact that human immune response to the cancer gene invasion

346
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:36,200
could cause a lot of tissue damage due to this very strong immune response inflammation.

347
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:43,910
And the TB actually has some kind of seminal, seminal, uh, pathogenesis.

348
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:49,880
It's not that mycobacterium tuberculosis generates some toxin.

349
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:54,710
That's the cause of tissue damage. Have a patient in the lung.

350
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:58,700
It's the host, the immune response, the macrophage.

351
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:13,730
And so that's the components of TB organism cause the host mechanism to clear these infected the cells that cause damage of the lung have the patient.

352
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:19,070
So this is the immune. The passive passive response.

353
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:31,740
The immune response is supposed to protect you from infection, but this type of environment matrix storm could cause that.

354
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:44,090
And this is why Cole thinks and he, you know, has a lot of root causes typically these type of pathogens, the cause multiple organ damage.

355
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:52,370
Um, so for that reason we really have to understand the panther genetics.

356
00:53:52,730 --> 00:54:03,740
And as for TB, HIV and, and also some parasites, you see, they are, you know, intracellular pathogen.

357
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:13,040
So you need to have the cycle of toxic T cells to really clear of infection that in those case,

358
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:27,860
like TB has largely focused on cellular immunity, produce and vaccine development, while many other disease is antibody based.

359
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:35,930
So you have to know what's adult and you know what's the mechanism.

360
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:49,220
It's different. You require a different strategy dealing with a intracellular or an extracellular pathogen.

361
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:54,860
You don't have to memorize a molecule.

362
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,420
I show you here it's the principle of just understand the difference.

363
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:10,280
And so Genesis require a different type of immunity to control the disease, which is the individual vaccine.

364
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:20,270
So this is just a quick look going through some of the mechanisms the vaccine research has.

365
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:29,000
You know, you may have you mentioned the want to understand the mechanism of action, pull back some works and some of them.

366
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:32,000
These are all based on the pathogenesis,

367
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:41,600
based on our understanding of four major categories of virulence factors for vaccine, for the pathogen, for some toxin.

368
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:48,220
It's the secretes the bacterium molecules that poison host cells,

369
00:55:48,230 --> 00:56:04,550
the by and organs and the other hence that's the help to the pathogen penetrates the invasion both help the pathogen to stay and enter host cells.

370
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:11,030
So you can package some of these kind of and molecules neutralize them.

371
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:19,940
Then the pathogen will lose the opportunity. And then perhaps for intracellular pathogens, they have a different mechanism.

372
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:26,900
They can survive in the infected cells without a, you know, the normal function.

373
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:31,220
We're not I guess the system would not be of that.

374
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:39,710
So you need interested in a seven radius packet from the use and their mechanism.

375
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:48,330
A lot of research, research for interested in the pathogen to understand how they could avoid phagocytosis.

376
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:54,020
You understand that is the our immune system to clear.

377
00:56:54,410 --> 00:57:05,990
In fact it's the antigen the pathogen a process that to all to a host of ptosis which is cell programed to sort does.

378
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:15,650
It's to clear back you know cells cancer cells putting cancer genesis interesting in the past.

379
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:21,390
They can cause the potential damage like in TB and lung cancer patients.

380
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:30,290
So, um, another important thing to mention here is we talked about the.

381
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:40,420
B cell mediated the immune response, which is the human immune system, but also antibody response.

382
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:50,290
But there are two kinds of antibody antigen for, you know, antigen.

383
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:53,440
Antibody is a human immune response.

384
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:56,860
Some antigen is called a T independent,

385
00:57:57,070 --> 00:58:14,290
which doesn't involve the T helper cells to multiply to produce and which usually is the smaller molecule polysaccharide some polysaccharide vaccine.

386
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:24,520
This is why for pneumococcal vaccine, the major Cox virulence factors polysaccharides.

387
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:37,060
But to enhance the vaccine's immunity typically were conjugates with a larger molecule that protein.

388
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:47,890
So that's why or some other and you want to make a stronger independent you don't.

389
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:57,070
So dependent one key dependent antigen that's a much stronger antibody response.

390
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:01,600
So for the vaccine, how does it work?

391
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:06,190
When you inject vaccine, it's like for your nature, for you,

392
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:18,670
where you come to the antigen presenting cells for like dendritic cells and macrophage this are all like antigen presenting cells you wear.

393
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:30,610
So if the vaccine and the adjuvants in some case elicits is sufficient to bend your signal to the system,

394
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:37,750
this will activate monocyte and dendritic cells.

395
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:49,990
This activation, of course, where the initiates a number of the downstream responds.

396
00:59:50,350 --> 01:00:03,729
As you can see from here, we talk about some antigen required t help cells participation with the t help cells participation.

397
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:12,340
If we're going to this the chairman sentence germinal center which is in the human

398
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:20,200
spleen and the saw this past week you were helpful much stronger immune response.

399
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:31,530
Why don't you go through that simple p cell properly and to the antigen product?

400
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,980
Antibody production.

401
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:48,160
This usually is much a small scale and also much shorter compared to this going through this screen as structure in the screen senses.

402
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:52,840
So in practice how this impact of vaccine.

403
01:00:53,200 --> 01:01:03,249
So you want to understand if the antigen you choose for vaccine development is t have so dependent for

404
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:16,270
acting or independence and and then you want to construct to the vaccine with some antigen that's you know,

405
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:32,480
induce a T-cell dependance and you find an antibody response basically where allow the antigen going through this the process that generates much.

406
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:44,440
Sorry, I forgot. So I forgot to turn off so that the the two different role.

407
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:50,170
This is why whenever you supported sacrifice and based the vaccine,

408
01:01:50,170 --> 01:02:00,850
you also have to come to gates with some other molecules so that you could enhance the immune response.

409
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:11,620
And key factors regarding vaccine is taking A for primer antibody B cell

410
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:19,689
activation in the inflow that have been reached by vaccine antigen upon diffusion.

411
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:31,480
And so here this association to migrate dendritic cells, protein antigens activates both B and the T cells which result.

412
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:38,240
In induction of a highly efficient to be zero differentiation password.

413
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:45,420
As I showed you going through these centers that will be more than 40.

414
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:49,230
Zacharias antigen does not go that way.

415
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:58,550
That's why you often have to come to grips with some protein antigen in the vaccine form.

416
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:08,990
This is all this just shows you that the secondary response exposure would be much faster, much more massive, and.

417
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:18,460
Is the what we try to achieve with vaccination.

418
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:28,120
Just to look at this curve. This is a primary immune response. When you first time exposed to the and you second time exposed to that.

419
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:34,060
And it's much more fast from this curve, Anderson.

420
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:46,870
What are the factors? Influence, immunogenicity, microbiome factors, foreignness, size, chemical composition, physical form and degrades ability.

421
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:57,040
One of the sense of foreignness and the microbial passage you sometimes could also share some homologous with the human antigens.

422
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,600
So when you do vaccine development, you really want to avoid.

423
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:06,040
You need to understand if that's an antigen.

424
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:17,860
Any homologous and otherwise you could potentially induce one and you may also not achieve the vaccination goal.

425
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:23,709
So and a host of factors, genetic factors, the age and underlying condition,

426
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:31,780
other diseases today's just simple mentioning and we're talk about is more later.

427
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:36,280
So some some examples of a particular vaccine.

428
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:48,160
And then which way you you introduce the vaccine also have a role in the immunity in the

429
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:59,080
past but the of there were some very nice nasal spray vaccine developed for children use.

430
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:14,380
But the vector vaccine as we always say when you can mimic the natural infection and vaccination, you can probably have a better protection.

431
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:19,030
Your distinctly influenza is through you know inherent the.

432
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:33,770
Infectious agents than you would a sink basis we work with that's a it's a has a very different response between children

433
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:43,280
and adult population and the adult population have been exposed to different parents and a similar capacity over time.

434
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:50,380
And so already some local unity presents at the next spring.

435
01:05:50,660 --> 01:06:01,070
We all know that the kids, you know, reduce the vaccine as protection.

436
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:05,340
So there are many different ways to discuss that.

437
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:12,560
To summarize, the basis of vaccine design is a good understanding of the pathogenesis package,

438
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:17,990
disease identification of various factors and protective antigens.

439
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:29,440
After the package passage, it's very easy to see, you know, protected and enabled or not for many vaccines.

440
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:36,320
And therefore we have to use the fourth century that could be seen still.

441
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:39,500
We still don't really know specifically.

442
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:55,850
And the average vaccine of the human body, it's where you induce a series of immune response, but then we shoot subsets of the immune response.

443
01:06:56,210 --> 01:07:08,240
It's really protective. That's not that we are not even with the because the disease of smallpox that we were lucky enough vaccine.

444
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:20,959
So protective antigen immunity is a major area of medical research is to

445
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:28,700
understand what's to protect you when we talk about the vaccine fact after break,

446
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:32,239
we will discuss that more. And today,

447
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:41,740
these two topics or something important the foundation for vaccine vaccinology and let's unfortunately it's the 3

448
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:54,000
hours this kind of escape you I had either reduced my contents or I had to put two or two serious topic one session.

449
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:59,020
I hope you are able to help. Okay.

450
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:03,440
And your questions. I don't I think that's all I have to see.

451
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:09,800
You know, sometimes I will show you some pictures and the lot of the molecules,

452
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:19,850
this is just the, you know, showing you some principle, some knowledge that's necessary.

453
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:23,930
This is not immunology class. I'm not going to press.

454
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:28,400
I need oh, what molecules that you can do today.

455
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:43,330
You want to understand, you know, of the features of human beings and how vaccines are relevant to class and people

456
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:51,290
thinking about what can we have to do with the COVID 19 vaccine and many other vaccine?

457
01:08:52,190 --> 01:09:02,310
Think about how does each feature is relevant to vaccine development and then

458
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:08,930
interview to understand the needs or better understanding of pathogenesis.

459
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:13,420
So when you do vaccine people well,

460
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:22,669
another thing that I don't know when I incorporate that here we have many epidemiologists, public health professionals.

461
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:28,580
We are dealing with large populations. We typically have the concept of population concept.

462
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:33,380
One of the sense is in vaccine development for long time,

463
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:43,200
the population concept is not where you cooperate and a lot of food discovery is based on a laboratory reference

464
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:54,110
strain and the animal studies that's today from what we have learned from recent epidemics of different parts.

465
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:58,820
And so we have to incorporate the population concept.

466
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:13,630
So when we try to understand epidemiology pathogenesis, we need to understand that if what we see in one population is the same other population.

467
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:17,780
So this is also important to understand.

468
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:26,780
And so part of the. The exploration of Genesis.

469
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:31,840
Any questions? Okay.

470
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:38,180
You can take a break. 30, but to feel free to enter.

471
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:43,040
Perhaps if it's not clear to cooperate, we will come back.

472
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:54,230
That's all I can do. What I think when you want to come back at 120 or once I give, I start the 10 minutes.

473
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:58,070
Or is the better to come back?

474
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:02,930
120 to have you. Oh, sorry.

475
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:09,650
Could you. Yes. Is that okay? 220 So that's we hopefully can finish today.

476
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:30,960
I really am. It's just not myself that I have to turn myself in Friday afternoon for this is just open to help with that.

477
01:11:33,370 --> 01:11:59,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Kind of this I you know, I am so actually I don't have any class, so I have to wait.

478
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:07,690
I have learned that. I have read.

479
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:14,430
I have not only got ready to start my day,

480
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:29,010
like if I would have been there talking to you about it because it's so she was like, I have to work, you know.

481
01:12:29,810 --> 01:12:42,120
She it is because she does know that there.

482
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:52,440
I try. I think I try to make the most of it.

483
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:56,520
Really? Why not? You don't want to see people, you know?

484
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:17,840
So it's kind of like, oh, I don't want you to hear until I started, like, better looking to make this announcement of the body.

485
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:28,650
Okay. I think what you're looking at right now, that was the beginning of something like this, you know?

486
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:44,060
Do you want to go on? Yeah. So you send a message about where I got someone who knows when I see you in person.

487
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:48,640
That's true. I also knew you were.

488
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:53,460
I was like. They're like my friends.

489
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:59,639
We're all human beings again. They have no records of our lives.

490
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:10,800
Whenever I first met him, for example, I remember the first thing you do in your life.

491
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:18,479
Oh, really? That's really good. Yeah, well, there's people.

492
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:25,950
Perfect. I see.

493
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:32,640
Like this occurred in years.

494
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:41,370
Oh, yeah. And I didn't realize that the things that you really can't go back in years.

495
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:45,770
Yeah. Where were you? It was like.

496
01:14:47,160 --> 01:15:01,680
Oh, yeah. And it's like, you're not familiar with that.

497
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:11,776
I know. I know. You just have the money or need to starve for my life.

498
01:15:51,713 --> 01:16:05,293
It's not sound like you're really going to do that right now.

499
01:16:05,763 --> 01:16:09,203
I got like 2016.

500
01:16:11,203 --> 01:16:17,473
Okay. I was nervous.

501
01:16:19,063 --> 01:16:22,693
Yeah. Mean a lot of. Oh, all right.

502
01:16:24,193 --> 01:16:34,843
We can start that again. Okay, now, I switch from immunology to packs of vaccine effects and public health impact of vaccination.

503
01:16:35,263 --> 01:16:50,443
This is also very important for vaccinology study because it really tells you how vaccines work from a different angle.

504
01:16:50,683 --> 01:16:56,923
First, though, we talk about what we need in vaccine and that from immunology standpoint.

505
01:16:57,343 --> 01:17:05,493
But this is really for, you know, from the application, once you use the vaccine,

506
01:17:05,523 --> 01:17:19,033
if you have a vaccine developed by some good immunology pathogenesis studies and then once you introduce to the population, what's that to happen?

507
01:17:19,393 --> 01:17:29,263
And for how it works and how to in terms of protecting the population from the target, the disease.

508
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:36,433
So what I thought I would do is to cover the following aspects.

509
01:17:36,853 --> 01:17:42,763
First, I would like to introduce to you the three levels of vaccine effect.

510
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:56,803
Once it's given to an individual, whatever difference in the vaccine effect, then I would focus specifically about the direct and indirect the effect.

511
01:17:57,493 --> 01:18:06,613
This is from the population vaccinations standpoint, what you expect to happen.

512
01:18:08,293 --> 01:18:15,403
Then we will also discuss the determinants of of herd immunity benefits.

513
01:18:16,033 --> 01:18:20,103
And then in other words, what population you can start to see.

514
01:18:20,353 --> 01:18:29,893
Now, the what's the sample population in our community or your country or, you know, and, you know,

515
01:18:29,953 --> 01:18:44,983
a certain geographic region can benefit from the indirect protection and the public health aspects of vaccination.

516
01:18:45,883 --> 01:18:51,433
Basically, I would introduce you to some similar cancer.

517
01:18:53,373 --> 01:18:58,903
Michael Harvey, you have heard that lots of them in vaccinology today.

518
01:18:59,773 --> 01:19:03,103
We also have the term community.

519
01:19:03,443 --> 01:19:17,383
You would see how that those concepts differ from each other and what has a similarity between this, why we need that difference and terminology.

520
01:19:17,383 --> 01:19:21,203
So these are really from laboratory.

521
01:19:21,253 --> 01:19:31,242
Now, you know, we were discussing integrates different disciplines in vaccine research and we last session

522
01:19:31,243 --> 01:19:40,813
we talked about immunology the basic and know nature immunology impact of vaccine.

523
01:19:41,623 --> 01:19:47,833
Now we are going to talk about population before and after vaccination.

524
01:19:48,493 --> 01:19:54,143
So there's three levels of vaccine effect you can think of.

525
01:19:54,223 --> 01:20:04,063
This is three. First, after you get an injection, there will be some cellular and molecular response in your body.

526
01:20:04,753 --> 01:20:12,943
And this basically is a different immune response generally in your body.

527
01:20:14,753 --> 01:20:23,423
In response to the in the vaccine injection or an overview, at least on paper.

528
01:20:23,423 --> 01:20:37,403
Most of the new study and this was seen in her water cooler was never in fact where B of course it translates into individual effects.

529
01:20:38,783 --> 01:20:46,612
What's the these molecules generates that you are or do you follow your vaccination where you are all good.

530
01:20:46,613 --> 01:20:50,043
The response or some response is bad.

531
01:20:50,063 --> 01:21:00,943
So have all these will talk about individual effects and then that individual in the community and

532
01:21:01,253 --> 01:21:15,073
depends on the relative level of good or bad response individual successful and unsuccessful.

533
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:20,413
You were helpful population number effects.

534
01:21:20,573 --> 01:21:27,943
So you have a cellular molecules. Why do we need to understand the what's the difference?

535
01:21:30,513 --> 01:21:36,093
And the senator and the water cooler. This is what I want to discuss.

536
01:21:36,123 --> 01:21:43,623
You can think about your answer. And then when this gets through, you can share your ideas.

537
01:21:44,613 --> 01:21:48,493
So this is what time it actually is.

538
01:21:48,513 --> 01:21:55,023
I have four, three slides to fill them out. First, the cellular and molecular level.

539
01:21:55,143 --> 01:22:08,013
Basically, it's a have you not seen the control of invasion before the infection take of and then acquired the immunity with memory.

540
01:22:11,463 --> 01:22:14,673
Then the individual is absolutely.

541
01:22:14,943 --> 01:22:21,373
You can go back to two different kind of individual factors.

542
01:22:22,203 --> 01:22:35,373
Depending on the level of molecular response, this individual factor could be seen as absolutely sterilizing immunity against the infection.

543
01:22:36,033 --> 01:22:46,353
Many of our childhood vaccine, like, you know, polio, like pertussis and,

544
01:22:47,203 --> 01:22:57,003
you know, diphtheria, tetanus, many of those vaccine is designed or has achieved.

545
01:22:57,153 --> 01:23:05,042
The absolute is being you were not to experience an infection.

546
01:23:05,043 --> 01:23:08,163
When you encounter, you can fight off. You don't get it.

547
01:23:09,543 --> 01:23:17,733
You don't get the disease support. You don't get the infection another type of infection.

548
01:23:18,753 --> 01:23:22,283
So it impacts and affects the individual.

549
01:23:22,743 --> 01:23:25,773
This individual get vaccination.

550
01:23:26,133 --> 01:23:37,143
We are still getting infection. But if we're have much less severe of this, what we see relative a reduction in infection disease,

551
01:23:37,143 --> 01:23:48,403
comparisons for respiratory diseases or infectious disease, if we already see a severe case, reduce that you will, contagious is likely to be reduced.

552
01:23:48,753 --> 01:23:57,653
Right. So we have this and we saw lots of in the COVID 19 vaccine vaccination.

553
01:23:57,663 --> 01:24:08,703
You know, you heard people say, oh, even some people who got vaccinations still got the disease, but they had a very mild episode of the disease.

554
01:24:08,973 --> 01:24:18,303
So this is what we talk the individual after vaccination depends on the vaccine, what kind of immunity to generate.

555
01:24:18,783 --> 01:24:32,223
And so I mentioned as a protective immunity, if our vaccine research really has had a very thorough understanding of with the pathogenesis,

556
01:24:32,343 --> 01:24:39,563
you may that designing a vaccine based on that is really important and it kind of provides

557
01:24:39,723 --> 01:24:46,803
the complete effective immunity and the malaria vaccine that I would discuss later.

558
01:24:47,103 --> 01:24:56,453
We based on the different the different stage of life cycle of the parasite's improvement and the issue cycle has a different impact.

559
01:24:56,463 --> 01:25:08,703
Some of is really for proof than from the infection, some prevention from transmission, some designed to reduce the severity of the disease.

560
01:25:09,063 --> 01:25:16,743
So it's I think if they do never happen to develop or any vaccine.

561
01:25:28,693 --> 01:25:36,393
Vaccine design largely based on. Yeah.

562
01:25:36,803 --> 01:25:46,133
My point is that I'm really trying to understand the of things I can see here.

563
01:25:47,203 --> 01:26:01,823
Um, so you can. You can. But the reality is that microbial pathogenesis may not be determined just by single appearance of fact.

564
01:26:02,573 --> 01:26:06,583
So our understanding sometimes is limited.

565
01:26:07,313 --> 01:26:14,083
And for that reason, you may not always have complete protection.

566
01:26:18,363 --> 01:26:26,223
Yeah. Virulence factor identification is a major focus of vaccine.

567
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:30,393
Research is to see how the disease.

568
01:26:30,543 --> 01:26:33,543
Then you want to turn off that mechanism.

569
01:26:37,003 --> 01:26:43,483
So three levels of rights and we talk about the individual a population.

570
01:26:45,043 --> 01:26:52,303
Then you were have effects on population reproduction number and for epidemiologist student and you

571
01:26:52,303 --> 01:27:02,503
probably have moments in one case or even probably has a student probably have it exposed to the concept.

572
01:27:02,593 --> 01:27:11,383
You know, one depends on how contagious disease, some disease could have multiple secondary kinds,

573
01:27:11,473 --> 01:27:16,153
while some limited only were on one respiratory infection.

574
01:27:16,483 --> 01:27:23,023
You were you have even more reproduction number of species from a highly contagious this

575
01:27:23,593 --> 01:27:31,813
infectious disease and mechanisms that can cause some of the reproduction so the vaccine

576
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:40,063
really have the effect and population reproduction number in other words through the control

577
01:27:40,063 --> 01:27:49,173
of infectious disease of the individual and reduction in infection or disease number,

578
01:27:49,483 --> 01:27:57,193
if we individual ever they can achieve for some reason immunity we just talked about.

579
01:27:57,703 --> 01:28:10,813
And then you couldn't expect to to have this population reproduction number reduced and the positive for the individual number is largely based on,

580
01:28:11,713 --> 01:28:18,313
you know, a relative reduction of the severity of the disease that maybe at a population.

581
01:28:18,313 --> 01:28:21,823
However, you are also likely to see this pattern.

582
01:28:22,423 --> 01:28:35,713
At the same time, the reduction of individual disease could also be translated into reduce the infectious contagiousness, because you say that's true,

583
01:28:36,253 --> 01:28:48,853
and then you could also impact population reproduction and overall or together you were reduce the epidemic in the population.

584
01:28:49,423 --> 01:28:59,353
I don't like this costume so much. It's widespread and is therefore more center making happen with this.

585
01:28:59,933 --> 01:29:12,012
And so we host the infection control after take up usually the pathogen if we take of it if the

586
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:21,453
pathogens and other Henson invasion where could effectively allow the pathogen get into the host.

587
01:29:21,763 --> 01:29:30,163
It could of course induce the growth of immune cell populations stigmatized by pathogens.

588
01:29:30,703 --> 01:29:40,483
And then the timing of growth can eliminate the infection before it becomes a serious or even symptomatic like a smallpox case.

589
01:29:40,843 --> 01:29:48,823
And as I say, reduce the severity or reduce risk in this is after the take out.

590
01:29:49,243 --> 01:29:58,573
So the relationship between the different phases of the following infection, you have illusion of prevention of take off.

591
01:29:59,233 --> 01:30:11,653
But if it's this pick up that did happen, it's a coup to induce some acquired immune control.

592
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:19,603
With this acquired immunity, it can generate antibodies and other standing immune elements.

593
01:30:19,993 --> 01:30:26,053
And this, of course, will translate to elicit a prevention of take up.

594
01:30:26,143 --> 01:30:33,882
So this is and then that's the immune elements also contributed to the acquired immune control.

595
01:30:33,883 --> 01:30:45,073
For example, the antibody antigen responses require the participation of full complement as you have probably learned your own immunology course.

596
01:30:45,373 --> 01:30:48,603
So they they all have some related.

597
01:30:48,613 --> 01:30:58,423
The fact here is basically a summary what I just say ideally a measurements of because that's a

598
01:30:58,433 --> 01:31:08,953
relationship ideally measurements of molecular and a similar effect could predict individual effect.

599
01:31:11,123 --> 01:31:22,073
Why it's important. Clinical trials effects the efficacy trials required for tens of thousands of people,

600
01:31:22,403 --> 01:31:31,913
especially for the disease that is not the actual infection happens after infection shortly incubation period.

601
01:31:32,033 --> 01:31:41,153
Some people won't work it if with some infection, as you know, you have to take an infection or,

602
01:31:41,963 --> 01:31:47,483
you know, some infection, something that's replaced as measure for disease.

603
01:31:47,753 --> 01:31:54,803
But when you have a very low dose of virus infection and the bacteria infection,

604
01:31:54,803 --> 01:32:01,433
TB is a good example of bacterial infection, HIV, hepatitis B or obesity.

605
01:32:01,973 --> 01:32:08,423
So this is some example of that kind of disease.

606
01:32:08,753 --> 01:32:16,613
Then if you want to measure efficacy, it's really a measure of the reduction in infection disease in the population.

607
01:32:16,613 --> 01:32:24,143
You may wait for a long time to the cases to make that calculation.

608
01:32:24,563 --> 01:32:31,193
So if you can measure the immune response to say, hey, this is the antigen or antibody,

609
01:32:31,233 --> 01:32:41,123
this sensor, IGT or whatever, this is equivalent to protective immunity.

610
01:32:41,543 --> 01:32:53,093
Then you can you just do what they call the immune tenacity survey epidemiology and to determine if people were being protected.

611
01:32:53,363 --> 01:33:05,083
We don't know after if you have a simple immune has just the test of the antibody generates let's say three weeks and three months.

612
01:33:05,093 --> 01:33:10,493
It depends on the consequences of the natural history of your particular infection.

613
01:33:10,943 --> 01:33:19,853
Or you can say, Oh, this person developed the protective immunity and the he or she will be protected.

614
01:33:20,303 --> 01:33:33,292
So that's the ideal situation. But because I told you for many passages, we are still learning about some of the protective immunity, including COVID.

615
01:33:33,293 --> 01:33:38,633
And so we don't necessarily have full immunity,

616
01:33:39,713 --> 01:33:50,363
immunological tests that could tell us what's the likelihood that these vaccinated people will be protected from the infection.

617
01:33:51,573 --> 01:33:57,683
Then another thing is ideally a measurement of the individual effects include predict the population effect.

618
01:33:58,193 --> 01:34:09,773
In other words, if the reduction of the disease in the individual could be translated into reduction of disease in the poultry nation,

619
01:34:10,343 --> 01:34:19,223
that's the generally speaking. But as you know, context are structure and the environmental conditions can affect the transmission.

620
01:34:23,003 --> 01:34:28,043
These or these factors can determine population effects.

621
01:34:28,793 --> 01:34:39,923
If the vaccine is introduced in a population where these are the factors environment, a compact structure is an.

622
01:34:42,173 --> 01:34:51,413
More prone to transmission than your population effect, which usually is a combination of the direct and indirect effect,

623
01:34:51,923 --> 01:35:02,423
will be lower because you have so many factors that enhance the likelihood for transmission or risk for transmission.

624
01:35:02,933 --> 01:35:15,783
So then this also is challenging population measurements because it requires a very large study sample of 10,000 typically vaccinated.

625
01:35:16,013 --> 01:35:27,533
The phase three trial where it needs to be in the place where the vaccine would be used and which year opens resource limited study.

626
01:35:27,743 --> 01:35:34,313
So now mathematical modeling has made some contribution to this kind of study.

627
01:35:36,283 --> 01:35:47,783
So when we talk about measuring the facts and facts of this history, leper and immunologist vaccine study, you can test,

628
01:35:47,893 --> 01:35:55,843
like I say, if we know if we know what we want to measure, but if we don't know what we want to measure, we can.

629
01:35:55,933 --> 01:36:03,643
We only can through measuring individual effects of either how much infection vaccinated the people get,

630
01:36:04,033 --> 01:36:15,673
how much disease severe reduction, and the how many transmission secondary cases generate by exposure.

631
01:36:15,763 --> 01:36:25,153
So this is basically you can measure infection, disease transmission following the vaccine.

632
01:36:27,003 --> 01:36:31,093
So this is then at a population level,

633
01:36:31,753 --> 01:36:42,463
you do the same because basically we recognize the individual effects could totally

634
01:36:43,213 --> 01:36:50,503
protect you from not getting infection disease or it could still make you sick.

635
01:36:50,983 --> 01:36:54,673
And the bad food is not so soon as you're given.

636
01:36:55,663 --> 01:37:00,593
So basically at the individual population, you were focused.

637
01:37:00,613 --> 01:37:12,853
Your outcome of interest in the measurement is infection, disease and transmission or epidemic frequency of how much transmission doing that.

638
01:37:13,423 --> 01:37:18,573
And the individual never basically is immune to pass the test.

639
01:37:21,433 --> 01:37:29,203
Then we come to the question what individual vaccine first has the largest population effect?

640
01:37:29,863 --> 01:37:38,473
Yeah. How much you want? Is sterilizing immunity better or is a reduction of the disease?

641
01:37:40,623 --> 01:37:52,473
This depends on similar situation. Giving a fix the percentage was in fact giving her margins makes them gave him more.

642
01:37:53,053 --> 01:37:59,823
You a situation where is it that where you know high risk of simulated infection.

643
01:38:00,363 --> 01:38:09,092
This is why vaccine effective efficacy studies if you have done you know outbreak proof population

644
01:38:09,093 --> 01:38:15,363
setting you were absolutely different efficacy as we've done in our channel for prevention.

645
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:26,843
But the one requirement for clinical trials is when you do the phase three trial, you must do the trial in the population.

646
01:38:26,853 --> 01:38:34,833
The vaccine is intended to be used, so your work consists of the moment.

647
01:38:35,973 --> 01:38:39,872
So if we gave you a fixed,

648
01:38:39,873 --> 01:38:46,952
the percentage of which in fact sterilizing immunity has the largest effect on

649
01:38:46,953 --> 01:38:52,323
population infection number you can imagine because it reduces the infectious source.

650
01:38:52,863 --> 01:38:56,193
It's a definite complete impact.

651
01:38:57,903 --> 01:39:11,223
But in another scenario, giving homogenous mix and really relatively reduction of susceptibility has a larger effect and population infection lever.

652
01:39:12,453 --> 01:39:22,443
And the reduction compared to when we see contagiousness is we talk about the people who had the disease,

653
01:39:22,923 --> 01:39:26,823
how much you shading, how much pathogen we can spread.

654
01:39:27,183 --> 01:39:33,633
But when we see susceptibility is people get protected not to get infected.

655
01:39:35,283 --> 01:39:41,252
We were discussed this concept in is the example repeatedly.

656
01:39:41,253 --> 01:39:45,213
So today is just first time to introduce this kind.

657
01:39:45,363 --> 01:39:51,242
All this comes another point is giving more.

658
01:39:51,243 --> 01:39:56,613
You use a situation where high risk of group disseminated infection relative

659
01:39:56,883 --> 01:40:06,513
contagious duction effects are with as if those the disease is not through randomly.

660
01:40:06,963 --> 01:40:13,713
You know contact is spreading it's a to some high risk population.

661
01:40:14,133 --> 01:40:23,703
Then if you can get to this a high risk population for contagious these controls, then you work more effectively controlling the.

662
01:40:27,683 --> 01:40:34,953
Epidemics in the population, but it's not ever a disease.

663
01:40:34,973 --> 01:40:37,702
You can use an inmate, you quantify the contact.

664
01:40:37,703 --> 01:40:48,502
It's only recently has there been much measurements of what the contentious effects of sex for a long time vaccine was based on, you know,

665
01:40:48,503 --> 01:41:00,893
efficacy study based on disease and or infection guess but now you think about the more different the potential impact of vaccine.

666
01:41:01,283 --> 01:41:07,743
You may measure difference like now we also measure COVID vaccines.

667
01:41:07,763 --> 01:41:14,873
Is success based on the reduction of the severe disease a hospitalization?

668
01:41:15,113 --> 01:41:24,233
Not just see if you get or not. Even now we have, you know, real life human.

669
01:41:24,453 --> 01:41:28,013
We're live with the pathogen.

670
01:41:28,343 --> 01:41:43,583
And as long that it's not cause severe disease, then it's still can be crusades effective to some extent.

671
01:41:45,683 --> 01:41:56,093
Then when you come to population, we the effect program assessment, immunization program assessment,

672
01:41:56,723 --> 01:42:05,303
we typically will measure direct and indirect the effects and the direct effects you all know

673
01:42:05,533 --> 01:42:14,363
know it's it's perceived that individuals where vaccine has syndrome or a killer effect.

674
01:42:15,053 --> 01:42:22,403
In other words, we've got vaccination and we have an immune response mounted following the vaccination.

675
01:42:22,823 --> 01:42:28,283
So the vaccine protects us from either infection or disease.

676
01:42:29,663 --> 01:42:37,433
That's the directly effects, which is side effects and the vaccinations of vaccine recipients and the indirect effects.

677
01:42:37,763 --> 01:42:52,912
It's occur what you often heard herd immunity and others who did not to receive the vaccine because of the reduction of contagiousness reduction

678
01:42:52,913 --> 01:43:06,143
of specific it then these people do not even didn't get the vaccine but because of the taxing of the infectious force in the community.

679
01:43:06,473 --> 01:43:11,273
So those are the direct effects unvaccinated individuals.

680
01:43:11,663 --> 01:43:18,713
Then you'll see the protection for long vaccinated every community.

681
01:43:19,403 --> 01:43:26,603
There will be always be some individuals who consider its effects right for different reasons.

682
01:43:26,653 --> 01:43:32,823
Even you just look at our recent COVID 19 vaccine roll out.

683
01:43:32,823 --> 01:43:42,142
So it's a different in face of the difference of priority and sometimes due to limited the resource,

684
01:43:42,143 --> 01:43:47,842
sometimes due to some and condition of the individual.

685
01:43:47,843 --> 01:43:55,343
Have you come to the vaccine? It's a life of the vaccine and the immunocompromised the individual should enough to get.

686
01:43:55,853 --> 01:44:08,933
And so this is a you know the the indirect effects from preventing the infection may stop chain of transmission.

687
01:44:09,293 --> 01:44:17,433
So this is what's stirred by some immunity can do and to also expose your redundancy diminished effect.

688
01:44:17,513 --> 01:44:26,993
This is what I just to say contacts the structure the presence of high risk population for the also alters the effects.

689
01:44:27,413 --> 01:44:41,213
So there you know a simple determination you really have to look into the population characteristics and the population structure,

690
01:44:41,393 --> 01:44:47,953
age and the geographic characteristics crowd use for those trends.

691
01:44:48,113 --> 01:45:00,173
How do you transmitted disease? Some effects can be indirect effects can be diminished due to the different environment factors that

692
01:45:00,833 --> 01:45:09,443
facilitates transmission and the indirect effects are almost always bigger than direct effects.

693
01:45:09,833 --> 01:45:17,903
That's why we want to vaccinate the population for communicable disease.

694
01:45:19,553 --> 01:45:23,783
And your question is about the three level of effects.

695
01:45:24,533 --> 01:45:26,303
And then when you.

696
01:45:26,683 --> 01:45:38,353
Talk about the utilization impact the we talk about direct and the entire answer makes this a different talk to why is that we talk about

697
01:45:39,073 --> 01:45:50,633
once the vaccine is giving an individual what's the level of effect or response you can have different immune response well can listen.

698
01:45:51,283 --> 01:46:04,303
And then for the individual who develops this molecular cellular response that's considered to be potentially protective immunity,

699
01:46:04,603 --> 01:46:10,063
then this individual will be, you know, protected from infection.

700
01:46:10,183 --> 01:46:18,853
If this you sterilize something or where have reduced the severity of the disease.

701
01:46:19,453 --> 01:46:25,663
And then this is the individual where what's the benefits, what in fact works.

702
01:46:25,693 --> 01:46:34,063
And then the community contents or these different individual, we're also see similar effects.

703
01:46:37,023 --> 01:46:40,873
In infection reduction and disease severity.

704
01:46:41,683 --> 01:46:50,413
This is that we talk about vaccination three different parts of the effect.

705
01:46:50,803 --> 01:47:03,673
But then I also discuss the vaccine effects in the context of assessing the impact of the immunization program.

706
01:47:04,423 --> 01:47:22,043
So in this context, context, we have the direct and indirect effects that besides understanding the difference, listen to potential impacts.

707
01:47:22,583 --> 01:47:32,753
You'll also want to understand that this is not purely based on facts and it's environmental factors.

708
01:47:32,933 --> 01:47:43,823
Population characteristics. Structure, how those cells may impact the risk of disease transmission.

709
01:47:45,803 --> 01:47:55,583
These impacts could be translated into the impact on indirect protection.

710
01:47:56,873 --> 01:47:59,933
So that is something.

711
01:48:00,063 --> 01:48:03,473
Yes, you're talking about.

712
01:48:04,783 --> 01:48:09,043
Percentage. Are you talking about? Percentage of.

713
01:48:11,903 --> 01:48:16,463
So. Yeah, that's.

714
01:48:19,063 --> 01:48:31,693
This one. This is a percentage with each effects talking about the sterilization versus reduction of full.

715
01:48:33,813 --> 01:48:38,373
Stir nicely in unity and a revolution of we party.

716
01:48:39,063 --> 01:48:43,143
So giving a fixed percentage with each in effect.

717
01:48:46,333 --> 01:48:59,703
The vaccine could, for example, a vaccine pop up for the vaccinated individual where pop up generates a stir and another hot fix.

718
01:48:59,743 --> 01:49:07,053
Well, it's a fix that it can be not quite the same, but it's not changed.

719
01:49:07,483 --> 01:49:17,053
Then you really you wouldn't expect the sterilizing immunity will have larger impacts on the population.

720
01:49:19,063 --> 01:49:31,873
So the fix the percentage with each effect reaching effective means of sterilizing versus reduction of the disease.

721
01:49:34,103 --> 01:49:37,443
No. Good. Thank you for the question.

722
01:49:39,033 --> 01:49:43,233
You know, I have a question. If not, I will move to some really fun facts.

723
01:49:43,503 --> 01:49:55,103
And you always have this question, your exam, because this is very important to understand this study design for measuring vaccine effects.

724
01:49:55,723 --> 01:50:00,563
Yes. I know many of you will be in in in, you know,

725
01:50:00,663 --> 01:50:12,613
public health practice and for your work as design study or involve the many physician read the clinical trials a lot of between trials.

726
01:50:13,443 --> 01:50:24,513
I am curious about the end of our public epidemics and also typically involved a lot of the clinical trial study.

727
01:50:24,783 --> 01:50:33,303
So I want to show you this slide is to show you the different kind of flu.

728
01:50:36,633 --> 01:50:44,163
Study design to measure different effects first to understand the effect so directly effects.

729
01:50:45,573 --> 01:50:52,023
I have this and I think means wherever points there is this population.

730
01:50:52,353 --> 01:51:04,293
So when we see direct effect basically we want to see how much protection it is in the it's in the people who get vaccination.

731
01:51:05,673 --> 01:51:15,753
So this study where require you to individual randomized randomized controlled trial with

732
01:51:15,993 --> 01:51:23,883
one group including many individuals for example half of these the course is vaccinated,

733
01:51:23,883 --> 01:51:30,843
another half are not vaccinated. So we will compare this school with this group.

734
01:51:32,163 --> 01:51:34,293
Does that make sense then you were.

735
01:51:36,243 --> 01:51:53,763
Yeah the cruise are showing on the oh Italian to show that who will understand what okay all right this about the word okay I was good okay.

736
01:51:54,093 --> 01:51:57,793
I know this is why I don't like this.

737
01:51:57,823 --> 01:52:03,333
You everyone's safe, but there you can see from here.

738
01:52:03,963 --> 01:52:19,323
So when we see measure effects, basically we will measure how much the outcome interest has been impacted by the vaccination.

739
01:52:19,713 --> 01:52:22,203
This outcome of the interest I mentioned,

740
01:52:22,593 --> 01:52:32,523
it could be control of the infection to come from the fact if a could also be measure the severe reduction of disease.

741
01:52:33,033 --> 01:52:37,353
That's the details and important at this time.

742
01:52:37,623 --> 01:52:42,423
So you could have a different outcome to measure.

743
01:52:42,873 --> 01:52:48,483
But what's important to understand here, it's how do we do a comparison?

744
01:52:49,113 --> 01:52:59,223
You have a population here, this will cover and the half of the population vaccinated have not vaccine.

745
01:52:59,673 --> 01:53:04,793
But the real situation is this too doesn't have to be reconciled.

746
01:53:05,163 --> 01:53:14,443
Depends on if you did not in principle how many disease in the population anyway you were helpful as

747
01:53:14,763 --> 01:53:22,143
in the same population you were headquartered half of the population vaccinated or not vaccinated.

748
01:53:22,623 --> 01:53:33,573
Then you will compel the the disease occurrence infection occurrence of occurrence of severe disease,

749
01:53:33,573 --> 01:53:39,393
the hospitalization death between the vaccinated and the lung.

750
01:53:40,923 --> 01:53:45,213
So just to clarify, so between those two, you would compare the direct effects,

751
01:53:45,213 --> 01:53:50,393
but the non-vaccinated population shouldn't see any direct effects because they weren't vaccinated, right?

752
01:53:50,513 --> 01:54:02,403
Correct. That's why when you look at the reduction of the disease in this group compared to this group, then this is the of protection.

753
01:54:05,163 --> 01:54:12,023
We can repeat some rain events and then some other things within that universe.

754
01:54:12,033 --> 01:54:17,943
In fact, it's really a high point in what population non-vaccinated the population, right?

755
01:54:19,143 --> 01:54:30,243
How that, in fact, could be possible because the universal link is appropriate in a population where that contains some vaccinated individuals.

756
01:54:30,543 --> 01:54:41,463
You can expect to reduce the infection, the disease severity that contributes to reduced reduction of infection force in this population.

757
01:54:42,813 --> 01:54:49,473
But this is a totally unvaccinated population. But nothing from giving the vaccine to any people.

758
01:54:50,913 --> 01:54:55,193
So these populations should not have any new virus infections.

759
01:54:55,203 --> 01:55:08,393
Correct. This population is a purple one. Nobody in their community had full of vaccine, so their infection source would be as many as normal with.

760
01:55:09,033 --> 01:55:16,203
But of these the population of absolute poverty in this community.

761
01:55:18,153 --> 01:55:24,033
They benefit from these people from less infectious centers.

762
01:55:24,543 --> 01:55:39,573
So what you do is you compare this disease occurrence in this with the disease or severe acute severe disease occurrence event.

763
01:55:40,773 --> 01:55:45,303
The difference is the indirect effects.

764
01:55:47,293 --> 01:55:57,523
But if you want to measure fabrics and the environment usually is, you measure this group.

765
01:55:58,303 --> 01:56:01,632
Why? Because this group. This group.

766
01:56:01,633 --> 01:56:13,463
And about this group. Okay. These schools, they definitely benefit from direct vaccination.

767
01:56:14,543 --> 01:56:23,873
But because there's a low vaccination population in this group, some also get some protection even better.

768
01:56:24,773 --> 01:56:33,353
So that will reduce the exposure and the risk for infection.

769
01:56:33,803 --> 01:56:47,743
So when you compare this group with this no vaccination group, you will see the direct effects of plus indirect effects.

770
01:56:50,653 --> 01:56:54,943
I can if I have to and I can do something.

771
01:56:56,173 --> 01:57:02,563
But I would do something different. I have to discuss the case so we can come.

772
01:57:04,543 --> 01:57:11,773
So where the air points is really where you would measure.

773
01:57:12,223 --> 01:57:17,353
So when you do the the you were paid to vaccinate people.

774
01:57:19,253 --> 01:57:23,453
Oh, yeah. Municipal population center.

775
01:57:24,353 --> 01:57:39,603
And then you go there, compare occurrence, outcome, interest with, uh, a population that's in the population.

776
01:57:39,623 --> 01:57:49,523
No, back and forth. So this is when come from this part, which is the poor part.

777
01:57:50,213 --> 01:57:53,593
This part. With this comparison we're making.

778
01:57:55,193 --> 01:58:05,182
But the utilization program, you also a lot of times you don't maybe for research of the a figure in the practice you

779
01:58:05,183 --> 01:58:13,252
you you being you want to understand overall how the program doing before you introduce

780
01:58:13,253 --> 01:58:20,273
vaccine that population is precision protecting so you're basically a simply a technical

781
01:58:20,273 --> 01:58:27,353
person this entire population where vaccine is introduced with the entire population.

782
01:58:30,003 --> 01:58:32,853
How are you measuring direct and indirect?

783
01:58:32,853 --> 01:58:39,573
How are you getting the indirect information that if you're not including non-vaccinated people from a partially vaccinated.

784
01:58:40,963 --> 01:58:56,383
Yeah, good question, because you have I'm sure nobody has the issues that matter in this group but this group besides the threat of the vaccination,

785
01:58:57,013 --> 01:59:04,353
they live in our community with the people who are protected through indirect effects.

786
01:59:05,203 --> 01:59:10,453
So these people seem very confused.

787
01:59:10,873 --> 01:59:15,683
Where do you reflect on the risk for infection for this group?

788
01:59:16,603 --> 01:59:28,133
So that's why when you measure this group, compare this population with this group one, you wear a measure that directly crosses.

789
01:59:32,463 --> 01:59:41,703
Does this make sense? Let's talk about who fired over basis of this the figures and pull together and yeah.

790
01:59:43,483 --> 01:59:48,733
Is the average person hopeful? I mean, is that so?

791
01:59:48,793 --> 01:59:59,743
I always ask the person, is every person, you know, expected to have a record and the indirect effect.

792
02:00:04,463 --> 02:00:10,262
And of course, this is the vaccine that will not hurt the environment for vaccines.

793
02:00:10,263 --> 02:00:13,343
For vaccines. Actually, I want to tell you this.

794
02:00:13,913 --> 02:00:18,893
You know. No. It's not always so.

795
02:00:18,993 --> 02:00:27,543
I give an example. Depends on the hands, which is the transmission round.

796
02:00:29,013 --> 02:00:34,963
If we saw respiratory disease, tougher new ones have both prevalence.

797
02:00:35,553 --> 02:00:38,973
It's not as food. You know something you direct, you.

798
02:00:40,083 --> 02:00:46,053
You only have a direct effect. And it's not just so human to human transmission.

799
02:00:46,563 --> 02:00:51,993
So you won't be able to see any indirect effects in that case.

800
02:00:52,503 --> 02:00:55,683
You can still see Title IX vaccine is not good sex.

801
02:00:56,223 --> 02:01:09,492
This is also important concept. And to the. Potential impact of vaccine on disease epidemiology, direct protection factor on the vaccination.

802
02:01:09,493 --> 02:01:15,223
The individual interacts direct personal effects and the unvaccinated,

803
02:01:15,943 --> 02:01:24,913
but it includes the potential increase of disease or potential decrease in the disease.

804
02:01:25,773 --> 02:01:38,643
Any questions? Okay.

805
02:01:39,033 --> 02:01:43,503
I can I can come back to you. I'm sure you will have some questions.

806
02:01:45,543 --> 02:01:58,593
Now, the question is which. Subpopulation in our community with benefits from the interior could benefit from the environment protection.

807
02:02:07,453 --> 02:02:10,693
Immunocompromised infection? Definitely.

808
02:02:15,323 --> 02:02:20,383
Infants. Cheers.

809
02:02:20,403 --> 02:02:28,593
And. Kids, older adults.

810
02:02:35,103 --> 02:02:45,183
If they are not eligible. Anyone who is not eligible for vaccination next year.

811
02:02:45,513 --> 02:02:48,603
People. People who have young kids.

812
02:02:48,873 --> 02:02:54,483
And you. You. Good, good. Good. Do not have access to medical.

813
02:02:59,813 --> 02:03:06,053
Okay. Very good. I had full coverage, a lot of sense of work for you.

814
02:03:06,773 --> 02:03:18,813
And that's an important reason that you want to give people, because they they are protective of that they can contribute to the protection of the.

815
02:03:20,513 --> 02:03:28,193
Anyway, that's good. I think you have covered the menu since we were also summarized in a little bit.

816
02:03:28,583 --> 02:03:34,263
Now I want to talk about the one at the expense of the other bits and the indirect,

817
02:03:34,503 --> 02:03:42,473
the immunity benefits of before we come back to so you can keep thinking these before any other

818
02:03:42,473 --> 02:03:52,793
population want to and so determinants of herd immunity benefits biological properties of the organism.

819
02:03:52,943 --> 02:04:01,912
I just talk about the settlements. Depends if it's a human to human transmission, then reduce the infectious source.

820
02:04:01,913 --> 02:04:12,323
In humans, we're definitely contributes to the reduction of the infectious source and the indirect effect, but only for tetanus.

821
02:04:12,323 --> 02:04:19,132
So soil contaminants in soil or other sun that's carried that bacteria.

822
02:04:19,133 --> 02:04:22,942
But it's not just a human. Then reduce the infected.

823
02:04:22,943 --> 02:04:26,223
The people in the population don't necessarily have that.

824
02:04:26,223 --> 02:04:35,713
The herd immunity and the epidemiology of the disease and the more transmission in that population that funding we're seeing.

825
02:04:35,723 --> 02:04:45,403
This impacts the bigger immunization strategies high mean and to complete the maximum.

826
02:04:45,413 --> 02:04:54,533
The strategy that maximizes the direct effects of you know, some childhood vaccination require more than one dose.

827
02:04:55,343 --> 02:04:57,233
Polio, for example, measles.

828
02:04:57,623 --> 02:05:14,183
And if you if the vaccination strategy do not maximize the direct effects, it could also reduce your herd immunity benefits, vaccine coverage.

829
02:05:14,423 --> 02:05:20,723
We have heard so much and recently trying to, you know, extended the coverage.

830
02:05:21,053 --> 02:05:25,943
And by by the way, when you're introducing your vaccine, this can be challenge.

831
02:05:26,513 --> 02:05:36,573
You know, there's always that debate is the better to provide the partial immunity by giving one dose or

832
02:05:36,653 --> 02:05:45,952
two to broader population or it's the to you know give or a lot of vaccine and some need it to a

833
02:05:45,953 --> 02:05:57,352
subpopulation and then some this has been discussed a improving facts and our emergency use is talking

834
02:05:57,353 --> 02:06:07,653
about if you you know it's better to not to get the third or fourth dose to everyone you raised.

835
02:06:07,673 --> 02:06:12,023
Instead we distribute some dose last the semester.

836
02:06:12,023 --> 02:06:13,502
My vaccine costs the student.

837
02:06:13,503 --> 02:06:24,323
We really want to discuss this so this is always the vaccine coverage and the vaccine coverage you it's not so there is a threshold.

838
02:06:24,653 --> 02:06:30,413
We will talk about, of course, the effectiveness analyzes of vaccination.

839
02:06:30,713 --> 02:06:38,123
It's not forever how well we have reached to certain thresholds.

840
02:06:38,453 --> 02:06:49,673
The increase of use of resource may not, you know, proportionate increase the protection, the effects.

841
02:06:50,063 --> 02:06:58,883
That's why it's also important to do, of course, effective and mechanism of action of the vaccine.

842
02:06:59,423 --> 02:07:04,613
Some vaccine is a focus like a gift,

843
02:07:05,093 --> 02:07:14,453
like a malaria vaccine and focusing on different lifecycle stages for like how safe from other vaccines

844
02:07:14,723 --> 02:07:24,772
somewhat specifically designed for the stage of the infection the parasite lifecycle that so we're not

845
02:07:24,773 --> 02:07:37,803
contribute to infection or comparisons for that vaccine you want to see as big herd immunity and vaccines

846
02:07:37,823 --> 02:07:46,193
are focus on other stages which we were discussing more details and duration of vaccine induced immunity.

847
02:07:46,823 --> 02:07:58,493
If we don't understand the duration of vaccine immunity, we may lose our opportunity to protect, to, you know, achieve.

848
02:08:00,403 --> 02:08:10,663
The direct effect it has to reduce the diminishes in the backs of the population who would in absolute say any herd immunity even in Syria.

849
02:08:11,683 --> 02:08:16,503
You these vaccines should protect you.

850
02:08:17,213 --> 02:08:21,493
The extent to which it can be boosted by nature exposure.

851
02:08:21,823 --> 02:08:33,193
This is also important and the the the you know sustains a protective immunity in our population can be achieved.

852
02:08:33,523 --> 02:08:44,953
So actually both vaccination and also the nature of infection of major infection until the disease is eliminated at the right place,

853
02:08:45,773 --> 02:08:52,873
if very few could achieve that. And you were still high for some people, not for this.

854
02:08:54,823 --> 02:09:09,373
The actually the infection. If we did it, it could also have some benefit in that it generates this the positive effects through a major infection.

855
02:09:09,793 --> 02:09:18,192
You actually can develop some protective immunity if you you are cured or you recovered

856
02:09:18,193 --> 02:09:29,083
from your infection and your immunity induced by natural infection could stay protected.

857
02:09:29,683 --> 02:09:37,613
And then I want to introduce you to this concept, what's called the herd immunity.

858
02:09:37,633 --> 02:09:41,113
We already talked about this isn't really in Syria.

859
02:09:41,443 --> 02:09:49,953
You were. Absolutely. But in the real world, the situation, you know that you were see some very.

860
02:09:50,623 --> 02:09:56,172
So community immunity is really an extension of the term of the herd immunity.

861
02:09:56,173 --> 02:10:00,823
That's what describes the community implication of vaccination program.

862
02:10:01,213 --> 02:10:09,643
This is simply the issue of the entire protection of among humans, both talking about, you know,

863
02:10:10,753 --> 02:10:20,713
humans that's long immune but community is impact of vaccination program in Syria is a

864
02:10:20,713 --> 02:10:26,773
function of the efficacy of the vaccine among individual recipient and of the coverage.

865
02:10:28,543 --> 02:10:44,593
So if the efficacy is so high and the coverage is also high, you could expect good, good, strong community impact.

866
02:10:44,893 --> 02:10:48,523
But in the real words, it's not always.

867
02:10:48,673 --> 02:10:54,003
So we have many issues to come see this truth.

868
02:10:56,293 --> 02:11:02,413
Why is the distribution of vaccine and for disease risk in the community?

869
02:11:02,893 --> 02:11:08,233
Even you say the vaccines distribute in some resource limited the community.

870
02:11:08,233 --> 02:11:18,223
They don't really necessarily understand the what condition the vaccine should be store like some life or vaccines very sensitive to your way life.

871
02:11:18,643 --> 02:11:25,633
You can see some school vaccination program has all the papers the setting the coach of

872
02:11:25,783 --> 02:11:32,003
the country they need your school and your life tenured maximum all gotten killed by.

873
02:11:32,863 --> 02:11:37,123
So if you don't have a cold the chain to distribute the vaccine.

874
02:11:37,123 --> 02:11:42,283
This is another important of problematic issue especially in global health.

875
02:11:42,643 --> 02:11:45,223
That's very it's a big concern.

876
02:11:45,583 --> 02:11:59,863
And then, you know, disease risk, I tell you, that's where the impact the the the it could even diminish the entire fact it's very high.

877
02:12:00,403 --> 02:12:08,982
And then the nature of the immunity induced by the vaccine if it's a partial or complete protection,

878
02:12:08,983 --> 02:12:14,473
if it's against the infection or reinfection or against the disease or transmission,

879
02:12:15,193 --> 02:12:22,633
and how much nature of boosting the population you actually get or this can contribute

880
02:12:22,633 --> 02:12:31,603
to very the indirect protection which has nothing to do with the vaccine itself.

881
02:12:32,253 --> 02:12:44,653
So indirect protection of livelihood by the persons born I think are helpful when I try to reduce some of the size, make some of the redundant.

882
02:12:45,523 --> 02:12:50,503
Sorry, you can do that. So back to our question.

883
02:12:50,713 --> 02:12:53,893
This is a mean of the points you have covered,

884
02:12:54,403 --> 02:13:03,942
some population benefit from the indirect protection children too young to have been vaccinated and the immunocompromised,

885
02:13:03,943 --> 02:13:11,403
the person who cannot make an adequate immune response, you know, they may be still giving the vaccine.

886
02:13:11,773 --> 02:13:19,513
That's because they are compromised in the occurrence of really months of the immune response.

887
02:13:19,783 --> 02:13:29,233
That's the vaccine is expected to induce and then persons with contradictions to vaccination and different conditions.

888
02:13:29,233 --> 02:13:40,663
That's at risk of HIV. In fact, the people can't get BCG backs, which is a life opportunity for us when we see life attenuated.

889
02:13:41,083 --> 02:13:51,763
It's a relative concept, you know, it's in the context of in terms of giving to immunocompromised individual if it's immune, the.

890
02:13:56,663 --> 02:14:07,913
You know, come from India. You can't do that. And the person who failed to mount adequate immune responses, they are either and some, you know,

891
02:14:08,153 --> 02:14:23,383
treatments that cure transplant patients and still treatments their immune is surprise you more after

892
02:14:23,393 --> 02:14:32,873
the chemotherapy that could also be a problem and persons in whom vaccine induced immune to his when

893
02:14:33,473 --> 02:14:43,192
and this has been and with the pertussis vaccine and the and some other including even press and the

894
02:14:43,193 --> 02:14:51,013
persons who are unvaccinated either by choice or because they do not have adequate access to vaccine,

895
02:14:51,443 --> 02:15:00,953
you would not be a believe or how what the population of which in the world in resource

896
02:15:01,013 --> 02:15:11,623
limited country can even not access to will approve the lung can use the vaccine currently.

897
02:15:11,633 --> 02:15:25,672
So these you know you limited the resource settings resource limited so then you really could the the population can

898
02:15:25,673 --> 02:15:39,923
really benefit from the indirectly fact but as I say it's enough over vaccine can to reduce that and then another

899
02:15:40,223 --> 02:15:49,522
problematic of this and relate to the vaccine effect measurements assessment in the population some problematical

900
02:15:49,523 --> 02:15:58,343
issues of risk the by the shift that you perspective from the individual to the community scale use concerns,

901
02:15:58,433 --> 02:16:02,873
contradictions, legal enforcement and exemptions.

902
02:16:03,203 --> 02:16:16,133
It's not part of it. Not every country has the same kind of public health law that you know, is in of vaccination and then access issue.

903
02:16:16,133 --> 02:16:21,503
Sometimes it's a personal choice. Sometimes it is resource limitation,

904
02:16:22,103 --> 02:16:33,143
public versus the private providers fixed the versus and mobile services and the routine versus the packaged programs there.

905
02:16:33,743 --> 02:16:38,713
A lot of the success of disease eradication or elimination.

906
02:16:38,933 --> 02:16:42,203
So vaccination usually require a combination of.

907
02:16:45,173 --> 02:16:51,683
You know, routine vaccination plus some more thoughtful campaigns.

908
02:16:52,493 --> 02:16:58,113
There is also, especially in some resources, limited the country.

909
02:16:58,193 --> 02:17:03,412
Often they were had for national immunization.

910
02:17:03,413 --> 02:17:18,203
Then where do we have that open access to a different health care facilities or setting setting and some surveys in schools,

911
02:17:18,203 --> 02:17:26,153
in remote villages, those were the national immunization phase.

912
02:17:26,693 --> 02:17:31,493
And what's most important is monitoring and evaluation.

913
02:17:32,303 --> 02:17:42,742
The reality is, in many settings where vaccine is very needed, very widely, you know,

914
02:17:42,743 --> 02:17:54,983
very they don't have monitoring system, then the vaccine impact is not able to assess even when you do clinical trials.

915
02:17:55,673 --> 02:18:03,143
And if they don't have good disease surveillance data, golden standard for disease detection,

916
02:18:03,533 --> 02:18:18,112
you would not be able to design a new trial or design and impose the license, you know, monitoring at the how the researchers address those issues.

917
02:18:18,113 --> 02:18:27,653
We would talk about that in the vaccine and clinical trials and you know shifting perspectives part.

918
02:18:30,083 --> 02:18:37,313
Yeah so this is raised by the shifts in position from the individual to the community.

919
02:18:37,553 --> 02:18:44,123
So when we talk about the vaccine effect, a lot of time we are talking about the individual.

920
02:18:45,473 --> 02:18:56,662
You get the vaccine, you have the effect you do. But when you think about the vaccine effects from individual to the community,

921
02:18:56,663 --> 02:19:04,973
looking at the communities impact you, there are many options that can have you can influence.

922
02:19:06,533 --> 02:19:17,123
So this is in other words, this is when you want to look at the protection in the context of community.

923
02:19:17,993 --> 02:19:26,153
There are a number of programmatic issues have to be considered, which includes the list here.

924
02:19:27,863 --> 02:19:31,493
Yes, basically, yeah. Not just to look at the individual.

925
02:19:31,913 --> 02:19:40,673
Individual could be great to perfect that. But as we get to the community looking at the community impacts, in other words,

926
02:19:40,673 --> 02:19:53,363
you can do community immunity versus a herd immunity fight in Syria and that that in the real world situation you have many impact factors.

927
02:19:55,833 --> 02:20:04,793
Good. Any other questions? So understanding you,

928
02:20:04,823 --> 02:20:15,373
this is very important that because it's important for the policy implications of the social benefits of environmental protection for regime,

929
02:20:15,943 --> 02:20:19,813
for a rational, for man thinking in your life.

930
02:20:20,173 --> 02:20:26,923
If you can establish this evidence for the indirect protection and the direct indirect,

931
02:20:27,073 --> 02:20:34,893
then you can provide the rationale for in man thinking immobilization.

932
02:20:35,053 --> 02:20:41,603
It's like if you look at our last of the vaccine vaccine introduction,

933
02:20:41,613 --> 02:20:50,683
we try to get the data and even data, you know, the protection infection and the severe disease.

934
02:20:50,983 --> 02:21:03,913
Then you come to provide some rational, scientific or rational evidence to recommend to the WHO should get all events not meant to protect them,

935
02:21:04,663 --> 02:21:10,242
and then also provides the justification of the vaccine in your compensation program.

936
02:21:10,243 --> 02:21:19,003
A child whose vaccine is not the only you driving direct of protection but is also helping to protect of the community.

937
02:21:19,633 --> 02:21:26,233
So this is not just an individual, it's also the contribution to the community protection.

938
02:21:26,503 --> 02:21:33,343
Hence, the society has some obligations for any injuries incurred by the vaccination.

939
02:21:34,003 --> 02:21:40,273
United States does have that compensation program, but it's not for every country.

940
02:21:40,813 --> 02:21:44,673
And yeah, another important policy.

941
02:21:44,683 --> 02:21:57,162
It's important in determining the future course of the pilot immunization policy as new vaccines have become more costly and the issues of the

942
02:21:57,163 --> 02:22:06,993
entire protection benefits have become increasingly important in determining whether to introduce new vaccine and to to whom they should be given.

943
02:22:07,613 --> 02:22:20,883
And, you know, a lot of good development by the gates of giving this global alliance the vaccination and immunization vaccine,

944
02:22:20,893 --> 02:22:27,043
and that realization some seed funding to start their product program.

945
02:22:27,583 --> 02:22:36,823
But then if the government wants to to commit some funding, we're dependent on the benefits.

946
02:22:37,063 --> 02:22:51,703
So you have to measure this to understand that if we are rational to make this investment and new questions are so much today, I feel for my.

947
02:22:52,273 --> 02:22:55,363
I'm sorry, how do you feel?

948
02:22:56,053 --> 02:23:03,373
Any questions? No.

949
02:23:03,673 --> 02:23:09,433
Everything is clear. Okay, then it's okay.

950
02:23:09,633 --> 02:23:14,463
This was not complete because of this concept of working in the prisons.

951
02:23:14,503 --> 02:23:21,582
I also hope to have some very fruitful discussions, such an open discussion with our staff.

952
02:23:21,583 --> 02:23:26,773
Figure out some things. Try to give some examples for you to practice for some longer.

953
02:23:27,223 --> 02:23:30,463
And then maybe. Yeah.

954
02:23:31,003 --> 02:23:33,313
Okay. Thank you for your attention.

955
02:23:33,733 --> 02:23:48,373
Have a good weekend and I will upload the PDF file of the Dr. Frieden lecture, maybe this weekend to them and something else.

956
02:23:49,423 --> 02:23:53,773
And then also a reading and to prepare you for next spring.

957
02:23:54,123 --> 02:24:01,573
But it will be next week and we're also has what is custom since to your a lot of things.

958
02:24:04,513 --> 02:24:08,363
Okay. Have a good weekend. Thank you again for your help.

959
02:24:09,013 --> 02:24:14,293
It's not enough. We appreciate your time.

960
02:24:18,013 --> 02:24:25,623
Okay. Now I need to stop. I hope it's good.
