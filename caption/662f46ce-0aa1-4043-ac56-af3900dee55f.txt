1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:07,350
All right. There you go. Can we go?

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:14,969
Yes, please do. So a new study that was just released last week by the National Institute of Health has

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,950
indicated that women who have been using hair straightening products are more relaxing.

4
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,700
Products may be at a higher risk of developing uterine cancer.

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:34,520
And so among the researchers leading this study was Dr. Alexander White, who is the head of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

6
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:44,519
And in addition to this study, she has led and really kind of been at the forefront of a lot of research into beauty,

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:55,580
cosmetic products, research, and in investigating those impacts on hormonally associated cancers such as breast and other cancers.

8
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:06,569
And so this study found and this study found a lot of it's research from something called the sister study,

9
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:14,549
which is really well known for being kind of one of the first instances in the last 30 or 40 years

10
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:23,280
of kind of tracking breast cancer and other hormonally associated cancers in the United States,

11
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:33,479
particularly. It's impact is so great because it tracks women from all 50 states in addition to Puerto Rico and across all walks of life.

12
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:43,469
And so this study was a national it was a nationally based prospective cohort study, and it used data from nearly 50,000 women.

13
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:52,110
And it concluded that among those women who regularly use permanent hair dye in the year prior to enrolling in this study,

14
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,330
9% were more likely than women who didn't use hair dye to develop breast cancer.

15
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:05,249
So this wasn't the first study that showed an increased risk of hormone related cancers in women who use these kind of girls.

16
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:11,970
Because hair dyes, beaches and straighteners have been linked to breast cancer as well as ovarian cancer.

17
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,190
And women who use these products more frequently are more likely to develop cancer.

18
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,130
And so another important topic that this article talked about was some of the disparities in these cancers.

19
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,580
So for both incidence and prevalence, there's higher rates for black Americans compared to white Americans.

20
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:36,180
And one of the reasons for that could be that black women were more likely to use these hair straightening products.

21
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:43,050
And this was due for a variety of different reasons, one of them being societal pressures of having straight hair.

22
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,870
So in this study, 60% of the women who use these hair straightening products were black.

23
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:56,310
And so researchers and public health professionals can use this information to guide different interventions,

24
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,950
maybe in terms of education and preventing the use of some of these toxic chemicals.

25
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,680
So what were the conclusions of the study?

26
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:13,380
Over the 11 year long study, 378 cases of uterine cancer were diagnosed among among the 33,497 participants.

27
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,930
The research team estimated that roughly 1.6% of women who never used hair

28
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,410
straightening products would go on to develop uterine cancer by the age of 70.

29
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,440
But for frequent users, the risk goes up to 4.05%.

30
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,500
Other hair products like hair dyes, highlights and Perms did not have the same link to cancer.

31
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,889
However, when asked if women should stop straightening their hair,

32
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:40,770
researchers stressed that uterine cancer is still relatively rare and that it may be too early to make a firm recommendation,

33
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,730
since it's unlikely that any single factor explains the women's risk.

34
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,040
But avoiding these chemicals might be one thing that women can do to reduce their risk of cancer.

35
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,310
So we picked this article because it was interesting and heavily related to many of the concepts that we talk about in class.

36
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,280
This includes that the disparities that we mentioned,

37
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:06,180
although no differences in the association between hair straightener use and cancer risk between racial groups were observed.

38
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,210
Adverse health effects could be more consequential for black women because of more frequent hair product use.

39
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,620
Additionally, it relates to how environmental exposures can affect cancer risk.

40
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:23,610
Also, something that we thought was interesting was how the researchers did not ask participants to report to particular brands or chemicals.

41
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:31,170
While this may have mitigated a recall bias since remembering that you have straightened your hair, it's easier than remembering what product you use.

42
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,620
We believe that including this information, could have led to more data,

43
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,000
and it would be interesting to know if a certain product was more heavily associated with uterine cancer risk.

44
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,940
But the who's gone through it? So have you gone to a salon and had your hair dyed or straightened or something like that?

45
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,599
What product did they use? What brand was it like?

46
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,740
Unless you're buying it and doing at home, you probably have. Absolutely. I don't I have no idea.

47
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:01,110
I couldn't begin to tell you. I've had my hair highlighted a bazillion times and I have zero idea any of those times which one it was.

48
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,030
So we actually we actually ganged.

49
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:11,070
I'm first of all, product use for my cars. So it's one of the things that we're going to be using.

50
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,830
And I think one of the things to really point out I'm sorry, guys, that I didn't like about it, I didn't make it.

51
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,590
I totally took over. He worked on. That was a great job.

52
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:25,740
Oh, I was going to say one of the things about the sister study is that it did enroll African-American women.

53
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,750
Right. And so most of the previous studies probably didn't like the the list of questions

54
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,540
on their personal product use is very clearly for both white and black women.

55
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,070
Right. So if you had a question that mostly white women probably wouldn't ask too much about, like skin whiteners,

56
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,709
hair relaxers, you know, that kind of thing, because those are products that are mostly used by black women.

57
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,250
Right, or women of color. And so those are on that list.

58
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:56,850
And I think part of the issue with the sister study is or part of the the thing that makes it novel and really helpful is that it did

59
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:03,359
in all those women and ask those questions that are like particular personal product use that is much more common in black women.

60
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,440
And so now we're able to actually see these results. I think it's really interesting, too.

61
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,580
Should people stop doing this? You know, they're not going to say, oh, my God, I never do that.

62
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,209
I get that right. Because that's I guess everybody was done with most things.

63
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,130
Everybody takes on a certain amount of risk, like bacon is listed on the W.H.O. list of carcinogens.

64
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:26,100
I'm going to have a little bit of bacon every so often, you know what I mean? Like, when I go out to breakfast once every couple of months,

65
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:31,919
I'll probably get a couple of certain things that you I mean, but like, everybody takes on their own risk.

66
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,100
And I guess if you really like getting your hair straightened, that's that's great.

67
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:42,060
But I think it's really interesting when when researchers find this stuff and then change their own behaviors.

68
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,170
So we peirce's one of my colleagues,

69
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:51,240
she used to work at USC and she had a colleague out there who said bladder cancer and she published a paper about hair dye,

70
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:57,540
increasing their supply of cancer. And we haven't seen her for a little bit and went to some event out there and saw

71
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,599
her and her hair was completely gray because she had just stopped starting for hair.

72
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:07,560
She was like, I'm not doing it. I don't care. Found that it was at a rapid rate so good for her.

73
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,879
But I always think it's interesting when people like clearly very much believe

74
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,220
their research because they're willing to change their own behavior based on it. I think that's an.

75
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:23,190
Any other thoughts that I would like to share? Yes, I'm dying to hear.

76
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,470
All right. Great. Great advice. Thank you.

77
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,730
Okay. Now, everyone's noted the stack of exams up here. I will give them back at the end and give you a few minutes to look through them.

78
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,770
Everybody did really well. You should be able to see your grades on canvas at this point.

79
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:51,280
So everybody did a great job and everybody should feel good about their performance.

80
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,360
You should also be able to see my comments on your outlines.

81
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:04,990
Yeah. If anybody can't let me know, that's a canvas problem, not a I finished them all, so you should be able to see them at this point.

82
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,159
Okay. Any other kind of. Oh, one more housekeeping thing.

83
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:15,850
We do have a, um, a for next time.

84
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,340
We have an activity that you need to do before class.

85
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:28,060
So I want you to here's the food frequency questionnaire, and this is an online 24 hour dietary recall.

86
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,739
So part of what we're going to talk about next time is dietary assessment of how we assess diet.

87
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,190
And most people have never. Who's ever done a food frequency questionnaire?

88
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,930
Yeah. And most people have I mean, some people have done like a diet, a diet diary or whatever.

89
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:51,730
I get that. But you are kind of doing both and sort of seeing the differences in assessment between the two methods I think is useful.

90
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,310
So I want you guys to do both of those.

91
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:03,040
Um, and then on this discussion thread comment, a short reflection on what you thought of the two assessment, how useful they might be.

92
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:10,780
And then in order to receive full credit completed by 9:30 a.m. for next time, does that make sense?

93
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,590
Okay. I realize there may be some reasons that people don't feel comfortable filling out a dietary questionnaire.

94
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,180
If that's true for you. That's fine. Just give me a quick note.

95
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:30,700
Say, I don't think I should do this. That's fine. Okay. All righty.

96
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:39,209
Any questions before we dove into smoking? Right.

97
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:45,000
Smoking's bad. It causes cancer. Well, have a great day. There's a little more to it than that little bit.

98
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,230
We'll go into a little more detail and just a little bit of history.

99
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,030
So, you know, it used to be that lung cancer was rare.

100
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,070
It was the weird cancer that like doctors would call patients,

101
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,359
like residents and or medical students and be like, oh, my God, I got one of these cases.

102
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,660
You should see it, you know. And now, of course, it's the most common cancer.

103
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,850
But we didn't always know that smoking was the reason for it.

104
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:15,110
And this was this winter. And Graham study was one of the first studies that really looked at evidence.

105
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,630
This is the first study published in 1950 showing evidence that tobacco smoking was potentially a cause of lung cancer.

106
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,290
So it's kind of a seminal study. I think it's really interesting to kind of go back in time.

107
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,470
Every year I teach this class, you guys get younger and younger, it turns out.

108
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,980
And it's really interesting, like how many people have watched the movie from the eighties and just found it really jarring, like all of the smoking.

109
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,230
It's I mean, even to me, having lived through the eighties, when I go back and watch,

110
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,330
watch those movies, I'm like, Oh my God, people are smoking everywhere, everywhere.

111
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,550
Like how many people have gone and sat in a smoking section in the restaurant?

112
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,130
I knew it was going to happen someday, but you guys, no one would have had that experience, right?

113
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,910
My grad students still, some of them say yes, but like, yeah, when I would go into a restaurant,

114
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:07,620
my parents were smoking or non smoking and I don't know what good it did you until like we in the nonsmoking section

115
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:13,770
which was like feet away from the smoking section because it turns out that smoke circulates and it did you know,

116
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,990
smoke can actually move in the air. It's not like there's some magical barrier between the smoking pot smoking sections.

117
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:32,850
So yeah, so there's been a lot of like in my lifetime, a huge shift in terms of what people, the, the attitudes, social attitudes towards smoking.

118
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:38,759
I would say one of my favorite examples of this, I really like the ads.

119
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,490
So we'll look at the ads leaving nose and throat specialist suggest that you change to Philip morris.

120
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:50,490
So there used to be all of these ads that were like about doctors promoting smoking.

121
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:56,700
And I'm going to show you a site that has all of these ads. But this is the first surgeon general's report.

122
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:03,480
Does anybody know when this came out on smoking and health close 1964?

123
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,559
Very, very close.

124
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,800
So the first study like kind of saying that this seems to be cigarets that's causing this huge lung cancer increase came out in 1950.

125
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,790
And then in 19, after more data came out in 1964,

126
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:19,199
the U.S. surgeon general put out this report on smoking and health, saying, yes, smoking is causing lung cancer.

127
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,840
And there have been multiple surgeon general's reports after that.

128
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:32,550
This whole thing really reads like almost like some sort of weird industrial espionage film or book or something like that.

129
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:38,520
Right. Because what the links that the tobacco companies went through to kind of conceal that their

130
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,889
product was addictive and killing people and to be able to continue to sell it are just astounding.

131
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:48,959
Right. Here's some ads that came out kind of after the surgeon general's reports came out.

132
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,370
Considering all I heard, I decided to either quit or smoke. True, and I smoke true.

133
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:59,970
My mom smokes trees. That was her brand. So, I mean, it's just it's kind of shocking.

134
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,450
Right. Here is the website I was telling you about.

135
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,799
And I just if you ever want, like, I think practically it's interest.

136
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:14,760
It's good to have this info about it because if you ever need like pictures for a talk or something like that,

137
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:21,719
right is a really great place to get that. But this is the research into this is the Stanford research into the impact on tobacco advertising.

138
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:28,560
So if you go to Cigarets, they have 28 collections rate doctors for your throat, for your health.

139
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,040
So who what do you guys want to look at that one for me.

140
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,330
Movie stars. Where? Here we go. Well, you've got let's see, women.

141
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,100
These are older. Anybody recognize it or is that Lucille Ball?

142
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,040
I love Lucy. I think that's I love Lucy.

143
00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:02,500
And, you know, I think at some point it became not cool anymore to but, you know, like old Hollywood, these women were everywhere.

144
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,270
I recognize her, but I don't know her name.

145
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,040
So I think this isn't going to be as fun as we'd hoped because most of us probably don't know who these people are.

146
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,170
If I don't know, I'm suspecting you guys don't know. But maybe I'm wrong.

147
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,430
No, you don't know. All right, let's go back and find a different one. How about.

148
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,820
Oh, Lord, kids? This is upsetting children.

149
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,930
Oh, man, there's so many collections.

150
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,360
I know. And it goes clouds.

151
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:39,720
What I love is I could spend an hour and a half just looking through this website with you guys because it is it's truly shocking.

152
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,270
But like, this was everywhere. It was everywhere. Right.

153
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,890
And so I think if you think this kind of stuff is interesting, having a little poke around this website would be a lot of fun.

154
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,030
And it's just this very interesting like recent history of our country.

155
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,579
Right. That I think is kind of fascinating. Plus,

156
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:01,840
it's a really good source of like potentially semi shocking images for your talk if you're going to give a talk with anything to do with smoking.

157
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:07,460
All right. All right.

158
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:15,010
So lots of surgeon general reports. If you go to a surgeon, this is an old screen shot.

159
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:22,180
But if you go to surgeon general, Don, go, you can go to the library, go to reports, and then you've got all kinds of hoops.

160
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:27,460
It turns out if you do that, it doesn't scroll down the page because that's a screenshot that moves you to the next slide.

161
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:33,370
Okay. So here you got all of these different things. You've got e-cigarette use, you've got 50 years of progress.

162
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:37,269
We're going to talk quite a bit about this report. So each of these like since 1964,

163
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:43,720
they've had multiple different reports come out but have kind of refined and added to the data on smoking and health.

164
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,380
All right. So the 2001 report was a big one because it was talking about smoking among women.

165
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,300
And we're going to talk a little bit more about this and some of the data that went into it in a little bit.

166
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,720
But the major findings were that the gender specific difference narrowed.

167
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,580
And since 1985, the decline in prevalence among men and women has been comparable.

168
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,410
Smoking prevalence decreased among women from 1965 to 1998.

169
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:15,570
Okay, but there haven't been that much recent decline that the prevalence was three times higher among men,

170
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,479
women with less education than women with more education.

171
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:27,309
And that is something that we're going to see kind of repeatedly, is that as we have made a lot of strides in smoking cessation.

172
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:31,970
Right, because that is the number one primary prevention force lung and like a bazillion cancers, right?

173
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:38,819
Like if we get magically erase smoking, we would magically erase a third of cancer, which is or more a third of cancer.

174
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,139
Just the lung cancers is a third of cancer and then all of the smoking associated cancers for every other side.

175
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:52,830
So it would be huge. Right. But what we're seeing now is that smoking is a disparity.

176
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:59,370
Right? The groups that are still smoking at higher levels are less educated.

177
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:07,670
There's a racial component right there. All kind of these social determinants that are associated with higher smoking prevalence.

178
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:13,950
Right. And so the like higher educated, higher as yes, people are not smoking very much at all.

179
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,900
Right. So it's those other groups that we're going to have to do a little bit more work to kind of get to.

180
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:28,050
Okay. 224 Smoking harms nearly every organ of your body causing many diseases.

181
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:33,000
Quitting smoking has immediate as well as long term benefits, reducing the risk for diseases.

182
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,670
Smoking cigarets with lower tar and nicotine provides no clear benefit to health.

183
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,919
And I was involved in one of one of the big studies that supported this.

184
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:50,370
And I'm going to show you a little bit about that in a minute. And then the list of diseases was expanded to include all of these different things.

185
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,240
There's also these tobacco control monographs, the cancer control, the population sciences.

186
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,100
Behavioral research. Behavioral research. Site.

187
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,170
So lots and lots of stuff. This is a little bit more like behavioral,

188
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:10,399
like it says write less about like reporting the associations and the prevalence

189
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,350
and kind of the biological associations more about like the role of media,

190
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:21,150
right? Those who do continue to smoke, like who are the people who continue to smoke?

191
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,210
Changing adolescent smoking prevalence, you know, those kinds of things.

192
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,660
So a little bit more with that sort of ones, but there's a lot more here as well.

193
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:35,549
All right. So now we're going to talk about the 2014 report because it was 50, 50 years after the 1964 report.

194
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,610
So it was a really big one that came out and kind of like 50 years of progress.

195
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:47,370
Where are we 50 years later? So since the first surgeon general's report, more than 20 million premature deaths can be attributed to cigaret smoking.

196
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:54,209
The tobacco epidemic was initiated and has been sustained by the aggressive strategies of the tobacco industry,

197
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,390
which has deliberately misled the public on the risks of smoking. Cigarets.

198
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:04,380
That's big. That's a very bold and clear statement, blaming the tobacco industry for a lot of things.

199
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:10,260
Right. And we're going to get into a little bit of the history of that. They added some newly identified diseases.

200
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,879
I mean, like everything basically everything you can put on the list as being associated with

201
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,700
smoking with a couple of like endometrial cancer being the one that we don't know about.

202
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,700
Right. Let's see.

203
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,020
Exposure to second hand tobacco smoke has been causally linked to cancer.

204
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:34,890
This was a huge one. This was one that the tobacco companies really fought against and really tried to

205
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,480
obfuscate the findings about secondhand smoke because it was much easier to do.

206
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,070
How do you collect information on how much secondhand smoke somebody has been exposed to in their life?

207
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:50,180
I want you all to think for a moment what a cigaret smoke smell like, you know.

208
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,870
Can you imagine it in your head? You have been exposed to cigarets with secondhand smoke.

209
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,300
How much could you fill out a questionnaire and tell me? It's very, very hard.

210
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,770
So some of the ways they did it is like people who worked in places where smoking was

211
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,969
allowed or people who lived with a partner or a family member who smoked in the house.

212
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:15,090
Right. That kind of thing. But it's hard, right, to to really quantify someone's secondhand smoke exposure.

213
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:22,140
And so it was easy because when you have a lot of mis measurement, what does that do to your finding?

214
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:32,240
If you have non differential misclassification, it it biases your finding toward the null, right?

215
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,030
So it was really,

216
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:39,630
really easy for the tobacco companies to hire their own experts who could massage the data and make it look like there was nothing going on.

217
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,700
So in 2014 we say yes, secondhand smoke is causing sex.

218
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:50,000
Disease risk from smoking by women have risen sharply. We're going to talk about that.

219
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,600
I don't know that they've really risen. We're going to talk about kind of what that means.

220
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,930
OC cigaret smoking has other adverse effects.

221
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,799
Large disparities in tobacco use remain across groups defined by race, ethnicity,

222
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,520
education and socioeconomic status and across regions of the country.

223
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,260
So there's a big take home message here.

224
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:15,580
And since the 1964 surgeon general's report, comprehensive tobacco control programs and policies have been proven effective.

225
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,020
Further gains can be made, and the burden of disease,

226
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:26,230
death and disease from tobacco use in the U.S. is overwhelmingly caused by cigarets and other combusted tobacco products.

227
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:36,780
Right. So this was a big report that came out with some very clear, bold statements, which usually the government is not super into.

228
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,120
But here we are. Right. All right.

229
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:43,900
Premature deaths caused by smoking. So this is part of that 2014 report.

230
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,000
Between 1965 and 2014, smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke.

231
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:59,580
This is where they get that 20 over 20 million number. These numbers are so big, it's almost hard to wrap your brain around how many that is.

232
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,489
Right. But smoking related cancers is up there.

233
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,930
But of course, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases is even higher than that, right?

234
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,980
Yes. What is the presidential? Yeah.

235
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,560
That's just like. Yeah. Like people fell asleep smoking in bed.

236
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,670
Oh. And lit themselves on fire.

237
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:28,740
In their house? Yes. So don't smoke in bed. Everyone does smoke, but especially.

238
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,160
Please don't smoke in bed. It turns out your bedding is flammable.

239
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:37,710
And also you are if you try hard enough. So, yeah.

240
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,800
Yes, that's what that is.

241
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,560
And I think that's, again, something that like you guys may never have heard of, but it was actually like a thing that happened fairly.

242
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,690
I well, I want to say frequently,

243
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:54,100
but like it was a thing that people would like their house on fire because they had a cigaret going and they fell asleep.

244
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,320
Okay. So this is total cigaret consumption.

245
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:05,330
This is saying that, you know, it continued to rise for 20 years after the surgeon general's report came out.

246
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:11,259
Right. So it took a long time to have that social pressure and, you know, the real sea change.

247
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,370
But it has since come down, but it's still, you know, billions every year.

248
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:25,990
Right. All right. And this was also this was, you know, in 2013, new evidence that cigaret smoking remains the most important health hazard.

249
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:33,250
So it's a really up there, right? I mean, not only is such a huge risk factor for lung cancer, it's a pretty strong risk factor for most cancers.

250
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:40,120
And it causes all of these other things. Right. So it's just like as far as public health, bad actors go, smoking is like top of the list.

251
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,730
I would say these are some of the cancer causing chemicals in tobacco smoke.

252
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,760
It's kind of horrifying if you read the list.

253
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:54,490
There's a lot of things on there that we have known for a long time are poisons, but I don't think we always knew that they were in tobacco smoke.

254
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:03,270
It wasn't until recently that tobacco companies were required to disclose what was in their product.

255
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:12,780
And that was part of the Tobacco Control Act, which gave the FDA the authority to regulate the manufacture,

256
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,900
distribution and marketing of tobacco products. When do you think that came out?

257
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:24,760
What year? Seems like a pretty basic thing, right?

258
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,340
Seems like that should have been in place for a long time. Right.

259
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,170
Don't nobody peek. You can't you can't scroll head and pick.

260
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:44,420
But give me a guess. What do you think? Yeah.

261
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,650
1990. Sounds reasonable. Sure. 2009.

262
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,950
Yeah. Can you believe that? That's bonkers, isn't it?

263
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,760
Restrict tobacco marketing and sales. Do you require smokeless tobacco, product warning labels, insurance?

264
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:04,960
Modified risk claims are supported by scientific evidence and require requires disclosure of ingredients of tobacco products.

265
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:17,170
In 2000 might finally have to tell us what the modified risk thing is about the reduced tar calling things light and ultralight.

266
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:21,670
And I'm going to talk to you about that in just a moment. So let's talk about litigation,

267
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:25,450
because this has been kind of a weird process by which we have enacted a lot of our

268
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:30,909
tobacco control policies rather than having it be through like government going,

269
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:34,080
Oh yeah, this is bad, we need to enact some sort of control over this.

270
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,760
It has really happened a lot more through litigation.

271
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:42,730
So the first wave of tobacco litigation was in the 1950s and the tobacco companies won hands down.

272
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:50,350
And it was the claims were about negligent manufacture, product liability, like negligent advertising fraud.

273
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,280
And the tobacco manufacturers responded with defense strategy,

274
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,960
saying that the package wasn't harmful if someone smoked and got cancer, it was because of something else.

275
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:07,870
Couldn't prove that it was the smoke, the cigarets that did it, and that smokers assumed the risk when they decided to smoke and they won.

276
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:14,770
The second wave in the 1980s is when the idea of addiction was introduced and the plaintiffs sued,

277
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:19,870
claiming that the tobacco companies knew Cigarets were addictive and cause cancer. But the tobacco companies were mostly successful here.

278
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,410
It wasn't really until the 1990s and onwards that the plaintiffs became more successful.

279
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:33,340
So this was because cigaret company documents were leaked showing that the companies were aware of the addictive nature of cigarets.

280
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,920
So there was a whole how many? I think they made a whole movie about it. Like how many people know about this whole thing?

281
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,370
Yeah. So up until then, the Packer companies were like, No, it's not addictive.

282
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:49,019
Or they were saying at least that they didn't know it was addictive when they've been captured and advertised as people.

283
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:56,639
And then there was an actual whistleblower, like a person who leaked these documents that very clearly stated that they knew it was

284
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,320
addictive and that they were using that as part of their strategy for keeping people,

285
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:07,050
customers. Right. It was a plus for them. It was a pro and they knew that it killed people.

286
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,660
So after that, everybody was a little more successful in suing them.

287
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,190
And the master settlement agreement came out in 1988 because there were like all of these suits that came out.

288
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,050
So they kind of made one big master settlement agreement.

289
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:26,070
And then there were after that individual suits, including ones about light cigarets I believe this master settlement agreement,

290
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,600
money was given to the states and then it could actually I know people who've

291
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,690
like actually gotten the master settlement agreement funding to do research,

292
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:40,830
for example. And so I think it funds a lot of things, including anti tobacco advertising like cessation programs and stuff like that.

293
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:51,120
Okay. So here's the thing about light cigarets. So these two guys are really big players in the the tobacco epidemiology world.

294
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:59,520
So Jon Samet was the chair of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins when I was there as a Ph.D. student.

295
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,879
And he has since gone on, I believe, to somewhere in California.

296
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,459
And then I think you may also have switched again since then, but he did a ton of work on on lung cancer.

297
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:14,580
He was involved in a lot of he was from New Mexico and he did a lot of work on radon and lung cancer, like in his earlier career.

298
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,389
But in his later career, he actually did a lot of like testifying before a joint session of Congress about

299
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:25,620
tobacco and things like that in a lot of these litigation kind of scenarios.

300
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:33,030
Michael Tune was my, I don't know, great grand boss when I worked at the master's level at the American Cancer Society.

301
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:38,219
So they had kind of two they have the analytic side that like worked on the cohorts and like published

302
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,240
scientific papers and then they have the surveillance side that does all the cancer facts and figures work.

303
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:46,229
And I worked in the analytic side and they were like a head person of each of those,

304
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,870
and he was in charge of both, like he was the head guy in charge of that.

305
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:56,880
So story time, when I first started working, I started working there like me because I graduated and then I started my job right when I graduated.

306
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:04,200
Right. The way it kind of worked is that you got paired at the Master's, that you were paired up with a Ph.D. level person.

307
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,279
You were their analyst, right?

308
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:10,950
So they came up with research ideas and then you would do the programing essentially to kind of execute those research papers.

309
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:17,190
And you ended up like middle author of a bunch of papers. It was a great job. And so I got paired up with Carmen Rodriguez, who is wonderful.

310
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:28,410
And she, however, was from Spain. And so she had a plan to go away for like six weeks to visit family in Spain very shortly after I started my job.

311
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,400
So I'm like brand new and my boss is gone and I've got nothing to do.

312
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,350
Michael Chin walks into my office.

313
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:41,489
His analyst was this woman named Jane, and she had gone out on maternity leave and he's like, Hey, I have this this analysis.

314
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,639
I need to run. You're available, so you're going to do it.

315
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:53,940
I'm like, great. The analysis was this looking at hazard ratios for lung cancer by tar level of cigaret

316
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:00,930
because he had been contacted by one of these lawyers who was suing the tobacco companies for

317
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:05,459
false advertising because all of these light and ultra light cigarets they were saying

318
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,540
that calling them light or ultralight applied a health benefit that didn't exist was like,

319
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,380
Oh, we haven't actually looked at that in our data, so we're going to do that. And so we did.

320
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:20,099
So you can see that the referent here is 15 to 21 milligrams of tar.

321
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:29,729
So that's like a marlboro red, that's like a regular cigaret. 8 to 14 is light less than or equal to seven is ultra light and these are unfiltered

322
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,030
cigarets like a lucky strike or a handled cigaret that has no filter on it.

323
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,450
Okay, so what?

324
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,700
And then these are people who quit smoking and never smoked.

325
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:46,290
So obviously people who quit smoking longer ago have incredibly reduced risk compared to people who are currently smoking regular cigarets.

326
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:52,559
And if you've never smoked, obviously way, way, way lower risk, what do you think about, let's say,

327
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,750
light and ultra light cigarets with respect to risk of lung cancer compared to smoking regular cigarets.

328
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,190
As I say, they're not different. If anything,

329
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:13,740
the point estimate is higher for the ultralight cigarets and the confidence intervals certainly across one

330
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,260
like maybe slapping a filter on it does something right because the unfiltered ones seem to be a bit higher,

331
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,550
but like nothing. Yeah. Is that more so?

332
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,790
Because you analyze that you're active also more or less cigarets.

333
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:31,829
We did adjust for cigarets per day and that kind of thing.

334
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:41,250
So we adjust for how much you smoke. But I will tell you the way that they measure tar level is by this machine, right?

335
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:46,439
It's a machine measure, tar level. So they stick the cigaret then there in the machine, smokes the cigarets and there's, I don't know,

336
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,430
some kind of filter or sensor or something in there and it tells you how much target is there.

337
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:58,190
This is not how people smoke. Cigarets right. I'm looking for a pen or something that is cylindrical.

338
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,150
Aha. So the way they reduce the tar level is they add it's about like filter design.

339
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,070
One of the ways they do it is they add these ventilation holes in the filter so that when you suck in,

340
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,940
you're getting fresh air in as well as there is the smoke.

341
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:21,950
Right. But people hold their cigarets in such a way that they often will cover those holes like they don't mean to.

342
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:24,290
They don't know anything about how they're filter design.

343
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:29,900
But like, if you're a smoker, you'll figure out pretty quick that you get more smoke if you hold it a certain way.

344
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:35,809
And so smoking behavior is such that when people actually smoke cigarets, they tend to cover those ventilation holes.

345
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:43,040
And so probably the delivered tar to an actual smoker's lungs is very similar, no matter which kind of cigaret smoking does.

346
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:50,299
That makes sense. That's like one example. There's a million things like this about smoking behavior and depth of inhalation and

347
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:55,550
all of that kind of stuff that is difficult to capture in like a epidemiologic study,

348
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:59,780
but that probably accounts for some of why there's actually a difference.

349
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,490
So I will tell you that this was absolutely terrifying.

350
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:13,070
As an analyst, I came in one day and found a subpoena on my chair from Philip morris, and they wanted my data and my code.

351
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:19,790
And the American Cancer Society lawyers went to court because they said that they did not have

352
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:25,669
to turn over their data to the tobacco companies because they were a donor funded organization.

353
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,659
They're not federal funds. They can do whatever they want with their data.

354
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,410
They don't have to give it to them.

355
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:37,190
So we did have to give them the tobacco companies were trying to get all of the data which they had done in the past.

356
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:42,920
Somehow they had gotten a hold of like our six year follow up data in the past these these data.

357
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:49,010
And then they used it to publicize to like massage and publicize all this about, oh, smoking was not actually that bad.

358
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:53,569
So HCF really didn't want to do that because they're, they're anti-cancer, right?

359
00:33:53,570 --> 00:34:02,960
That's their whole thing. Right. And so to have their, the data that their volunteers provided them with used to promote cigarets was really not cool.

360
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,030
Right? And so they were fighting hard against this.

361
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,860
We ended up having to give them a very limited analytic dataset just to basically create our analyzes.

362
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:17,120
And then Michael Tune was deposed by tobacco lawyers, which it turns out are a very specific kind of [INAUDIBLE].

363
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:27,560
And they kept him in a room for about 12 hours. You could hear them screaming at him down the hall like it was ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly.

364
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,750
And he they were yelling at him.

365
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:38,810
Part of what they were yelling about is that when they ran the data, they got slightly different answers than I did, like in the thousandths place.

366
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,690
So I ended up having to contact SAS,

367
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:49,760
the statistical analysis software people and figure out that their version of SAS was different than our version of SAS.

368
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,640
And theirs kept more places of data, more bits of data than ours did.

369
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:59,959
And so it was a rounding thing.

370
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:07,850
It was horrible. And that's why I decided I did not want to study smoking related cancers because it is

371
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:11,569
a full ball of worms and gets you involved with tobacco company lawyers and everything.

372
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:18,770
So if you have if you have the Constitution for that, God bless you.

373
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,659
More power to you. I was like, you know what?

374
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:26,420
I'm going to go over here to this other kind of cancer, because I don't think I have the ability to deal with this on a day to day basis.

375
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:32,810
There's something viscerally terrifying about coming in as a brand new master's level analyst to a subpoena from Philip morris on your chair.

376
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:39,170
Big. Yikes. But anyway, this is one of my most highly cited papers ever, and I'm still pretty proud of having been involved with this.

377
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,840
And Michael Tunis and John Middleton and John Sam, superstars there are I mean, they're just amazing.

378
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,650
Okay. So healthy people 2020 targets.

379
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:59,909
We made the one for adolescent cigaret smoking. Not so much for adults. Part of this is because adults have already been smoking.

380
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:05,970
Right? Getting people to quit who already smoke, it turns out, is harder than getting people not to start, particularly young people.

381
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:11,100
And this is what I told you about cigaret smoking by educational attainment.

382
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,900
So 25.6% prevalence among adults with less than a high school education.

383
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:22,290
3.7% among people with an advanced degree. So huge gradient, right?

384
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:26,489
Huge disparities. It's also very different. This is youth smoking.

385
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:33,150
Anybody know it via obsesses? It's the Youth Risk Behavioral Something survey.

386
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,800
I don't know what the US is for. There's too many S's, but it's surveillance.

387
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:42,090
Yeah, I. I think that's right. So reading the survey. Thank you. Anyway, it's done by CDC.

388
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:45,850
It's very much like NHANES or purpose. More like purpose because it's a phone call.

389
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,890
It's a phone survey that's done about youth risk behaviors. And so they ask about who's smoking as part of it.

390
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:54,180
And I guess they don't have the pictures here, but the darker is more.

391
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,690
So you can certainly see that there are gradients across the country, right.

392
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:08,400
It's not perfect, but a lot of the states that have higher tobacco smoking in youth are those that have had historically

393
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:16,350
higher like tobacco growing industries and tobacco producing industries in North Carolina.

394
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,630
Anybody know where Wake Forest University is? What city is it in?

395
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:28,860
Say it again. It's Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

396
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,759
And we all say that like it's a city name. And it is. But I would like you to also think about Winston Cigarets.

397
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,010
Salem Cigarets. Winston Salem Yeah.

398
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,580
You pass the Marlboro plant if you drive down, I think it's 75 through through North Carolina.

399
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:49,590
Right? So I mean, it is it is a huge part of the state economy.

400
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:57,510
Right. And so state laws state the tobacco control laws have historically been less punitive or less strict there.

401
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:08,220
Right. And so you still have a lot more youth smoking in those places. And also, I want to point out that we've made a lot of progress in the U.S.

402
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,260
We've really whittled down the number of people smoking.

403
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:19,640
Do you think that the tobacco company executives are like, oh, men making less money now and they're just crying about it?

404
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:26,860
No. They are going other places. They do not have strict tobacco control policies in place.

405
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:35,200
And there's kind of this if a place is a very low income country, they don't have enough money to spend on cigarets.

406
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,639
Right. They're only spending their money on essentials once a country starts to go

407
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,430
through the epidemiologic transition and it's kind of a lower income country,

408
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:47,680
then it's ripe for a tobacco company to move in and start selling their product because people have a little more money to spend.

409
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:54,940
But the government is still probably not thinking about tobacco control as its main concern health wise.

410
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,540
And so tobacco control policies are generally a little bit laxer or not in place.

411
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:08,800
Right. So globally, you can see this is a little bit old, but you can see that there are definitely places with huge growth in tobacco smoking.

412
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:16,520
Right. And so this is def global tobacco control is it is a big issue in public health.

413
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:24,110
Also, as an aside, if you think that companies like Philip morris and all of the other tobacco companies are

414
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:31,280
not already making marijuana cigarets as that becomes more of a thing in this country,

415
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:37,160
you are sadly mistaken. That is their next big thing is jumping on the bandwagon.

416
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:43,790
Right? Because if people are not smoking traditional cigarets anymore, by god, e-cigarettes and marijuana are going to be their next big thing.

417
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,690
This is a cool book. I know you guys don't have a lot of free reading time, but if this topic,

418
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,770
if you were interested in this, if this kind of gives you go and you think it's cool,

419
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:03,070
this is all about kind of the rise and fall of the tobacco companies over the past during the cigaret century, essentially.

420
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:08,270
So yeah. And it turns.

421
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:15,470
We're going to have a quick slide about that at the end. But briefly, so the question is about e-cigarettes.

422
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:23,600
So it's very hard. If you wanted to do an epidemiologic study of e-cigarettes, tell me how you would do that.

423
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,069
Like e-cigarettes and lung cancer, say because this is a cancer class, right?

424
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:34,340
So if you wanted to know the risk of lung cancer with smoking e-cigarettes, how would you do that?

425
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:43,760
Yeah. Well, how old are the people, though, who are getting lung cancer?

426
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:53,730
They're in their late sixties. So the people who are in their late sixties, are they smoking e-cigarettes or vapes?

427
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,620
No, that's you guys. Maybe a little older than you. Right.

428
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:06,270
So if we wanted to do a real epidemiologic population based study on vapes and e-cigarettes and risk of cancer,

429
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,960
we are going to have to wait another 40 years before we have that answer.

430
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,530
That's the trouble, right? You might get people right now.

431
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:21,000
The other trouble is that there's usually I think if you want to get people who

432
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,050
have only smoked vapes and e-cigarettes and not also traditional cigarets,

433
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:31,530
you're going to have to wait for your generation. People who are older now, who are smoking them are using them as a tobacco cessation tool.

434
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:35,700
Right. They're doing it kind of in order to quit smoking regular cigarets.

435
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:44,280
And then, you know, I mean, who knows? Right. It could be, I don't know, maybe smoking traditional cigarets and then e-cigarettes is extra bad.

436
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:50,189
I don't I don't know. Like it maybe that's terrible in a way that just smoking e-cigarettes isn't we I have no idea.

437
00:41:50,190 --> 00:42:01,829
We don't know is the answer. You know, there have been some studies on like interim things looking at kind of interim one function,

438
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:05,730
the sorts of things, not actual cancer outcomes. It certainly suggests that they're not good.

439
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:11,099
I would argue that anything that addicts you to a product that someone's trying to sell you is

440
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:17,970
probably not great at inhaling kind of anything foreign into your lungs on a regular basis.

441
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:26,250
Probably can't be better than not doing that. So I don't know that we need to wait 40 years to tell people that that's probably a bad plan.

442
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:32,190
But we actually aren't going to have cancer data on people who exclusively smoked Cigarets for a while.

443
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:41,280
But I will tell you, we're asking about it on my questionnaire and we are asking why coffee per day can.

444
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:50,820
But. Yeah, we don't know. Yeah. Part of the.

445
00:42:54,450 --> 00:43:04,930
So. I, I mean, I, I think part of the culture is, is a big part of it.

446
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:09,490
Um, I will say also it's addictive.

447
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:13,390
It's very addictive. And there are some people who can quit and some people who can't. And I will tell you.

448
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:20,290
Are you guys familiar with your studies? I think I've brought them up before. So the but she was is a genome wide association study.

449
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:23,800
You just kind of look at all the genes in the genome in relation to some outcome.

450
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:30,130
When you do that for lung cancer, do you know what pops up? It's not cancer related genes, it's addiction genes.

451
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:35,390
Addiction genes are the genes associated with lung cancer and us.

452
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:42,950
And so I think we all have to be. I think there's almost been this shift right towards stigmatizing smoking.

453
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:50,240
And I think there's a lot of, you know, the fact that it is much more prevalent in lower education,

454
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:57,740
lower SES groups, the fact that it is so addictive once you start it, that has a genetic basis.

455
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,990
I think we all need to be as public health professionals,

456
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:08,810
I think we're not going to be able to be successful at getting people to quit and getting people to not smoke unless we are more.

457
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:16,760
Empathetic, kind, sympathetic, less judgmental about people who do smoke.

458
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:17,570
Does that make sense?

459
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:26,179
It really sets up a difficult like us versus them, where the highly educated people who are high school like you shouldn't do that.

460
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,540
Don't you know it's bad for you? And that doesn't.

461
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:36,850
No one, literally zero people in the whole world have ever responded positively to someone looking at them going, you know, you shouldn't do that.

462
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:42,770
I don't think that's good for you. Like that has never worked. I can't imagine a single person who would be like, Oh my God, you're right.

463
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:48,919
I shouldn't do this. And I also don't think there's a single person on the face of, at least in this country,

464
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:54,110
who is unaware that smoking is bad for you, like not a single one.

465
00:44:54,140 --> 00:45:02,990
Right. So the reason that people choose to do it are varied and have a lot to do with individual culture, like micro culture people.

466
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:06,320
You're with your social circle and also addiction genes, right?

467
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:13,550
So anyway, that's my soapbox. All right.

468
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:18,380
So I'm going to kind of fly. I have a lot of slides here. I'm not going to go through all of them.

469
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:24,740
We've seen this lung cancer has been coming down and males and just starting to come down on females.

470
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:29,690
This definitely mirrors smoking rates, but this is an interesting graph.

471
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:37,970
I think. So NCTC means no tobacco control. Etsy is actual tobacco control and CTC is complete tobacco control.

472
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:44,629
So the blue line is what we actually did since the 1964 surgeon general's report.

473
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:51,980
That's the actual what we achieve. The MTC is assuming we never did any tobacco control and people just continued to smoke kind

474
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,760
of at the same rates that they were before the 1964 Surgeon General's report came out.

475
00:45:56,570 --> 00:46:01,880
And then KCTCS is like if we had magically erased Cigarets at that moment, right?

476
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:06,650
And everybody was like, okay, and they quit smoking.

477
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:13,910
So these are the deaths avoided and green and these are the deaths not avoided for men and for women.

478
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:19,790
And so I think that's really you know, there's a good chunk that we avoided, but there's a bigger chunk that we didn't write.

479
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:25,430
And I think that's kind of a powerful a powerful graphic.

480
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:31,040
We've seen this before. There is a very clear 20 year lag time between smoking and lung cancer.

481
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,660
If you look at the uptake of cigaret consumption and its decline, the lung cancer rates,

482
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:43,790
particularly for men that really follow right behind that and then lung cancer risk factors, of course, we know tobacco, but there are others, right?

483
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:48,320
Secondhand smoke, radon and asbestos. So anybody here know what radon is?

484
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,790
If you're from Michigan is anybody's parents have a radon mitigation pipe.

485
00:46:53,120 --> 00:47:00,430
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

486
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:07,180
So there's different parts of the country, and Michigan is one of them where like radioactive gas can come out of the earth.

487
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:10,810
Right. And if you make a basement, it can have you can come into your basement.

488
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:15,910
And so when you buy a house someday, if you buy a house in Michigan or another place that has radon.

489
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:22,989
One of the things that you'll have to do among like 900 other things is get somebody to come in and inspect it for radon and say,

490
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:28,110
now it's cool, you can live here. And then we actually have in my house, we have a mitigation pipe in the basement.

491
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:35,949
So like yours that you operate on gets high or if the battery starts to go out and then if you mean you're like, oh my God, I'll go in the basement.

492
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:42,069
But they want to make sure that it's just the battery. Some industrial substances.

493
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:45,850
Arsenic is one. There are others. Oh, asbestos I skipped.

494
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:48,999
That was like an insulation thing.

495
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,780
And it actually causes a very specific type of lung cancer, causes mesothelioma.

496
00:47:53,200 --> 00:48:01,689
You may have seen like ads for exposed to asbestos, call this layer or whatever, but it's definitely a big it's much it's not used anymore.

497
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:05,110
But like older buildings, if they renovate older buildings, you have to be very careful about it.

498
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:11,560
And there were certain occupations that were very highly exposed to it, and it caused this very particular form of lung cancer,

499
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,630
some organic chemicals and then radiation exposure from other kinds of sources.

500
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:19,740
Right. All right.

501
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,980
So this is getting at the men and women thing that we've kind of hinted at a bunch.

502
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:32,340
Right. So this is a paper that was published by Michael Tyrone and and Company in 2013.

503
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:36,270
So this is looking at the relative risk for lung cancer death in women and men.

504
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:41,910
And this is a study that was conducted in the early 1960s.

505
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:53,130
And if you compare current smokers to never smokers. In women and in men, what do you think about the relative risk for lung cancer?

506
00:48:53,550 --> 00:49:00,990
Comparing women and men? If you only have these data, what would you say about smoking and lung cancer for women and for men?

507
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,590
Yeah. Yeah. It seems to be bad for everybody, but it's extra bad for men.

508
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:19,470
Right. So it looks like smoking is worse for men. That is for with. Now let's look at this cohort that was conducted in the eighties.

509
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,420
Everybody's risk seems higher, but it still seems higher for men.

510
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:33,020
Right. But if we look at a contemporary cohort, what do you think now?

511
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:45,840
Same and that. Right. So keep in mind, when we're saying current smokers, that reflects a lot of things.

512
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:49,280
Smoking is a dose response exposure.

513
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:54,389
Right dose matters. So the overall relative risk reflects the person's average consumption.

514
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:57,810
How long they smoked, you know, how many years have they quit?

515
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:03,210
This is current smokers. But if you were looking at former smokers would be how long since they quit?

516
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:09,090
What age did they start at? Starting younger is worse. What type of tobacco product of the smoke.

517
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:12,480
Right. Do they smoke? Those non filtered cigarets. Cause that's bad news bears, we learned.

518
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,820
And then what was their inhalation pattern? They just kind of puppet or did they really inhale it deep into their lungs?

519
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:23,309
So all of these things are really important. So from this paper,

520
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:29,639
it says that women who began smoking smoking in the 1950s or thereafter have smoked more like men than

521
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,840
they did in previous generations means they started at an earlier age and they smoked more heavily.

522
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:38,310
Women earlier than that tend to smoke socially and maybe start in their thirties.

523
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:45,270
But as time marched on, women began to more smoke, more like men, starting in adolescence and smoking daily.

524
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:50,219
Contemporary smokers have spent much of their lives smoking filter cigarets made of blended tobacco.

525
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:56,840
So the ones you buy at the gas station. So this is talking about birth cohorts.

526
00:50:56,850 --> 00:51:04,049
This is confusing and weird to think about. I always kind of breaks my brain a little bit, but you have to think about the birth cohort.

527
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:10,830
People born in the 1900s, people born in the 19 tens. Those were those one participants because they were in their forties and fifties

528
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:14,790
when they were recruited and the study was conducted in the early 1960s.

529
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:18,320
So people recruited into that. CPS one study are these birth cohorts.

530
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:25,020
Does that make sense? And similarly, these are those two participants and these are those contemporary cohort people.

531
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:37,169
So if you look at this is the percentage of men who smoked by year for the 1900 birth cohort you're up to like 70% of them smoking by their twenties.

532
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:41,190
Right. So they really are taking it up in their teens. Same here.

533
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:49,260
Same here. If you look at the 1900 birth cohort and even the 1910 birth cohort for women, totally different, right?

534
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:53,490
They're not really starting until much later in life.

535
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:57,570
And it turns out that they're also smoking less frequently. They're not really smoking daily.

536
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:08,790
So a a current woman smoker in these birth cohorts has a much lower lifetime exposure to tobacco smoke than a current male smoker in those cohorts,

537
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:12,720
which is why their relative risk for current smoking was lower.

538
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:15,269
But once you get up here,

539
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:24,780
everyone's starting in their teens smoking those blended tobacco cigarets machine created blended tobacco cigarets every day.

540
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:30,900
And so the dose is basically the same for men and women, and therefore the relative risk is the same for current smoking.

541
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:37,020
That makes sense. It's kind of a little brainteaser, but it's kind of fun, I think.

542
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:45,570
And that is just that, you know, duration and and the amount of cigarets consumed really matters.

543
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:55,200
I think this is interesting. The total mortality rate ratio for smoking a bunch of cigarets per day actually decreases after a certain age.

544
00:52:56,220 --> 00:53:00,959
And the reason for that is because all of the really susceptible people remember our

545
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,760
genetic picture of the people who were general population resistance susceptible.

546
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,600
The more susceptible and kind of general population people are dying off.

547
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:17,400
And so the ones who are in their eighties who were smoking 40 plus cigarets per day are those genetically resistant folks, generally speaking, right?

548
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:27,960
So the age specific mortality rate for heavy smoking kind of decreases after a certain age because all the really susceptible folks are dying off.

549
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:36,999
Okay time since smoking cessation matters to all these different studies are finding kind of slightly different numbers.

550
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:48,280
But it's it's the same idea that like if you quit 5 to 9 years ago, you're starting to see benefit 10 to 14, 20 plus years ago.

551
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,820
You're almost down to a non smoker. Right.

552
00:53:53,380 --> 00:54:01,390
So quitting. Improves your risk and the longer you benefit, the better.

553
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,910
So I'm not going to go into this in great detail.

554
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:13,089
Essentially, you've got inside the bronchi, you've got these basal cells, columnar cells in the cilia when they're exposed to cigaret smoke,

555
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:18,370
the tar from the smoke coats, the cilia and the nerve cells are damaged and lose those.

556
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:24,879
And then essentially the basil cells are multiplying and abnormally high rates to replace these damaged cells.

557
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:31,750
And so what happens is that if you have cancerous mutations, they tend to be propagated more quickly.

558
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:43,079
And this is the same thing we've seen before. Smoking causes cancer in organs throughout your body, not just your lungs,

559
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:48,300
although that is the strongest relative risk, but basically everything except the endometrial.

560
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,120
We've seen this before. This is a bit old, but it's the annual number of deaths attributed to smoking.

561
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:03,780
Males and females by sight. So if you look at the oral fairings, a huge chunk of them are smoking related larynx,

562
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:13,020
almost all of them huge chunk of esophagus and obviously a huge chunk of lung and then smaller proportions of some of these other types of cancer.

563
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:23,270
I am going to skip this. But of course, the health consequences are not just.

564
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:35,150
Cancer, right. It causes all of these different cancers, but it's also causing all these other chronic diseases.

565
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:39,680
Anything over there surprise you?

566
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:50,880
Or nothing surprises you about Cigarets anymore. Lots of things.

567
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:56,910
So other types of smoking, cigar and pipe smokers have a higher risk for lung cancer than non smokers.

568
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,550
Right. The risk varies by the number of years they've smoked, the number of pipes or cigar smoke per day and how deeply they inhale.

569
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:08,660
A lot of smoke, a lot of pipe and cigar smokers are not inhaling it into their long as they're just sort of puffing it into their mouth.

570
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:12,660
And so that's why like mouth cancers are more strongly associated with those.

571
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:23,399
But I mean, you can inhale them, I guess. I don't I don't know. But I think it's not typical or it's at least less ubiquitous.

572
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,240
Right. There are certainly pipe and cigar smokers who don't inhale. Yes.

573
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:41,360
My. I don't know I don't know exactly how this hip fractures probably it I would think that it um.

574
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:49,930
I don't know. Damages something about your ability to regenerate cells or something like that.

575
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:55,530
That's interesting. I mean, you probably look it up. It's it's shocking the number of things it causes.

576
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:59,310
And I'm sure that there's a good biologic rationale for all of them.

577
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:07,390
I don't know. I yeah. Yeah. All right.

578
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:13,940
Okay. So there's also this idea about tobacco harm reduction.

579
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:17,179
If you want to like watch a bunch of epidemiologists get into a fight,

580
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:23,420
you should bring up tobacco harm reduction and make your popcorn and just sit back and watch.

581
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:30,900
So this is very controversial. The idea is that rather than getting people to quit, should we watch them out to something else?

582
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:38,130
Right. So like patches of gums, smokeless tobacco, like chewing tobacco or snooze or e-cigarettes.

583
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:43,190
Right. So okay, if we it's like, okay, fine, we can't get them to quit, but can we get them to do something that's not as bad?

584
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,769
So in the end, quitting is best, right?

585
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:50,120
And so lots of public health practitioners believe that we should if we're going to invest resources in something,

586
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:54,920
we should be trying to get people to quit, but trying to get them to do this other thing that's maybe not as bad, but still isn't great.

587
00:57:55,640 --> 00:58:01,460
But then there are there are people who are like, let's be practical. Like if they're addicted to nicotine, they might not be able to just quit.

588
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:08,300
Maybe we have to get them to do this other thing. So this is hugely controversial and people will get into big fights about it.

589
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:19,099
You know, there's been this big Cochrane review on interventions to do to reduce harm.

590
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:23,420
So it looked at 20 randomized controlled trials that used a variety of harm reduction strategies.

591
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:28,460
So using these strategies, particularly nicotine replacement therapy, like the patches or the gum,

592
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:32,209
did reduce the number of cigarets smoked and increase the likelihood of quitting completely.

593
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:38,300
But there was limited evidence for other strategies like the like switching to smokeless tobacco or e-cigarettes.

594
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:41,900
And no studies evaluated the long term health effects of the treatment.

595
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:46,639
So they showed that using these strategies reduced the number of cigarets they smoke,

596
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:51,170
but it did not show whether they actually were less likely to die of lung cancer, for example.

597
00:58:55,220 --> 00:59:00,720
And then we've talked about this e-cigarettes issue, right? So I'm not going to go into that.

598
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,040
We kind of discussed this earlier.

599
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:11,310
So smoking causes lots of cancer and other chronic disease smoking behavior all modify your disease risk duration, dose type of product.

600
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:16,140
So we have incomplete tobacco control in the U.S., but it's ongoing and we've made some headway.

601
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:22,640
But, you know, we are not done. And globally, the tobacco epidemic continues.

602
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:25,580
But I do think it's important to note how much progress we've made.

603
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:29,220
I mean, we talked about like movies in the eighties that I tell you my story about ashtrays.

604
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:38,450
I think this is a really good I like the story because I think it's shocking to people and it really illustrates how far we've come.

605
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:44,250
So when I was a little kid, I can remember, you know, you make something for your parents at like preschool.

606
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:52,940
I made a like for for anything dad related. He would make an ashtray, like you'd make a little ashtray out of clay and, like,

607
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:57,440
use your little bitty finger to make the loopholes for the cigarets into your home. Can you imagine?

608
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:02,089
Like, just imagine a kindergartner today in Ann Arbor Public School coming home.

609
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:08,719
What would I be, my daddy? I mean, inconceivable, but like it was absolutely normal.

610
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,550
And I said to my husband, like, did you do days ago?

611
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:15,139
And I remember thinking and thinking, I guess I'll smoke when I'm a grown up, which is horrifying.

612
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:24,050
But you know exactly what you would think, right? So, yes, I made an ashtray for my dad in kindergarten and it was totally normal.

613
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:28,010
Just like you'd make a little handprint for your mom. Take the ashtray for your dad.

614
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:32,000
It was the clay craft of the day. Horrifying.

615
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:42,170
Any questions? Why are you alive?

616
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:47,329
The eighties were a time. All right, well, I'm going to hand back the exam.
