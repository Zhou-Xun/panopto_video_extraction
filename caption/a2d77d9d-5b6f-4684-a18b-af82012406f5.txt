1
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:14,190
Early in the 20th century, infectious disease epidemics continued to afflict the United States and the world.

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:23,970
Most notably, including the 1918 pandemic of influenza, which killed tens of millions of people worldwide.

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,120
The enormity of the death toll inspired scientists to search for ways to prevent infectious diseases.

4
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,200
There are a lot of parents whose children are healthy and happy now who live in fear.

5
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,980
I know I do. The fear, my friends, is polio.

6
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,690
Perhaps one of the greatest achievements in addressing the spread of infectious diseases

7
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,500
came in the mid-twentieth century with the discovery of the polio vaccine by Jonas Salk.

8
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:03,450
He initiated a polio vaccine trial with 8 million children, the first modern clinical trial,

9
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:13,380
which led to the announcement at an international press conference that the polio vaccine is safe, effective and potent.

10
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:22,200
This is Tuesday, April 12th, 1955, a day which may well mark the most significant event in all of medical history.

11
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:29,040
A world will very soon know whether the battle against the disease that has twisted hundreds of thousands of young bodies has been won.

12
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:44,270
With greater control over the spread of infectious diseases, national attention shifted to an increase of public access to health care.

13
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:53,420
In 1965, President Lyndon B Johnson's national initiative called the Great Society, established Medicare.

14
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,350
Health care coverage for every American age. 65 and over.

15
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,390
And Medicaid. Health care coverage for lower income Americans.

16
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,550
At the same time,

17
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:14,720
an epidemiologic revolution was taking place with the availability of antibiotics promoting the belief that infectious disease would be conquered.

18
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,040
This led to a new focus on managing chronic disease,

19
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:29,180
a huge and growing burden on public health due to aging and various changes in health behaviors in the United States and around the world.

20
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,300
In the early 1980s, another public health pandemic emerged.

21
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,310
HIV AIDS was on the rise. It's mysterious.

22
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,760
It's deadly, and it's baffling medical science.

23
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:56,830
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome AIDS is now spreading in epidemic proportions to other segments of the population.

24
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,870
To address this public health crisis,

25
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:08,950
then Surgeon General C Everett Koop communicated to every household in the United States through a mass mailing explaining HIV,

26
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,270
AIDS, how it was spread and how to avoid contracting it.

27
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,560
I am Johnny Depp of 21 Jump Street. I don't know a whole lot about AIDS, but I want to introduce you to a couple of guys who do.

28
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,620
Dr. Robert Windham, the assistant secretary for health and the surgeon general of the United States.

29
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,360
Dr. C Everett Koop. There are a number of ways to catch AIDS.

30
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,800
Casual contact is not one of them, but sexual contact is.

31
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,100
If you are not going to abstain, we're not going to maintain a faithful, monogamous relationship.

32
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,570
You can reduce the chance of contracting AIDS if you use a condom.

33
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:55,810
But remember, there may not be 100% effective. Through a national advocacy movement involving both public health officials and private citizens.

34
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:05,650
Resources were made available for research and treatment, doing more to control this disease rapidly than any disease in history.

35
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,940
At the same time, the breast cancer movement changed the way research was being conducted.

36
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:23,530
Well looking for. Stories with happy endings like Brandon and Lori Catherine.

37
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,600
Women that have run their own race against breast cancer.

38
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:35,040
Now they're running with thousands of others in the Race for the Cure events to raise awareness and money for breast cancer education and research.

39
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,960
A social movement led by patient advocates,

40
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:50,050
drew attention to the alarming mortality rate of women with breast cancer and significantly bolstered breast cancer research and treatment.

41
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,120
You know, working day out here stretches from sunup to sundown,

42
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:03,210
but there's always time for a mile by the cigaret that gives you a flavor rich and full.

43
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:26,570
You get a lot to like where the Moral Furrow Builder plays, like Norfolk County, where the flavor is come to Marlboro Country.

44
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:34,390
But throughout the 20th century, one of the most critical public health challenges has been about the impact of tobacco.

45
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,690
Smoking rose virtually annually throughout the century until the release of the

46
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:46,780
groundbreaking First Surgeon General's report on smoking and Health in 1964.

47
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:54,999
Out of its long and exhaustive deliberations, the committee has reached the overall judgment that cigaret smoking is a health

48
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,870
hazard of sufficient importance to the United States to warrant remedial action.

49
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,220
Ever since then, smoking has been declining.

50
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:13,900
Tobacco control is widely considered the premier public health achievement of the second half of the century.

51
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:23,440
Still today, about 16% of American adults smoke and tobacco is responsible for one out of every five deaths.

52
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,100
Tobacco remains the nation's leading cause of preventable premature mortality.

53
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:47,890
In 2001, the United States experienced a new kind of public health crisis, this time brought on by the terrorist attacks of September 11th.

54
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:55,270
First responders rushing to the aid of victims of the attack suffered significant health consequences,

55
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:01,120
leading to the establishment of congressional legislation to address their health care needs.

56
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:09,750
During this period, other health crises related to gun violence, global conflicts,

57
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,350
natural disasters and health insurance continued to be the focus of public health.

58
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:31,650
In 1988, the Institute of Medicine published a paper which included this statement about the future of public health in the U.S.

59
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:40,230
This nation has lost sight of its public health goals and has allowed the system of public health activities to fall into disarray.

60
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:48,570
They attributed this to serious underfunding, poor organization management and lack of political support and influence.

61
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,610
These are pervasive themes throughout history and continue to this day.

62
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,080
But there have been many public health achievements that provide hope for the future.

63
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:05,340
Public health efforts have led to a dramatic increase in life expectancy during the last 100 years.

64
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:12,180
Life expectancy in the U.S. has increased by two thirds from 47 to 77 years.

65
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:19,440
Life expectancy at age 65 increased by 66% from 12 to 20 years.

66
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:29,490
Infant mortality rates dropped 94% from 100 per 1000 live births to 5.9 per 1000 live births.

67
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:41,880
If the rate in 1900 had continued, 400,000 infants born in 2013 would have died in their first year, but only 24,000 did.

68
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:50,070
The maternal mortality rate decreased 99% to 0.1 per 1000 live births.

69
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:56,940
Heart disease and stroke decreased in the second half of the 20th century due to decreased smoking,

70
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,520
increased exercise and screening and treatment for high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

71
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,980
There are better emergency medical services both at the scene and in the hospital.

72
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,649
And vaccination against crippling and fatal illnesses has led to such remarkable

73
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:20,490
accomplishments as the complete eradication of smallpox and the near eradication of polio.

74
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,590
Public health is an enormously important field of endeavor.

75
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,149
I hope this brief introduction to our history will give you a good sense of

76
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:35,910
where we have come from and perhaps some lessons about where we have to go.
