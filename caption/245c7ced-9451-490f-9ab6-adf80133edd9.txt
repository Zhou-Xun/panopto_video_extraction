00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,390
Hello everyone and
welcome back to Nutrition 590.

2
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,330
I'm sure that many of you have heard about
the Flint Water Crisis that occurred when

3
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,213
the city of Flint, Michigan switched
the source of its water from

4
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:24,110
the Detroit Water and
Sewage Department water,

5
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,729
which was sourced from Lake Huron and
the Detroit River, to the Flint River.

6
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:33,396
Officials failed to apply
corrosion inhibitors to the water.

7
00:00:33,396 --> 00:00:37,582
As a result, lead from aging pipes
leached into the water supply,

8
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:40,274
leading to elevated
levels of the metal and

9
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:44,713
exposing over a hundred thousand
residents to elevated lead levels.

10
00:00:44,713 --> 00:00:48,773
This real life example demonstrates
that exposure to toxicants has

11
00:00:48,773 --> 00:00:51,610
detrimental effects to human health.

12
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,510
And in this module,
we're going to study in depth

13
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,310
the association between toxicants and
the epigenome.

14
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,300
The first learning objective is to
understand the severity of toxicant

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,170
associated epigenetic alterations.

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,150
Second, through reading a journal article,
we will begin to understand study

17
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:18,330
motivations, study methods and how
toxicant epigenetic studies are conducted.

18
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,040
We may not be aware of this, but

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,490
all of us are exposed to various
toxicants in our everyday life.

20
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:29,810
The figure here shows the geographic
exposure of arsenic in the United States.

21
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,270
Arsenic is a naturally occurring element
that can combine with either inorganic or

22
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:39,020
organic substances to form
many different compounds.

23
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,370
People are most likely exposed to
inorganic arsenic through their

24
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,910
drinking water.

25
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,470
We can also be exposed to inorganic
arsenic by eating such foods as rice and

26
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,390
some fruit juices.

27
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:56,410
Relevant to today's topic, in utero
arsenic exposure has been associated with

28
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:02,710
infant cord blood DNA methylation at genes
involved in child growth and development.

29
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:07,452
Thus, the identification of DNA
methylation in cord blood of

30
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:12,926
individuals exposed to arsenic may
serve as epigenetic biomarkers for

31
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:18,507
changes in phenotypes later in life,
such as low density lipoprotein.

32
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:21,404
Arsenic is not the only toxicant
that can affect the epigenome.

33
00:02:21,404 --> 00:02:26,057
Others including endocrine disruptors,
like bisphenol-a or PAHs,

34
00:02:26,057 --> 00:02:30,553
which stands for poly aromatic
hydrocarbons, have all been shown to

35
00:02:30,553 --> 00:02:35,606
affect epigenetics in animal models,
human population and even wildlife.

36
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:41,227
For a more detailed example,
I'll use the study depicted here.

37
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:45,643
DNA methylation of imprinted
genes in Mexican-American newborn

38
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:48,731
children with prenatal phthalate exposure.

39
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:53,238
Which was conducted in 2018
by Nina Hollins Laboratory at

40
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:55,411
the University of Berkeley.

41
00:02:55,411 --> 00:03:00,297
Researchers in animal models has shown
associations between phthalates,

42
00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:05,182
which are plasticizers that make plastic
soft and flexible, and global and

43
00:03:05,182 --> 00:03:07,332
site specific DNA methylation.

44
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:11,716
However, there's a lack of
information on DNA methylation in

45
00:03:11,716 --> 00:03:14,540
relation to human phthalate exposure.

46
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,423
In fact, only two human studies
are available that have examined

47
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:20,897
the relationship between phthalates and

48
00:03:20,897 --> 00:03:25,222
placental imprinted gene methylation
in a particular H19 and IGF2.

49
00:03:25,222 --> 00:03:31,249
In addition, there are no data available
that evaluate the relationship between

50
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:37,880
cord blood imprinted gene methylation and
prenatal exposure to phthalates.

51
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:43,105
The lack of population-based epigenetic
epidemiology data is a huge gap

52
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:48,423
in this field, which is also the
motivation for them to conduct the study.

53
00:03:48,423 --> 00:03:54,218
In terms of methodology, the authors use
the longitudinal cohort study CHAMACOS,

54
00:03:54,218 --> 00:03:59,694
which is a maternal infant birth cohort
from the Salinas Valley in California.

55
00:03:59,694 --> 00:04:04,793
Phthalate metabolites were measured in
maternal urine collected during early and

56
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:06,330
late pregnancy visits.

57
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:12,420
The concentration of metabolites were
measured using solid-phase extraction,

58
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:17,571
coupled with isotope dilution,
high performance liquid chromatography.

59
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:22,294
DNA methylation was measured in
infant cord blood samples in

60
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:27,581
a candidate gene approach for
the following nine imprinted genes.

61
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:32,454
H19, IGF2, MEG3, MEG3-IG,

62
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:37,784
MEST, neuronatan, PLAGL1, PEG3 and

63
00:04:37,784 --> 00:04:42,695
SGCE, which is also called PEG10.

64
00:04:42,695 --> 00:04:47,330
While we won't go over it today,
gene expression was also measured at

65
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:52,118
a subset of these genes using
quantitative real-time PCR analysis.

66
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:56,250
And this was done to show the correlation
between DNA methylation and

67
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,440
gene expression levels.

68
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,770
Displayed here are some of
the first main findings.

69
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,490
Figure 1 shows the distribution of
DNA methylation values at imprinted

70
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,330
CPG sites within each differentially
methylated region, and

71
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,435
average DNA methylation for
each of those nine imprinted genes.

72
00:05:16,435 --> 00:05:22,280
The percentage of DNA methylation
varies between imprinted genes and

73
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,236
within individual CPG sites.

74
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:28,780
For example, MEG3,
which is maternally expressed gene three,

75
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,814
exhibited the highest
methylation percentage at 73%.

76
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:37,410
While PEG3, which stands for
paternally expressed gene,

77
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,870
had the lowest DNA methylation
percentage at 35%.

78
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,300
This figure now incorporates phthalate
exposures by looking at metabolites

79
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,990
of the high-volume phthalate called DEHP.

80
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,590
For all four phthalate metabolites,

81
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,580
there was a positive association between
average pregnancy levels and mean DNA

82
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,970
methylation of the MEG3 differentially
methylated region in the infants.

83
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,540
This means higher levels of phthalates
were associated with higher levels of DNA

84
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,374
methylation, which in turn can affect
the gene expression level of this gene.

85
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:16,850
In the CHAMACOS newborn,

86
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,630
prenatal exposures to several DEHP
metabolites were positively and

87
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,560
significantly associated
with DNA methylation.

88
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,890
Particularly at that MEG3 DMR,
which is differentially methylated region.

89
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:35,330
This is just one of many studies that
shows either in epidemiological cohorts,

90
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:41,749
or animal models the relationship between
toxicant exposures and the epigenome.
