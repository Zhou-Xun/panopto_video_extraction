1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,210
There is a business.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,020
I think you make your point just like this, but I don't know.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:38,460
I don't have much there. No, I don't think that we should go on to get anything like that for companies.

4
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:48,810
That would be. It was my idea us doing that would not know where they were.

5
00:00:50,210 --> 00:01:15,780
I mean, I think probably because I know I guess it was like I was like it was like,

6
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:42,480
oh, I just like the other day I think I recommended to one another like.

7
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:56,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

8
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,010
Mean, I didn't like it.

9
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:12,059
And I think that's really.

10
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:36,360
Yeah. But you know, I would like to get into pictures with my friends or like there's one on top of them.

11
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,770
I hope so. I know.

12
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:57,750
All right. Well, you know the way and of course, that morning you are over making a lot of numbers.

13
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:06,210
And rest of the week you have very important but very different kind of communication.

14
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:14,160
Focus is not on too much on quantity or probability, conceptual relationships.

15
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,860
I spent two classes on this. I, I always go back and forth about how much time to spend on this.

16
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,220
I don't want you to focus so much on the particular method.

17
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,070
We're going to go through the method because I think there's value in understanding it.

18
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,010
I'm going to say right now, even the people who developed this method don't really do it at the level of detail.

19
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,460
They describe it in the book because it's a heck of a lot of work.

20
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,210
That doesn't mean, however, that there aren't some really important insights, both in terms of figuring out what your goal is.

21
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:56,730
And in terms of bringing aspects of this methodology into your workflow as you're designing communications so that you can make them better.

22
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:06,120
So I'm going to talk about this from a sort of pragmatic, practical standpoint that is going to be more sort of the overview of the approach.

23
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,030
We'll talk about situations in which it might be relevant.

24
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:17,580
I'm going to do a demonstration of what a mental models interview looks like and sort of see how it plays out.

25
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,150
As per the known up there, there is no class. On Thursday I will be in Denver.

26
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:34,689
I cannot do the class from Denver. October is always the complicated season for me and I apologize for the way this is going to mess up the schedule.

27
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,930
But this is when all my major conferences and things tend to hit.

28
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:45,880
So we're going to be on again, off again for this whole month between my travel and fall break.

29
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,130
It just plays out this way.

30
00:04:50,370 --> 00:05:00,450
I'm working on the grading, the test results, and I will it's going to be a week before I get back to you, just given the way everything worked.

31
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:08,430
So I have no update on that because it's going to take me a while to get through where we are going.

32
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:16,230
Just let me a sense as to the flow of the class from here. We spend essentially two weeks, but only two sort of poor class days.

33
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,640
I must make a lot of stuff and then I'm going to start putting the pieces together

34
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:27,870
in terms of thinking about how do we facilitate good decision making about risk.

35
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:37,130
And so we're going to spend a few different days talking about. Do we need numbers or do we not need numbers?

36
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,820
What are some of the ethical goals in facilitating people making being participants in decision making about risk?

37
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:52,070
We'll talk about the concept of shared decision making in clinical medicine as an idea, and we'll sort of set you up for the next assignment.

38
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,170
Next assignment, which is do leave in early November.

39
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:04,490
So we got some time is a piece of something that we refer to as a patient decision aid.

40
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:10,520
So it's something we are gathering lots of risk and benefit information to.

41
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,890
In this case, a table. You know, in the real world you have the table,

42
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:24,049
plus you have lots of supporting material that's designed to help somebody understand the tradeoffs facing whatever their

43
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:30,380
choice is and what you're going to be doing for your assignment after we go through all of the different stuff related to it,

44
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,430
is making that kind of material for a particular choice.

45
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:41,780
Why don't I bring this up? Because I'll give you the choice of topics for that assignment.

46
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:52,260
So there are some kind of strengths and we'll keep talking about this, but you can do your assignment on a medical choice.

47
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:59,800
You can do it on an environmental choice, but it needs to be something in which there are multiple risks and benefits.

48
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:11,140
I think we discussed in quantitative terms, the trade off is the keyword, you know, benefits plus side effects or, you know,

49
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:19,150
effectiveness plus costs and time unlike anything which there's trade offs is going to be the space in which we're working.

50
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,070
So just want to get you thinking about this. What are the kinds of things that you're interested in?

51
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,360
I will have lots of examples that we'll go through as we as we get into this.

52
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,520
But if you're like, Oh, I'm really passionate about specific things, birth control,

53
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:39,010
but like there's plenty of risk tradeoffs in birth control decisions.

54
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,950
And we can talk about how you might try and think about organizing that information to facilitate decision making.

55
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:52,650
So that's for the next month or so. And then there's going to be another shift in this course.

56
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,810
We moved from sort of deliberative, focused decision making.

57
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:08,590
Crises. It's kind of November talking about crisis situations and then a few random topics to pull this all together in December.

58
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,490
But that's the overview of where we're going. But this is sort of the first major shift in this course.

59
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,120
If, as you're thinking about this, you're like, ha has still got some questions about numbers, like, please feel free to reach out to me.

60
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,480
Why does he keep coming back to the stuff that we've talked about this first month?

61
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,420
But that's this is the end of the time in which we're going to really going to be pushing, like how do we talk about numbers?

62
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:39,430
All right. So, as I said, today is all about sort of this big overview of mental models and why.

63
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,690
Why is this an approach to risk communication that's important?

64
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,610
I want to start before I get into musings, afraid to come out with sort of.

65
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:54,430
What did you take away as you were reading those initial chapters from the book?

66
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,440
We talked about that a lot. What did you take away about the philosophy?

67
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:11,380
Least their approach. And did anything seem in contrast or different from the way in which you've often thought about educating people?

68
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,280
Was curious, what did you take away from those three? Were you surprised by them or was there anything like, Wow, I never thought of it that way.

69
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,120
Yeah. It's like trying to prioritize people's beliefs.

70
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,779
Like what do these interviews try to address?

71
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,190
The most concerning belief is the most concerning part of it.

72
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,420
Yes. So there's a there's a disturbing newness to it.

73
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:47,420
That's the wrong word. But it's not just tallying up the things that somebody knows.

74
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,980
But but being sort of conscious about certain things are more important than others,

75
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:59,390
and that that has an influence on both how they're going to behave and then what that means for us as communicators.

76
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:12,150
What else, if anything, could you get from a. I'll show you this.

77
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,500
Oh, good. Oh, I just thought it was really interesting how it was so.

78
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,200
It's not like patient focus, but focused on what people need, something like a regular person.

79
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,120
Because I think a lot of the times when I think about like communication is like all this,

80
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,210
like the expert and they're like telling you to read, sorry.

81
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:35,380
Yeah, this one, it's like, Oh, what are people, like, worried about?

82
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,040
Yeah.

83
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:47,069
I like the way you're phrasing this in the sense that it's I would use the phrase audience focused rather than starting from the expert and saying,

84
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:56,730
what do they know and what do we need to go from expert to audience in starting from the audience and say, what do they not know?

85
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,010
What is missing here? What is wrong here?

86
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,430
The key thing I think we need to take away from this is.

87
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,190
If they've already got it, you don't have to talk about it.

88
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:22,260
And that is so fundamentally in contrast to the way much of health education is designed.

89
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,640
We start to, you know, here are the things that are relevant to this.

90
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,190
We listen and we're complete and we keep emphasizing them because they're foundational.

91
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:40,630
And if the audience already has it, I'll be able to provide you food as a waste of our time.

92
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,450
And their time. Because they already have it.

93
00:11:48,430 --> 00:12:00,490
So if a health education, if a sort of classic Greek health education message is let's give you everything.

94
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:13,670
All the things that might be relevant to this. This is like a, I think, trying to avoid using a militaristic metaphor here, but I'm having difficulty.

95
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:22,030
Like, this is like a super targeted. You know, precise delivery of information.

96
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:30,630
The thing that they don't get at nothing else. And notice the problem here is if you're going to take that philosophy.

97
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,980
You better know what it is that you need to be targeted.

98
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,850
Because if you hit the wrong thing. There's no effect.

99
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:45,600
Like if you give them something, they already know that nothing is going to change in their behavior because they already knew that.

100
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:53,060
The only thing that's going to change behavior, the only thing that's going to change their their thoughts or feelings about that is,

101
00:12:53,620 --> 00:13:02,590
is if we target the thing that they don't know, they don't understand, it's that which requires us to go to them first and understand that.

102
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:13,770
So. Let's spend a little bit of time talking about some of the kinds of problems and how public health and medical education,

103
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,919
etc., that are fundamentally this kind of problem where the core issue is not a number.

104
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,160
It's they don't know this. And.

105
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:32,710
Let's start off with a fear. You were talking in your musing about HPV.

106
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:40,220
So let's talk. How is HPV a domain in which sort of the mental model matters?

107
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:47,030
Well, I was talking about how when I was in middle school, it was like time to get the HPV series.

108
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:52,399
My mom had said no originally because I feel like she doesn't know a lot about it.

109
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,680
And also, like, you know, I think it's like everyone's like a sexually transmitted disease and all of that.

110
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,610
And so it's more like, Oh, I got to worry about this. My kids don't need to worry about this kind of thing.

111
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:08,780
And it wasn't until like I got into high school where I was like, it's time for me to just get it.

112
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,780
Like, why am I going to not get it? And I had to convince her.

113
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,969
Like, part of it was like social media and what she heard from other parents and so on.

114
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,440
The misinformation that was around that was influencing her into like not wanting us to get it.

115
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:29,960
So yeah, there's two mental models that have already popped up in my test pieces and I want to make sure we pull both of them out

116
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:36,230
because there are two different ways to look at why one gets vaccinated for HPV or the consequences of getting vaccinated.

117
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:45,450
What do you hear? How you know? What is HPV protecting against?

118
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,110
What is the HPV vaccine protecting against? Cervical.

119
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,110
Cervical cancer. So one framing here is cancer protection.

120
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,339
But you didn't actually use the word cancer when you were describing what your mom was talking about,

121
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,120
what you what the what came up in the context of discussing this.

122
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,950
So one framing is the cancer framing like this is a disease prevention intervention.

123
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:18,390
And in fact, I have seen doctors pitch the HPV vaccine very narrowly that way.

124
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,790
This is a vaccine that protects against cancer. Why would you ever not want to be vaccinated against cancer?

125
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,970
Period. End of conversation. Right.

126
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,900
Right. What's the other framing that came out that your mom did bring up?

127
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,260
Sexually transmitted disease. Sexually transmitted disease.

128
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,550
So that's a model that isn't actually about what the disease is.

129
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:45,360
It's about a behavior and protecting against transmission of diseases occurring in the context of sex.

130
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,880
That mental model triggers certain use.

131
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:55,530
I'm not going to get into the rightness of wrongness, but let's just acknowledge the trigger.

132
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,929
Certain believes that who needs to be protected against sexually transmitted diseases?

133
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:04,090
People who are sexually active. That defines who is the relevant group.

134
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:12,160
You're right. Who should be being protected or not? If you're not engaging in sexual activity, then you shouldn't necessarily need the vaccine.

135
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:26,719
That's what the logic says. Notice, the wrongness or wrongness of that belief aligns to the behavior.

136
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,250
And by the way, it's not particularly wrong in the absolute sense,

137
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:37,549
like we do certain things in public health for people who are sexually active or have multiple

138
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,330
partners versus those who are in monogamous relationships or who are not sexually active.

139
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:51,470
We got involved in, for example, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis by behavior.

140
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,950
So it's not that the mental model is coming from nowhere. It's just being applied here.

141
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:06,590
Which frame comes to mind changes? Whether or not you think a 13 year old is a good person target for HPV vaccination.

142
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:16,860
I think one of the fundamental flaws that public health is rolling out HPV vaccination.

143
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,240
They've. The initial rollout in the United States.

144
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:36,540
It's only because. Sugar is a very specific kind of mental model of what is it protecting against and who is it who needs to be protected?

145
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:43,790
Right now, HPV vaccination is recommended for all teens, boys and girls.

146
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:49,760
That is not yet even really, truly part of the conversation because the initial rollout was gender specific.

147
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:59,510
And even now the conversation is all around the question of vaccinating prior to the initiation of sexual activity rather than around cancer.

148
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:04,350
So this is this is why we're talking about this stuff. I get notes.

149
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:10,510
There's no probabilities here. I'm not talking about. To what degree does the vaccine inhibit the transmission of that?

150
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,000
No, we're not in that space. This is just about the link.

151
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,790
I notice also that this isn't purely a biological thing.

152
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:25,660
Like this question of does being vaccinated modify someone's sexual behavior

153
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,730
is just as much a part of the mental model of risk as anything biological.

154
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:40,090
So this is this is an example of a situation in which, you know, the conversation is really a mental models conversation,

155
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,630
not a numerical risk conversation, not a vaccine effectiveness conversation.

156
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:59,860
So like three or four or five of you talk about some of the vaccines and mental models associated with vaccines.

157
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,040
So it's development process, things like that.

158
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,450
I'm going to touch a little bit, but I think everybody's got some insights that are going to be relevant.

159
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,570
Let me start, however, Amber.

160
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:23,160
I know you just popped in here, but we're talking about the vaccine and you brought up in your musings the development process.

161
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:31,709
Yes. Yes. And what was I think was interesting about what you wrote about was the sort of the way in

162
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:37,380
which the developed process made you feel about is this something worth trusting or not,

163
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,870
which is a conversation that has been happening throughout the particularly the early rollout of the vaccine?

164
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:50,640
Yeah, I was fresh out of undergrad and just graduated with a bachelor's in biology.

165
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:59,309
And I had a choice in genetics and understood the mechanism of learning vaccines enough to say,

166
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:03,450
okay, these things for me, first of all, say legitimate.

167
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:10,829
However, just my family and the communities that I was surrounded by, primarily,

168
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:18,870
there were a lot of were there was a lot of worry and concern on the part of the black community in taking that vaccine.

169
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:27,060
And my science side was like 90% sure I was okay with that 10% because once you get the vaccine, you can't say.

170
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,630
So that 10% was enough to keep me hesitant from getting vaccinated.

171
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:41,490
And it took some conversations and a lot of just exploring the literature.

172
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:51,870
I mentioned in my meeting that the inspiration I came here for research to finally help me to make the decision to go.

173
00:20:52,650 --> 00:21:04,740
But it was definitely hard. Yeah. And, you know, things that come up, especially about new vaccines, new me is, of course,

174
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:13,200
a history of exploitation of populations for the purposes of testing medical innovations and.

175
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,700
That's another piece of mental model. Yeah.

176
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,210
That's not coming from nowhere. We have real history of.

177
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,600
Patterns of exploitation of particular populations.

178
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,110
For testing of vaccines. For testing of innovation.

179
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,820
So the question becomes.

180
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:43,390
That knowledge exists. We cannot deny its truth. Does it apply in this case?

181
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:54,150
No, in this case it didn't, because I was looking at the statistics of who was getting access to this vaccine is in my family and in my community.

182
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:59,910
There were conversations about us being the guinea pigs, and if we take the vaccine first,

183
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:05,920
we're going to experience all like, you know, the horrible side or take it with a tweet and give it to everyone else.

184
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:13,840
That was something that was a real fear for my family and I, and that was not the case.

185
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:22,000
And also that the statistics of who with access to these vaccines, it was primarily white, affluent.

186
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:30,760
Absolutely. Yeah. And so even with that, there was still in my head, there was still more fears, even though I was seeing that it is not,

187
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,760
in fact a low SPF and communities of color that are getting the vaccine first and being tested.

188
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,600
I was just actually reading an article today in The New York Times about the way that the.

189
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:54,990
Disparities in COVID 19 vaccine roll out between predominately black communities like this have actually been narrowed over time over the past year.

190
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,940
But this is the point is that there is a larger framing of risk here.

191
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,929
We do not want to go to this conversation.

192
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:12,479
Next is I don't want you to think about mental models as only being about the the biological risk, the side effects of the vaccine.

193
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,700
What would the particular medical consequence? And what about those models of the risk?

194
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:27,660
We've been talking about everything, whether that's social context, whether that's social risk, stigma,

195
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:36,540
all of these kinds of things can be part of the process when somebody talks about or read some stuff about sexually transmitted infections.

196
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:43,590
Next class. But tell me, somebody talks about mental models of HIV, for example.

197
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:49,830
It is totally appropriate to include in that mental model substance use.

198
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:58,780
As associated with behaviors which then potentially change one's risk of contracting HIV.

199
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,740
This is a social model, not necessarily a biological model.

200
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:12,190
And so the history of the beliefs that are held by the target audience of all types that influence what is seen in the States,

201
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:19,750
what is not is seen as safe is irrelevant for thinking about the let alone what we're talking about.

202
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:30,590
COVID 19 vaccination at its development final. You're talking and you're musing about the speed with which it was developed, if I remember correctly.

203
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:36,920
Yeah. And that's another mental model. So talk a little bit about what you wrote about, because I wanted to respond to that.

204
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:45,870
So it doesn't matter if you don't remember exactly. I just remember we were talking about sort of like how it comes up.

205
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,760
This was something we were talking about, something I remember a lot of people talking about,

206
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,620
you know, do I trust this vaccine because it got developed in months rather than years?

207
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:01,790
Yeah. So, I mean, the average vaccine development cycle is more than ten years.

208
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:07,190
Yeah. Yeah. Usually they're like 26 years for smallpox vaccines.

209
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:14,220
30 years for to tetanus and 40 years for the influenza vaccine.

210
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:25,580
So, I mean, it's pretty I'm worried about the vaccine because it's actually invented over a year.

211
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:32,149
Just over a year. Yeah. So as we can have knowledge, this is a new process.

212
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:36,590
We're talking about many vaccines is a different biological process being operated for its development.

213
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:44,670
And that's. May or may not be part of people's mental models, but even if it isn't,

214
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:51,900
the it's appropriate for someone to say, hmm, how do I feel safe about medical interventions?

215
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:57,560
Because they're been tested, because they've gone through the long term development processes.

216
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:06,060
If we have trust in those processes, what does it say to me if this vaccine is now being delivered to market super fast?

217
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:13,660
It's not crazy for somebody to be then saying, Hey, why should I believe that this thing is safe?

218
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:22,260
Especially when you do have history of vaccine rollouts in which there were problems.

219
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,820
I don't know if you guys are familiar, but when the polio vaccine first rolled out,

220
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,530
it was something referred to as the cutter incident in which a bunch of polio

221
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:37,260
vaccines were not appropriately inactivated and caused hundreds of cases of polio.

222
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,350
Real history. So the idea of, hey, we're rushing this thing out.

223
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,770
Maybe it's not safe. Is it reasonable mental model?

224
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:57,630
So if that's going to be a belief held within the community, then we need to think about, well, okay, how do we respond to that?

225
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:05,350
What is it that the expert believes? That makes them feel safe, despite the fact that this is coming out so fast.

226
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:13,450
And then think about design and communications to go on and on about.

227
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:24,120
COVID 19 vaccines. But there's certainly some other things that are associated with lots of the vaccines and mental models matter a lot.

228
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:30,629
But one other obvious one I want to make sure to hit up. I apologize if I mispronouncing up that.

229
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:34,860
Correct. You were talking about herd immunity.

230
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,300
The concept of herd immunity. So let's talk a little bit about that.

231
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:45,570
What's so hard about this? So like in terms of like.

232
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:54,600
So I guess in my experience, like when the vaccines were still coming out and like I.

233
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:02,379
And like nurses and just people that we're talking about,

234
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:10,630
like herd immunity and like even if like you are vaccinated and you still tested positive for like stuff like that, like.

235
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,970
Health professionals would bring up herd immunity. But it was like there was already such.

236
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:31,379
There are already so many other emotional reactions to being afraid about exposure and stuff like that and like even getting the vaccine.

237
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:37,890
But like it wasn't, I guess, the proper time to really like take the time to like understand herd immunity.

238
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:43,350
Whereas like if risk communication for.

239
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,290
Those kind of concepts was talked about maybe like during like.

240
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:55,239
Like childhood immunization schedules and stuff like that.

241
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,020
Like I would probably that's like, not like state of emergency.

242
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:03,770
Like, it's, it's more. It could be more receptive.

243
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:07,790
And that's what I kind of talked about. So herd immunity is a complicated thing.

244
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:16,549
And you're right for bringing up the question of how is this talked about when we're not in the middle of a crisis?

245
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,930
Like it's not like we don't have vaccines for other purposes.

246
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,030
It's not like the concept of herd immunity is irrelevant if we're talking about

247
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,560
measles or pertussis or all of the other things that we get vaccinated for.

248
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:39,760
The reason why I want to bring it up, though, is. Want us to zoom in on the question of what is the benefit of being vaccinated?

249
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,030
So idea number one. Direct individual protection.

250
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:57,260
If you're somebody breathes on you, you get exposed to the virus, how likely are you to get sick?

251
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:11,160
That's almost everybody's mental model of a vaccine with something that's in that space, some kind of direct exposure protection.

252
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,490
What we want to think about herd immunity.

253
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:26,970
We're missing probably the bigger impact of vaccines, which is what if the chance that somebody breathes on me in the first place?

254
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,870
More that the black community that I am in is vaccinated is the less likely it is

255
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:37,140
that somebody is actually going to breathe on me and expose me in the first place.

256
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:43,890
And that protection. It's often orders of magnitude more important than the direct protection.

257
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:52,359
So the concept of heard the word have you ever heard of unity gets bandied around and honestly,

258
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:57,670
I think it gets bandied around in public health communication in ways that confuse people more often than help.

259
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:05,620
Because we don't have to actually achieve the scientific level of herd immunity to start to get some

260
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:10,930
of the protection of minimizing the number of times when the degree to which I'm being exposed.

261
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:19,649
The concept of herd immunity in the public health sense is a very specific idea for reducing the prevalence of the disease

262
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:28,140
within the population so low that an infection essentially can't take hold and become endemic even within a small community.

263
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:37,580
But at the individual level, if we're communicating with people, the hard part is often thinking beyond the individual.

264
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:46,310
Because notice I'll get I'm going to talk about a lot of terms here. If all you think about is the vaccine will protect me if I get breathed on.

265
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:53,530
And you don't believe that you're going to get briefed on. How would you get back to.

266
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:01,830
There's no benefit to you. Yeah. Yeah. That kind of made me think of, like, another example.

267
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:10,250
Like, even so. Like I'm vaccinated and I still got exposed to COVID like last year.

268
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:17,840
And even though, like, I have knowledge of herd immunity and I know what it is and I also know that there's drug benefit and community benefit.

269
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:30,290
It was still like what I like called about called like a nurse or something about like oh like like do I test positive?

270
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,410
Like, how do I know? Should I, like, you know, get tested or not?

271
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:39,280
I was like, definitely weird. I was like, okay, I got the vaccine.

272
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,000
I'm probably still going to test positive and like that that that can happen.

273
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:53,880
But it's like. I the concept of like even like umbrella vaccines being like, what is that like umbrella protection.

274
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:58,410
Like that's also not very understood. And like, that's a concept that it's like.

275
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:08,940
Okay? Like, it's not this like, 100%, um, like direct benefit or direct protection,

276
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:14,280
but because it's direct protection and community protection, that's what keeps you safe.

277
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,330
And that's like also part of that, like, and understanding that.

278
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:24,360
And it's been you. That's another piece here in terms of the model that is relevant.

279
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:29,920
Like if you're vaccinated, as we all are here because of the rules.

280
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:35,300
The University of Michigan. And you get COVID, which happens.

281
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:41,840
What do you believe? Do you believe that the vaccine failed?

282
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:47,400
Or do you believe that it's simply not a perfect thing?

283
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:54,770
Like much of the resistance. Yet we talked about some color. But this has been a major conversation about influenza vaccine for decades.

284
00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:04,460
Like people got influenza vaccine and then got flu and then were convinced by let's flash back to the beginning of the class.

285
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:10,430
You do something, you think it's going to keep you safe, do you think you're safe, then a bad thing occurs.

286
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:16,400
What do you conclude from that experiential learning? Hey, it must not be very effective at keeping me safe.

287
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:21,799
What do they conclude? The flu vaccine doesn't help. Next year.

288
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:32,629
Do they get vaccinated? No. So experiential learning of breakthrough infections undermines people's mental models of the idea of vaccines,

289
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:36,290
even though that, of course, could happen just by chance because vaccines are not perfect.

290
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:46,200
So. When we're engaging with somebody about, you know, what happens if you get infected,

291
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:55,140
that's also relevant is are they going to see this as my mental model is right now if I were to become infected with COVID 19.

292
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:06,660
Are is super infectious. Even with vaccination there, if I'm directly exposed, there's a non-trivial chance that I'm going to get infected.

293
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:13,620
The benefit of the vaccine is grounded not in protecting me from getting infected, but in protecting me from dying and getting hospitalized.

294
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:22,950
It's just that I'm just laying out a mental model here. But if that's my mental model, I'm not going to be anti-vaccine if I get sick.

295
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:27,990
But if you have a mental model that says, if I get vaccinated, I will never get sick and then you get sick.

296
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:33,930
But we're not going to be surprised if people then are skeptical about the value of vaccination.

297
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:44,940
So again, here is not just describing why should you do this, but how do they then interpret the experiences they have after that point?

298
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,870
The experiential learning is going to be influenced by the mental models we hold.

299
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,160
What we believe is the cause of the outcomes we're experiencing.

300
00:35:55,170 --> 00:36:02,670
And we got into that a little bit with the with the first assignment and people thinking about how to crawl, how to food poisoning.

301
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:09,389
How does that happen? Like, what are the things if you have risk factor beliefs and says, you know, oh,

302
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:15,510
this wasn't cooked very well or it wasn't handled appropriately, those kinds of risk factor beliefs, our analytical knowledge.

303
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:20,379
So there really are a mental model that. All right.

304
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:25,600
So I'm talking about this in the abstract. I want to touch upon a couple more quick examples and then get into.

305
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,720
Demonstrating how this can play out in the context of learning about people's mental model.

306
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,860
And these are a step away from the vaccine context for a moment.

307
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,440
I want to go next. Max.

308
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:51,510
Let's talk about people's mental models and vaping. So.

309
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:58,860
What were you? I tried to remember the details of what you were talking about in your music, but you touched upon a few things I wanted to react to.

310
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,480
I guess I was kind of a friend of I said before that like obviously you are trying to

311
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,740
address people's beliefs first like to really like get to the source of the problem.

312
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:12,299
Um, I like some of these, like when e-cigarettes are really popular.

313
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:18,390
Initially a lot of the marketing was like playing off of they were like the new hip thing to do instead of smoking.

314
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:22,770
Cigarets. Yeah, the main part of it was they're also not as bad as cigarets.

315
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,990
Um, because they're not like is or have as many chemicals in it.

316
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,199
But a lot of the research nowadays shows that it can cause popcorn lung,

317
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:37,640
that it can cause severe nicotine addiction because some of the stuff like cartridges have more nicotine than the cigaret.

318
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,050
So um, trying to address that like popularity versus science.

319
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:48,780
Yeah, I'll even zoom in putting aside the popularity and the way they were marketed, but just that last piece.

320
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,770
Are they safer than Cigarets? Is a mental moral question.

321
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:59,700
And if you frame it in different ways, you come up with different answers. So one answer you just brought up is around the concentration of nicotine.

322
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:09,480
So to the extent that vapes may have equal or potentially even higher concentrations of nicotine in the cigarets do that answers you one way.

323
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:16,020
If you think about it in terms of the number of chemicals or the particular types of chemicals that are generated when you burn something,

324
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,990
they don't have those. They may be seen as much safer. And by the way, notice that these answers can exist simultaneously.

325
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:29,580
This could be both true that they are safer in one way and less safe in another way.

326
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,440
Like a lot of the debate within public health about should public health be looking

327
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:44,200
at e-cigarettes as a tool to reduce the burden of smoking in the population trends,

328
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,030
in and around its benefit and avoidance of those kinds of carcinogenic chemicals,

329
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:57,730
versus a tool for hooking more and more people on to nicotine, which is one of the most addictive chemicals we know.

330
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:06,860
It's a very different framing, the same thing. I found it fascinating, just sort of watching this whole story unfold.

331
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:13,929
Different people focus in on different pieces of the mental model, different aspects of the risk benefit tradeoff.

332
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:17,290
And they tend to they tend to zoom in on the piece that aligns with.

333
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,550
What they care about.

334
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:28,940
So were some very prominent public health smoking researchers who trumpeted e-cigarettes as they were coming out as great things.

335
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:39,490
And there were some at the same time some more adolescent focused health researchers who were panicking as they were being introduced.

336
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,680
Again. It's just. Around the ways in which these different risks are present.

337
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:53,990
More. I want to hit before we go on. Know.

338
00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:00,379
We're talking about tracheostomy. Yeah. So I was talking about an experience.

339
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:07,130
I had my first month of residency where I had a patient who had a lot of different respiratory issues,

340
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:15,320
had been intubated for quite some time, had multiple attempts to get him activated that were unsuccessful.

341
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:22,400
So we ended up talking to him and his family about a tracheostomy, and he did fine here.

342
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,469
So I drink gas.

343
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:31,190
Me would be instead of having like a tube that goes down your throat, through your mouth, it would be a tube that comes out through your trachea.

344
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:35,599
So that way you can breathe without having to have like the tube in your mouth.

345
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,160
And so it's a lot more comfortable. You ought to be sedated. So it's a really good quality of life measure.

346
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:50,170
And so with that patient, he kept saying like he didn't want to be have the tube in his mouth anymore, but he didn't want to have the tracheostomy.

347
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:57,370
And we kept trying to explain to him that, like, we could take the tube out, but then he would, like, stop breathing.

348
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,200
And so there's like two big pieces here, like of his mental model that we weren't getting, which is that one,

349
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:10,150
he didn't understand that if we took the tube out and he said no to putting the two back in that not breathing with equal him dying.

350
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:17,150
And then part two was that he didn't want the tracheostomy because he thought he wouldn't be able to ever speak again.

351
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:24,790
And so we didn't have like those like nuance conversations, like we were understanding that we were just so focused in on like trying to be

352
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:29,470
able to get him off this event and like moved along in his course of progress.

353
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,610
The speaking piece, there is a beautiful example of a misconception.

354
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:40,420
It's not crazy to imagine having a tube coming out of your throat as disrupting your ability to speak.

355
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,920
But because that's not true, and you know that that's not true.

356
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,400
It never comes to your mind that you might need to say that to somebody.

357
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,760
But because he believes that that's a big deal, really important in his life.

358
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:02,500
So that was a very strong thing inhibiting him and potentially going through with that choice.

359
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:07,090
That's a nice example in which all of a sudden it didn't even take that long.

360
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,650
Think once you have that knowledge and you're like, Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

361
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:16,000
You're going to be able to speak. You're just going to be like like in 10 seconds.

362
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,420
That conversation would shift in a qualitative way. I've seen this play out multiple times.

363
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:29,230
Where? Again, this is the problem of us as experts when we know something isn't true.

364
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,790
We don't necessarily remind people that it isn't true because it's obvious to us.

365
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:38,910
But when you zoom in and you capture those those focused misconceptions, then you can now wait.

366
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,570
I got to tell you this and be explicit about this,

367
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:47,990
because otherwise you're going to believe this and that's going to affect your perception of the benefits of the rest of this choice.

368
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,390
So this is the kind of stuff that we want to get into.

369
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:58,530
So now I'm going to ask the only time in this class I'm going to do this, and I promise beforehand nobody is going to get embarrassed.

370
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:09,620
Okay. But I need a volunteer. Somebody who's wanted to come up here and be interviewed by me for just a few moments in a mental models approach,

371
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,380
just as a way of demonstrating this. I promise, I really I've done this kind of work.

372
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:23,210
Well, I promise not to be a problem. Not one.

373
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,350
So what Carolyn's coming up with, I want the rest of you to do.

374
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:38,670
I'm going to interview Carolyn about a particular health behavior and why we do it.

375
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,370
And we perceive it as other things that we need to do. All you to do is to take notes.

376
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,980
In the context. Think about this from a mental model standpoint.

377
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:56,750
What are the specific concepts, the ideas, the nodes in those mental models that you hear come out of her mouth?

378
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:01,910
The connections here are not as we go through this.

379
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:11,480
I was going to do this for like five or 10 minutes. I just want you to see what you can see coming out of the conversation.

380
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:22,680
Okay. All right. So. What I want to talk about today is something that we do.

381
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:28,000
We all know a fairly substantial amount in this. Hand-washing.

382
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:40,990
I. Caroline. Tell me things that you know about hand-washing handwashing from germs and.

383
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
It reduces the spread of.

384
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:56,450
All right. Particularly important when you are visible.

385
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:12,240
I can speak and. She obviously would have to learn more about that.

386
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:23,670
Um, well, obviously you use your hands to go to the bathroom and you took a lot of surfaces in there.

387
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:26,730
Okay. Um, and you don't always know.

388
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:32,040
And then also wash your hands. So it's important to just get into the habit of doing it.

389
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:37,550
All right. Do you think anything else? I don't think so.

390
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:44,080
So, can you tell me about how someone is supposed to wash their hands?

391
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:48,370
Yes. So. Um.

392
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:57,220
I'm just gonna. So let your hands clean up on your hands.

393
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:05,080
If you care about environment. If you can turn off the water. Lather up for 20 seconds.

394
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:09,370
Okay. Water back on and rinse your hands thoroughly.

395
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,830
And then. That down?

396
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,730
Yeah. Like the specific way that you wash your hands.

397
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:22,750
So, like, doctors know this and, like, surgeons and stuff, but, like, you really have to get, like, in between fingers.

398
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:30,790
I think there's some sort of technique where you, like, let it actually run down the way, like the water to raise your hands.

399
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,960
I did a hand out on that also, Chad.

400
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:39,370
Anything else that comes to mind? How are you supposed to wash?

401
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,970
Yes. You can sing Happy Birthday songs for you. Right.

402
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:49,650
And that's like the 20 seconds that you're supposed to have.

403
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:57,510
Yeah. That's not always wash your hands before they go back to work.

404
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:07,410
All right. Um, and they serve food, so you wouldn't transmit the disease?

405
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:12,450
Yeah, because that's all. Okay.

406
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:16,910
Um, tell me about when you are.

407
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:26,910
You touched upon the song, but, but yeah, well, at the age of COVID, it's like all the time now through before.

408
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:37,620
Well, actually, that's a good idea. I mean, for you, especially if you're a woman and after you go to the bathroom before eat,

409
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:45,480
maybe after you eat, after you blow your nose, touch your mouth and nose her eyes.

410
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,710
I sometimes think about it, but maybe it's getting closer.

411
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:57,190
Right. Obviously, you deal with patients before the interaction.

412
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,290
What do you think of the publicity? Because you're on the subway.

413
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:11,370
Like, don't touch anything until you wash your hands. Like on your body or on a bus.

414
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,210
I was doing up a grocery shopping and it was just part of life.

415
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,410
Like, it's a habit you get into when you touch it.

416
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,050
There's any chance that you're, like, touching publicly contaminated surfaces.

417
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:30,510
That's what keeps you from washing your hands.

418
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:38,280
Leadership, time and boredom. It's like a really boring thing to do.

419
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:45,960
It's like staring at yourself in the mirror for 20 seconds, and you have to do that like, multiple times a day.

420
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:53,850
And I think that sometimes you just don't have the patience for it, I guess.

421
00:48:53,850 --> 00:49:02,880
And like, there's more pressing things. Maybe you really like if I'm home working all day, it's not like the most important thing for me to like.

422
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:08,490
Be super thorough, like a surgeon would be there when I'm washing my hands.

423
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:17,670
There's no. All right.

424
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:24,000
Thank you. All right.

425
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:31,110
This is why I'm not worried about this. We all have thought about hand washing enough that everybody has something to talk about here.

426
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:39,960
But, of course, hand-washing is a core public health behavior, and it's related to a lot of our concepts about infection and risk.

427
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:46,920
So there's a lot that could be pulled out here. So I'm a shout out stuff that you heard.

428
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:54,540
So concepts, ideas, and let's just get as much as we can about the board.

429
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:59,190
And then there's going to be some things I'm going to call out, both for what's here and what's not here.

430
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,620
And by the way, don't worry about what's not here. This is the super compressed version of this.

431
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:10,530
Like, if I really wanted to pull out every last thing, there are many props I could have given you to really extract more stuff.

432
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:14,820
But as a demonstration of, like, what can we learn? Like, this only took 5 minutes.

433
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:18,260
There was a lot here. So this shout salad stuff.

434
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:25,560
What did you hear? Surfaces of germs as we've got germs.

435
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:34,820
Surfaces. Reduces the spread of infection so we can spread.

436
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:40,220
Infection. Else.

437
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:47,170
Medical professionals. Right. So rationales.

438
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:55,550
There are certain people who both do it more often and know how to do it, but also are required to do it.

439
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:58,880
What else? Yeah. Proper hand-washing or proper ways to do it.

440
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:05,090
So let's dove super deep into that. What do you mean when you hear her say how long?

441
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:11,210
So we've got time. Time was a variable that came up in terms of how long somebody washed.

442
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:16,030
What else came up before handling food? Okay, so when.

443
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:20,450
Before food and water.

444
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:27,080
Water was good technique. Again, specific finger like technique, far between fingers.

445
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:35,000
So we got between. And my handwriting is terrible here and I'm just getting stuff up here.

446
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,719
So there was there was a specific thing about you got to get between the fingers.

447
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,050
It's not just good enough to go on on the outside. Good.

448
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:46,220
Well, get it off with your elbow. Yep. So we got the elbow.

449
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:53,790
The order in which you're doing things 21. So let's talk about the order.

450
00:51:54,090 --> 00:52:04,560
What did you hear in specific? So she turns on the water, she gets her hands with soap, and she describes her hands for 20 seconds and then rinses.

451
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:13,100
So nobody can read this water. So scrub, rinse.

452
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,250
Not. Soap, water, red light.

453
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,350
You got to get your hands wet before you put the soap on. That's actually kind of really important piece here.

454
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:32,580
If you didn't know that you would use all of these things and not actually be very effective scrubbing before the soap is on.

455
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,890
Also not super helpful. Seems obvious.

456
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,880
Don't assume things. Yeah.

457
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:45,200
You also can try it afterwards. Yeah. She just said dry.

458
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:49,430
There's a lot you could go into there. Oh, please do that one.

459
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:53,930
Okay. So I know people are very environmentally sensitive,

460
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:59,870
but there's a lot of research that those air dryers actually just circulate germs back on to your hands.

461
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,890
So they're actually really bad for public health.

462
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:08,480
So there's not the air dryer versus the towel.

463
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:14,630
The question now. Know what else comes up when you think about drying hands?

464
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,900
Using our pants. Using our pants? Yes.

465
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:25,149
So if what I used to dry my hands is a contaminated surface, like, say,

466
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:29,890
a kitchen towel that has been sitting there for over and over being used over and over for lots of different things.

467
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:36,560
I am instantly contaminating my hands. If you use a paper towel.

468
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:42,620
That's fresh at that moment that you get it. By the way, another piece here.

469
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,300
I thought we sort of cut this off at the end of drying one's hands.

470
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:53,250
I need to get out of the room. You use the paper towel to open the door.

471
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:58,680
So the question of surfaces as tying to what's on your hand.

472
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:03,900
By the way, another thing operating up here, we have dirt.

473
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:09,330
So Kurland did mention the idea of what you could see on your hands.

474
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:16,710
She also mentioned the idea of germs. You didn't say it, but I could have probed you to pull out the idea that you can't see germs.

475
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:22,050
So, you know, if you want to talk about teaching kids to wash hands, that's actually a huge one.

476
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:29,220
My kids will recognize the need to wash hands when they can see stuff, but they won't recognize the need to wash hands when they can't see stuff.

477
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,900
So that's a mental model piece that enters into this.

478
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:41,180
You also brought up the idea of fairly detailed the idea of cross-contamination from surface like so

479
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:47,000
I will touch a surface and that will be a spread from another person to me through that surface.

480
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:53,450
So there was a pretty detailed set of information that you talked about about essentially transmission through contact.

481
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:00,880
On the. When you might get me to wash your hands.

482
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:09,010
But much less about that, at least as it was played out in terms of the how you manage the actual washing and the surfaces you're touching.

483
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:15,680
Like there were some, but not not as much. While I'm over here talking about sort of like how you wash your hands.

484
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:25,990
Anything that's missing here. Like fingernails.

485
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:30,160
So fingernails was one thing some people will tell you. You got to get under the fingernails.

486
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,890
You got to scrub all the fingernails. That's that's something that's not here.

487
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:37,570
If we were training got surgeons, that actually might be a key thing for us to be talking about.

488
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:42,370
Yeah, maybe the water temperature. That's the one I like.

489
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:46,300
If you were to follow this linearly, you would believe that it would be Tulsa.

490
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:52,180
Totally fine to use ice water. No, it's not.

491
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:55,840
Temperature does matter. You want it warm enough so that you're going to.

492
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,200
It'll help to break loose. I don't even know the chemistry underneath it.

493
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,070
But yes, temperature matters. That was not a concept that came up.

494
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:09,300
I was looking for it. It didn't come up. So were thinking about omissions.

495
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:15,400
Water temperature is something that's not shown here. Oh, yeah.

496
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:23,200
I would push my hand, as I would say, like, oh, this is weird, like height for like kids.

497
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:29,080
They're like reaching over. So they're like always like, now this is weird and like, this is touching us.

498
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:36,060
So if we want to think about. Designing environments to wash our hands.

499
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,840
You could. I didn't go there with the props I had.

500
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:50,860
But if we wanted to sort of like ask a question about sort of like how can you make it easier for somebody to wash their hands in the right way?

501
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:56,620
Those sort of an open ended question. How could you design a space that would make washing hands really easy?

502
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:58,750
We might get to things like.

503
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:06,730
Hey, it would be really helpful if we could turn the water on and off with our feet so that we don't have to be turned away.

504
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:10,240
That would be useful. I've seen bathrooms that do that. It's really cool.

505
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:16,270
Like Touchless. We didn't talk about the technology of touch less in terms of being able to get the water

506
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:21,250
or the towel by not actually having to touch anything that connects to mental models.

507
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:28,670
Yeah. The old doorstop. Well, you can pull the door through tonight.

508
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:33,260
Yeah, I wasn't saying anything like nothing.

509
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:37,700
Wasn't only talked about, was like social pressures of washing hands, both like.

510
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:41,240
Like talking, like, reasons to watch out for the germs. But sometimes it's like the social.

511
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:46,520
Like you're in the public bathroom, you feel weird walking out without washing your hands like someone would look at you.

512
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:53,000
Weird, do you? I was like, It's of weird. I pay attention to this kind of stuff.

513
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:59,180
I am highly aware of the fact there are certain context in which people go into the bathroom

514
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:02,540
and use the bathroom and are very careful about washing their hands in certain contexts.

515
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:06,620
It's the majority of people seem to be comfortable walking in and walking right out.

516
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:10,660
That's a social factor. That would also be part of the mental model.

517
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:18,440
Like, I guarantee you that hand washing in bathrooms is more prevalent in this building.

518
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:22,140
And it is in most bars. And it seems.

519
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:31,420
And we could talk about what else? Anything else that came up that we haven't yet talked about.

520
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:38,590
Yeah. Also the boredom, like. Like the beginning of the 20 seconds.

521
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:47,799
Yeah. So we had the 20 seconds, 30 seconds, and then there was the singing Happy Birthday as a way of don't remember.

522
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,610
That is.

523
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:55,050
Yeah, I was thinking of something that was omitted, which is that like washing your hands dries them out and so that could be like a reason why.

524
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:59,590
Yes. So skin hair.

525
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:12,500
So. When I was in the hospital for a transplant and washing my hands continuously.

526
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:23,330
One of the most important pieces of information that was passed on to me was recommendations of lotions to use every time I wash my hands,

527
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:29,840
because otherwise, if I were to get so corrected, they would actually be an infection risk because they would just be cracked so much.

528
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:34,080
That was a key mental model piece like that.

529
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:40,850
The nurses knew that they had to be talking about skin care because it would actually inhibit the behavior if they didn't go there.

530
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:44,960
Yeah. And part of that, I think, is rights, too, where you wash your hands,

531
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,680
like if you know you're someplace, for example, you don't like the soap that they have.

532
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:53,059
You think that it smells horrible or it does dry out your hands a lot versus maybe you're at

533
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:57,139
home when you have the soap that you love to use or you're going to wash your hands more.

534
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:03,680
Or maybe for a longer time, since there are associated negatives of, Oh, do I really want to have those effects of washing my hands?

535
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:11,090
And by the way, one thing that Carolyn brought up, which I did not pursue in the interest of time, is the wash hands versus hand sanitizer,

536
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:17,080
mental bottle question, because there's all kinds of interesting things about when is one appropriate and what is not, etc.

537
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,920
Environment play. Where are you? Are you in a place where you can do it?

538
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:29,600
Are you in a place where you're not necessarily in control of whether there's supplies to do it or not?

539
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:36,260
Yeah. The soap dispensers out. Yeah. And so some things that are related to that is.

540
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:41,780
So there may be availability, but there's also the behavioral norms and expectations.

541
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:48,170
So she did bring up questions of health professionals, things like doctors expecting to do it, going in and out of patient rooms, things like that.

542
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:52,339
Certainly in the context of food service, this is a super important question.

543
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:57,200
We have all these signs that say all employees must wash hands before returning to work kind of things.

544
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:04,399
Very specifically defining the expectations. Think we can keep going on and on on this.

545
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:11,660
But let's just note, I spent 5 minutes, asked four questions and look at how much we got out.

546
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:20,670
Well, we learned a lot here, not just in terms of what Carolyn knew, but also things it helped us to find, things that we didn't know.

547
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:27,090
Help us to zoom in on certain aspects of of what we might need to be messaging about, etc.

548
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:31,530
So one of my big takeaways for today is to help you understand.

549
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:39,160
No, you're not going to do this kind of intensive interview process for every last communication that you're going to do on every aspect.

550
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:39,990
It's impossible.

551
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:49,270
Boy, you might want to do some of them in certain kinds of time to find out the key things that you would want to learn from your audience.

552
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:54,880
It can be done. What is also the way which I did the interview.

553
01:01:56,290 --> 01:02:01,480
I. To the extent that I prompted. It was simply in a domain.

554
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:08,020
So I ask questions like you talk me about when you need to wash your hands.

555
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:16,630
I say you talk to me about food preparation or could you talk to me about, you know, health professionals?

556
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:22,560
You brought that stuff up on your own. Now, I could then follow up on it, like if I wanted to dove into all the rules for health professionals.

557
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:28,400
You gave me plenty of opportunities to do that. But.

558
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:35,480
That non directive question of style is key here.

559
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:40,370
Because as soon as I mentioned the word soccer.

560
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:48,110
Something's going to go off in your heads. Oh, wait, doctors care about, like, oh, you probably ought to wash your hands like you did.

561
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:52,700
But now I'm generating the knowledge as opposed to eliciting it from you.

562
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:57,050
So you have to be really, really careful the way you do this process.

563
01:02:57,230 --> 01:03:03,680
Limit how much you're. Feeding people and you never want to give them a yes.

564
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,950
No question because. Yes, no question embeds within it. The answer.

565
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:11,560
So the questions I had were, you know, tell me about.

566
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:21,230
And to wash your hands and tell me about how you wash your hands, you know, reasons why you don't wash your hands the way you should thing.

567
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:33,940
And by the way, you zoom in on the actual operation of various it didn't go up, but I cut off because of time barriers for time.

568
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,629
So like you didn't get into it like too busy.

569
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:46,690
So they forget to do it. You didn't get into the you know, I don't I feel silly doing it because of social circumstances,

570
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:50,980
etc. Like it came out in some context, but not necessarily others. But there was plenty of that stuff.

571
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:59,960
So what you're going to see when you do the readings for next class.

572
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:12,040
Is. A bunch of different samples or situations in which it's certain very specific critical insights that are going to be.

573
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:19,910
Either missing, misunderstood by the audience and sometimes potentially challenging you.

574
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:24,860
I've thrown a couple of articles in next class that surprised me.

575
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:30,700
And if, as you read them, you're like, oh, really?

576
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:37,749
Pay attention to that. Pay attention to your own experience of potentially having your mental model of risk

577
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:42,330
changed because of the information that you're being presented and to whatever.

578
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:48,690
Good for you that resistant. Because one of the key questions we have to face when we're talking about changing mental models is.

579
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:54,330
Whether you believe me if I tell you your model is wrong.

580
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:06,030
And I'll foreshadow a little bit. The answer is you can't just tell somebody their mental model is wrong.

581
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:14,600
You have to create you have to replace it with a different model. How to give them what the right answer is.

582
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:31,200
Just simply saying. I use the example that came up earlier in this class and you get the flu from the flu vaccine.

583
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:40,390
Think mental model question. Is it possible for you to get the flu from being vaccinated?

584
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:47,150
An answer is no. Where does that arrow bottle come from?

585
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:59,710
Why does somebody believe that? Why do some why might somebody believe that the flu vaccine was cause by giving you the flu?

586
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:12,020
One, they just got the vaccine so you could have a learning experience or two of every year that they choose to get the vaccine every year,

587
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:15,870
but they don't get the vaccine. So that's another piece of experience.

588
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:19,010
Those are both absolutely things that could people could experience that might lead them to.

589
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:22,520
That said, when people say, like, I got sick from the flu shot.

590
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:26,150
Like, if they get like symptoms, like from it and then we use the word sick.

591
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,860
So that's another piece there.

592
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:37,340
That's sometimes a failure to discriminate between the short term immune response of the vaccine and the actual disease itself.

593
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:44,690
Okay. Now that the vaccine contains like a little bit of the flu and they don't understand, like how it can or cannot be.

594
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:51,140
Right. So this is important. Like people have knowledge, the vaccine contains virus stuff.

595
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:55,670
I'm going to use fairly nonscientific leverage because that's the level we're talking about.

596
01:06:56,150 --> 01:07:03,530
They took the virus and they put some of it into this syringe and they injected it inside my body.

597
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:06,079
So all of my body integrity protections,

598
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:12,260
all the ways in which I feel like I am safe from the things that are outside me have been totally violated because you just stuck it inside of me.

599
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:23,209
Amber touched on it a little bit, but the idea of temporality, like we have a flu season, that's generally when you get your flu shot,

600
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:27,420
if you if you've got it during the summer, you're probably not thinking about it causally.

601
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:35,670
Whereas if you get the flu during flu season, when you've had your shot, there is more of a potential for a causal link there.

602
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:40,390
Yep. What else? Some follow ups to the stuff that Kenny brought up.

603
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:45,490
I want to make sure that. So the virus contains flu stuff.

604
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:54,860
You mean the vaccine? The vaccine contains flu stuff. So.

605
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:04,910
All mental models. If they were not talking about a virus, they're talking about chemical.

606
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:14,910
Now the mental model is right. You have injected the if we were talking about injecting somebody with bits of arsenic.

607
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:22,960
They're in trouble like they have been exposed to a dose of that chemical.

608
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:30,070
Worse than that. And you get a little.

609
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:34,390
From the polio vaccine. That's.

610
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:40,220
If you're talking about the five original vaccine, it is correct.

611
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:49,820
It is attenuated, but it is possible for you to get another attenuated vaccine.

612
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:54,180
Chicken pox. How do I know this?

613
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:01,169
Because it is likely that my daughter.

614
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:06,390
That. Apart from secondary exposure to vaccine.

615
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:15,520
You shed the varicella virus when you were vaccinated or in a box.

616
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:21,490
It is possible for someone to get in a box. Usually very mild case from that exposure.

617
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:30,100
So that mental model is correct in the domain of virus vaccines that are attenuated vaccines.

618
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:36,820
The vaccine is not a type of vaccine, so it is impossible in that case.

619
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:39,880
But people are not crazy for thinking about that.

620
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:48,220
So. You have to acknowledge that we can't just sort of say, oh, no, no, no, you can't get flu vaccine.

621
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:55,150
And I'm going to go, wait a second. You get polio from a vaccine you can get. It's not enough to say no.

622
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:58,870
We got to we got to explain why, how, etc.

623
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:05,490
Otherwise, it's just going to bounce off. All right.

624
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:15,110
So. Let me pause there and have you break into your little groups, people around you.

625
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:18,950
And let's go back to this question. We've touched upon a number of examples today.

626
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:26,270
But the question of the day is what are the public health problems that are fundamentally mental model problems?

627
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:35,470
Let's come up with as many examples as you can of situations in which the thing that is the problem in the world is that people have models of.

628
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:46,580
They're missing something critical, but they have some core misconception that is leading them to avoid behavior or to engage in behavior, etc.

629
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:52,430
So really brainstorm what in situations in which this is the stuff that we need to be talking about,

630
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:56,300
not quantitative risk communication, but mental model risk communication.

631
01:10:57,150 --> 01:11:07,420
Now pull us back in, like 5 minutes. Okay. Anything you want.

632
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:31,300
Karen has never spoken about like that, obviously.

633
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:51,100
Why would anyone with any information on Cigarets like your kitchen commercial stuff?

634
01:11:54,760 --> 01:12:01,570
Because I want my kids to treat intelligence, to exchange family life.

635
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:41,670
But the reality is that cannabis cigaret and we're trying to get into that, you know, everything goes on.

636
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:45,519
You know who is served on something like that.

637
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:53,169
But I think, yeah, yeah.

638
01:12:53,170 --> 01:13:31,420
I think everybody the time and stuff like that, it just came out and I was like, Oh my God.

639
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:40,180
I didn't. I was like, Oh yeah, I get my blood pressure and stuff out of it.

640
01:13:41,230 --> 01:14:01,030
And I guess I just didn't feel like I like so much.

641
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:13,090
And I just know this is, like, really bad.

642
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:26,280
Yeah, I don't think they did so well.

643
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:51,010
Yeah, I was trying to get a drink and I was like, I know what you are doing.

644
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:56,740
Any type of water early? Only about. Like if you go somewhere new, you're like, Can I drink the tap water?

645
01:14:57,010 --> 01:15:04,360
That's true. I wouldn't have been like I was trying to bring out a bottle.

646
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:07,950
I just I just I was like, when you find that, you get a lot of answers.

647
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:12,640
So I don't know.

648
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,830
I think also that, you know,

649
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:43,630
I think everybody is going to point out is like like an epidemic is like that's just like everything about this podcast I listen to.

650
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,100
All right. Now in the conversation.

651
01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:52,200
Yes.

652
01:15:53,200 --> 01:16:01,520
Any particular examples of stuff that you guys want to share in a group like, oh, this is a really good example of mental model stuff that we need to.

653
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:09,090
Yeah. You talk about putting your mask on.

654
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:12,570
That is not the mask.

655
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:17,370
I remember the first time that I put on my mask, but in 2020, my holds.

656
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:21,440
I'm the only one in the whole school put on masks. And they're like, like, so are you okay?

657
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:28,440
Why are you wearing a mask? And now, like I said, well, I'll just sit front of a really key sample.

658
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:33,180
Like, is a mask protecting you or is a mask protecting the other person?

659
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:45,570
That is a whole huge part of the mental model conversation and it played out in very strong ways in 2020 in terms of messaging, focusing on,

660
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:51,610
well, I don't have colds, I don't have to worry about this or how much of I like to be exposed versus protecting other people.

661
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:59,459
The whole mental model of do you know if you are sick kind of thing and it plays right into this like I keep idea

662
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:05,760
is if I to wear masks in context because it might be that you're infectious even though you don't feel bad.

663
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:11,500
I think a huge part of the mental model of mask wearing. So that's one great, great example.

664
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:12,450
Other stuff that came up.

665
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:23,190
Yeah, we wanted to create community that was on you because you sort a campaign about undetectable equals and transmittable positive people.

666
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:28,950
Yeah, and that's one that my friends are oftentimes like have to explain to a lot of people, yeah,

667
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:34,920
I'm on transmit so I'm trying to get all right and notice that there's a conceptual question there.

668
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,840
And again, we're not going to get to the science for the moment,

669
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:43,950
but the basic idea here is the idea that the level of virus that is present in somebody

670
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:51,090
is related to the likelihood that they would transmit to someone is the key idea.

671
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:57,639
If you simply believe that exposure, meaning the sense of someone has the virus,

672
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:04,170
it doesn't matter how much equals the same amount of potential exposure that they would have for somebody else, then this doesn't make any sense.

673
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:12,510
The idea of some kind of a dose response relationship is critical for that idea, and that shows up in a lot of environmental kinds of context.

674
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:14,970
The idea of dose response is huge.

675
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:21,360
You don't get that idea, and there's many kinds of things that we do over and we'll talk about this in next class in more detail.

676
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:27,030
The many kinds of things where you're going to freak out about very small doses beginning to actually have substantial effects.

677
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:32,770
Other ideas that came up. Yeah, we're talking about antibiotics.

678
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:36,779
Like, needing to, like, complete, like the dosing before feeling better. Yeah.

679
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:40,760
And a key. That's super important.

680
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:46,599
Communication about antibiotics. What do people always say when you hope?

681
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,840
They always make sure to take all of it?

682
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:55,290
Finish the bottle. Why? Let's let's unpack this from a mental model step.

683
01:18:55,290 --> 01:19:00,309
But why do we keep harping on that? Because people will feel better towards the end of it.

684
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:04,090
And they're like, I don't like to take this anymore. Right. So the idea here is.

685
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:11,870
The mental model that says I take medications in proportion to whether or not I feel bad if what you're talking about is a headache.

686
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,580
That's right. Thank you for talking about pain relief.

687
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:19,579
You take occasions in order to deal with the pain you have.

688
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:25,700
If you don't have pain, you don't take them. So that metal model has grounding in real world situation.

689
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:34,429
It just what we're talking about is that it biotic the concept that we have to take all of it because we can't we might feel

690
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:44,329
better before all of the bacteria or our kill has a consequence if we don't understand that we trigger antibiotic resistance,

691
01:19:44,330 --> 01:19:52,549
etc. So that's a key mental model idea that has led to this sort of really heavy emphasis on even if you're feeling well,

692
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:56,890
you have to take all your medications. Great example.

693
01:19:57,550 --> 01:20:01,810
Another one if and then violations specifically as well.

694
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:14,590
Oh. And I mean, I didn't get to it just in general, I think some mental model about how to regulate it, how to we improve access to guns in general.

695
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:18,459
So the mental model. One of them, there's probably many of them,

696
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:28,960
but the one mental model thing that pops to my mind is the association that we observed between gun in the house and suicide completion.

697
01:20:30,350 --> 01:20:39,320
Gun in house, an accidental firearm, but the presence of the gun is associated with those outcomes.

698
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:46,520
And so people who is model says, well, I that's not going to happen to me.

699
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:52,940
They don't associate the idea of the availability of the gun as a potential factor for causing a negative outcome.

700
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:57,049
That's a problem. And there's much more into that space.

701
01:20:57,050 --> 01:21:01,010
I don't want to dove into it too deeply because obviously there are things that moderate that like,

702
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:07,760
is the gun locked up, is it a critical piece here, etc.?

703
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:14,320
And the other wanted somebody to bring up. All right, last one, because we're running out of time.

704
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:22,600
Being overweight. Yes. Has a huge amount of the biology of of what does it mean to be overweight?

705
01:21:24,370 --> 01:21:30,070
You know, is it weight? Is it you have high? Is it what is the characteristics of that weight?

706
01:21:30,490 --> 01:21:32,620
Is it physical activity level?

707
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:39,070
There's a huge amount of our perception of cardiovascular risk in other kinds of things is wrapped up in what do we think that means?

708
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:46,540
That's a bigger than we can cover right now. But this is the kind of stuff I want you to be thinking about as we move forward, because next class,

709
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:49,989
we're going to zoom less from talking about this concept to more talking about, okay,

710
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:54,850
what do we do when we design communications to accomplish if we're thinking in this way?

711
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:58,420
All right. I'll see you Thursday.

712
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:08,890
What he was doing. Oh, no, I think so.

713
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:18,440
I didn't want to know. It's just like I was like.

714
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:22,570
He did say that. It was like.

715
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:27,130
Yeah, I really like what she said.

716
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:30,800
She was me so much. So you're implying that?

717
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:46,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

718
01:22:47,490 --> 01:23:10,220
You know, I find the people I most admire interviewing a very interesting people and charities where they might choose either.

719
01:23:10,230 --> 01:23:19,240
So it's probably like, Oh, I'm sorry.

720
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:24,120
Yeah. And a lot of she's like, I've been like this.

721
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:30,470
I think I go to your classes about things and living through it.

722
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:34,750
It's like I might as well do some work. Yeah, yeah, I do anything.

723
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:39,180
I can't do that. Yeah, I know.

724
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:50,850
Honestly, what kind of stuff like that are interesting that you're doing and what you're writing about?

725
01:23:53,100 --> 01:24:00,330
Yeah, well, I guess it's going to be like, My God, what the heck?

726
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:04,140
I like the business trip.

727
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:16,380
Oh, it's just like, we have it here.

728
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:24,690
We're in Boston and we're starting to board the planet.

729
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:29,530
And there was a thing it's a fluid activated terminal.

730
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:44,540
And then we had to go back through security. And of course, at this point in time, it's literally like a mobs out there and.

731
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:54,209
It's a line for security was. Conservatively.

732
01:24:54,210 --> 01:24:57,480
Four or 500 people. Oh, my God.
