1
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,780
Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. How did your semester going?

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,210
Good. You have a midterm this week or do you really think we're finally done right?

3
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,230
Yeah, I think. I think we're done. 3 minutes.

4
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,540
Okay. Yes, we are. One more thing in November.

5
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:41,730
Okay. Today, we're going to talk a little bit about data, maybe a little bit by European management.

6
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,140
I hope that you'll read the I did a reading for today, but also I want to know,

7
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,500
based on my own experience, I would like to know all about your own period experience management data.

8
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,610
We will we will do that. Okay. Before that.

9
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,720
Okay. We see where we are right now. October 31st.

10
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,820
Next week, we will have another lecture. How to write a thesis proposal.

11
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,120
That would be mostly an introduction about what you need to write in your proposal.

12
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:22,590
Now, for November 14, I still love and I will let you know what we are going to do next week.

13
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:33,149
And then for the last three weeks of that term, we have these two presentations I already sent you the the assignment days.

14
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:41,450
I did it randomly then as I told you before, and it doesn't have to be any fancy, any detail.

15
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:48,780
It mostly what I want you for doing is to show you baby with the whole group and then maybe I'll have some feedback.

16
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:59,040
Then at most, planning for you to talk about 10 minutes and allowing for 5 minutes for discussion, for questions.

17
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,049
And again, that doesn't have to be very detailed because most of you still are in that very,

18
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:10,420
very preliminary steps on trying to to propose a decision that,

19
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,540
don't worry, doesn't have to be too fancy,

20
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:22,950
then that will be the last three weeks of of that their questions and again you don't need to do a PowerPoint presentation.

21
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:29,670
You want to do it. You are more than welcome to do it, but you don't need to to prepare PowerPoint.

22
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,700
Okay, now, today then we're going to talk about data management.

23
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,630
Um, you read the paper that was assigned for today.

24
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:54,690
The, because when you are doing research, one of the major concerns should be how we manage our own data,

25
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,150
how we store our data and how we share our data.

26
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:09,479
I remember when I was a student, most of our data was basically a piece of paper are copies, piece of paper,

27
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:22,160
that type that we and I was very prone to misplace men who are maybe having difficulties finding the data.

28
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:33,209
Then there was this study here that one mentioned show in the paper that at least in 2014 they that biological data,

29
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,120
I think this refers to data from lab work.

30
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:44,850
These are preliminary rate of 70% per year, meaning that people do research and they don't store adequate the data in an efficient way.

31
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,960
And eventually the data is going to be lost now.

32
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:57,149
But even though when the data is still available, they are problems, I don't know if that happens to you.

33
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:03,810
Even with the data that you have your own computer or even when you are writing a manuscript, sometimes you have a problem.

34
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:14,830
Look, finding your own files, you try to to find that data, find the files or you are working data analysis.

35
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,540
See, for example, these someti you try to recreate your own analysis on time.

36
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:29,610
Is it? This is hard, but I mean, is this you you take with me next winter?

37
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,420
This class most recently 2012 went to do some data analysis.

38
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,920
One of the advice I give you to do is to write very precise note what you are doing.

39
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,990
Because on that, even that happens with me and with my analysis.

40
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:55,080
I you stop doing the analysis, I get back maybe one or two month later, you are really going to forget what it was doing at that moment.

41
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:06,600
Then you need to have very precise note for what you are doing, even though you are going to share your work with your colleagues, for example.

42
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:15,020
Ask your students if they are doing analysis to share with me that gold their note before I went to the woodshed that everything was ease.

43
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,310
There is no any problem, any mistakes in the analysis.

44
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,420
Then these are the types of things that I will discuss today.

45
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:34,090
No responsible data management then. These are all the serious safeguards and solutions to prevent and solve these and these other problems.

46
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:42,940
Now, any of you have experience in data management. Could you tell us a little bit about what you do?

47
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,820
Really, why not the different data managements?

48
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:59,110
And the one I did it was object oriented database management, which is like a supply chain management and the object has many link.

49
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,530
And if I know where the ingredients come from and within the ingredients is

50
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:08,980
the farmers information and the pesticides or a website to see that the use.

51
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:14,830
So that's the data. Okay. And then also delay the N Yes.

52
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:20,050
Sample for the one result from nothing.

53
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:29,050
What we did then was to use the computer processing speed and capability to analyze all the data and their segments.

54
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:37,700
Mm hmm. So this. And you have to be able to analyze some, find it and define the relationship.

55
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,000
So it's easy to retrieve. Okay. Any other one?

56
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:54,700
Anyone else with experience? I worked on a clinical trial where we had CT scans of people, but they were grouped over like three years.

57
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:02,350
So we had a lot of safeguards in place to make sure we didn't lose this person and make sure they were paired with the right person.

58
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:08,560
And they all had like it was blinded, so they had ideas that were not robust about their real name.

59
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:16,300
So we had like both a Google drive system with the real scans, and then we saved them a big hard drive as well.

60
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,980
So they were paired correctly and we didn't lose them. I'm right. Yeah.

61
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,300
No, that's ah that's a problem that they, that we need.

62
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:31,000
You can't get it back. But they took one scan at a time and that's the only data point that we got.

63
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:38,500
Okay. Yes. Also, now we have all these, um, servers in the cloud with stored data by this deal.

64
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:46,480
Here us is a student from the university. You have several options to store data using the university servers,

65
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:53,410
but also you will need to take into account the privacy for the data that you are storing.

66
00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:04,240
Then they are actually getting the university to, depending on the privacy settings for the data that you are not are going to store and analyze.

67
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:17,320
Now, usually in my my youngest experiences, I have been working with that type of data that we wore.

68
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,330
We all thought we had this type of safeguards. When I was working on this at Boston University,

69
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:33,160
we had the data in from there Bears only one Bears film had that key to leave the actual data to personal identifiers.

70
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,730
Then we were able to analyze the data without knowing the identity of that person.

71
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:45,010
There were several backup systems and also here in the university you will have those options for your own data.

72
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,010
Okay, now what are the advantages of having a good data management?

73
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:59,440
Fair is a more efficient research. Imagine that you have your local data or even you had your data.

74
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:06,130
You don't find your data or you don't remember what you're doing, or you want to share your result with some of your colleagues.

75
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:15,550
That is more efficient. Research now is important to the wider scientific community because that is going to speed that discovery.

76
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:31,180
Now, I think I think maybe you and I were aware of that right now, but any genomics data that we get using funding from the NIH has to be a store,

77
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,830
but we pay for to be available to the wider scientific community.

78
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:44,770
Is anyone, once access to that data, needs to write an application and I get every application has one proposal and

79
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:50,169
that data is available now also that really will really with new findings.

80
00:09:50,170 --> 00:10:06,130
And this is very important, Alisyn, in the fetal genomics, I remember and talking about maybe before I will say 2010.

81
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,950
Um, the work in the night out was very unreliable.

82
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:18,700
And what I mean is the police had results and association as they between identity barrier and a particular disease.

83
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:25,290
But there was no replication of findings when people trying to replicate the find in the new

84
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:32,470
study there was no such association would be due to false positive and with more sample sizes.

85
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,050
Lack of controlling for confounding.

86
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:47,140
Then starting in 2000, maybe a little earlier than 2000 today, maybe 2000 a nine people starting doing the genome wide association studies.

87
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:55,390
Big sample sizes are more guideline for replication and now we are sure we have this system in place.

88
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,690
When we publish genetic result, we we should be able to replicate the findings in independent samples.

89
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:13,180
That is going to increase the collaboration. And of course, you will want to educate the larger community about our results with them so far.

90
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:23,460
Had you an experience. Um, you seem rather explaining.

91
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:34,530
You recited your data to the larger public. I mean, I know I don't know any news interviews or in that for a nonscientific audience using what?

92
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:40,140
I mean, do you have any experience using your results with plenty of your results?

93
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,790
To the large community, yes. I just think it was my thesis.

94
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,970
I don't know if that's that applies my master's thesis.

95
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:55,220
So we get this we applied the data management because it was a collaboration between Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates.

96
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:00,840
So they sent us, uh, rice samples from the United Arab Emirates to Lebanon.

97
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,309
So we had like to store them and they used place to measure aflatoxins.

98
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:13,139
And um, so we like labeled the bags and we saw them and they put in vitamins in the fridge,

99
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,070
making sure that they would like to do collection more than someone else's check.

100
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,080
This is in conflict.

101
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:29,910
So at that time, like during my thesis, I used to explain after we did that, I'll get to that to a lot, to the little nonscientific audience.

102
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:36,570
Yeah. Okay. But you have also experience. I have principal signatures, so I worked out Weight Watchers.

103
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:47,969
Oh, and the biggest part of my job was to, like, read new research and then translate them in a way that the members of the program would understand.

104
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,950
And those are just like normal people who were trying to lose weight or like maintain their weight loss.

105
00:12:53,280 --> 00:13:03,329
So we did a lot of, um, especially translating research data about like specific diets like the keto diet and all of those which I thought was really

106
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:10,980
interesting because we would read real papers but then try to make them accessible to like the normal population either.

107
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,210
That's how I, that's nice.

108
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:22,319
I, um, I guess you would as you progress in Europe by reading U.S. studies, you are going to have this type of contact with an unscientific community,

109
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:30,559
how you are going to spend your soul, how you are going, what are the implications of your findings for the ah for the, for the population in general.

110
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,100
Then also that's an important part of the good data management.

111
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:42,089
Okay, this is the affiliation with data management that is in the paper are not going to read it here.

112
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:49,200
But I just want to address on points that are one of the key aspects of data

113
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,660
management that we should be able to find out new data when the data is needed,

114
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,540
where the data is all that is new, and also to use it in an effective way.

115
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:09,569
Now in the paper they are several suggestions are several they propose several steps how to data management.

116
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:14,160
We are going to go over so one those are just going to tell you about my own experience.

117
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,140
Then this is morally the lifecycle of our research data management.

118
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,110
Usually we need to probe to write the proposal. Let's say we are starting from scratch.

119
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,500
I project. Then we start writing the proposal.

120
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:39,510
We start the project not usually here. We need to get funding to collect the data, to recruit participants, to do any type of analysis.

121
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,270
And then we are going to have the data collection.

122
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:52,650
And again, the data collection will be from are interviews with participants with juniors or analyzes.

123
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,370
After that, we want to do this statistical analysis.

124
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:09,090
Now I good part here is that the data that we collect sometimes we can use that data for other purposes that they were not defined at the moment.

125
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:13,469
We write the proposal and this is very, very common what happens in science.

126
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:20,160
We get the data. It is all along these these pathway, we get the new hypotheses, new ideas,

127
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:26,910
and then we are going to use our data for maybe other purposes, other hypotheses that we want to test.

128
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:41,070
Now, after we do the analyzes, usually when we ask for funding to the NIH, also we need to write a data sharing plan.

129
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,860
We need to tell the NIH that our data is going to be publicly available.

130
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:55,440
Now, there are different ways that we can do that because on time, because of the specific writing consent from participants,

131
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,920
we are not allowed to share it that they didn't have to inform our guidelines how to do that.

132
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,580
Usually that is okay.

133
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:13,950
We say we are going to share the data, but we need to make a collaboration with the first one, the 1 to 1 data to, to do our research together.

134
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:24,350
Because that was. What is writing in that informed consent way to share that data is to put it in a repository.

135
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,010
Then people can submit applications to get that data.

136
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:41,720
Now also, when we go into publish record, now is very common in journals that they also ask some plan for data sharing.

137
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,270
Now there are several journals that they before any publication,

138
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:55,310
they ask you to make sure that your data is available for anyone that wants to replicate your findings, let's say.

139
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:01,730
So one is against one of my papers and say, okay, I want to see whether this is what I really thought.

140
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:07,940
I want to replicate these findings. Then my own data has to be available to the scientific community.

141
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,840
If someone wants to replicate the findings now, many of you are asking for that too.

142
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:22,460
Then what will you do with you? Write that. And that will depend also in the writing content that you have on your participants.

143
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:32,000
Now, you thought you were going to end the project coming off time, but then we can archive the data and that data can be reused for other purposes.

144
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,430
Then really that data once is collected is going to have a longer life.

145
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,120
Even when we finish our own project, even when we finish our own initial proposal that we started here.

146
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,680
Our data is going to have a long life for other people to use, even for ourselves.

147
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:58,860
And I think this is a nice one on that because bands in the last two decades,

148
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:07,050
the availability of these data that we can use for different purposes with them so far.

149
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:18,030
Has anyone apply or has experience with data repositories asking for data?

150
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:25,470
Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I hope I what you're disputing was far too many paperwork.

151
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,110
Yeah. That's have a lot of stuff depending on the database. Yeah.

152
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:37,740
Mm hmm. Um, for smaller studies, it may be easier to, like, reach directly to the author.

153
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,170
Mm hmm. Start the process. Yeah. The larger one.

154
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:51,070
Yeah. In my my own experience, our police are requesting tips on collaboration from police from Costa Rica.

155
00:18:52,060 --> 00:19:00,400
Now, so tired, depending on the day, that takes a long time to write the date agreement between say the University of Michigan you

156
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:09,850
the it in Costa Rica and in Costa Rica they tend to be very or very careful with that with that,

157
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,600
with their own data. Then they take too many precautions like things on phones.

158
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:19,360
I do remember an exception to that, which is when I was an intern in the and I did okay.

159
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,830
Yeah. That's where I got access to the U.S.

160
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:31,920
S the renowned data data system. Mm hmm. That was pretty easy, but I think it had to do with the fact that I was out there talking.

161
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:38,770
Yeah. This one time fact that you have far more unprofessional connection with someone that they that fast there.

162
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:47,290
Yeah, but you just. Just might be prepared even for your own thesis or for your own career after you graduate,

163
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:57,010
that most likely you are going to work for to be either both in your own data or request in your or their data for your work.

164
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,440
Okay. Now see, on a bicycle in the paper. So what then?

165
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,190
I get you are. You will reply to this type of thing.

166
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:12,340
First, keep a good documentation. Always.

167
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,440
I One of the things I recommend here are the three bullet point rule.

168
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:22,829
Right. Rhythmic files are usually what I do is I start, I will dog them.

169
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,620
I put a date, they they add this and this and these.

170
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:31,830
And then just to make when when I get back, I make sure that I understand what I was doing at the time.

171
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,800
Well, what the objective and then keep those type of files also data dictionaries.

172
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:44,160
Now this is usually when you work with a small dataset.

173
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:53,940
Um, maybe you have a dataset with only five, ten variables, then it's pretty easy to remember which variable leads.

174
00:20:53,940 --> 00:21:02,760
And usually you put name to the battery. I want to try to be self-evident what they mean, for example, BMI or weight or ideal or something like that.

175
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:07,349
However, in most of the case that you are going to work with that as it are,

176
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:13,200
they can have hundreds of variables and you can have variable data derived from other variables.

177
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:21,230
Then please keep data dictionaries to make sure what the variable they mean, how they were processed.

178
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,260
They are the right party awards, that type of information.

179
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:31,750
And together with that, this codebook that they are usually the the code that you are going to save the

180
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,890
either are code such code data or any statistical software that you are using.

181
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:44,069
Now, this is an idea that is in the paper how to organize your file.

182
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:53,760
I confess that I'm usually don't do this, but the idea is to organize your files.

183
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:00,840
In this hierarchical model, you have your different folders, different different levels of the folder.

184
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:11,790
Try to why I think this is good that by to put that date that you were working that in the file what these people did in the data the file.

185
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:18,870
Usually when I'm working on manuscript I have for example version two, version two,

186
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:26,100
one, 2%, I have version three, version three one is getting confused in there.

187
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,180
I don't do that. I don't follow it strictly these guidelines.

188
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,340
But you are working with colleagues, with your mentors.

189
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,100
Most likely I would recommend at least to have some kind of organization in your files.

190
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:49,320
Um, sometimes even I. I misplaced the file that my student sent me.

191
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:57,630
Then I requested that you send me that I spreadsheet with these manuscripts because they are that the reports of your methods.

192
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:09,100
Okay. Also how different based on the science people there in the diversion either go for

193
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:15,430
SAS silver code that A-Z manuscript or any other file they generated during research.

194
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,600
You are working in a lab most usually.

195
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:30,850
I remember we had this lab not booked by the protocols but tried to utilize to make online copies of your notebook.

196
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,360
Because anything can happen, you can misplace.

197
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,110
It is not uncommon that have nothing to happen.

198
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:47,200
Then try to even that you have a lab book to have an electron vacuum that are related to that create that security plan.

199
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:57,520
The you are working with confidential data. Most likely in your application you will need to create a confidential are they a security plan?

200
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,770
How you are going to protect privacy? Why is it going to happen in that case of breach of privacy?

201
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,910
And most likely you are going to have to work with here at the university with humans.

202
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:19,750
So get commission or the or for the idea department because depending on that private through that data you will see what are security options.

203
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:29,170
Now you are working in large group and most likely these are responsibility from for your B.I,

204
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:36,850
for your mentor or for the for the the person that is the management responsible for the management of the lab.

205
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,900
Define drafting responsibilities who are responsible for what.

206
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,370
Also, you have minutes, you have you have meetings.

207
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,580
Someone has to be responsible to create these meetings. Automated what is called.

208
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:57,830
What are the decisions about? Backup data.

209
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:04,910
You are using cloud services. Now that the university offered a service to backup the data, have multiple copies in different locations.

210
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:19,070
But again, being careful about privacy because you cannot store data that is restricted in your computer because you can use your computer.

211
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,170
Then even then make sure you are having multiple copies of files.

212
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,710
They have to have the right security settings.

213
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,150
No, usually they are not that point.

214
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:41,780
Here's how we're going to manage data transfer between collaborators and institutions, and this is the type of thing that you will need to work.

215
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,800
For example, with the legal office in the university.

216
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:51,500
Using that data, you'd restrict data. You are requesting data on that university, that type of thing.

217
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,650
That would work through the legal office here in the university.

218
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:01,350
Some time when we close out the project, we have to write the final project to write the documentation.

219
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,180
Now what to do? Have a matter copies of all the project results.

220
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:14,149
You are funded by the NIH. Most likely you are. You are going to put your data in a repository.

221
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,650
These are publicly available.

222
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:21,950
There are several guidelines that you will need to follow, but you will learn about that in that moment that you need to do it.

223
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:29,209
So and just telling you that these exist. Also, the university has a repository for data at large.

224
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,080
You need to write that data management plan for all the data that was stored.

225
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:39,709
Now that you are more interested on that here in the university,

226
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:44,810
they are so resources that you can read about that data management, you can go to this page.

227
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,860
They are different and are very useful of the researcher here that you should read.

228
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,630
You are responsible for data management even if you are managing your own data.

229
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:03,620
They are similar useful tips here how to describe or organize your own data with them so far.

230
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:15,770
And also, as I told you before, that innovation requires now that we for all the grand proposal that we write,

231
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,719
we need to have a data management and sharing plan or our own data,

232
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:28,310
how we are going to share with our wider community, what the wider scientific community, the data, that word unity, you know, dating question.

233
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:38,050
Okay. Then let me before were planning for more discussion.

234
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,590
How you doing with Master DC? With your mentors.

235
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:49,600
You have one final yet? Okay. For. For those of you that still have it, fine.

236
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,640
Maybe you can say that many male.

237
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,320
But in these we've got to try to to see how we proceed that.

238
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:03,639
But how you talk with someone. I do. Okay. Then you I mean, you are in the process.

239
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:11,709
You are you are in conversations with some professors and you have several professor have to make this week.

240
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:16,730
So. Okay. Uh, let me know you need help.

241
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:24,380
But you know very good that you are in the process of talking with several potential mentors.

242
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,670
Uh, also, you know, you've had you talking with someone.

243
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,300
How would you think? I'm still undecided. Okay.

244
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,040
But I think you have options. Okay, great. Yeah, that's the important thing.

245
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:43,130
What? I want for you to have the options, and then you decide which one will be better for you then.

246
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:48,320
And that's all for today. Questions. Comments.

247
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:56,840
Okay. Next week, we are going to talk a little bit about how to write a proposal that will be just an ordinary overview.

248
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:05,930
How to write ATC proposal. And I think for November 14, we are going most likely to watch you again.

249
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:14,960
Remember that we were watching at the beginning of the term. I'm going to say that I know there are topics that we can watch at the school discuss,

250
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,140
and then after that, that flattery will be tested in the presentations.

251
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,020
The presentations may look.

252
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:39,590
Yep, on the you read my email that in that in website accommodation you guys have 10 minutes to talk about why do you want to go for a reason.

253
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:44,650
Okay. No problem. Yeah. Give me one second to.
