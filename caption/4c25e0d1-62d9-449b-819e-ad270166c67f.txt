1
00:00:00,386 --> 00:00:06,596
So in this module, we're going to be talking about understanding mental health in general.

2
00:00:06,596 --> 00:00:15,026
And then also, being able to identify concerns that may come up for students.

3
00:00:15,026 --> 00:00:17,256
So over the years at multiple universities,

4
00:00:17,256 --> 00:00:23,786
they've kind of pooled to get a sense of what are the main mental health concerns that come up for students.

5
00:00:23,786 --> 00:00:27,176
Anxiety and depression are always at the top, and it kind of varies year by year

6
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:33,556
which one of those is at the top. Emotional regulation is another one.

7
00:00:33,556 --> 00:00:38,896
So this is the idea that as young adults and really at any age,

8
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:45,616
there's a lot of stressors and intense emotions that can come up from day to day about various things.

9
00:00:45,616 --> 00:00:50,596
And oftentimes, students can experience those intense emotions as difficult

10
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:56,906
to manage and difficult to manage while going about all of their day to day tasks,

11
00:00:56,906 --> 00:01:05,266
and this is one of the concerns that often comes up. Academic stress, so just juggling all of the deadlines.

12
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:10,856
A lot of worry about are they good enough? What's the grade on the tests going to be?

13
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:12,446
Relationship concerns are another one,

14
00:01:12,446 --> 00:01:21,716
and this can take a lot of different forms from relationships with their family and how those are changing as they are moving through young adulthood.

15
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:30,506
New relationships with peers who are different from them, and learning lots of new ideas and the challenges that sometimes come with that.

16
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:41,246
And then just their friend groups and sometimes romantic relationships. So all of these on any given day can be causing some distress.

17
00:01:41,246 --> 00:01:45,656
And the last one is self-esteem.

18
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:46,826
Well, really, throughout college,

19
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:54,956
there's a lot of identity formation, personally and professionally that's happening, and a lot of trying to figure out who am I in the world?

20
00:01:54,956 --> 00:02:01,966
Am I good enough? Do I matter? And so a lot of different fluctuations that are happening can affect how students are seen,

21
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:04,436
and so this can be a big challenge.

22
00:02:04,436 --> 00:02:17,636
So just know that these are all kind of in the atmosphere of things that students that you're working with can be dealing with.

23
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:23,996
I want us to think about mental health on a continuum. So often when people think about mental health,

24
00:02:23,996 --> 00:02:33,566
we think about mental illness, and really mental health exists on a continuum in the same way that we all have dental health, we have physical health,

25
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:40,286
we also have mental health. The thing is, with dental health, we know a lot of the maintenance things to do.

26
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:43,616
We know to brush two minutes, twice a day.

27
00:02:43,616 --> 00:02:53,786
We know to floss. And then we also know that we need to get our regular cleanings and when we're feeling pain, to go in and to get more help.

28
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:57,896
So we want to have that same information when it comes to our mental health.

29
00:02:57,896 --> 00:03:06,126
And so, as we're thinking about these places along the continuum, I want you to think about two different things.

30
00:03:06,126 --> 00:03:16,326
Number one, maybe think of a character in a favorite book or some kind of TV drama or movie, and think about the moments in those in those stories how

31
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:22,066
you know they're thriving or just getting by or when they're really struggling.

32
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:26,976
Also, think about for yourself, what does is it look like when you're thriving?

33
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:31,296
What does it look like when you're just getting by? And what does it look like when you're really struggling?

34
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:39,816
What are some of the first signs that you're starting to move to functioning less on this continuum?

35
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:47,106
And also, what are the practices that help you at each stage of this continuum?

36
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:56,776
So you'll see as we move into getting by and struggling, I will introduce some strategies that can be more helpful as things get more intense.

37
00:03:56,776 --> 00:04:02,386
But I want you guys to know from the outset, that therapy is something that people can do at any stage,

38
00:04:02,386 --> 00:04:07,596
that even when you're striving, it can be a place for discovery and for growth.

39
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:12,636
And we want to know that for ourselves, and we also want students to know that, so it can help to diminish stigma.

40
00:04:12,636 --> 00:04:20,106
It's not just something that people do when they're struggling, but hopefully a resource that they use at any point in the continuum.

41
00:04:20,106 --> 00:04:24,426
And the same with some of the other practices that we'll talk about as we move down.

42
00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:29,946
So thriving is just the moments in life where we kind of just feel like ourselves.

43
00:04:29,946 --> 00:04:35,946
We feel like there may be challenges, but we have the capacity to meet them.

44
00:04:35,946 --> 00:04:45,756
Our relationships are functioning usually pretty well, where our sleep and eating are relatively somewhat of a normal range.

45
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:51,636
We may have some variation in our mood and our emotions, but it doesn't seem like anything out of the normal,

46
00:04:51,636 --> 00:05:00,196
it's not impeding with our day to day in any kind of way.

47
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:10,176
Then there are the days where we're just kind of getting by. We may have brief or mild changes in our mood,

48
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:15,366
and our sleeping and eating, and in how we're showing up in our work and relationships.

49
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:16,476
And when you think about this, so

50
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:26,706
for example, if I think about some of the movie or TV characters, some of my favorite are like Olivia Pope from Scandal or Brandle from This is Us,

51
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:30,486
and so you might see how they're interacting with their friends and families

52
00:05:30,486 --> 00:05:37,536
shift a little bit. How they're feeling about themselves shift a little bit. And this is often caused by just everyday stressors.

53
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:42,126
Sometimes you'll see it's caused by childhood or family issues coming up.

54
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:51,306
Sometimes there could be a past trauma or a current trauma happening, a death in the family, something like that, a breakup,

55
00:05:51,306 --> 00:05:55,446
other relationship issues or things happening in our work and academic environment.

56
00:05:55,446 --> 00:06:03,246
Anything that's happening could cause us to just not feel like ourselves, not feel like we're functioning as well.

57
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:08,186
But often when we're in this getting by area, we have the sense that it

58
00:06:08,186 --> 00:06:13,346
doesn't feel great, but it's manageable,

59
00:06:13,346 --> 00:06:20,936
we're not feeling completely flooded or overwhelmed by it. And often these are things that we feel like within a week or two,

60
00:06:20,936 --> 00:06:25,526
kind of resolve themselves. So that's what that middle range looks like.

61
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:32,596
And this is a time where a lot of the self-help strategies, just kind of uping them a little bit, if people like journaling or meditation.

62
00:06:32,596 --> 00:06:38,456
And there's lots of apps that you can have on your phone right now that help with this. Increasing physical activity,

63
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:45,506
connecting more with people that care about us, that cheer us up, that give us a healthy distraction, getting a little bit more rest.

64
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:50,556
These are all things that can really support us during that time. Sometimes just a good conversation with a friend,

65
00:06:50,556 --> 00:06:57,116
mentor, or peer, that gives us a different perspective, that makes us feel seen and heard can help us through that.

66
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:02,776
So if we were thinking about physical health, this might be

67
00:07:02,776 --> 00:07:11,266
like an everyday cold, where you're just like, okay, I need rest, I know what to do, I'm going to be a little kinder to myself, a little gentler with myself,

68
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:19,026
and things tend to have a feeling that they'll get back to normal.

69
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:30,576
In the struggling range of this continuum, that's where we start to see more severe changes, and also a lot of times are more persistent.

70
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:37,136
So what might have started off as a breakup, that felt really sad and intense,

71
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:45,316
has now months later, just continued to dip down in mood and not really come back up.

72
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:54,386
So, often, too, you're seeing steep declines, whatever you saw normally for yourself, whenever you saw normally for this character in the movie,

73
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:59,216
whatever you saw normally for the student in the way that their showing up, you're not seeing that anymore,

74
00:07:59,216 --> 00:08:09,016
you're seeing very different things. Some of the things you kind of think about and look out for in this range would be

75
00:08:09,016 --> 00:08:18,486
changes in appearance, especially when it's looking like they're kind of more neglectful of appearance or hygiene in ways that weren't the case before.

76
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:23,016
Drops in academic performance, so this could be grades or assignments,

77
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:31,936
it could also be attendance in Zoom. If somebody was always on camera and engaged, and all of a sudden they're not anymore.

78
00:08:31,936 --> 00:08:35,876
And these are all things to check in on. None of them by themselves means anything for sure,

79
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:40,876
but they're things you want to just kind of note and maybe check in about.

80
00:08:40,876 --> 00:08:49,026
Also, just the way that they're paying attention or not, if they're less engaged, paying less attention, it might be something there.

81
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:57,026
Drastic changes in mood. Whether that's anxiety, agitation, irritability, sadness.

82
00:08:57,026 --> 00:09:01,586
If you're noticing changes in the way that they're talking, thinking, writing.

83
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:12,076
So if it seems unusual, less coherent, if all of a sudden their speech is much more rapid than usual or just kind of disorganized.

84
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:19,616
If you're hearing them talk from a place of hopelessness or preoccupation.

85
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:25,466
If you're hearing them talk about engaging in risky activities like.

86
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:33,236
If you see withdrawal from their engagement with peers or with you, or family or friends,

87
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:38,816
especially things like kind of ominous goodbyes or giving away sessions.

88
00:09:38,816 --> 00:09:45,716
And also, just any time you're noticing big stressors happen in peoples' lives, so deaths in families, failures,

89
00:09:45,716 --> 00:09:51,596
if they're feeling like I just really bombed this assignment, or this speech, or things like that.

90
00:09:51,596 --> 00:09:59,156
Sometimes when people are coming out about gender identity or sexual orientation,

91
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:05,756
these can be times of stressors and rejections and times where additional support or checking in can be helpful.

92
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:08,866
And another sign of risk, is just feeling like a burden.

93
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:17,386
And so a lot of times for students as they are emerging into their professional careers and sometimes a lot of money is being spent on education,

94
00:10:17,386 --> 00:10:23,206
the sense of wanting to make people proud, or wanting to maybe better their lives, can feel really weighty.

95
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:29,566
And if it doesn't feel like you're doing that, it can really lead to being in this struggling area.

96
00:10:29,566 --> 00:10:35,676
And so it's just something you want to kind of keep this continuum in mind.

97
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:39,276
Especially when we're in the, kind of in the red here,

98
00:10:39,276 --> 00:10:44,766
this is where often you'll see thoughts of death. And it's important to know,

99
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:50,516
and we'll talk more about this, that a lot of

100
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:57,736
the things that we see on this continuum are completely treatable, often resolve themselves completely okay,

101
00:10:57,736 --> 00:11:02,436
but as we move from yellow into red, we need more assistance. We need more help.

102
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:05,806
And so we don't wanna be scared or panicked when we see people in the red.

103
00:11:05,806 --> 00:11:12,596
We actually want to convey calm and help them completely believe that they can get through this. But it is a time where often more support is needed,

104
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:15,326
and so this is often where for sure,

105
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:23,416
it's possible we want to make sure that people have the therapy and also that they are getting evaluated for medication if that would be needed.

106
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:28,906
So as we move through the rest of the modules, keep this continuum in mind. Keep it in mind for yourself,

107
00:11:28,906 --> 00:11:32,496
keep it in mind for the people around you.
