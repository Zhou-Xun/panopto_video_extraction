1
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:29,190
Those microphones on right there, however you want with it, or you can put it to your back in whatever sense or doing just the perfect thing.

2
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,040
All right. Happy to introduce Sophia Lavorato, who will be presenting today.

3
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,780
Oh, thank you. Hello.

4
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:48,030
My name's Andrew. So I will be presenting on behalf of my colleagues on how AB x464 decreases the total human immunodeficiency virus

5
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:56,490
reservoir and HIV transcription and issues and and CD4 from antiretroviral therapy suppressed individuals living with HIV.

6
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:02,250
So it's a really long title. So a little bit of background.

7
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,579
So antiretroviral therapy or in terms of intensification and disruption of latency have been suggested.

8
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:19,050
Strategies to address and treat HIV ABCs for Sex for as a novel oral antiviral drug that inhibits the biogenesis of HIV RNA.

9
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:28,230
It does so by binding to binding complexes, inhibiting viral proteins and alters HIV and where they biogenesis.

10
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:35,159
And it is also the first HIV antiviral that induces long term control of viral load of treatment.

11
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,380
Arrest in transgenic. Humanized. Nice.

12
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:48,049
So the objectives of this study was to investigate the effect of ABC's for six four on HIV transcription and also to quantify

13
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:58,250
the total and intact HIV DNA in CD4 t cells from large suppressed participants enrolled in the AP VAX 005 clinical trial.

14
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:08,820
So for the study as it is a follow up to the 005 clinical trial in which 24 parts of

15
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:16,140
individuals living with HIV and 12 not living with HIV receive daily oral doses of ABC's 464.

16
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,959
There were different dosages provided over different time spans in which 11 of the

17
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:28,650
individuals living with HIV were treated with a 150 milligram dosages for four weeks,

18
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:39,210
while the other 13 individuals of the 24 living with HIV and B 12 without HIV were treated with 50 milligram dosages over 12 weeks.

19
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,060
There also was an ethnic statement with the study in which the Spanish agency of medicines and medical

20
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:52,070
products approved of the trial and each participant provided written consent for sample collection.

21
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,850
Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells from weeks zero four and eight were collected from nine of the suppressed,

22
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,230
cisgender men living with HIV treated in the 150 milligrams dosage group.

23
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,840
The CD4 t cells were then purified by negative selection and frozen as dry pellets,

24
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,400
and in turn the nucleic acids were extracted using che reagents and used to quantify the HIV, DNA and HIV transcripts.

25
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,550
The total HIV DNA was quantified in duplicate using droplet digital polymerase chain reactions,

26
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,700
and the intact HIV DNA was quantified in eight replicates using intact pro viral DNA assays.

27
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:43,470
These cell associated HIV transcripts were quantified in triplicate using reverse transcription PD, PCR and for statistical analysis.

28
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:50,190
Longitudinal changes were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and correlations were assessed using the Spearman test.

29
00:03:52,780 --> 00:04:03,700
And here are the results from our trial, in which Figure one primarily talks about the effect of ABC's 464 on the HIV reservoir,

30
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:09,490
and figure two mostly talks about the effect of maybe exposing to work on HIV transcription.

31
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:20,319
The only significant results that came from this trial was from Figure one B in that first column there in which the total HIV DNA decreased

32
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:33,729
significantly for patients on ABC's for sex for the people who 0.0078 specifically for weeks 0 to 4 but then dropped at eight and four.

33
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,780
Figure one C for the correlation between total and intact DNA.

34
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:45,670
There was a strong correlation also at weeks zero and four, but drops as the real value goes down to 20 as well.

35
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:54,250
So I figure to see that this is for the administration of a report that if you explore things for

36
00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:00,820
and that there is a significant decrease in the initiated HIV transcriptions as well per pro virus.

37
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:08,350
And for both of these figures, each color represents a different assay.

38
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,860
The symbols and shapes represent different individuals from the studies.

39
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:19,540
The bars themselves represent medians, and any of the determinations below the limit of detection are represented as open thoughts.

40
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,370
But. So the overall conclusions, I mean,

41
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:35,250
our findings have potential implications for future developments in treating HIV as ABCs for six four and similar

42
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:41,070
agents have roles in reducing HIV reservoirs and are preventing the reactivation of late in the infected cells.

43
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:47,280
The future directions of this study in particular should investigate the mechanisms that reduce HIV,

44
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,330
DNA and RNA in vivo after treatment with ABCs 464 in combination with other parts as well.

45
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,490
There were a few limitations with this study in which only nine of the samples

46
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,720
out of the 11 trial participants in the 150 milligrams dosage were available,

47
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,639
and most of the participants presented lower HIV levels.

48
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,420
And it may have affected the detection of total and intact HIV, DNA and HIV transcripts.

49
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:22,320
So these undetectable terminations, in turn made it difficult to exclude in the smaller effects of transcripts.

50
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,160
And so we're going to play through that quickly. Yeah.

51
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:35,570
And then. Questions from the group.

52
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,380
Oh, yes. Well, were there any considerations?

53
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,029
Oh, yes. So part of the methods included so trial.

54
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,550
Are there samples taken from week zero four and eight?

55
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:58,290
The samples that were taken from week eight and on were those that discontinued usage of ABCs 464.

56
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:09,090
So when I talk about disruption of latency for taking the the treatment, they did have results for an increase in the total DNA RNA,

57
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,160
but it wasn't as significant compared to the decrease prior to that week.

58
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:20,530
But excellent question. Thank you. Anyway.

59
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,930
Let's go to keep question of results one side or the.

60
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:38,200
Yes. So it looks from there that, you know, you do see this decrease in penalty, but it also looks like there's just a lot of heterogeneity.

61
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,390
You know what I mean? There's a wide spread of response. Yes.

62
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,830
And I know there were for 11 people. It was a very small sample.

63
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:55,420
So it's kind of weird and it is kind of hard to really kind of discern any actual meaningful changes in between just a small sample.

64
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,780
So I understand the concern. Well, no, it is not even a concern.

65
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:04,629
But just is there an opportunity to figure out who like to tailor this and figure out who

66
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:09,610
this is optimal for the who this treatment might be better for history that might be worse.

67
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:15,249
Or or is that something you're considering looking at in the future is definitely a consideration for the future,

68
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,639
as I'll talk with my colleagues later about that.

69
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,820
So when we track to a later date. But definitely with the question, I think there is a challenge of PBMs.

70
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:33,489
See these studies because they're so hard to get and so expensive to process that given huge range of results.

71
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,469
And it's like, okay, this is clearly working for some people.

72
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:42,370
It could not working for others, but it's really hard to drill down on like from a population level,

73
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:48,550
who are you going to get the chance to do something? And I didn't get too many details for the specific population as well.

74
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:54,390
So that's why I write it. It's usually going to be like men in their twenties and thirties and.

75
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,489
The studies, as I pointed out, only that it only says nine men living with other cisgender men living with HIV.

76
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,580
So that's all they've said in terms of reference representation on that one.

77
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,410
Yeah, that's excellent.

78
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:17,980
Thank you very much. Exodus.

79
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,680
Your slides should be pulled out. Okay.

80
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:34,460
So next, I'd like to introduce Dr. Harvey Obama, who's going to be presenting some modeling work with some of us.

81
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:43,340
Hello, everybody. I figured I'd switch gears a little bit and talk about a modeling study.

82
00:09:45,320 --> 00:10:03,380
Oh, yes. Hands up.

83
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,950
Okay. Wonderful.

84
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:17,690
Okay, so the title of our study is Identifying Optimal Vaccination Scenarios to Reduce Varicella Zoster Virus Transmission and Reactivation.

85
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:29,490
So just a brief background. Varicella zoster virus is also called VCP and it is one of the eight two known human herpes viruses.

86
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,240
It's part of Baltimore classification system class one.

87
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,930
So it's a DNA virus and it's a double stranded DNA virus.

88
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,280
It's also an envelope virus with an icosahedron capsid structure.

89
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:51,870
So initial the severe infection manifests as chickenpox and when symptoms resolve, the virus retreats into the nerve ganglia.

90
00:10:52,350 --> 00:11:01,889
And then typically there's a latency period. And in about 10 to 30% of adults, the latent varicella virus will reactivate and manifest as shingles.

91
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:05,820
And this typically occurs in adults aged over 60.

92
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,590
The chickenpox vaccine was first approved for use in the US in 1995.

93
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:19,440
Chicken pox vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine and shingles vaccine is a recombinant vaccine.

94
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:28,380
There's a couple of different types of chicken pox and shingles vaccines, some in the interest of time, not going to go into those too much.

95
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:35,009
So there is controversy regarding chicken pox vaccination and most countries do not

96
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:40,500
include this vaccine and their childhood immunization schedules for a few reasons.

97
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:48,750
First, complications from chicken pox are rare, with less than 1% of infected individuals experiencing severe illness.

98
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:57,840
As with other vaccine preventable diseases, it's likely that natural infection provides longer immunity than a vaccine does.

99
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:07,680
Childhood immunization. Oh, sorry. Low and intermediate levels of chicken pox vaccine coverage could shift the age distribution of chicken pox

100
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,040
on to older age groups who would be more likely to experience more serious illness than children would.

101
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,649
And childhood immunization against these has been hypothesized to reduce natural PCV exposure in adults,

102
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:27,900
which could impact the odds of immune boosting, which may then lead to additional reactivation.

103
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:35,160
And this is the main reason that most countries worldwide do not implement chickenpox vaccination.

104
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:41,070
So theoretical models have predicted an increase in the incidence of shingles corresponding

105
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:46,320
with the inclusion of chickenpox vaccination in childhood immunization schedules.

106
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:57,809
But empirical evidence is inconclusive, and so surveillance programs in locations that did vaccinate against chicken pox have been inconclusive.

107
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,260
And part of this is due to, you know,

108
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:11,880
it's difficult to determine whether an increase in cases is a result of chicken pox vaccination or just a result of improved surveillance,

109
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,340
which is always kind of an issue.

110
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:25,020
So the aim of our study was to understand the long term impacts of BCB vaccination using simulations of multiple immunization scenarios.

111
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:37,590
And we selected data from Thailand in 2003 or from 2003 to 2010 due to the availability of population level chicken pox and shingles data.

112
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,490
It's important to note that Thailand does not vaccinate against visibly,

113
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,310
and we developed a mechanistic model fitting the model to this data from Thailand.

114
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:52,770
We use this model to simulate multiple vaccination scenarios and compare these results to a

115
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:58,680
model lacking any vaccination in order to analyze the long term impacts of BCB vaccination.

116
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,800
So this is our model, this is a schematic of our model.

117
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:13,500
So just briefly, people enter into the model schematic through birth and people kind of move

118
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,719
along from box to box depending on where they are in terms of susceptibility,

119
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,650
exposure, infection, so they can move from susceptible to expose infected with chicken pox,

120
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,309
recovered from chicken pox, infected with shingles, recovered from shingles.

121
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:36,900
And then the boxes that start with V indicate vaccination against chicken pox and shingles.

122
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:45,600
So we ran simulations with vaccination scenarios that took into consideration different combinations of certain factors.

123
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:54,299
These factors are listed in column B, so these factors included chicken pox vaccine roll out at three different levels slow,

124
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:02,550
moderate, aggressive uptake of the chicken pox vaccine, shingles, vaccine coverage and length of immunity from the shingles vaccine.

125
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:08,069
Then we also ran a vaccine free simulation where all values related to the vaccine

126
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:13,889
and column B were set to zero and to evaluate the impact of chicken pox vaccination.

127
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:19,320
We estimated the number of cases that would have been averted had the chicken pox vaccine been introduced in

128
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:27,090
Thailand's routine immunization program in 1996 like it was in the US under these various rollout scenarios.

129
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:36,780
So you may have noticed in this paper there were a lot of figures and so I'm not going to spend a lot of time on every single figure.

130
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:44,340
But this figure shows the different vaccine rollout scenarios and their impact on chicken pox dynamics.

131
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:51,570
So first, I just want to highlight one thing from figures B and C.

132
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:58,560
So the main thing that I want to highlight from these figures is that the black and blue lines are very similar.

133
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:07,290
And this is important because you can see and the key that I made on the left, blue the blue lines represent some.

134
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:13,550
Related chicken pox cases without vaccination in the black lions represent reported chicken pox cases.

135
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:23,180
So it's a very good sign that these lions are lining up because it means that our model is accurately like fitting the data.

136
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:29,479
And then the main thing I want to highlight from FIG. one is that this figure

137
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,440
shows the number of chicken pox cases prevented under various conditions.

138
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,349
And a key finding was that if vaccination in Thailand had begun in 1986,

139
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:46,340
the model estimated that between 340,000 and 480,000 chicken pox cases would have been prevented,

140
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:56,000
representing a 65 to 92% reduction in cases during the the period that we used for the data set 2032 2010.

141
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:02,060
But importantly, these results showed a non-linear relationship because a proportional increase in

142
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:07,010
vaccination coverage did not further prevent an equal proportion of chicken pox cases.

143
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,160
And just one other thing it's important to keep in mind.

144
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:17,000
These estimates are conservative because we focused on what would happen if only newborns were immunized.

145
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:24,110
So if there were any additional PCV immunization catch up efforts, that would have further reduced chicken pox cases.

146
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:33,770
So now onto shingles. The model identified a trade off in chicken pox and shingles coverage on shingles dynamics.

147
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:43,940
So most scenarios that included shingles, vaccination, decreased shingles cases in the first period, which is the first column of the years, 1 to 25.

148
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:50,510
And then only when chicken pox coverage was high and shingles coverage was low.

149
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,180
Did shingles cases increase during this period.

150
00:17:53,190 --> 00:18:00,860
So if you look at the top left corner of those boxes, you'll see that it's kind of like yellow, orange ish, which indicates an increase in cases.

151
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:08,600
And this is because the length of immunity from chicken pox vaccination lasted 20 years.

152
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:14,120
So the increase in cases would be during those last few years of the 25 year period.

153
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:21,890
Then in the second and third periods, all scenarios saw an increase in shingles cases compared to the first period.

154
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:29,420
You can see there's a lot more red and orange in those middle two columns and then in the final period, cases kind of dropped again.

155
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:34,160
And we're sort of closer to what we saw in the first 25 year period.

156
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:41,660
This next figure is a cross section of the previous figure, and it just displays the data slightly differently.

157
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:48,500
So the key concept that I want to highlight from this figure is that you'll notice a U-shape where

158
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:54,270
mid-level chicken pox coverage led to a greater reduction in shingles incidence than either low or high.

159
00:18:54,290 --> 00:19:03,139
Chicken pox coverage. But you can also see that high shingles coverage led to a greater reduction in cases regardless of chicken pox coverage.

160
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:10,730
So that's a really important point. And then again, this is just a the data displayed slightly differently.

161
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:18,590
So what I want to note is that, again, greater greater shingles coverage led to greater reduction in cases and greater chicken pox coverage

162
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:25,760
led to less reduction in cases or even an increase in cases with low shingles vaccine coverage.

163
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:37,370
So just to reiterate a couple of points. Any introduction of a chicken pox vaccine would drastically reduce chicken pox incidents.

164
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:41,690
And there's a non linear relationship between chicken pox coverage and reduction in cases.

165
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:50,209
Any introduction of shingles vaccine with real estate coverage levels in combination with realistic chicken pox

166
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:57,110
coverage levels would increase shingles incidence unless the immunity provided by the shingles vaccine was lifelong.

167
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,160
There is again, there is a tradeoff in chicken pox and shingles, vaccine coverage on shingles,

168
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:13,399
incidence in mid-range chicken pox coverage was the best long term strategy for reducing shingles cases under realistic shingles vaccination levels,

169
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,400
which was an unexpected finding.

170
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,420
There were a couple of limitations to our study.

171
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:30,560
So first, our model does include now takes into consideration natural death, but not death caused by complications from PCV infection.

172
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:37,699
So this could be important because remember at the beginning I mentioned that any low or mid-level

173
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:42,560
chicken pox coverage would lead to an increase in the mean age of chicken pox infection.

174
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:49,790
And those those adults or people in the older age group experiencing chicken pox could have more severe illness.

175
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:57,590
However, previous studies have shown that chicken pox vaccination would reduce the mean age shingles reactivation.

176
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:08,180
So in that case, that could potentially reduce the serious complications from shingles infection if it's occurring in adults who are younger.

177
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:13,160
So a little bit of complicated dynamics going on.

178
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:20,360
Then the second limitation is that all of our simulations omitted the potential impact of chicken pox vaccination,

179
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:26,210
reducing the population level vs exogenous boosting in adults.

180
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:32,929
However, we previously attempted to fit this exogenous boosting in the data from Thailand in the

181
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:37,460
models that did include the boosting did not perform any better than models that did not.

182
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:46,370
So that's why in this study we chose not to include that exogenous boosting dynamic, but that leads us to important future directions.

183
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,460
And for the sake of time, I'm not going to go through each of these questions.

184
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:57,350
But the bottom line is that it would would be important to incorporate a reduction in exogenous boosting in future models.

185
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:08,610
Okay. So then just a few conclusions. The complicated nature of BCB makes it impossible to select a single vaccination scenario.

186
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,670
Is universal policy to be used in all countries.

187
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,370
Some countries may wish to to minimize total visa cases,

188
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:23,630
while others may prefer to focus on chickenpox or focus on shingles just depending on their population dynamics.

189
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,590
So strategies that our focus on reducing both chickenpox and shingles,

190
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:36,600
but prioritizing shingles should maximize efforts towards shingles vaccination while slowly incorporating chickenpox vaccination.

191
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,190
Alternatively,

192
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:47,760
countries may to choose to minimize risk of complications of or may wish to minimize views of the complications of both chickenpox and shingles,

193
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:52,230
which would require maximizing vaccine coverage for both diseases.

194
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:59,500
And then balancing. For countries considering implementing visa vaccination programs.

195
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,210
Balancing the consequences of vaccination to overall health impacts,

196
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:13,160
including understanding the impact of altered mean age of infection for both diseases, would need to be considered prior to any vaccine introduction.

197
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:31,569
And with that, I will take questions. So in the beginning you mention one of the reasons that people might not want to

198
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:38,150
incorporate the chicken pox vaccine would be that more people would get chicken pox older.

199
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:48,520
So I was just curious if your model accounted for like a stratification by age and like who would you say there's an overall decrease in chicken pox,

200
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,450
but is that like in all age groups, or is it more in some.

201
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:03,110
That is a wonderful question. I don't know the detail.

202
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:08,420
So we did not account for age and the data from Thailand.

203
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:19,730
I'm not positive that we got ages of the cases, but I will definitely look into that and talk with my colleagues about incorporating age.

204
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,600
That is a wonderful question. And when you talk to your colleagues.

205
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,620
Mm hmm. Oh, hi.

206
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:34,549
One reason that's really important is because DVT is like other viruses and some similar viruses,

207
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:41,030
where the older you have your first exposure to the virus, the more severe you are.

208
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,460
Your exposure is going to be.

209
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:49,910
So in your unvaccinated people, you can have a delay of outside just because there's less chickenpox in the whole population.

210
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:55,200
Right. And then so those older people are. Great point.

211
00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:00,030
I never. Well, just everybody who would suggest boosting refers to.

212
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,640
Could you could. Would you be able to explain to the audience?

213
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,880
I will do my best to not say again why that matters.

214
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:16,140
Like, I know it did not do anything in the model. Theoretically, what that would do to the population.

215
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:23,890
Yes. And I guess I'll clarify that. We just felt that our model didn't adequately capture it.

216
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,310
Not that it wasn't important. So it's definitely important.

217
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:40,640
So my understanding of exogenous boosting is that it's opportunities that adults have to be exposed to visibly throughout their life.

218
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:47,880
So if there's less people who have chickenpox or who are infectious,

219
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:58,380
then people throughout their lives have less opportunities to be exposed to VCP, which could build up their immunity over their lifetime.

220
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:05,430
So in the absence of those exposures, they may be more likely to have shingles reactivation.

221
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:17,630
Yeah. So in the highly inhuman viruses where we especially viruses that are can be really persistent.

222
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:25,010
Um, when you have vaccination happening in an endemic country, you're vaccinated,

223
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:30,110
people actually end up being more usually the data will often suggest they're

224
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,880
more protection than the vaccinated person in a country with full elimination,

225
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:42,350
because that vaccinated person is almost getting like mild booster doses in the environment throughout their life,

226
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:48,950
whereas in a eradication model country, the vaccine is the only time they're seeing the virus.

227
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:53,130
And so you're not doing that. If.

228
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:03,640
Thank you very much. Know what the leaky vaccine means, this leaky vaccine in the model.

229
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:12,460
So leaky vaccine is simply the idea that vaccines don't have sterilizing immunity,

230
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:23,740
which used to be something that people are used to this idea that before so that when somebody receives a vaccine,

231
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:35,410
they may still have some infection, they may be asymptomatic, it may be less severe and it may still be transmissible.

232
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:42,760
And so the idea of the leaky vaccine, when we especially when you're looking at studies that are modeling vaccination,

233
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:51,040
it's this idea of is vaccine an all or nothing proposition when you have a vaccine in terms of protection or is it a partial protection,

234
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,830
it still allows transmission systems to continue.

235
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:04,990
It also kind of leads sometimes this leaky vaccine concept will lead to a debate about in vaccine effectiveness.

236
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,110
Say you have a vaccine that 75% effective.

237
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:16,330
Is it that 75% of the is it that, like most of the people that receive the vaccine are completely protected?

238
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:21,100
And then there are some people that are incompletely protected, or is this more like a continuous scale?

239
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:25,239
Some people are mostly protected. Some people are less protected.

240
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:33,370
But you know that protection is not complete. Most vaccines are probably fairly leaky.

241
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:47,230
All right. So it was interesting conversation at the meeting I was at yesterday and Monday with.

242
00:28:49,830 --> 00:29:01,530
Oh, no, I close my sides. Stanley Plotkin wrote the textbook called Vaccines that this effort wants him to sign in.

243
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:09,210
Really? Okay. And David Baltimore of Doctor of Baltimore Classification.

244
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,750
We're sort of debating about sterilizing immunity.

245
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,800
If presented at the meeting. Dr. Baltimore slept through my presentation.

246
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:34,250
President. Oppressed the victims here is today.

247
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:56,900
Zero eight time. Oh, hey, what sure is not posted on?

248
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:01,130
Yeah. You know what? Check the very front homepage.

249
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:09,130
Is it linked there? No, I don't see what I look like.

250
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:16,830
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no, don't let me make it look.

251
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:24,800
Let me let me get it to you. I also have to activate the domain.

252
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,320
What's like? I think they want me to give them, like, my first grandchild or something.

253
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:36,170
We're still thinking about it. Okay, let me just get real quick for you.

254
00:30:37,430 --> 00:31:02,190
Take it. You take a 5 minutes for a two minute stretch break. Yeah, that's true.

255
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:07,710
But yeah. I don't know.

256
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:11,680
Drugs are going to be.

257
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:25,300
This new low so you can run this kind of.

258
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:45,960
You know, it was hard to walk through on Monday and I can't figure out who is really to do this running and realize,

259
00:31:45,990 --> 00:32:09,100
you know, they are one everything and it is there are a few things that are not really going on.

260
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:30,850
And I don't why I don't like or think the last step of a million people be removed.

261
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:40,500
Okay, refresh now it should be there in the module.

262
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:44,070
It didn't link in the homepage because that's another like 16 books.

263
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:50,760
But I do not know is everybody able to see the slides in the in the module.

264
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:55,080
Yeah, that's okay. Great. All right.

265
00:32:55,150 --> 00:33:01,930
It's from this person. And do the full time.

266
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:10,250
It's. Okay.

267
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:17,860
All right. Let's go ahead and get started. So we've got time to discuss the discuss the other pieces later.

268
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:28,940
Um, okay. So I'm gonna do a polio lecture first, and then we'll switch to talking about the activities for today.

269
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:43,190
Okay? Polio virus and I described polio virus is part of the performance of everyday and remember I describe for corner birthday earlier and

270
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:56,030
we talked about enteroviruses so the pico small RNA makes it point to the name of area for the non enveloped virus spherical virion,

271
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:11,100
protein shell and and RNA genome. The replication takes place in the cytoplasm and uses RNA dependent RNA polymerase.

272
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:27,790
And polio viruses are very stable in the environment, so resistant to weak acids, common disinfectants, lipid solvents tend to not work against polio.

273
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:33,250
Polio virus, you usually have to use something much stronger to to work with it.

274
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:41,320
And there are inactivation methods, including heating, utilize drying of surfaces, very strong chemicals.

275
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:50,020
You can see that this is why having polio virus in aqueous environment can be quite successful.

276
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:59,500
Right? It can travel through wastewater and maintain a transmissible state in those in those scenarios.

277
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:10,230
So similar to actually this discussion we just had about chickenpox, talking about the age specific epidemiology of of polio.

278
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:19,629
So as you mean, as you improve the hygiene in an area, you see decreased exposure in young kids because there's less polio around you.

279
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:26,680
In fact, kids you see a longer time on average in the population, a longer time to first infection.

280
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:33,970
And so then you actually start to see because kids tend to be asymptomatic and adults tend to be asymptomatic.

281
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,740
You actually see an uptick in clinical disease in a country.

282
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:45,310
So as polio goes from being very common and endemic towards being less common,

283
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:50,650
you actually have an opposite trajectory of the amount of disease that's seen in the country.

284
00:35:51,310 --> 00:36:02,590
So in the U.S., what that looked like during the U.S. polio eradication is you would see a lot of during the polio control efforts,

285
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:07,660
you started to see a lot of young adults and teenagers get started to get polio.

286
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,010
And so when we think about like FDR having polio, it was during that time period.

287
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,750
So for this reason,

288
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:27,070
the infant mortality rate is going to be inversely correlated with polio myelitis in countries that are undergoing eradication efforts.

289
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,090
So it's important to remember that 70% of people are asymptomatic.

290
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:40,210
25% of people will have some sort of flu like symptoms when they first get polio.

291
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:43,810
So sore throat, fever, tiredness, nausea, headaches, side pain.

292
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,170
About 45% of people have paralysis.

293
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:58,000
Now, when polio was very common in the United States, so in the 1950s, there was about 15,000 cases of polio per year in the United States.

294
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:05,380
And as the as but when polio was very common, the U.S. was also very seasonal.

295
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:09,580
And so and it was tends tend to be a summer season virus.

296
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:17,140
The polio would come around and it would sort of move into communities, and then you'd get a lot of polio cases happening at once.

297
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:22,010
Now look at the flu like symptoms sore throat, fever, tiredness, nausea.

298
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:27,609
I mean, that's sort of like the I mean, every virus they present to you, like most of them have that.

299
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:31,180
Right. And so, you know, that's when you get strong, like I have polio.

300
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:39,040
But think about it. Like the chance that we're going through now, this is actually sort of difficult to explain to students prior to the pandemic.

301
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:44,080
The challenge that we're going through now, that every time somebody has a sore throat, they think it's COVID, right?

302
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,200
This is what it was like for polio back in the 1950s.

303
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:55,260
Every time somebody, a kid came home with a fever and sore throat, family was concerned that polio potentially leaving leading to lifelong paralysis.

304
00:37:55,270 --> 00:38:03,700
Right. So you can imagine you can imagine the the fear of polio that was pervasive in the US.

305
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:14,620
Now, polio really picked up in the 1950s in the US partially because of like the modernization of American kitchens was happening.

306
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:20,560
So there was more of a there was more of an attention towards things like

307
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:26,950
hygiene and cleanliness and stuff like that from the forties into the fifties.

308
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,190
And so you had a little bit of in because you can be transmitted by fecal oral means.

309
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:46,809
You had a little bit of of it's theorized that there was sort of a little bit of change in rates and shifts into a more more kind of older

310
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:53,530
and symptomatic disease as far as the hygiene and the kind of the sewage systems and things like that in the US started to improve.

311
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:01,870
But then the real inflection point in the 1950s into the 1960s was the vaccine.

312
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:14,740
So the vaccine campaign, I mean, this is like just a really incredible breath that we see in terms of how quickly the vaccine reduced.

313
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:18,400
Polio in the United States started with the inactivated vaccine,

314
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:26,290
then followed by the live oral vaccine and now replaced again by the inactivated vaccine.

315
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:35,320
To be continued throughout his life. But I want to talk a little bit about what these vaccines are,

316
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:41,440
and then I'm going to talk a bit about the development of these vaccines so you can sort of understand the context in which this was happening and.

317
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,800
So the oral vaccine is a live attenuated vaccines.

318
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,780
So live attenuated vaccines are usually weakened.

319
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,110
They're often they're a wild virus that has been weakened.

320
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:02,160
The original way of doing this was weakening viruses through passage,

321
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,730
by culturing them over and over and over and over and over again until they got weaker.

322
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:16,080
There are other ways to weaken vaccines as well. The cold path or passage was tended to be the strategy to go to there with a live attenuated vaccine.

323
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,100
When you administer it, there is limited replication of a pathogen,

324
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:27,450
so that like kind of tried and true public education message about like it doesn't actually infect your cells.

325
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:33,120
There are vaccines that do actually infect yourself. Live vaccines do actually cause a replication process.

326
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:43,590
It's just a defective replication process. So if it is packaged correctly, it will replicate in a way that does not cause disease.

327
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:50,009
Now, oral polio vaccine as it is, replicates in a way that doesn't cause disease.

328
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:56,850
However, there's one genetic mutation that can happen that is not uncommon, that if that happens,

329
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:01,800
it will revert to symptomatic and then will cause symptomatic disease with that reversion.

330
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:08,670
The reason why, even with the challenges with live attenuated vaccines,

331
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:15,420
because you are having this limited replication of the pathogen, you have a very good immune response.

332
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:22,660
Your immune response is going to be as close as to mimicking the natural response as as we can get.

333
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:32,639
Now, interestingly, like we used to say, the natural response was sort of you never going to get better than a natural response to infection.

334
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,219
But actually, like we're starting to see vaccines come out where the vaccine response is better than a natural response

335
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:44,490
to infection because of the breadth of the T-cell response were able to prompt with vaccination.

336
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:49,020
It's actually like getting exposed to multiple strains at once, things like that.

337
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:57,960
But you know, compared to the original inactivated vaccines, live attenuated vaccines were better in terms of approximately natural response.

338
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:06,660
So because of this, usually only one dose is necessary and sometimes we do two doses just to make sure that everybody is completely

339
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:11,820
covered and we don't have a gap of like that smaller percentage of people that aren't responding to vaccine.

340
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:18,990
Now, for mass campaigns, you can see where something where one dose has very high effectiveness is going to be very attractive.

341
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:26,280
Right. And so this is where all vaccines come in now with live attenuated vaccines.

342
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,490
We do get into this problem with circulating antibody.

343
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:40,080
So if you vaccinate a child too young at an age where there may be some antibody that they've received,

344
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:43,230
serum antibodies that have been transferred from the mother,

345
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:49,320
that anybody could actually block the activity of the vaccine, stops the vaccine from working.

346
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:54,780
This is why FluMist, like the flu vaccine, the injected people's nose,

347
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:01,290
we don't use it in very young kids because very young kids have potentially antibodies already.

348
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:09,300
The mucosa that's going to stop the replication of the live virus, which is going to make it so that that vaccine doesn't work at all.

349
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:17,280
And obviously, we don't use we don't use them often in pregnant women and we certainly don't use them in people with immunodeficiency.

350
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,770
So here's an example of some live attenuated vaccines.

351
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,900
So the the alternate are killed are inactivated vaccines.

352
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:36,410
So the original versions of these of killed inactivated vaccines are vaccines

353
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:41,030
where we took the whole or a split particle and we use that to make the vaccine.

354
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:48,440
Oftentimes originally the inactivation was performed by human was performed by chemical processing.

355
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:59,870
Now there are other types of non live vaccines, like recombinant types that we'll get into when we talk about HPV, other ways of making vaccines.

356
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:03,830
But the original way of doing this was by taking the virus and then making small particles.

357
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:12,260
So with these vaccines, because you do not need a replication process in order for the vaccine to work,

358
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:20,210
you don't have to worry as much about circulating antibody. And you can deliver these vaccines younger at a younger level than older.

359
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:32,480
However, most killed graduated vaccines will oftentimes require boosters, and they wane over time broadly.

360
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,420
Now, as I say, everything I say in this class, anytime I give you like a big overarching statement, there's going to be like three exceptions.

361
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:44,660
But broadly, this is often a small, okay,

362
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:50,930
so how do we get to this point where we have two polio types of polio vaccines that

363
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:56,239
have fundamentally different ways of working but are both available and being used?

364
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:01,130
Or why do we use one and not the other in different places? Some of this is biologic and some of this historically.

365
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:05,089
So it starts with the Salk vaccine.

366
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:09,559
So Salk Jonas Salk trained here for School of Public Health.

367
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:16,160
So you are now classmates, the Jonas Salk in trains to make the influenza vaccine.

368
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:21,110
When I was Francis and then left to go to University of Pittsburgh,

369
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:29,060
where he developed the polio vaccine and became like Time Man of the Year, all sorts of things.

370
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:35,420
Now, he was a very like a gregarious personality.

371
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:42,770
He loved the media he would call the media before he published a paper on anything that was going on in the lab and be like,

372
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:47,150
let me tell you what's going on over here, and then get big. And he got a lot of money that way.

373
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:55,970
Like he got really good funding from the March of Dimes and other places because he was this really kind of engaging personality.

374
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:08,480
So once he developed the vaccine, though, Dr. Francis, who was still here, stepped in and said, well,

375
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,160
somebody is going to need to run the trial and how about you send it over here like we're doing and we're just going to do this for you.

376
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,390
So then Dr. Francis ran the polio trial to test the vaccine.

377
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:25,490
Now, the trial was sort of the largest scientific undertaking in the U.S. at the time.

378
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:31,460
There's 1.8 million children that participated in the trial of the Salk vaccine.

379
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:41,020
We had the results of the trial when they came out and the like.

380
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:44,870
This corner picture right here, those are those at the top right corner.

381
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:54,260
So this is in Raqqa. If you've ever been in Raqqa like Paul and like it's the second or third floor, it's really like long.

382
00:46:54,830 --> 00:47:01,250
This guy right here is like the media relations person for U of M at the time and he's standing at a table.

383
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:07,700
So what basically what he did is he walked into Raqqa with this stack of reports and whether or not the vaccine worked.

384
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:13,190
And all of the reporters rushed in behind him and tried to grab them.

385
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:20,870
And so he climbed up on a table and started throwing the report out into the crowd to get them out faster.

386
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,329
And then they all started going in and calling in the reports and it disseminated

387
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:29,600
throughout the U.S. like the results disseminated really quick across the U.S. actually,

388
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,590
like people were now, like they were stopping class and announcing them.

389
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,179
And, you know, the kids the kids were all invested in that effort.

390
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:45,860
So also very you know, it's interesting, too, like I've been I've been giving this lecture for a really long time.

391
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,399
And it's interesting to sort of think about, you know,

392
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:54,680
I always sort of thought it was interesting to think about how people how how

393
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,610
people were just incredibly invested in getting their children into this trial.

394
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:02,810
This was a placebo controlled trial. So not even everybody was getting the vaccine.

395
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,650
Not all the kids were getting vaccinated. They got eventually vaccinated, but not right away.

396
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:12,380
And so people were signing their kids up in like huge numbers for this trial.

397
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:16,640
They sort of think of where we've gotten to today in terms of vaccine attitudes.

398
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:23,750
But then also the interesting thing about the coding trials, I mean, there was sort of this same sense that a lot of people were doing a lot.

399
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,180
Of things to try to get in the trials.

400
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:30,290
Like I know some people that you would drive 5 hours for an appointment to try to get into the COVID vaccine trials,

401
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:37,970
but those were adult first trials and these were kid first trials because this was really a pediatric disease we were trying to stop here.

402
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:43,970
And so this is very little you know, they started with the kids and then they kind of caught of the adults.

403
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:48,690
Whereas COVID, we started with the adults and the down to the kids and so created this very different dynamic.

404
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:57,110
But I love this picture of the guy throwing up. So so this vaccine, it got approved.

405
00:48:57,110 --> 00:49:04,290
It got disseminated very, very widely. However, then the cutter incident happened.

406
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:07,550
So how many people are familiar with the idea of the cutter incident? A couple of you.

407
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:13,820
Okay. So the pattern incident happens pretty shortly after the mass rollout of the vaccine.

408
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:20,120
So what they did some and what happened to COVID is once a vaccine is initially approved,

409
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:28,159
oftentimes manufacturing gets distributed out to other sites that can take over meaning in order to manufacture it faster.

410
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:34,880
So they had identified and licensed a whole bunch of facilities around the country to manufacture the vaccine.

411
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:45,830
However, immediately after licensing, we have reports of five children in California were reported to have paralysis after receiving the vaccine.

412
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:53,960
So this is a red flag. When that happens with an inactivated vaccine, it means something has gone wrong in the inactivation process,

413
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:59,600
which there should be checks and balances during the vaccine production process and there are to this day.

414
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:03,830
But to see whether that is happening wasn't done on the cutter.

415
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:12,950
And so there were actually, at the end of the day, about 380,000 doses of polio vaccine.

416
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:18,320
The inactivated pulling out vaccine had been inadequately inactivated and then administered to children.

417
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:27,140
So live polio virus not appropriately attenuated that administer what had happened was at the time

418
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:33,200
so this is actually a picture of a technician at Cutter Laboratories inspecting the filters.

419
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:41,120
The way that they were enacting inactivating the virus was by moving it through these filters, cycling it through all these filters.

420
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:45,440
And there was something wrong with the filters that would cover a lab.

421
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:54,140
So ended up being a really kind of important incident in terms of vaccine safety.

422
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,520
There were as part of that, it's in about 40,000 children developed milder cases of polio,

423
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,090
but 51 children had permanent paralysis following the Cutter incident.

424
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:06,320
Five children died.

425
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:15,380
Now numbers much, much smaller than the number of children in the US that are getting paralysis from polio due to wildtype polio however,

426
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:20,990
still a pretty huge, huge number.

427
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:28,040
There was actually follow on epidemics that happened after that point as well.

428
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:38,120
So some of the cutter incidents, in fact, the children went on to spur additional epidemics that led to additional paralysis cases as well.

429
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:54,020
So the so this had a so this led to the Gottsagen versus Carter Laboratories case,

430
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:59,240
which basically made it was it's a pretty kind of landmark drug safety case.

431
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:08,180
And it made it so that vaccine companies were liable without basically liable for any vaccine related injury that was happening.

432
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:17,690
You can see how it got to this point. You saw also had a pretty much I mean this this effectively over the decades following kind of shut down a

433
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:21,860
lot of vaccine development because a lot of companies were unwilling to work in the space at that point,

434
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:29,059
but sort of led to that conversation. So at the during the Carter incident,

435
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:38,750
so they knew this vaccine that like floods the market and then goes away and kind of really like what's going to happen at this point.

436
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,930
So we have this vaccine that was working, the trials, everybody used it,

437
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:46,490
but now we don't want to use it because we've got to like replan the production system.

438
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:57,709
Well, there was another vaccine on the market as well. And this vaccine was made by Dr. Simon that Dr. Sabin and Dr.

439
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:02,510
So did that get a lot famous. They wrote nasty letters to each other.

440
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:06,680
They like submitted nasty letters to the editor about each other's papers.

441
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:15,240
Apparently there was. Why there was a is that there are scientists around now that worked with these gentlemen.

442
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:27,410
You still hear about what that said? And there was a presentation and Salk was presenting and refused to refer to Sabin by name.

443
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:35,660
He referred to his work. He would say the gentleman trained by so-and-so, whoever Satan's mentor was like Thursday or Friday,

444
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:38,839
and it was just like there was all sorts of stuff in there,

445
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:44,300
like at the end of the trial, you know, you know, the end of the soft trial when this was happening.

446
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,719
Like saving kind of went up and took all the credit for the trial.

447
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:53,870
And Francis but his feelings were like, I mean, I'm telling you, like these guys, they were not getting along.

448
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:57,590
So lots of lots of like really dramatic personalities.

449
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:05,540
So saving develops. He was also at the same time himself was working to that his polio vaccine savings, developing his polio vaccine.

450
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:12,799
However, what Salk finishes first and starts like the world's largest randomized trial saving

451
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,820
can't test his vaccine now because every kid in the U.S. is now already received,

452
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:23,629
you know, every year received salt's vaccine they're going to do it soon is no longer ethical for saving to perform a

453
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:30,050
randomized controlled trial with a placebo control group because there's already a vaccine out that works.

454
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:36,830
So in 1861, he gets this vaccine license.

455
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:49,340
But because he had tested and done his rc t in in the Soviet Union, he actually built up the ability to to produce these vaccines in the Soviet Union.

456
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:59,370
And he did his trial there. The Soviet Union, ever since this thing actually has had amnesty in Russia following the end of the Soviet Union,

457
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:06,950
has actually had sort of a big scientific role in the development of live vaccines because of the investment,

458
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:13,700
the saving made over there originally because it sort of dug dealing with the investments even made in using live vaccines.

459
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:21,050
So you often see Russia leading with a live vaccine based strategy with kind of new things happened.

460
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:32,120
But so he got his first MONOVALENT vaccine license and they they started adding additional types over time,

461
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:39,640
either through making single man surveillance or by 1963, combining them into a trial.

462
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:48,740
So in 1963, when they come out with the Travaillant formulation, this then lines up with the time line.

463
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:53,720
If you sort of have to a graph here, do I need to go back to the graph?

464
00:55:57,410 --> 00:56:05,500
If you look at 1963, we have pretty low polio happening at that place at that point.

465
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:10,660
But because of the safety record, people want inactivated vaccine replaced with something else.

466
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,970
And now we've got the availability of the Sabin vaccine to come over and take over.

467
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:21,810
So they start delivering the oral polio vaccine.

468
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:30,649
Once they start delivering this vaccine, they then find, though, that the risk of oral polio vaccine,

469
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:36,420
which you're very familiar with because of the workshop, is that vaccine associated paralytic polio.

470
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:49,069
So this is happening when VPC has a reversion of the attenuation through very few polymorphic sites and it allows the virus to read,

471
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:59,150
acquire the nerves. Virulence is actually it isn't quite a it's a over a 1% genetic divergence from the same in vaccine strain,

472
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:07,100
which is enough of a divergence that at the time it was felt that that was so far away genetically that it was unlikely to happen.

473
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:15,950
And these are, you know, communicable V please from an epidemiology perspective,

474
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:22,760
they can be indistinguishable from wildtype polio virus and we tend to see it when we have low herd immunity.

475
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:34,100
So because of VDP in 2000, the IP went from OPV and went back to IPV.

476
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:41,840
So we had so little polio that we were basically okay with going with IPV and and not

477
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:50,900
having any additional in additional VPC vaccine derived polio virus risk in the US.

478
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:54,560
And so this was kind of seen as the model how you do this right,

479
00:57:54,560 --> 00:58:03,050
you use OPV to get rates down quickly because it is a more potent vaccine and it works better in mass campaigns because you can deliver in one dose.

480
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:08,359
It also offers gastro like it works, it's replicating in the gut.

481
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:12,890
So, you know, you can stop, stop the virus right at the point of entry.

482
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:22,310
But it's not a the long term strategy because you can continue to reintroduce the vaccine derived virus in the community.

483
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:30,319
And especially it's especially problematic in a country after you've had broad elimination and you don't have this exhaustion,

484
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:38,210
this boosting that we just talked about, because it's not just boosting is a way to kind of me really systematically maintain immunity in adults.

485
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:47,300
You don't have that in a country that had elimination. So so is the IP switched to the inactivated polio virus vaccine?

486
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:57,680
Now, one thing that I find fascinating about this, you should see this.

487
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:04,860
These are the back rates. These are the polio cases from vaccine of the sort of the vaccine campaign.

488
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:12,460
And as you see, when that switch happened, it was we see no, that happened after that point.

489
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:20,290
The only back case we saw in 2005 was it was actually it was in a U.S. resident.

490
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:27,040
So the CDC wasn't classifying it as imported, but it was somebody who had traveled and gotten infected with that while they were traveling.

491
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:32,950
So interesting drop off happened at that point.

492
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:43,210
What I find really fascinating about this is that for all of the competition and not, you know,

493
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:49,840
lack of collaboration between self and say that at the end of the day you actually need both products, right?

494
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:54,280
You need the inactivated and you do the oral to be able to respond to things like that.

495
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,700
And if that wasn't clear until both men had passed away,

496
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:04,500
then you actually needed the oral product and the lab product and the inactivated product to be able to do that.

497
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:10,419
I'm sure either were alive to speculate, but I bet both of them would say that their product was is the only one that's

498
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:14,740
needed and would continue to blame each other for the situation that we're in now.

499
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:20,710
But it's just sort of interesting that there's sort of like postmortem collaboration happening between the two of them.

500
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:32,170
So all right. So with that, we've already sort of talked about the idea of where this left us in terms of international eradication.

501
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:39,500
But now we have this situation where we have U.S. eradication,

502
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:48,100
U.S. kind of what we have to figure out what to do in the U.S. and I was sort of thinking about having a few of you come up and present sides.

503
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:51,400
But in the interest of time, I think I'm actually not going to do that.

504
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:56,710
Well, I'm going to stop the recording because we have a discussion.
