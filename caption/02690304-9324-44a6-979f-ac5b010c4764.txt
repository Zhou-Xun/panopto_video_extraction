00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Aging Part three social programs in the first segment of this lecture,

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
we examine changes in the age structure of the U.S. population and the potential impact of such changes.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The second segment was focused on health among the elderly and how this may be changing over time.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The current segment will examine the three major social programs that support the elderly Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There are three major federal programs that provide support to those 65 and older.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Social Security is the oldest of these three programs.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It is a social insurance program that was established under President Franklin Roosevelt in

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
1935 with the primary goal of providing income support to retired workers who are 65 and over.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It also provides income support to disabled people of all ages.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Current active workers pay Social Security taxes that go into a Social Security trust fund, which then pays benefits to current retirees.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:31,000
In other words, it is largely a pay as you go system in that current payments are used to pay current retiree benefits.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There have been a number of modifications over the years,

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:43,000
such as incorporating cost of living adjustments for inflation and increasing the standard retirement age from 65 to 67.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But for the most part, the structure of Social Security has remained unchanged.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Medicare and Medicaid were both created in 1965 as part of the Great Society programs under President Lyndon Johnson.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Medicaid primarily provides health insurance for those aged 65 and older.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It also provides medical insurance for disabled people who are under 65.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Medicare is funded by current workers who pay Medicare taxes that are then used to pay benefits to current retirees.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
As with Social Security, it is largely a pay as you go system.

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Medicaid is somewhat different from the other two programs in that it is a jointly funded program between the federal government and the states.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Medicaid was designed in part to provide health insurance for those of any age who are in poverty.

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But importantly for today's discussion, it also pays for nursing home care for those who are in poverty and 65 and older.

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
In fact, Medicaid now pays for almost 50 percent of the nursing home care in the United States.

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So it has become an enormously important program for the elderly since the vast majority of people in nursing homes are over 65.

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Unlike Social Security and Medicare, which have their own special taxes for supporting those programs, there is no special tax for Medicaid.

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It is funded out of current general tax revenue and it is also funded as a pay as you go program.

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This table provides a summary of recent actual federal expenditures and projected

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
expenditures for each of the three major social programs in twenty seventeen.

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
These three programs cost over two trillion dollars.

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
They accounted for just over 50 percent of the entire federal budget and over

31
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
10 percent of the entire gross domestic product or GDP of the United States.

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
These are huge numbers in both absolute and relative terms. And when we look ahead to the year 2028, the numbers grow even larger.

33
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So not only is the absolute dollar amount in twenty twenty eight larger for each program,

34
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:21,000
but collectively they will consume a larger fraction of the federal budget and represent a larger fraction of the entire gross domestic product.

35
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So what explains the fundamental trend that the costs of all three of these programs is growing in both absolute and relative terms?

36
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The answer includes a number of the ideas that we have discussed in the previous segments of this lecture.

37
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:47,000
First, the elderly population is growing larger in both absolute numbers and as a percentage of the total population, which makes costs go up.

38
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Second, the costs of health care are increasing and usually at a rate that exceeds general inflation.

39
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So this also adds to costs. And finally, there is the additional challenge of adequate tax revenues to support these programs.

40
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
As we have seen with the shift in the age structure of the population toward older age,

41
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
there will be fewer active workers who will be paying taxes to support each retiree who receives benefits from these programs.

42
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
In other words, the elderly dependency ratio is going up while at the same time the costs per person are going up.

43
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Overall, the economic strain on the system, as currently structured, is projected to worsen and it is not considered to be sustainable.

44
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Some people have described the current fiscal situation with three major social programs as a perfect storm.

45
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Health care costs are high and tend to increase at a rate that exceeds general inflation.

46
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The population is growing older, so the number of elderly and the proportion of the elderly and the population are both increasing.

47
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And as a consequence of the change in the population structure. The elderly dependency ratio is increasing.

48
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:14,000
In other words, the number of elderly is increasing relative to the number of people in the labor force who pay taxes to support these programs.

49
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The latter means that there will be fewer active workers paying the taxes that are

50
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
needed to support each of the three major social programs that support the elderly.

51
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Overall, the fiscal solvency of these programs is already difficult and growing worse.

52
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So what can be done for Medicare? There are a number of ideas that have been discussed.

53
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The age eligibility for Medicare is currently 65.

54
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If the age were increased, this would reduce the number of eligible beneficiaries, which would reduce costs.

55
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Another possible option would be to increase premiums for high income beneficiaries and to increase co-pays to some extent.

56
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The premiums for high income beneficiaries have already increased. The range or magnitude of benefits could be decreased at present.

57
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And unlike every other insurance provider in the United States, Medicare specifically Part D, which provides prescription drug benefits,

58
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
is barred by federal law from negotiating for lower drug prices with pharmaceutical companies.

59
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hypothetically, this could be changed, but the Congress would need to change the law.

60
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Instead of reducing costs to the program,

61
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
another possible approach would be to increase the payroll taxes dedicated to supporting the Medicare program.

62
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:56,000
However, as shown in the slide, the magnitude of tax increase necessary to make Medicare fiscally solvent is quite substantial,

63
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
a reflection of how fiscally out of balance Medicare is.

64
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And there are other possible approaches that could reduce costs and or save money and therefore improve the fiscal solvency of Medicare.

65
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
However, one critically important factor has remained unmentioned.

66
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Politics, aside from reducing drug prices,

67
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
all these possible maneuvers for addressing the fiscal solvency of Medicare are politically unpopular with the elderly,

68
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
since they would reduce benefits and or increase costs to beneficiaries.

69
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And the elderly tend to have a higher rate of voter participation than any other segment of the voting age population,

70
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:50,000
which makes it challenging and unpopular for politicians to propose such changes.

71
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Medicaid has its own unique challenges. Medicare does not cover 100 percent of health care costs for beneficiaries on average.

72
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Under the current levels of premiums and coverage, Medicare beneficiaries spend over 15 percent of income on out-of-pocket medical expenses.

73
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And this is likely to increase this level of out-of-pocket spending forces,

74
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
many elderly people to go bankrupt and therefore they must turn to Medicaid.

75
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:33,000
As an aside, in the United States, medical bills are a major factor in about two thirds of all personal bankruptcies, specifically among the elderly.

76
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Medical bills account for about one third of all personal bankruptcies. The United States is unique among high income countries.

77
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So-called medical bankruptcies essentially don't exist in all other high income countries,

78
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:56,000
since all other high income countries have some form of universal health insurance that prevents this from happening.

79
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
As noted previously, Medicaid pays for about 50 percent of all nursing home care in the US.

80
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
However, in order to qualify for Medicaid support for nursing home care, an elderly person must meet poverty criteria.

81
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
In other words, they can't own a house or any other significant assets.

82
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:23,000
They must spend down to poverty. This requirement for poverty can be particularly pernicious for married couples in which one

83
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
spouse needs nursing home care because then the other spouse must also be reduced to poverty.

84
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Since their joint assets are considered for Medicaid eligibility and recall that

85
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Medicaid is a joint program with funding from the federal government and the states.

86
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So the dollar amounts that were shown on the previous slide only represent the federal component of Medicaid expenditures.

87
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Though most of the money for Medicaid comes from the federal government,

88
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Medicaid represents one of the largest categories of expenditures at the level of the state's.

89
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Finally, let's consider what options may exist for making Social Security more fiscally stable.

90
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
One way to reduce the fiscal pressure on Social Security program would be to reduce

91
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
the number of beneficiaries by increasing the regular age for for retirement.

92
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:29,000
In fact, this has already occurred. The original standard age for retirement was 65 and it has been gradually increased to 67.

93
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What if this were to go higher? Well, this would certainly reduce costs to the program.

94
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But as we will see in the next lecture segment, the impact would fall disproportionately on those who can least afford such a change.

95
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Another possible approach would be to means test for eligibility for benefits.

96
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This would imply that people with higher incomes would receive reduced or no benefits.

97
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:03,000
This option has also been discussed at times, but has never gotten very far due to political opposition.

98
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And of course, increasing the tax rate for Social Security would increase revenues and this would help to make the program more fiscally stable.

99
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Note that the tax rate increase required to make Social Security fiscally stable about 16 percent

100
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
is much less than the percent increase that would be required to make Medicare fiscally stable.

101
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Or in other words, Medicare is in much worse shape fiscally than Social Security.

102
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Overall, the options available to improving the fiscal balance for each of the three major

103
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
social programs for the elderly fall into one of three categories increase taxes,

104
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:54,000
decrease eligibility for benefits, and or decrease the level of benefits or some combination of these three options.

105
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:10,525
As already noted, politics has played and will continue to play a significant role in how the challenges facing these three programs are addressed.
