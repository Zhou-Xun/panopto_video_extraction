1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,420
Go ahead and get started. Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:15,220
Today we'll be talking about another topic we have stephen without.

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:22,660
We'll talk about research and therapy. Before we get started and.

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:35,670
So next Tuesday, we do have Dr. Wendy coming back to give us another talk on genetic testing and then Thursdays when Exam two would open up.

5
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,670
So there's no class, no in-person class on Thursday.

6
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:47,620
The exam should open up, I believe, 8 a.m. on Thursday, and it's open till five, 5 p.m. on Friday.

7
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:54,160
And you have to log in and get started and anytime you want within that time frame.

8
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,420
Okay. Any questions related to that or.

9
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,470
Cause in general. Okay.

10
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,590
Well, so today we have Dr. Steven Waddell.

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,480
He's the research and innovation activities director for the Center of Public Health and Community Genomics.

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,570
And he has been in that position since 2001.

13
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:28,790
He has more than 35 years of experience working in multiple projects, focusing on different aspects of precision, precision health, ethics and policy.

14
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,620
And we're so excited to have him here today. So I'll hand it over to him.

15
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:48,469
Thank you so much, Farah. And hi, everybody. And I'm really over to you for getting here so bright and early.

16
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:55,760
And the weather is certainly helping us, isn't it? So we'll be covering gene research and therapy today.

17
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:03,620
Here are the various categories that will be discussing genome types of civic therapy, somatic cell gene therapy,

18
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:16,880
gene editing technology, and especially CRISPR germline gene therapy that includes mitochondrial gene transfer and CRISPR.

19
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,960
And we'll be discussing a distinction between genome preventions, you know,

20
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:33,020
preventive approaches and genetic enhancements, first down to the genome type specific therapies.

21
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:43,189
So I'd like to start with the condition called long term syndrome, mainly because it is a relevant condition.

22
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,970
It's a heart arrhythmia named after the lengthening of the acute interval.

23
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:56,510
It's something that I've worked on with a cardiologist, the med center, and it does have public health importance.

24
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,860
At last count, there are 13 genotypes for this condition and there are lots of genetic variants underneath that.

25
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,530
And it does lead to 3000 deaths of children and young people per year.

26
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,500
So it's a condition of public health concern.

27
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:24,950
The Michigan Department of Health and Human Resources reports 329 children and young adults die of sudden cardiac death each year in Michigan.

28
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:33,020
So it has instituted a surveillance system in the state which catalogs causes of sudden cardiac death,

29
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,270
including atherosclerotic heart disease, cardiomyopathy.

30
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:42,890
That's something that strikes out athletes, especially in long acute syndrome.

31
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:53,540
BRUNER It all of use gene transfer methods operating on cellular potassium channels in troubles with with

32
00:03:54,110 --> 00:04:01,700
the cellular channels are at the root of this condition and they have electro physiologically reversed,

33
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:10,280
genetically created Y acute syndrome. But more study needs to be done to prove to prove efficacy in human beings.

34
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:18,770
There's some disagreement on whether the ideal approach for this condition should be prevention or should be treatment.

35
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,740
So more appropriate at this time is not gene therapy,

36
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:30,140
the genome type specific therapy that is looking at the particular variant of one

37
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:35,210
cuties syndrome and deciding what the course of action should be from there.

38
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,380
So oftentimes it's avoidance of certain competitive sports.

39
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,060
Interestingly enough, swimming is one such condition where allowed triggering noises.

40
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:53,870
So I don't know if you had an electronic alarm clock to wake you up this morning or if your body has timed it, it just gets you up.

41
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:06,000
But that's one trigger for it. Beta blocker therapy is one form of medical management, and 1 to 3 tends to be a lot more pernicious.

42
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,640
So sometimes that requires pacemaker implants for it.

43
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:21,980
So what's the pro balance identified? It's also valuable to alert family members of the risk, and this can be done either by virtue of surveillance,

44
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:27,290
as I said, something that the state of Michigan conducts or through the physician.

45
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:35,190
Now for other conditions. Actual gene therapy is something that we might consider.

46
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:51,990
So here's the current status. 2926 gene therapy trials have been initiated worldwide since 1989, covering more than a dozen disease areas.

47
00:05:52,350 --> 00:06:00,030
The NIH is currently tracking 1796 gene therapy trials.

48
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,790
Only about 4% of these trials are phase three.

49
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,380
Phase four, that is, they've moved on in a population direction.

50
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:20,460
To date, numerous studies have reported the ability to express the gene product of the inserted gene.

51
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,840
About 91 have reported a significant degree of clinical efficacy.

52
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:32,520
Most trials are concerned with proving either a safety or safety and efficacy.

53
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:40,080
As you might have heard, gene delivery is is a major area of challenge.

54
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:50,100
So just imagine an aerosol with recombinant DNA, safer cystic fibrosis being applied down the throat and into the lungs.

55
00:06:50,460 --> 00:07:01,260
And so the idea is to transduced cells, but at the same time that might into an immune reaction, which will deter the effectiveness.

56
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:13,550
Since the Gelsinger event, which we have for today's reading use of Adeno associated virus, HIV has become more widespread.

57
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:23,240
It's proven to be a little bit safer than adenovirus, although its of course it's not ubiquitously used and it very much depends upon the application.

58
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,020
Well, let's talk about some indications of reported protocols.

59
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,650
Cancer is a major one.

60
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:47,720
So things like immunotherapy or tumor suppressor genes, these sorts of gene therapy trials represent 66% of those that are being undertaken right now.

61
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:53,750
Then we have gene therapy for a single gene defects such as cystic fibrosis.

62
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:04,730
This would represent about 11% of the current trials gene therapy for infectious diseases, especially HIV.

63
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:11,350
6% of the trials and gene therapy for cardiovascular conditions.

64
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,720
So heart disease, for example, growing and growing new blood vessels.

65
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:22,810
This is also 6%. So in Jeremy, talk about these different categories.

66
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:30,250
There's obviously a public health implication to this because we're talking about shifting away from single gene,

67
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:37,060
inherited conditions to the more common elements like cancer, aids in heart disease.

68
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:48,550
I myself received through the mail a gene therapy enrollment notice from a University of Pennsylvania venture affiliate in 2016.

69
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:59,620
This was for an ongoing trial of adeno associated virus to be used for homozygous and as two genes affected familial hypercholesterolemia.

70
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,630
And this is another condition of importance to public health.

71
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:12,250
It's actually labeled a tier one condition by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention because

72
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:21,070
the test for hypercholesterolemia is validated and the condition can lead to clinical severity.

73
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:29,470
If you have two mutated gene copies that can lead to heart attacks and sudden death in the teenage years.

74
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,430
So let's talk about some of the successes of gene therapy.

75
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:48,490
One of these is severe combined immune deficiency, and this comes in two different varieties,

76
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:57,250
adenosine deaminase deficiency or 88 and X-linked sked, which affects only boys.

77
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:07,990
And then there's applications to hemophilia B like kitchen storage disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

78
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,800
First for eddy deficiency skin.

79
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:20,860
As early as 1990, T cells were infused back into Ashanti to Sulfa, who is the poster child at the time,

80
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:27,880
and she was all over the internet and this was done in an attempt to save for

81
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,910
trials of this sort are currently pressing forward in the United Kingdom,

82
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,710
US and Japan. So 35 such trials ongoing right now.

83
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,910
And then there is the other form, which is X-linked kid in France.

84
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:50,979
Nine of ten children treated for X-linked good showed long term immune recovery and there were other successes in Britain.

85
00:10:50,980 --> 00:11:00,350
So very promising. And then for hemophilia B, it really doesn't take much of to induce an improvement.

86
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,800
Just a 1% increase in clotting factor nine will make the difference for these patients.

87
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:14,810
Five Gene therapy clinical trials are currently being conducted in the United Kingdom for severe hemophilia,

88
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:20,629
and this is a really good country environment for conducting these trials because for a long

89
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:27,380
time now they've maintained a database both to report the cases and to report adverse events.

90
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:35,360
So we find success is now being reported in collaboration between the United States and the United Kingdom.

91
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:43,219
Then there's glycogen storage disease, which you may have heard of from newborn screening.

92
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,730
So it actually comes in a couple of different varieties.

93
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:57,020
There's kitchen storage disease type two or Pompe disease, which involves a defect in the enzyme acid alpha glucose two days,

94
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:04,040
and we end up with a buildup of glycogen in organs and possible death as a result of this.

95
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:14,090
So this can have an infantile onset, and that's why newborn screening is conducted for glycogen storage disease type one.

96
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:20,179
The more prevalent form rather take type two.

97
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:31,100
Rather The more prevalent form is by kitchen storage disease type one, which involves a defect in the enzyme glucose, six phosphatase.

98
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,840
And this once again impairs the individual from converting glycogen.

99
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,630
So it builds up in numerous organs and it can be potentially fatal.

100
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:49,730
It can be fatal from something as simple as type of like repeated hypoglycemia that might get out of hand.

101
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:55,110
So these patients, as part of the major medical intervention,

102
00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:02,329
then they have to consume cornstarch every 4 hours, and that includes when they go to sleep.

103
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:09,290
So they have to wake up every 4 hours here at University of Michigan in 2023.

104
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:16,550
One of our investigators, Alicia Almond, reported the results of a phase two trial of adults.

105
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,170
With gene therapy for the condition.

106
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:31,630
By the year one endpoint, all patients were between 50 and 100% off of the amount of cornstarch that they originally had to consume.

107
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:40,540
And so this rather successful trial has gone on to to phase three for efficacy and safety.

108
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,440
And finally, we have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

109
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:56,469
In February of 2017, gene therapy developed by the National Cancer Institute and licensed to Pharma was reported to have

110
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:03,280
left one third of very sick lymphoma patients with no sign of disease at three and again at six months.

111
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:15,250
So this is colored and you've probably heard of the car t cell therapy and it allows the T immune cells to better identify and destroy tumor cells.

112
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,090
Here we have a quote from Edinburgh.

113
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:29,200
There is hope that these successes will lay the groundwork to become a technology platform for future gene and cell based therapies for disorders,

114
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:37,160
with much higher incidence rates such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, stroke and Alzheimer's disease.

115
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:51,910
It's a good question to ask is will somatic cell gene therapy ever be accessible to the wider population?

116
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,469
Well, scientists in Britain think so.

117
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:02,730
And they created a white paper that predicted that despite the subjects that you read about today and have heard about,

118
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:08,010
that gene therapy would have the potential to become a cornerstone of modern medicine.

119
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,610
Those who wrote the White Paper predicted that this might be the case within five or ten years.

120
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,750
Of course, that paper was written ten years ago.

121
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,180
But let me ask you, what's what's your read on the current state of gene therapy?

122
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,700
Is what they spoke about in the White Paper coming to pass?

123
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,420
Opinions don't have to be fact based.

124
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:46,130
I would say that like it's more accessible, but it's not entirely widely accessible to the population you simply grown.

125
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,980
So that's a good answer. Momentum picking up, but not entirely there yet.

126
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,630
Other thoughts?

127
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:06,890
Yes, I noticed it wasn't reading the mitochondrial gene therapy article that other countries are kind of making more progress and we are here.

128
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:12,739
And I think that all it will probably take is one passage of something to allow it to happen,

129
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:21,379
and then it'll kind of snowball into more things being allowed or just seeming more accepted by the public because they're thinking,

130
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,320
Oh, we already have this. Like this isn't that much different.

131
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,540
But the biggest hurdle to get over it will probably be the initial step, and then it'll be easier from then on out.

132
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,580
Yeah, that's a really good point. Mm. So a couple of positive prominent examples.

133
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:40,060
Yeah. CAR-T therapy is gaining a lot of traction and it's not just being used to treat like lymphoma anymore,

134
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,780
that it's being modified to treat other diseases because it can be used in such a targeted manner.

135
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:53,360
Hmm. Very well said. It's almost like a form of precision health for the particular condition does have its drawbacks,

136
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,840
but the physicians and scientists know how to deal with those.

137
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,620
Yeah. I like your answers.

138
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:07,690
Yeah. It sounds like momentum is actually carrying on and we're moving in that direction.

139
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,960
Would be interesting to just meet whether we're past the halfway point.

140
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,890
We're probably probably at the halfway point right now.

141
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,560
Couple of years ago, maybe, maybe six years ago, I couldn't have said that.

142
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,130
But a lot new is coming out. And you've mentioned that to me.

143
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:34,340
So I would like to mention a couple of cautions, though, with the trials which have proven successful, which I talked about.

144
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,000
One of those is excellence, good trial.

145
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:44,870
These trials were actually halted in 2002 after two children developed leukemia and one died.

146
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,450
So the FDA in the RIC, the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee,

147
00:17:50,960 --> 00:18:01,070
then began the difficult task of of weighing the potential leukemia that could result against the fatal nature of X-linked skin.

148
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:12,350
So countries since then have resumed these trials on a case by case basis, and no second generation gene replacement trials are underway.

149
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,319
Then we have hemophilia.

150
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:28,880
B I came across a dose escalation trial, a collaboration between Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Stanford and Allergan, which halted.

151
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:37,790
The trial was halted briefly when portions of the vector used were actually found in the patient's seminal fluid.

152
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:45,680
Now, fortunately, this didn't persist beyond a few weeks, and the semen DNA was unaltered.

153
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:54,140
But it's what I would consider to be somewhat of a scary condition with the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

154
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,860
Three of 101 patients died from causes not related to natural worsening of their condition,

155
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,530
and two of the deaths were deemed due to the treatment that was applied.

156
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:17,270
And then we come to the almost unpronounceable or anything trans carbon malaise deficiency, which is what Jesse Gelsinger suffered from.

157
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:23,390
It was part of your reading for today. 18.

158
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:28,880
Jesse was an 18 year old who died in 1999.

159
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:38,299
44 days after administration of the highest dose for the trial of adenovirus with recombinant corrected,

160
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:46,250
Gene Gelsinger underwent a severe immune reaction to the protein code of the virus that was used.

161
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:56,750
And that's why I say that further further development is occurring and which particular virus is used for a line of gene therapy.

162
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:04,670
So at the time, it was felt that somatic cell gene therapy was not especially dangerous because

163
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:09,530
there hadn't been such severe adverse events for a number of years prior.

164
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:18,020
But this proved that supposition wrong. So the article that you wrote for today is very telling about what could go wrong.

165
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:31,610
And so I could I hear from you either what you read or what you've heard about the case that went wrong or oversights that occurred.

166
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,260
Yes, I read that.

167
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:46,040
Sorry. It seemed like the principal investigators at the University of Pennsylvania.

168
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,420
It seemed like they had financial conflicts of interest.

169
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:59,720
I think it said so clearly. There wasn't a lot of oversight by the new regulatory body, especially not the one that university.

170
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:11,420
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. So Teams Wilson, who is the head of trial, he actually used to belong to University of Michigan before he went to Pennsylvania.

171
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:21,410
He owned a company called Genova and Genova stood to profit quite a bit at the trial, was successful.

172
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:29,960
Then there was another company that you've heard of its been around Biogen and they would have offered millions for a successful trial.

173
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:34,790
So there was definitely a financial conflict of interest.

174
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,000
Other things he may have read or heard.

175
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:49,129
Yes, I think the lack of oversight from the FDA at the time and like even their own, ah, your view was like very, very new.

176
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:57,040
So they were like, well, we don't have regulations for it. So yeah they, they enabled it to, to occur much too quickly, didn't they.

177
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:05,390
But I think that like between the federal agencies, I mean they could have been more communication about what could happen,

178
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:10,190
but bit short of that, they should have scrutinized it closer.

179
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:17,930
Other other things that you've heard about. Yes.

180
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:27,680
There was data out, I think it said up to a year before Jesse died that there were adverse events associated with this trial,

181
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,579
but they were never really reported properly or considered at all.

182
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,180
And they should have halted the trial, but didn't. Oh, yeah. Oh yeah.

183
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:41,239
There were adverse events. These were for the animal models, the mice.

184
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,170
But there are definitely deaths that occurred and.

185
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,930
Which seemed minor a bit. I'd want to hear about it if I were about to have a trial.

186
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:56,150
And it was not part of the disclosure. Yeah. Yes.

187
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,739
The thing, too, that was very problematic is that the University of Pennsylvania,

188
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:07,120
their IAP board, was understaffed and so couldn't provide adequate review of that.

189
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:16,410
So there was like a lack of informed consent with that and is problematic for other studies that are going to go into the IRP as a stopgap.

190
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:20,930
That's a very different. That's interesting. Thank you for contributing that you're.

191
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,750
Well, you should have your finger on the pulse of what was happening.

192
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:38,530
I'll just say that, you know, Jesse went into the trial fairly healthy other than having the primary condition.

193
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:51,850
But then he in the time before the trial, you know, they always do like liver and same studies before a blood drop.

194
00:23:51,880 --> 00:24:00,640
When I was a Red Cross donor, they did they did a liver test and I couldn't donate anymore.

195
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:07,630
And so his liver was slightly impaired in the weeks before, and that should have put up a red flag.

196
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:13,150
But then right before he had a chest infection, you know, which which means immunity.

197
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:20,290
So that should have been looked into. And you've already mentioned the disclosure problems, plenty of them.

198
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:26,110
So you're all quite right. Interestingly, right after the death,

199
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:33,969
others reported that there were some 6700 belated adverse events in other gene therapy

200
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:39,760
trials that came out one way or another that hadn't been reported previous to the trial.

201
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,440
So it's like the, you know, what hit the fan?

202
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,570
And then everything broke loose and companies finally started to report,

203
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:55,960
whereas previously they tended to view as many of the events that could happen is proprietary.

204
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,880
Now they were a little bit more willing.

205
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:11,680
Questions for us to consider our situations like the girls, in your case, correctable, and how who should be selected for human gene therapy trials?

206
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,960
How should informed consent be conducted? What should be disclosed before the trial?

207
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:23,980
What should be reported after trials? Should there be any legislation to protect participants rights?

208
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:32,560
The main question What policy remedies might be used to fix the ethical lapses?

209
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:41,830
And so this breaks into two questions. What can be done to improve informed consent and what should be disclosed?

210
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,180
And I'll just mention some of the disclosure solutions.

211
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:54,220
One of them, of course, is for an accurate disclosure of potential risks, as well as the benefits,

212
00:25:54,580 --> 00:26:00,160
and, as you mentioned, disclosure of commercial ties in the informed consent.

213
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:11,020
It has been suggested that investigators with direct financial interest in the study excused themselves from subject selection.

214
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:18,700
And then in terms of subject selection, greater attention to factors like urgency and benefit.

215
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:27,339
A lot of patients who have this condition or are on medical therapy and are fortunate

216
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:32,260
if they can be a participant in the trials so long as the right things are done.

217
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,780
Then there's institutional improvements.

218
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:45,909
So reporting and communication improvements, online reporting of adverse events is a nifty idea and that has got into effect with the NIH Jim.

219
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:49,540
Chris database, which does store adverse events.

220
00:26:49,540 --> 00:27:00,459
This started up in 2004. And then Article four today mentioned legislation like the National Human Services Research Act and a couple

221
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:08,350
of other attempts to us more specific legislation on gene therapy have sort of lagged and fortunately.

222
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:19,130
Now we're going to get into the gene editing technology, something that's really been in the news the last couple of years.

223
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,750
All of this is site specific insertion.

224
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:32,420
And aside from CRISPR, there a variety of methods. One of them is zinc finger nucleases or xylophones.

225
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:39,800
These are site specific and do nucleases designed to target and cleave specific DNA sequences.

226
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:45,290
There's transcription activator like effector, nucleases or talons.

227
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:56,360
These use restriction enzymes specific to desired DNA sequences restriction enzymes, something that bacteria also use.

228
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:03,200
Then there is clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats.

229
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,730
Or CRISPR. Thank heavens we have the acronym for it.

230
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:14,450
The CRISPR system was discovered in bacteria by Japanese scientists in 1987.

231
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:25,670
It Was Harnessed is a gene editing technique by UC Berkeley scientists Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier in 2012.

232
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:37,490
CRISPR is the RNA guide, and it targets plant, animal or human genomes like a torpedo, sort of.

233
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:42,080
And Cas9 protein is the cutting enzyme, so they're linked together.

234
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:50,930
Unlike other techniques, CRISPR doesn't require that scientists create custom proteins for each of the DNA targets.

235
00:28:51,890 --> 00:29:01,220
So the RNA programing for CRISPR is much easier to do than the other techniques, and it tends to be relatively precise.

236
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,540
So it was lauded when this technology came along.

237
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,340
And it has achieved groundbreaking breaking levels of accuracy.

238
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,390
Uses of these gene editing techniques.

239
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:29,370
Well, for Z offense, the zinc finger technology homology directed repair of x like skin.

240
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:41,830
Yeah. The blood clotting disorders modification of T cell c, cr5 receptors in AIDS, making them resistant to HIV binding.

241
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:50,020
I think it's sort of interesting that they are dealing with kids has given way to gene editing technology,

242
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:57,010
which shows a sort of a continuum of of development in gene therapy.

243
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:08,510
Then we have uses of CRISPR Cas9 modification of microorganisms of insects blocking their ability to reproduce.

244
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:16,180
Animal model models to study mutations find human diseases.

245
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:27,520
Gates, in a reading for today, says that it can be applied to tropical breeds of cattle to boost milk and protein production.

246
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:39,970
So Bill Gates in 2018 also suggested gene editing for mosquitoes to make them sterile or mostly produce male offspring.

247
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:44,379
And lo and behold, he is he's somewhat like a Jules Verne character.

248
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:49,900
And he is in many ways because he's come out with an assortment of books that are very forward looking,

249
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,280
another one on climate change that also has public health relevance.

250
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,880
So lo and behold, a British company, Oxitec,

251
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:04,629
has produced Gene edited Melville's kill that passes along a lethal gene to its

252
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:10,540
female counterpart and makes her offspring die before they can reach adulthood.

253
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:21,010
This has been field trials in Brazil, in Panama and the Cayman Islands, a fascinatingly in the US.

254
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:31,090
As of May of last year, Oxitec finally gave permission to release these mosquitoes in the Florida Keys.

255
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:40,090
And I'm a purist in seeing what the outcome of this is, but it was a long time before they could do it in the Cayman Islands.

256
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:47,440
There's been reported a 62% suppression rate of virus carrying mosquitoes.

257
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:51,010
So these are tropical fire viruses.

258
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,330
Think of West Nile. Think of hemorrhagic fevers.

259
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:06,700
So despite concerns, it is something that could have positive implications, but also minuses.

260
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:14,350
So what's released? You've got to admit that the mosquitoes cannot be put back into the bottle.

261
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:24,050
And there's the fear that use of these mosquitoes could lead to the creation of an anti virus resistant mosquito.

262
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,660
And then there's evolution of a species resistant to gene drives.

263
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,650
Bill Gates feel that we can always be one step ahead of these sorts of developments.

264
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:39,650
And then there's not just biological resistance, but there's also public resistance.

265
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:56,790
So relevant question for us. Is there any role for public health in the release of these kinds of of edited mosquitoes?

266
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:06,030
I would argue there is because the EPA was the central agency in charge of making the decision for approval,

267
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:12,540
but it received input from Florida public health before it made the decision.

268
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:18,390
And as it was making the decision, it did it in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control.

269
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:25,770
It also received quite a bit of public input. So public health does have a say in these kinds of applications.

270
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:35,100
And there are other sorts of applications gene editing, careful bio sciences, which is Jennifer Doudna.

271
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:41,700
This company gave exclusive rights to DuPont for agricultural uses like disease.

272
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:51,570
Resistance in crops in firms in Israel and Germany have now formed licensing agreements with Monsanto for agricultural products.

273
00:33:52,410 --> 00:34:01,530
Gates mentioned in his article a University of Oxford application, which was an see for Rice,

274
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:07,920
which the new see for Rice would be 20% more efficient in photosynthesis.

275
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:13,920
It would have higher yields and it would be less water stressed.

276
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:25,080
In September of 2020, an international team that included Scotland, the country who brought us Dolly the sheep.

277
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:32,580
It reported the ability to modulate the amount of fermentable dietary fiber in barley green.

278
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:44,460
And also in September of 2020, an international team that involved quite a number of countries from the U.S. to Asia to Canada,

279
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:51,030
reported the use of CRISPR to create a version of the parasite which causes leishmaniasis,

280
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:56,880
which affects the skin, nose and throat, and actually is a very prevalent tropical condition.

281
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:07,110
So the new organism could no longer cause clinical disease, but it would induce an immune reaction towards its presence.

282
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,590
A vaccine with the mutated parasite protected mice against leishmaniasis.

283
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:18,490
And so phase one human trials are now underway.

284
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:26,760
And you can imagine this would be the kind of gene editing trial that would become increasingly important, as is.

285
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:33,620
Climate change is underway because it does deal with the trap of serious tropical conditions.

286
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:43,020
Presently, they're ongoing gene editing trials for sickle cell disease, for retinal disease,

287
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:50,910
some of them here at University of Michigan and Kellogg for myeloma, melanoma, aggressive lung cancer,

288
00:35:51,150 --> 00:36:03,900
specially trials in the U.S. and in China and companies like CRISPR Therapeutics in Europe and ed US in the US position to translate CRISPR Cas9

289
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:16,110
technology into therapeutics for serious human diseases and are already partnering with pharmaceutical companies to enable gene editing to be used.

290
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:30,320
In October of 2017, scientists at Harvard University reported a new CRISPR related technique to change single versus multiple base pairs.

291
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:35,780
And so this was a little bit of a simpler kind of idea,

292
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:43,790
a little bit like pulling a guitar string off of a guitar to simply change the single base pair.

293
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:58,290
And the reason why I mentioned this development is because they report it has the capability to create about 60% of single base pair mutations.

294
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:21,340
It's a relevant slide game. Okay.

295
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:32,630
So CRISPR, you know, it can be used for somatic cell gene therapy and it has been in other forms of medical management.

296
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:39,950
So the UC Berkeley team is doing in vitro CRISPR experiments on sickle cell disease.

297
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:50,300
But sickle cell can also be managed by less risky means, such as simply using hydroxyurea.

298
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:59,840
So this is just one example of a set of issues where CRISPR is something that's developing.

299
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,870
Can we do something that's a little bit less risky?

300
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:09,499
One thing that you have to think about is these trials are rather limited in the number of patients that they accept in.

301
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:15,290
Oftentimes, gene therapy trials can involve just 10 to 15 individuals.

302
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:24,080
And so you wonder, how could these kind of trials ever result in something that enters the mainstream if they're so limited right now?

303
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,140
And then with the gene editing trials on an international basis,

304
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:38,090
these might start a Sputnik 2.0 biomedical space race between countries like the U.S. and China.

305
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:47,959
And then we could also envision maybe species extinction of the mosquito and the kind of ecological upset that would occur,

306
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,160
at least in a particular area like the southeastern U.S.

307
00:38:52,580 --> 00:39:01,730
And then you have a host of GMO genetically modified organism arguments that could also translate into the use of CRISPR.

308
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:11,500
So now let's get into germline gene therapy.

309
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:18,940
This contrasts with somatic cell gene therapy, because with the stakes in germline gene therapy,

310
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:23,760
any such errors could perpetuate themselves into future generations.

311
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,560
Very problematic. So early on,

312
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:36,640
gene therapy therapy pioneer William French Anderson said that we should only consider germline gene therapy for various serious conditions.

313
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:44,830
The example that he gave was offer to fill a C mia, which can result in in-utero fatalities.

314
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:54,190
And as one of you had mentioned, mitochondrial gene replacement is already was already actually being conducted in a couple of countries.

315
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,140
And it represents one form of germline gene therapy.

316
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:06,700
So the embryo and self harboring for mitochondrial genes and there are a variety

317
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:11,170
of techniques that can be used to make mitochondrial gene therapy happening.

318
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:23,080
One of them is to introduce the biological mother's nucleus into a donated cell, which has been a nucleated.

319
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:34,120
The other one is to inject a fair share of cytoplasm from the donor mother's egg into the cytoplasm of the biological mother's egg.

320
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:43,900
So mitochondrial gene therapy was performed in Mexico by a New York center for fetal neurologic condition.

321
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:57,980
Authors have been concerned about possible consequences that there might be an incompatibility either between the biological mothers,

322
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:03,370
mitochondria and the donor mother's mitochondria,

323
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:15,860
some some sort of adverse chain reaction, or between the host mother's nuclear DNA and the DNA that's contained within the donor mitochondria.

324
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:26,059
The United Kingdom's parliament six years ago and you're reading for today Australia just this year

325
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:34,940
approved legislation allowing IVF techniques to replace faulty mitochondrial DNA in in progeny.

326
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:42,160
And the authors, Johnson and Bowman, make a strong legislative and regulatory argument in its favor.

327
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:49,400
They feel that its time has come. The disorders that are being tackled can lead to serious problems.

328
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:54,980
So heart problems, seizures, blindness and infantile death.

329
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,180
That's why so much attention is being given to this form of therapy.

330
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:11,020
However, at least in the United States, the techniques are big, haven't been given a lot of scrutiny and are still under tight regulation.

331
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:23,980
So the question is who should set policy for mitochondrial replacement therapy?

332
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,770
And I've already mentioned a couple of countries that are setting policy.

333
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:38,830
What's your opinion? So it's a new application of gene therapy, relatively new.

334
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:47,740
There's still questions about it. What sorts of bodies should look into it and regulate how quickly it comes out?

335
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:57,400
Yes. It's a really difficult question because our country's obviously regulated from the governments, even in the sciences a lot of the time.

336
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,620
But those aren't the experts. And having grown up around Washington, D.C.,

337
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:07,090
I know a lot of the time people who are making those laws actually don't know that much about what's going on.

338
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:16,179
So it definitely be prudent for maybe even a new body to be created to regulate gene therapy and have experts in the field.

339
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,590
Part of that interesting proposal. Yeah.

340
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:31,510
Once gene editing came out, you had a number of commissions formed to scrutinize it and and discuss the consequences.

341
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:42,490
What sorts of divisions should occur? So forming a knowledgeable body, especially containing a variety of experts, is some is a very valid suggestion.

342
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:51,890
Other suggestions? Yes. I definitely think it has to be regulated at the federal level instead of leaving those discretions up to the states.

343
00:43:52,370 --> 00:44:00,409
Because then when you get such inevitable variation and different policies, that kind of what we're seeing right now with Roe and everything,

344
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:06,410
different states having their own policies, it produces great inequities in access to different things.

345
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:14,510
And in something like this, where especially at first, it will be very hard for those of lower access be able to access.

346
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:21,620
And just increasing that further separation of who will have access to what kinds of things by state lines,

347
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:27,770
I think would result in a lot of additional ethical issues that could be avoided if we regulated it federally from the beginning.

348
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:35,900
So if I were to merge your two comments, what what federal direction would you suggest?

349
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:51,490
Her what? Federal body. Oh, body. I like his comment about creating an additional body, or at least a committee of experts in this specific field,

350
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:59,079
whether that's within the NIH or a member on the presidential cabinet or something like that,

351
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:07,780
someone who has a significant background but also is poised to be in a position to actually influence policy as opposed to offering

352
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:13,750
recommendations that are then taken into consideration by people who aren't necessarily experts think they need to be directly involved.

353
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:20,409
Yeah. Yeah. It's been said that legislation is really slow to change.

354
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:28,330
So that's why you're recommending there be a scientifically knowledgeable cabinet and NIH hasn't been involved.

355
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:39,760
So policymakers, NIH have suggested that perhaps human attempts should only be made on males and there would be a stopgap

356
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:46,750
to ensure that any errors wouldn't get perpetuated into future generations because sperm don't have.

357
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:52,690
Well, sperm have a minimal number of mitochondria, if any.

358
00:45:53,020 --> 00:46:09,460
Yeah. Yeah. So and there's also the FDA, because the FDA has general purview over over any number of kinds of of trials, including gene therapy.

359
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:23,310
Mm hmm. And then also, it's good to have public commentary as create a window so that the public could at least report in their beliefs.

360
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:29,740
Maybe it's maybe it's online or perhaps have public leaders involved.

361
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:46,050
Okay. So Gene editing has been performed in China, nonviable embryos for beta thalassemia,

362
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:52,320
which is a potential fatal blood test for disorder in the same family as sickle cell disease.

363
00:46:54,450 --> 00:47:04,110
And this CRISPR Cas9 was injected into 86 non-viable human embryos, which were allowed to grow to the eight cell stage.

364
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:12,780
71 of the embryos survived. It ends up that only four of these actually contain the intended genetic material.

365
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:21,770
And the scientists found that the CRISPR Cas9 complex had introduced two into a number of US targets.

366
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:30,810
Not a good thing. So various techniques are being used to reduce the possibility of off target insertions.

367
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:37,050
One of these is to look into the nature of the Cas9 complex being used, for example,

368
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:43,800
to weaken its hydrogen bonds so that it's less likely to insert offside.

369
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:53,610
The other one is simply to inject the CRISPR Cas9 complex into the cell rather than outside of it.

370
00:47:54,630 --> 00:48:03,450
And the reason being that the Cas9 will be metabolized a lot more quickly and has less of a chance of going off site.

371
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:10,620
So dangers of germline gene therapy.

372
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:22,960
Are the function of genes that confer an unknown property that has benefits could be inadvertently modified.

373
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:32,230
Then there could also be the possibility of introduction of harmful genes, which again would end up being propagated into a future progeny.

374
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,810
There is a simple argument that why not use conventional therapies?

375
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:44,650
So these include pharmacologic fixes as well as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.

376
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:58,900
And there is also the ethics of oh, that the embryo to be obviously can't give any consent, but neither can the future generations that are affected.

377
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:03,850
So don't do something that would be frowned upon by future generations.

378
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:11,290
And then use of the technology, if it becomes more widespread, could lead to discrimination.

379
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:18,520
So it's a little bit like the brave new world situation, which is you have Superior Gammas running around.

380
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:27,880
And then there's this slide towards eugenics. And this has been written about by University of Pennsylvania ethicist Arthur Caplan,

381
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:32,490
who says that this kind of technology could produce super babies.

382
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:37,120
So here is thinking about mitochondria, which are the powerhouse of the cell.

383
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:42,730
And it's like it's like producing super babies with energized batteries.

384
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:47,910
I call this the Energizer Bunny argument against extreme.

385
00:49:51,840 --> 00:50:00,840
A big question should CRISPR technology be used for embryonic as opposed to bodily somatic purposes?

386
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,510
You know, it's a division type question.

387
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:20,140
Do you have any opinions about that? For that matter, you could apply it to germline gene therapy in general versus somatic cell gene therapy.

388
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:27,970
Do you feel that there's a dividing line between embryonic uses and bio uses?

389
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:33,110
For example, lung disease or eye disease? Yes.

390
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:43,610
Yeah. I think there's a difference. Mean, just because like anything that is your mind is like affecting like another human

391
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:48,799
that doesn't always have like you can't really get informed consent from them.

392
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:55,190
But then as somatic cells, you're the patient. So like you can have more of a say in what happens.

393
00:50:55,190 --> 00:51:02,930
So it's hard. But I think embryonic could be used for like these single g like the these issues,

394
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:13,050
like newborn issues that we know about and that could be prevented but not like for like choosing the hair color like color of your baby,

395
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,370
like the whole designer baby thing. I don't know if that's is ethical.

396
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:24,620
Yeah. Yeah. Which seemed to be a little bit superficial though, those possible uses.

397
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:32,420
But as you say, for a serious Newport condition, something that we're very concerned about in public health,

398
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:38,900
although we're used to thinking about them in terms of newborn screening and dietary management,

399
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:44,450
but for example, conditions that might occur in utero.

400
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:55,610
Yeah, but then, you know, there's always the problem of informed consent sometimes in these circumstances,

401
00:51:55,610 --> 00:52:04,070
rather than worrying about whether the child to be would consent, the parents give their consent.

402
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:10,310
Would they be a suitable proxy for the child who not yet been born?

403
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:19,950
See if mitochondrial gene therapy were being applied. Not a trick question.

404
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:23,460
I'm just sort of asking your honest opinion simply. I mean.

405
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:32,570
But I'm just saying possibly that that could be the key because it's their decision to bring.

406
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:38,480
You know, possibly, possibly they could. And I mentioned that some of these.

407
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:44,110
Yes. Oh, I do have a comment, but I wasn't raising my hand so she can finish.

408
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:57,040
Oh, no, no. Yes, please. Oh, okay. I think that's this is like an interesting topic because I took a bioethics minor,

409
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,750
but one of the classes, specifically an undergrad, was focused around different health issues like this.

410
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:07,120
And one of the things we talked about was like children who are born intersex and whether or not the

411
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:11,830
parents can consent to have that surgery or if parents should be able to consent to circumcision.

412
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:18,250
And I think that that is a totally different issue because it's more cosmetic than anything.

413
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:26,170
And this is and while they're both permanent, this is very different and has greater implications.

414
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,249
So on the issue of like cosmetic things,

415
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:37,540
I think that is different than like as parents being able to have the authority to consent because ultimately,

416
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:44,860
unless it's affecting your child's life span, that's a decision, a decision that they can make when they're older.

417
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:51,760
But like you said, with something in utero that would ultimately end their life before it even starts.

418
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,160
I think that's different.

419
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:58,520
Like when you take your kid to the doctor, you're not asking your four year old if they want an antibiotic for their pneumonia.

420
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,100
You're just giving it to them.

421
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:09,250
So I think that in this case, given because it is a serious health situation and not something that a decision could wait,

422
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:12,760
then they would be a suitable proxy. Yeah. Yeah.

423
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,860
Yeah. That there's an interesting distinctions. Yeah.

424
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:22,510
So you're right. I mean, parents do make decisions for their children all the time.

425
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:26,950
So I like the intersex example. Mm hmm. Yeah.

426
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:32,680
Another example might be simply deciding to send your your child off to private school.

427
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,780
Which will affect the next 4 to 6 years of of their education.

428
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:40,610
But then again,

429
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:48,440
there's a difference in gravity between applying this kind of technology and the kinds of decisions that parents are normally called on to make.

430
00:54:49,840 --> 00:55:00,890
So maybe the issue information becomes especially important because it's it's not a decision to be taken lightly any other.

431
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:06,290
This is it's like I feel like it's a similar situation for couples that go through IVF and

432
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:11,120
like the sometimes like they destroy the eggs that have like those genetic mutations.

433
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:16,939
And like sometimes like know the consent there is tricky as well because like, yeah,

434
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:23,360
what's the line between like eugenics and like just making sure that they have like a healthy child.

435
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:29,690
So if you like that, like the arguments for that can also be applied to this conversation.

436
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:37,640
Yeah. Yeah. You know, IVF really does push the envelope, although you have all these, like social surveys that are conducted.

437
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:53,060
And if given the opportunity to not just address a serious condition, say, like, oh, my child having cystic fibrosis,

438
00:55:53,270 --> 00:56:00,590
okay, but maybe something that would be serious, but it wouldn't materialize until a future.

439
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:12,800
So IVF, PGD has been used to detect mutations for breast cancer, BRAF mutations at the very, very earliest stages.

440
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:22,160
And then you have scientists and policymakers wondering like how far the envelope should be pushed, like should it be pushed?

441
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:30,740
Should these sorts of things be applied? IVF and for for chronic disease.

442
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:37,790
Okay. So a chronic disease, high blood pressure.

443
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:49,260
It's something that won't appear for decades. He. So there is there's the issue of an IVF is another good example.

444
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:57,400
I'd like both of your examples really where the envelope should start and where the envelope should, should and we.

445
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:06,559
Yes. I also think it's frustrating because just in terms of talking about the ethics, I think there needs to be a consistency.

446
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:11,210
You can't just decide that IBM's okay, but X, Y, Z is not okay.

447
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:20,209
And I don't know if this is way too different, but for example, like abortion is also you're talking about embryos, you know, why is that not okay.

448
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:27,530
But IVF is and it's it's just kind of there's so many inconsistencies and it seems to just follow in line with whatever people want to believe.

449
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:36,469
And so but if you're talking about making policies and protecting people, there needs to be a consensus on what is okay and what is not.

450
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:39,260
And there doesn't seem to be so. Wow.

451
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:48,050
Well, and I know you bring that up because abortion is under attack right now and rovers versus Wade disappeared.

452
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:52,040
And, you know, but you have a very good point. And yet IVF is being used.

453
00:57:52,940 --> 00:58:02,630
I don't know if there's any commission that has a larger view of these things, you know, scientific commission or legislative commission.

454
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:12,020
You make a very good point. Yeah. Well, thank you for all your commentary.

455
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:22,920
This certainly leads me to think. So I didn't have it at today's reading because the article is a little bit aged.

456
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:27,240
But I think the difference between genome tipping prevention,

457
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:36,150
which is making sure that people are not born with a particular genotype and phenotype to prevention,

458
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:43,560
preventing the manifestation of a particular disease condition is somebody who is born is a valid distinction,

459
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:52,410
is one that was written about by Eric Yost, who is a former director of a NHTSA, L.C.

460
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:59,820
So he actually to phenotypic prevention into various categories.

461
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:09,090
One of them was primary, you know, prevention. So this would be efforts to monitor and reduce levels of militants in the workplace.

462
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:15,720
Then there's secondary phenotype prevention. This is after the condition has slightly manifested.

463
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:26,700
So we have newborn screening and then we have dietary measures that are applied for the condition like fetal area,

464
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:34,910
and then there's tertiary fetal prevention. So this is after the disease condition is a period and at the beginning of our

465
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:40,680
talk today already mentioned one such application and that is cystic fibrosis,

466
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:46,160
aerosol therapy for somebody who is already manifesting severe.

467
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:58,670
And then there is simply germline gene therapy to early embryos to prevent the expression of certain disease phenotypes which are already underway.

468
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:09,800
And then there is a germline gene therapy for infertility, which is which is a condition that manifest later on.

469
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:15,050
But it's something that can be tackled at the early embryo stage.

470
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:23,630
It has been done in mice at the Salk Institute. So young in this article discussed what should not be allowed.

471
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:31,520
One of them is germline gene therapy to prevent the passage of a particular genotype to the embryos offspring.

472
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:39,260
And this is sort of an ethical to an argument, and that is that the person or the embryos should not be used as a means.

473
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:45,440
In this case, it would be used as a means to guarantee the health of future generations beyond it.

474
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:54,200
Or it should not be used as part of public health programs to eliminate genetic diseases from the general population,

475
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:59,930
which could cause stereotyping and discrimination of people.

476
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:08,290
And so actually this was discussed by Joseph Shulman, who is the head of the Genetics and IVF Institute,

477
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:18,189
and he said that possibly we could use germline gene therapy to eliminate Huntington's disease to all future progeny,

478
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:20,500
basically throughout the population.

479
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:31,360
But the question whether that can can actually be done, whether it's feasible, but also it would take a long time.

480
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:40,540
And many people still have Huntington's disease and they could also have neurologic disorder, degenerative disorders like Huntington's disease.

481
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,460
It could be stigmatizing.

482
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:57,220
And certainly you don't want to use germline gene therapy in ways that the just said the child to be in the progeny to follow would disagree with.

483
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:05,560
Well, finally, we get to something that perhaps you've been waiting for, and that is the issue of gene enhancement.

484
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:15,040
So gene enhancement is enhancement of the overall characteristics or traits, physical, mental, behavioral of a person.

485
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:21,160
And this contrast with medical or therapy, she accuses gene therapy.

486
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:25,600
There are plenty of conventional examples of enhancement,

487
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:33,970
such as the use of of hormones for short stature, and there is temporary athletic enhancement.

488
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:39,910
Sports commissioners have talked quite a bit about this, especially Olympic commissions,

489
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:52,930
and you have penalties that are levied and then there's enhancement with compounds to enhance short term cognitive ability.

490
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:58,750
I'm wondering if the if I agree to you that I drink this morning would fit into that category.

491
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:04,900
And then there's enhancement by way of something that you discussed in the middle,

492
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:15,280
which is it could be applied for purposes of one's gender or also short of that for cosmetic purposes.

493
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:25,210
And then you simply have dental enhancement. And finally, we have bariatric surgery to take off weight, which is something that you see on TV.

494
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:31,329
And then there are high tech examples, for example, enhancement to improve intelligence.

495
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:38,950
And this has been done in mice so that they navigate a maze a lot quicker or to permanently

496
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:45,280
enhance athletic ability to guarantee that an individual they have the right acts,

497
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:52,270
see one or active genes which allow them to have a higher ratio of fast twitch muscles.

498
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:56,650
And this obviously is done at the very earliest stages.

499
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:00,729
And then it's even been suggested that ironically,

500
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:08,560
that gene enhancement could be used to improve moral reasoning, which seems a little bit like an oxymoron to me.

501
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:22,000
But. So in October of 2018, reports emerged of twins Lulu and Nana, and they were also born in China.

502
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:30,630
And they had a so-called deletion of the CF r five gene before birth.

503
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:39,660
And the goal was to make the girls immune to infection by HIV by altering the CC five gene.

504
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:48,360
One effect that's been note of noted of altering 65 genes in mice is that it

505
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:55,320
does seem to alter to improve their ability to engage in navigation of mazes.

506
01:04:55,740 --> 01:05:03,450
So the ccr5 gene is somehow indirectly linked with certain basic cognitive skills.

507
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:14,370
So this form of gene enhancement was very controversial and obviously there were shortcomings in informed consent that were performed for this.

508
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:18,720
Just like there were in the Jessica L single case.

509
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:23,700
And then I would say that though,

510
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:35,339
many in many instances somatic cell or germline gene therapy confused could be used for enhancement in most of the trials,

511
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:43,650
since you have to make a change in the entire person that germline gene therapy is what will initially be used for enhancement purposes.

512
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:51,870
Now, of course, there is a random of suggestions of why we should use genetic enhancement.

513
01:05:52,140 --> 01:06:00,330
And the funny thing is that for the various arguments, every argument that you can mount, there's also a counter argument.

514
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:08,730
Question we could ask is how can we draw the line between disease prevention and human enhancement?

515
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:20,180
Two Subquestion is what policy should be instituted for mitochondrial gene therapy and for CRISPR Cas9 gene editing.

516
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:26,420
So I think you're tackling the mitochondrial gene therapy question fairly well.

517
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:42,650
What about CRISPR Cas9? It's so gene editing and so that can be used for an either somatic cell purposes or for a germ line purposes.

518
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:49,580
And certainly there's always been a lot of controversy for germline gene therapy.

519
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:56,180
So there are the issues, the controversies, and then there's what can be done about them.

520
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:03,920
So what do you suggest should be done about CRISPR Cas9 or should be done?

521
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:19,730
And you've sort of come out with a few of these already. Okay.

522
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:27,920
What are some problems if we if we try to create a policy in this area?

523
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:36,410
Do you think that maybe, maybe having a ban on CRISPR Cas9 would be effective?

524
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:47,879
Yes. I just want to say that I think that implementing policies right now is difficult

525
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:52,510
because there's so much that's changing and being discovered with gene therapy.

526
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:59,939
So implementing a policy now is difficult because I feel like that there's going to be new discoveries and new languages and everything.

527
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:03,740
So I don't know. That's interesting.

528
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:13,590
Yeah. Yeah. So there is a distinction, say, between CRISPR Cas9 used for research and it used for actually application.

529
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:18,030
And then in terms of application, there's the question of what kind,

530
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:27,120
because Monsanto is already busy in this area and obviously Florida has some has released the mosquitoes.

531
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:38,840
But then there's human applications. And so I mentioned that there are trials that are happening worldwide, but those are trials.

532
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:42,710
And then there's taking a trial and then mainstreaming the results.

533
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:45,740
So you're saying that that's a different matter? Yeah.

534
01:08:45,890 --> 01:09:01,850
Yeah. If we were to move in the direction of actually applied CRISPR Cas9 outside of the trial environment size of commissioner,

535
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:05,180
what scope of commission should make that kind of decision?

536
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:21,640
Should it be just a couple of scientists at the University of Pennsylvania.

537
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:27,520
Your opinion? I think you're going to need almost maybe in an international committee,

538
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:36,610
because this technology and this research will probably spread internationally like other countries are going to want to do it, too.

539
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:44,530
But I also think that if it becomes a matter of maybe privatizing or expanding this, that, you know, you mainstream it.

540
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:48,030
I also think corporations are just going to do whatever they want anyways to it.

541
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:58,120
It almost doesn't. It's difficult because I don't know how much regulation they'll be able to implement.

542
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:02,830
Yeah, you make a very good point is that first of all,

543
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:09,129
I agree with the international and I tend to use the tube of toothpaste analogy is that you

544
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:13,870
can try to construct it at a certain level and it's like hammering out a tube of toothpaste,

545
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:16,870
but then it's going to squeeze out the other end.

546
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:28,990
And so we've mentioned countless examples of varying discreet applications in other countries like China or South Korea.

547
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:37,180
And and these will occur despite the lack of informed consent in those situations,

548
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:45,250
because parents will jump on an opportunity if if they know that their future child will have that condition.

549
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,900
And yet this is something that has to be paid attention to.

550
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:53,470
So you sort of need a collective clicking of heads at the international level.

551
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:58,510
But I like how you sort of countered yourself and you said, well then what about companies?

552
01:10:58,510 --> 01:11:07,390
Because a companies have their own EIR views and those are different than higher fees we might have here at the University of Michigan,

553
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:15,219
a University of Michigan I IRBs. We depend upon a lot of money from the National Institutes of Health.

554
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:21,520
So we have to very much pay attention to NIH regulations and rules.

555
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:25,660
But what about what about the companies, though?

556
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:33,850
So they don't they don't have to pay attention to the same sets of rules, possibly.

557
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:44,400
But then I our company when you say that companies are subject to federal agencies.

558
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:49,980
Yes. I think it depends if they're private or public.

559
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,800
So, I don't know. It's complicated.

560
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:09,030
Yeah. Public or private. Right. Because if they're public, there can be a degree of oversight if the private is simply the board.

561
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:12,750
Like the stock board that's behind the company. Uh huh.

562
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:20,730
But if they're public, then you can have any number of individuals weighing in on what direction, what directions they take.

563
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:26,520
Mm hmm. But a good example of that might be environmental concerns.

564
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:36,840
And so the oil companies and and you have shareholders and people from the outside saying that I have to be careful about the next move,

565
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:40,620
which is if it's an oil company. Mm hmm.

566
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:51,780
I have another found mine, but please go ahead. Yeah, I feel like they have oversight, but, like, the lack of policy or, like, specific regulations,

567
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:56,370
like the companies can, like, prove with their own methods that things are safe and kind of,

568
01:12:56,370 --> 01:13:01,350
like, work around like the regulation system that way just because there aren't like

569
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:06,270
set standards that there are for like institutions getting federal dollars.

570
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:12,389
So I feel like there's like it's still pretty easy for them to work around the rules.

571
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:17,250
And so like setting more strict standards for something like this is unnecessary.

572
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:24,660
Mhm. Yeah, you're right. They have their own set standards and some of them are very secretive.

573
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:38,970
Mhm. So and they don't disclose much and, and the idea is to, to produce the product and yet I would argue that there is some regulation for them,

574
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:46,950
you know, especially you can think of like a new medical device and that has to go through the FDA.

575
01:13:48,000 --> 01:14:03,120
So new sorts of applications do have to be approved by the FDA at the start of all the trials can be a lot more lax.

576
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:09,540
Well, eventually it's going to catch up with them, because if they're going to mainstream one of these developments,

577
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:13,890
then it does have to go under the guise of of FDA.

578
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:24,400
Yes, I totally echoed the sentiment of strict regulation, but I think that's very idealized.

579
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:31,930
And there's some things even now that should be strictly regulated or are said to be and are not.

580
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:38,379
And the first thing I thought of was like different things that are in our food, like processed things,

581
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:48,100
different chemicals like dyes and like artificial sugars, things that are like known carcinogens that are still allowed to be in our food.

582
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:51,879
But we were talking about this in another one of my classes as well,

583
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:58,450
about different classmates sharing experiences abroad and how their food is specifically labeled

584
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:04,330
when these things are in them and it's more strictly regulated overseas than it is here.

585
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:10,870
So why would that change with something like this, especially when there's such a profit to be made?

586
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:14,469
And that's why things in our food haven't changed either.

587
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:22,420
It's because it costs too much for companies to perhaps substitute that out for something that is better for us.

588
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:27,520
And they market the whole fake health foods and profit off of that.

589
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:33,640
So why would it change with something like this where there's so much profit to be made at the expense of.

590
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:39,990
You know, strict regulations, I guess in the U.S.,

591
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:45,120
the regulation of fluids is not as strict as it could be, especially compared to European countries.

592
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:54,300
The U.S., every once in a while comes out with a chart about how much how much meat, how much dairy should go into your diet.

593
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:59,400
And it's and the one here, it's it's very general.

594
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:03,960
It doesn't say anything about what goes on the label of the food.

595
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:15,600
On the other hand, it's I mean, I've heard that USDA is is a little bit influenced by the industry.

596
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:25,020
It could be that the differences between industry and government agencies are not as airtight as we as we hope.

597
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:32,850
Although one would hope that in areas like gene editing,

598
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:43,860
that the government would would be very responsible in allowing a particular trial from a particular institution to go through.

599
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:51,290
I think in the case of University of Pennsylvania, of that institution had a lot of momentum.

600
01:16:51,310 --> 01:17:02,600
You the government was lax and they went by reputation and unfortunately and and my attorney didn't place didn't take place like like it could have.

601
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:10,560
And so monitoring really doesn't take place very heavily in terms of in terms of food labels.

602
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:21,150
And sure, we depend upon federal agencies, but they're not always everything they would be would help them to do.

603
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:33,660
Are they. Does the public have a role in saying anything about the technologies that go forward that jump from,

604
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:38,610
say, the research stage into the mainstream application stage?

605
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,550
What's your opinion or have you heard any examples of public involvement?

606
01:17:55,670 --> 01:18:02,120
Yes. Yes. No, I don't think the public really has much of a say either.

607
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:13,130
People don't know about it or sorry, or they don't care enough to voice their opinion about it, like about these topics.

608
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:21,080
So I just don't really know. Mm hmm. Yeah, it's true that the word always doesn't get out.

609
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:25,760
In the case of the Florida mosquito release,

610
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:35,180
that actually took ten years of discussion and and a lot of it had to do with the experts weighing in and holding up.

611
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:42,080
But individuals in the Florida Keys also reported in their opinions.

612
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:50,480
And one way to do this is is I know it's very hackneyed, but to let your legislators know,

613
01:18:54,080 --> 01:19:01,370
Debbie Dingell, for example, she has town halls about three times a year.

614
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:10,730
I get this deep on my cell phone and all of a sudden she's on and a lot of other people somehow cut out of her emailing list.

615
01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:18,890
You know, if you click, you can actually make a comment. I made a comment about water pollution in southeast Michigan.

616
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:22,700
So you had this dump page that went into the Huron River,

617
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:30,860
and I was delighted that she actually responded to that for about 10 minutes over this phone town hall,

618
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:40,820
because it's something that she looked into, especially with the Joe Miller streaming, which is something that's been occurring for years and years.

619
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:46,070
It's a general way of of having your voice.

620
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:54,560
In the past, there have actually been public dialogs that have been designed when a technology comes out.

621
01:19:55,130 --> 01:20:03,260
So I've been a part of the genome technology and reproduction values and public policy dialogs that took place in Detroit,

622
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:08,180
as well as Saginaw and Grand Rapids.

623
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:14,360
So these dialogs occurred about 15 years ago,

624
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:22,430
and we were able to gather public input and things like preimplantation genetic diagnosis and what it should be used for.

625
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:34,060
And then we actually had a meeting after all was said and done in Lansing and made sure that legislative aides were present,

626
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:36,620
that there were press kids that were handed out.

627
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:47,420
Another way of the public having its say, I don't know that those kinds of dialogs are being held for mitochondrial gene therapy,

628
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:52,430
but it's not such not such a bad idea with something.

629
01:20:52,610 --> 01:21:00,710
And if you can kick something in the bud right before the technology goes mainstream, that would be the ideal.

630
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:05,570
Well, I've appreciated talking with all of you and discussing these technologies.

631
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:09,470
Who knows what the next five years for us take care of, but.
