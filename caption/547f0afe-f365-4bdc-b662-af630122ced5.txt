00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,380
All right, Melissa. So which path towards anti-racist teaching should we start with?

2
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:37,750
Hmm. I think we need to start with the question of what is at stake for us as teachers, for our professional fields, and for health overall.

3
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,760
Yeah, good idea. It's important to dig into the why of anti-racist teaching.

4
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,070
What happens if we don't work towards that goal? And what can happen if we do. Down this path,

5
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,739
we'll hear from a wide variety of leading public health experts on how racism functions in public health and

6
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:59,650
what that means for all of us as educators and facilitators. To help us get a foundational understanding,

7
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,270
we've asked Dr. Whitney Peoples to introduce her six guiding anti-racist teaching principles.

8
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,540
These principles inform reflection and self-critique throughout all aspects of anti-racist teaching and training.

9
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:16,690
We'll build on these ideas to talk about how social identity is related to our work around anti-racist teaching.

10
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,640
How do we think about who we are?

11
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:25,960
Our lived experiences and the identities and experiences of our students as we create an anti-racist pedagogy for ourselves.

12
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,350
Such an important perspective. And down this path,

13
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:36,670
there are some foundational readings on the role of racism and health and definitions of anti-racist teaching that will really help ground us.

14
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,370
Excellent. Should we get moving? Let's do it.
