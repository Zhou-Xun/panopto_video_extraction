1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,910
In today's session for HMP600, The Health Services System.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:14,006
We are going to be talking about the period of the 1940s to the early 1960s,

3
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:20,035
looking at a brief history of financing health care in the US.

4
00:00:20,035 --> 00:00:24,438
Our goals and objectives for this session are to continue to

5
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:28,676
describe the history of paying for health care in the US.

6
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:34,892
Describe the evolution of health insurance during and after World War II.

7
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:39,774
And why the United States is sometimes called at the accidental system or

8
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:43,709
health insurance system is called an accidental system.

9
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:49,217
And we'll explain some of the connections between this period of time, this

10
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:54,568
early history and the current structure of healthcare services in the US.

11
00:00:54,568 --> 00:00:59,523
And before we look back at this period of the 40s to the 60s,

12
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:05,993
it's sometimes helpful to remind ourselves of what the system looks like today.

13
00:01:05,993 --> 00:01:10,203
So we can connect today's structure with the past,

14
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:14,987
the actions that occurred during this period of the 40s to

15
00:01:14,987 --> 00:01:19,591
the early 60's and what it means for our system today.

16
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:24,618
So, we aren't going to talk in depth during this session about this

17
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:29,572
overview of the structure of financing in our health care system.

18
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:34,001
Other than to recognize that we have in the US,

19
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:38,214
what's called a third party payer system.

20
00:01:38,214 --> 00:01:44,828
Which means that health care services that are delivered by

21
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:49,988
health care providers to patients are paid for

22
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:55,291
by a third party, a set of insurers and payers.

23
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:59,941
And that structure is evolving over

24
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:04,439
the period of the 20th century.

25
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,209
In fact, if we begin our session today thinking about

26
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:16,380
the way the health financing system looked in 1930.

27
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,337
We can see that we already had the basic infrastructure

28
00:02:21,337 --> 00:02:26,294
of this third party payer system in which Blue Cross and

29
00:02:26,294 --> 00:02:31,700
Blue Shield insurance were established during the 30s.

30
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:37,082
And were in place as a payment infrastructure even though

31
00:02:37,082 --> 00:02:43,696
most people were not insured by this third party as of the 1930s but

32
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:48,085
that model that infrastructure was in place.

33
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:53,323
Most people who received health care services paid

34
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:58,801
directly out of pocket in a direct exchange of a fee for

35
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:03,428
service, the patient went to the provider,

36
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:08,450
got care, paid the bill for the care delivered.

37
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,325
So let's now think about the 1940s,

38
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:19,200
US health insurance becomes embedded in employment during this period.

39
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,728
And this came about sort of as a consequence of World War II,

40
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:30,147
as some people describe it as an accident of World War II and

41
00:03:30,147 --> 00:03:35,468
why the US is now sometimes called an accidental system.

42
00:03:35,468 --> 00:03:40,004
So this accident was because during World War II in

43
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:45,188
the United States, private employers faced wage caps,

44
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:49,943
which was a freeze on employees wages and salaries.

45
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:55,141
The government did this because they didn't want private companies to compete

46
00:03:55,141 --> 00:03:59,810
too strongly and pull workers away from the war producing industries.

47
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,155
So the industries that the government was using to

48
00:04:04,155 --> 00:04:09,130
produce airplanes and soldier uniforms etc for the war.

49
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,765
So private companies could not raise their

50
00:04:13,765 --> 00:04:18,276
salaries in order to attract employees.

51
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:23,082
However, employee benefits such as pensions or

52
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:27,895
funeral benefits were not subject to a wage cap.

53
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:35,046
So many companies started to offer these benefits in order to attract workers and

54
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:40,094
one of the benefits, in addition to things like pensions

55
00:04:40,094 --> 00:04:44,947
that employers started to offer is health insurance.

56
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:51,032
The government actually helped incentivize employers offering health

57
00:04:51,032 --> 00:04:57,625
insurance to their employees as a benefit through a number of tax incentives.

58
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:02,831
So employers who funded health insurance for

59
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:07,626
their employees could deduct the costs of

60
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:12,431
that health insurance from their taxes.

61
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:17,408
And in addition to that, the federal government also allowed

62
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:21,917
that any employee contributions to health insurance.

63
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:27,221
For example, money taken out of an employee's paycheck to go

64
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:34,060
towards the premium for that health insurance would be considered tax exempt.

65
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,878
So that could be removed from the employees paycheck

66
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:44,141
before taxes were levied against those wages or salary.

67
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:50,200
So in this way, this incentive, this,

68
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,903
action taken as a result of World War II

69
00:05:55,903 --> 00:06:01,072
began to embed health insurance in

70
00:06:01,072 --> 00:06:06,256
employment in the United States.

71
00:06:06,256 --> 00:06:13,599
So what the result of that was, is the number of people who had health insurance.

72
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:20,142
So prior to the war, about 1.4 million people were enrolled in Blue Cross and

73
00:06:20,142 --> 00:06:26,308
Blue Shield, which was the primary type of health insurance at this time.

74
00:06:26,308 --> 00:06:30,379
We talked about the rise of Blue Cross and

75
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:39,627
Blue Shield in the lecture on the Health Care Financing History from 1900 to 1930.

76
00:06:39,627 --> 00:06:46,773
So prior to the war 1.4 million Blue Cross and Blue Shield enrollees after the war.

77
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:51,657
By 1951, 60 million people have some type of

78
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:56,769
health insurance, both Blue Cross and Blue Shield,

79
00:06:56,769 --> 00:07:01,330
but also some other types of health insurance.

80
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:06,558
And what this means is, what insurance companies saw this as

81
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:11,694
meaning is we now have a broad market for health insurance.

82
00:07:11,694 --> 00:07:17,169
And so commercial insurance companies started to move rapidly

83
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:22,127
into this area of the market to offer health insurance and

84
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:27,618
compete with Blue Cross and Blue Shield type insurance plans.

85
00:07:27,618 --> 00:07:33,316
Now this rise in the commercial for profit indemnity

86
00:07:33,316 --> 00:07:38,509
insurance also led to a number of innovations.

87
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:43,370
Before I talk about those, I'll just define the term indemnity insurance is

88
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,300
really just another way of saying insurance.

89
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:52,099
It's insuring against some future risk or need.

90
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:55,432
But the commercial indemnity insurance, which were for

91
00:07:55,432 --> 00:07:58,564
profit companies, many of which still exist today.

92
00:07:58,564 --> 00:08:03,401
That Aetna's the Cigna's etc.

93
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:08,313
They started to offer individual plans insurance plans as

94
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:13,236
well as insurance plans to employer groups to companies.

95
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:19,819
So that led to the growth and an individual health insurance market.

96
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:25,615
So individuals who might not have access to health insurance through their

97
00:08:25,615 --> 00:08:31,329
employer could purchase an individual plan from one of these companies.

98
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:38,974
Another innovation that these companies introduced is experience rated premiums.

99
00:08:38,974 --> 00:08:43,731
And this means that the risk that

100
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:48,135
is used to evaluate the cost of

101
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:52,899
the premium for the insurance.

102
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:57,042
The estimation and calculation of the risk is now

103
00:08:57,042 --> 00:09:01,288
evaluated using individual characteristics and

104
00:09:01,288 --> 00:09:06,553
conditions of the the individual who's seeking insurance.

105
00:09:06,553 --> 00:09:11,533
Or the individual characteristics of the individual

106
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:15,520
employer group who is seeking insurance.

107
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:21,633
This compares to the community rated premiums that were used by Blue Cross and

108
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:24,653
Blue Shield when it was established.

109
00:09:24,653 --> 00:09:30,610
And you may recall from the lecture on the history

110
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:36,862
of financing in the US from 1900 to 1930s.

111
00:09:36,862 --> 00:09:43,379
A community rated premium means that everyone in the pool,

112
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:48,084
the insurance pool pays the same premium.

113
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:52,928
So their individual health characteristics or conditions do not

114
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:57,956
influence the level of risk and therefore the level of the premium.

115
00:09:57,956 --> 00:10:03,741
Everyone in the pool, the entire pool is evaluated for risk and

116
00:10:03,741 --> 00:10:11,286
then everyone pays the premium based on that average risk across the entire pool.

117
00:10:11,286 --> 00:10:16,409
And Blue Cross and Blue Shield pools had individual companies in them, but

118
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:22,263
they were making their risk pools based on typically the state that they operated in,

119
00:10:22,263 --> 00:10:23,578
such as Michigan.

120
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:29,002
So with experience rated premiums, commercial insurance

121
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:34,323
companies could then evaluate different levels of risk.

122
00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:39,075
And so healthier people could get lower premiums because their risk of

123
00:10:39,075 --> 00:10:41,902
needing health services would be lower.

124
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:45,952
So this was an incentive for people or

125
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:51,970
certain companies to seek out those insurance plans.

126
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:58,854
But what experience rated premiums mean is that sicker people or

127
00:10:58,854 --> 00:11:03,953
employer groups that have higher risk would pay

128
00:11:03,953 --> 00:11:10,974
higher premiums because of the risk of needing health services.

129
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:15,706
And so for example, outside of the individual

130
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:20,203
market in the employer-sponsored plans.

131
00:11:20,203 --> 00:11:25,391
If you had a company say an IBM compared

132
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:32,863
to a company like a coal mining company, for example.

133
00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:37,983
The evaluated risk for the employees needing health services and

134
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:42,088
those two companies is going to be quite different.

135
00:11:42,088 --> 00:11:47,897
A coal mining companies, employees is going to be at much higher risk of injury.

136
00:11:47,897 --> 00:11:52,749
And other kinds of health consequences of their employment

137
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:57,806
compared to a more white collar company like IBM for example.

138
00:11:57,806 --> 00:12:01,660
And so the premiums that would be charged for

139
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,765
health insurance to IBM would be lower based on experience

140
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:11,470
rated premiums compared to the coal mining company.

141
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:16,533
So you can see some advantages there and that an incentive for

142
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:20,505
healthier people to start buying insurance and

143
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:27,564
companies to offer insurance if they could get lower premiums for their employees.

144
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:31,572
But also a complication now, a challenge and

145
00:12:31,572 --> 00:12:35,370
that sicker people would now be expected to

146
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:40,344
pay higher premiums in order to have health insurance.

147
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:41,562
And finally, one more innovation that the commercial insurance companies introduced

148
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:42,425
were exclusions of coverage for pre-existing conditions.

149
00:12:42,425 --> 00:12:47,409
This didn't happen immediately

150
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:51,859
in this period of the 40s and

151
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:57,199
50s, but started to evolve later

152
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:01,830
in the early 60s and beyond.

153
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:06,981
In which a commercial insurance company would offer health insurance,

154
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:10,370
say to an individual on the individual market.

155
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:15,280
And if this individual came to the individual market with pre-existing

156
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,057
diabetes, for example.

157
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:21,391
The insurer might say, okay we're gonna experience rate you

158
00:13:21,391 --> 00:13:25,985
we're gonna offer you this premium for you to own the insurance.

159
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:28,949
And we will provide insurance coverage for

160
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:34,394
your health care service needs except for anything related to your diabetes.

161
00:13:34,394 --> 00:13:39,643
Because that is a pre-existing condition that existed prior to you

162
00:13:39,643 --> 00:13:46,190
having health insurance and so we will not cover the health needs of that condition.

163
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:53,329
So this in some ways allows the insurance company to keep the premium lower.

164
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:58,429
But what it did was exclude the actual health condition that

165
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:03,131
patients had from being covered by health insurance.

166
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:08,172
That issue as you are probably familiar with

167
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:12,668
stays part of the US health insurance up

168
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:17,719
until the affordable care Act in 2012.

169
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:21,546
So we'll talk about it when we talk about 2012.

170
00:14:21,546 --> 00:14:26,497
But just to summarize now what the US financing of healthcare

171
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:31,752
services looks like by the 1950s up to the early 1960s.

172
00:14:31,752 --> 00:14:38,328
We have pretty much the same third party system that we saw by the 1930s,

173
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:43,281
in which we have this basic third party payer structure.

174
00:14:43,281 --> 00:14:48,689
But now, in addition to Blue Cross and Blue Shield as a payer,

175
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:54,305
we now have commercial insurance for profit companies offering

176
00:14:54,305 --> 00:14:59,616
health insurance to both individuals and employer groups.

177
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:05,758
And,, offering and changing the industry by introducing a number of innovations,

178
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:11,569
like experience rated premiums and exclusions for pre-existing conditions.

179
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:17,263
That's the end of our discussion of the period 1942, the early 1960s.
