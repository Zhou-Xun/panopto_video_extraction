1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,470
Alison Mondul: hey guys alright so let's go ahead and go over this one.

2
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:14,790
Alison Mondul: So really the idea behind this was trying to kind of integrate a lot of what we talked about yesterday and think through.

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:27,300
Alison Mondul: You know causality okay so after visiting your parents your mother knows that you've been drinking a lot of black tea and she tells you, you should cut back to know more than one cup per day since caffeine is bad for your health.

4
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:43,170
Alison Mondul: I hate to tell you that it doesn't matter if you are a PhD level epidemiologist is a tenured professor and has lots of publications your mom will still try to tell you about news articles that she RAD until you things that you're supposed to do and you're like.

5
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,800
Alison Mondul: I know more about that thing up can't say that.

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:58,080
Alison Mondul: So anyway to prove her wrong and to justify your love of hot beverages you do a search and find evidence that tea drinkers have a lower risk of type two diabetes and before you go back to your mother with your findings.

7
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:06,690
Alison Mondul: you decide to think carefully about the various lines of evidence, to see if the data really support a causal interpretation because there's no one who's harder to convince then your mom.

8
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:16,350
Alison Mondul: Alright, so compose a plausible biological argument as to why it would be protected against type two diabetes and you might want to use online resources to be creative.

9
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,830
Alison Mondul: So there's a few here i'm curious what you guys came up with does anyone on a tell me what their group discussed which guys came up with for this one.

10
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,110
Nolaundron Harris: Oh no we said.

11
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:33,240
Nolaundron Harris: I just did a search for you, because it's, then you may want to use online resources, so we just found a.

12
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,030
Nolaundron Harris: cohort study.

13
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,060
Nolaundron Harris: That looked at.

14
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:50,520
Nolaundron Harris: Oh, my God help me what is wrong with okay there we go, we looked at COPD cohort study that looked at drinking certainties, and how they have like.

15
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,290
Nolaundron Harris: Anti oxidative I mean I have blah blah blah properties and they also have my blood sugar reducing.

16
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,930
Nolaundron Harris: properties as well.

17
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,620
Nolaundron Harris: yeah you pulled up a medical paper for that.

18
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,030
perfect.

19
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,430
Alison Mondul: Anybody come up with something different.

20
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,740
Alison Mondul: yeah so there's lots of biological plausibility here right we're definitely meeting that that criteria of of our good friend hill.

21
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:27,810
Alison Mondul: um and so number two you identified a published ecological study that compared prevalent diabetes and black tea consumption in 50 countries.

22
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:36,000
Alison Mondul: So Figure three shown below for the paper illustrates the key finding, which suggests that there's a lower type two diabetes prevalence and countries with greater tea consumption okay.

23
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:48,210
Alison Mondul: And figure one shows T consumption by country so comment on the strength of the argument for causality made by the study and explain your reasoning and note which, if any of his criteria are met by this study So what do you guys think.

24
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,010
Alison Mondul: Anybody want to volunteer or shall I call on groups.

25
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:15,060
Zoe Gurney: um my group number two said that because this isn't ecological study we can't really say you can't say for sure if people drinking tea, are the ones who do or do not have type two diabetes, because it's ecological study we keep in terms of like hills criteria, my group said that.

26
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:29,700
Zoe Gurney: As discussed in the first question, there is biologic possibility and based on the figure we said that there was like potential dose response relationship, because the figure indicated that increasing consumption.

27
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:39,480
Zoe Gurney: Like may suggest inverse relationship with prevalence of diabetes, but besides that we didn't say that the criteria was met.

28
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,690
Alison Mondul: Great does anybody have anything else.

29
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,240
Alison Mondul: All right.

30
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,120
Alison Mondul: exactly right okay.

31
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,010
Alison Mondul: that's exactly what the what the key says so good job.

32
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:08,880
Alison Mondul: Alright, so next you find a study of type two diabetes and T consumption that was conducted using information for the women's health stowed, which is a prospective cohort study.

33
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:20,370
Alison Mondul: So we're getting a much better study design here embedded within a randomized control trial evaluating the impact of low dose aspirin and vitamin D on cardiovascular disease, so does everybody understand what that means.

34
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,530
Alison Mondul: That this is a.

35
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,220
Alison Mondul: Cobra study embedded within a randomized control trial.

36
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:38,070
Alison Mondul: So, essentially, this was a randomized control trial, where they randomize people to ask for an invite the money right, and they were following them for impacts on cardiovascular disease, but.

37
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:49,920
Alison Mondul: There they have all of these people they collected, a lot of other information from them when they enrolled in the trial right, and so the collected information on all kinds of other exposures that they are self selecting right.

38
00:04:50,790 --> 00:05:06,690
Alison Mondul: And they've got their cardiovascular disease outcomes and also other outcomes that might be of interest rate over time, so if you're looking at any any potential factor as an exposure, that is not what they were randomized to that is now a covert study.

39
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:09,870
Alison Mondul: Does that make sense.

40
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:21,210
Alison Mondul: So if you're looking at the aspirin or vitamin E, this is a randomized trial because they were randomized those exposures, but if you ask them about their exercise on a baseline questionnaire.

41
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:27,360
Alison Mondul: When you randomize them and then you look at exercise and cardiovascular disease now it's a it's a cohort study.

42
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,560
Alison Mondul: Because you didn't randomize them to exercise.

43
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:49,530
Alison Mondul: But you're still prospect you're still asking them before they have the disease and following them over time, to see if they got it okay so lots of trial data has been used as cohort data for any exposure that's not the trial randomized exposure i'm makes sense.

44
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,320
Alison Mondul: OK.

45
00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:05,400
Alison Mondul: So the women's health study self reporting T consumption was collected a baseline and type two diabetes was self reported over the follow up period and people personal information was also collected about other individual risk factors for type two diabetes.

46
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:14,670
Alison Mondul: So you're asked to list three characteristics of the state that make a stronger design, obviously, the fact that it's a prospective cohort study means you've got temporality right.

47
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,210
Alison Mondul: you've got individual level data that's not you know it's not group level data like an ecological study.

48
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:31,140
Alison Mondul: And you've got lots of other characters lots of other personal information, so you can assess, you can adjust for potential confounders right, you can address, confounding by those things.

49
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,710
Alison Mondul: Did anybody have anything else.

50
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,940
Nolaundron Harris: We kind of said that.

51
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:51,180
Nolaundron Harris: What was it that the follow up was nice because you're able to ask questions right then in there in some people's information could have changed so they're type two diabetes.

52
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,670
Nolaundron Harris: Diabetes could have changed your exercise or something that happened throughout the course so.

53
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,660
Alison Mondul: yeah usually you're more interested in once somebody gets the outcome they're considered to have had it.

54
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:15,030
Alison Mondul: Like well I guess you could go back to not having the outcome of going back to being at risk, I think, for most people once you get affected by diabetes, even if it's managed well.

55
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:23,130
Alison Mondul: you're still considered to have it, so I don't think they move people back and forth like that, with the outcome, but certainly T consumption could change over time.

56
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,410
Alison Mondul: Right and they can certainly.

57
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,420
Alison Mondul: address that right, they can get that information and an updated way yeah definitely.

58
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,220
Alison Mondul: I see something in the chat sorry go see what that is.

59
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,580
Alison Mondul: Oh okay um all right.

60
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:52,170
Alison Mondul: So number four now we've got this table that illustrates the study findings with respect to T consumption.

61
00:07:53,370 --> 00:08:02,910
Alison Mondul: Looking at the relative risk estimates comment on whether there is compelling evidence of relationship between T consumption and infant diabetes and if there is a relationship could be due to chance so.

62
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:14,970
Alison Mondul: I want to just orient everybody the table here we have the lowest category of tea intake, and this is the highest so in which category would you expect the strongest association.

63
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,150
Alison Mondul: Particularly if there's a dose response.

64
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:20,970
Sarah Ferri: The fourth.

65
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:30,450
Alison Mondul: The fourth exactly right Okay, so if there were a dose response you would want this to like kind of March down nicely over the over the categories.

66
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:37,710
Alison Mondul: And so we're comparing each of these were comparing the second to the first, the third to the first and the fourth to the first okay.

67
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:48,270
Alison Mondul: Here we have what they're calling it's not really a crude model, but as it is there a beast adjusted model it's adjusted for age and energy intake you guys know where they're adjusting for energy intake.

68
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,160
Nolaundron Harris: Just something.

69
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,030
Alison Mondul: Sorry go ahead.

70
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:10,410
Alison Mondul: i'm partly but it's it's um it's more about like if I eat 2000 calories a day, and someone else eats 3000 calories a day which one of us is going, even if we kind of have the same.

71
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,540
Alison Mondul: Composition of our diet.

72
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,010
Alison Mondul: Which one of us is going to like.

73
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,660
Alison Mondul: eat more protein.

74
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:30,390
Alison Mondul: The person eating 3000 calories a day so it's kind of normalizing to the amount you eat it's almost saying like per how much you consume how much of this thing, are you does that make sense.

75
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:38,130
Alison Mondul: So most dietary analyses will in some way adjust for energy intake when you're looking at nutrients or foods.

76
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,390
Alison Mondul: um okay so.

77
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:51,930
Alison Mondul: So this is sort of their baseline right because most chronic disease analyses are never going to present I never present it a truly crude.

78
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:59,790
Alison Mondul: result in my tables it just doesn't make sense for cancer like Why would you why would you ever present a cancer result not adjusted for age.

79
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:13,770
Alison Mondul: Right it's it's almost meaningless, we know age is a risk factor it's always going to be confounded by age, if you don't adjust for it, so we always do right so that's like the least adjusted the most crude but we usually present as as justin.

80
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:30,360
Alison Mondul: Okay, and so, then they have multi variable model to where they add all of these different things in and then multi variable model three where they further add in more things okay So what did you guys think was there compelling evidence of a relationship.

81
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:46,680
Will Brodwater: We kind of set up the trend with relationship, but since you don't need to do anything that begins, you can say that your relationship doesn't.

82
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,390
Alison Mondul: Because it's not statistically significant.

83
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,790
Will Brodwater: yeah none of your all of your competence intervals include one is a critical point.

84
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:00,930
Alison Mondul: yeah so.

85
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,880
Will Brodwater: Much here, but not quite.

86
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:07,710
Alison Mondul: Like how by how I mean, do you really feel comfortable being like nope nothing there.

87
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,170
Will Brodwater: No, I mean that's why I think you could say there's a trend towards towards that yeah.

88
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,880
Alison Mondul: or a suggestive association.

89
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,580
Alison Mondul: yeah.

90
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:29,400
Alison Mondul: This is again where like we don't want to just dismiss this because it's really close right and this paper trend is quite close, but if you're right, it could be due to chance.

91
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:38,040
Alison Mondul: Okay The other thing to note here is that there's really not a dose response it's only in this highest category that it shows up it's kind of like normal and then.

92
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:47,700
Alison Mondul: Once you adjust for confounders boom you see this only in the highest category, it could be a threshold right that could be real but um it makes us wonder.

93
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,530
Alison Mondul: Okay.

94
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,400
Alison Mondul: Oh right.

95
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,480
Alison Mondul: Any other thoughts on that.

96
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:12,780
Alison Mondul: Alright, so looking carefully table through you know that the auditor's report associations adjusted for various factors in their statistical model, so this approach, like stratification is used to control for confounding by including the confounding factors.

97
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:22,950
Alison Mondul: In a multi variable regression model so reviewing the table, do you see evidence of confounding of the crude for people drinking more than four cups of tea a day as compared to know tea.

98
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:35,580
Alison Mondul: So I had a question from one of the groups here, what are you going to compare here, so this is essentially your crude it's not really crude right because it's adjusted for agent energy, but this is the crudest that you get this point nine two here.

99
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,990
Alison Mondul: And then let's just look at the model to result of point seven three.

100
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:52,650
Alison Mondul: So you're going to say i've now adjusted for all of these factors simultaneously i've taken into account, confounding by all of these factors, simultaneously, which is similar to what you're doing when you're comparing the crude to the stratum specific right.

101
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,450
Alison Mondul: stratified is one way of taking care of confounding so you're looking at those stratified.

102
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,640
Alison Mondul: Measures of association, compared to the crude to see if they're the same.

103
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:09,420
Alison Mondul: right here you're going to look at this adjusted metric compared to the crude now do you think that's different.

104
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,260
Alison Mondul: This point seven three different than point nine to.

105
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,810
Sarah Ferri: Do you think they're different.

106
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:35,190
Sarah Ferri: I mean they're different enough when we look at you between the first lowest category they're all ones.

107
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:42,360
Sarah Ferri: Like a point 922 Point seven three that's me it's about a 20% difference.

108
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:49,260
Alison Mondul: It is yeah and I didn't know I know I promised you know math, but if you do that, where you check what percent change that is it's about 20%.

109
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:53,160
Alison Mondul: So I think the bell over the 10% that we use is kind of our.

110
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,920
Alison Mondul: Lucy goosey rule.

111
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:57,960
Alison Mondul: Right.

112
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:06,540
Alison Mondul: So I think, yes, it looks like there's confounding because this adjusted measure is quite different than the less adjusted measure.

113
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,100
Okay.

114
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,720
Alison Mondul: Now I would not say that there's confounding by any of these things right.

115
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:32,310
Alison Mondul: fiber intake glycemic load magnesium or total fat, because the change from two to three is there, basically isn't one it's almost non existent right to model to model three are basically the same as each other so there's some there's definitely confounding by some or all of these variables.

116
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,890
Alison Mondul: But not by these I would say.

117
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,980
Alison Mondul: That make sense.

118
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,060
yeah.

119
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:55,710
Alison Mondul: alrighty so Question six the Association of type two diabetes with consumption of more than four cups of tea shown in table three become stronger after adjustment for BMI exercise and fiber consumption.

120
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:02,790
Alison Mondul: Given the tea drinkers tend to have lower BMI better exercise patterns and healthier diets, why does this finding seem surprising.

121
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:15,000
Alison Mondul: So I think one thing you can do here is, you could have drawn out that confounding triangle it's written out here, this was kind of confusing a couple of the groups, but if you had said.

122
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:21,990
I want to draw.

123
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:26,640
yeah.

124
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,000
Alison Mondul: But I had to draw.

125
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,140
Alison Mondul: Oh well.

126
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,240
Alison Mondul: Okay anyway um can annotate let's see.

127
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:46,320
Alison Mondul: I can annotate that's exciting okay Now I know how to do it all right, so if you have like four plus.

128
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,480
Alison Mondul: cups of tea.

129
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,120
Alison Mondul: And we're interested in the association with type two diabetes right.

130
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:07,350
Alison Mondul: And let's just take BMI, for example, right if we if we know teenagers tend to have lower BMI and better exercise right, so if this is associated with.

131
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:20,340
Alison Mondul: Lower BMI and lower BMI is associated with a lower risk of type two diabetes, if you didn't adjust her BMI with the crude be too low or too high.

132
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:31,650
Alison Mondul: you'd be taking up, including that effect of BMI right so tea drinkers have lower BMI which reduces the risk of type two diabetes.

133
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:40,380
Joshua Tucker: me closer to the know if you weren't taking into effect BMI right.

134
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,670
Joshua Tucker: He really no.

135
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:50,250
Joshua Tucker: No, no it'd be no I get what you're saying so it'd be the opposite, because it would be he would look bigger than that it actually should.

136
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,390
Alison Mondul: Should pretend that we magically know that the truth is that there's nothing here.

137
00:16:54,870 --> 00:17:05,400
Alison Mondul: pretend to truly know association with T if you don't take into account BMI and tea drinkers have lower BMI and lower BMI reduces risk of type two diabetes, you would see.

138
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:17,940
Alison Mondul: an inverse association here a protection, even if there wasn't anything so not taking into account BMI and exercise and healthier diet, should make this.

139
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,390
Alison Mondul: More protective than a truly is.

140
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:30,690
Alison Mondul: But what we see in table three is the opposite, that the unadjusted is less protective so that's weird right that feels backwards.

141
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,840
Alison Mondul: Does that make sense to everybody.

142
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,250
Sarah Ferri: I guess to my I think my one question was sixes then.

143
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:54,240
Sarah Ferri: Did you want us to describe why like what things could be happening because, like.

144
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,940
Alison Mondul: I guess my early.

145
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,340
Alison Mondul: We just wanted you to understand.

146
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,990
Alison Mondul: That reaction, the confounding should push the truth.

147
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:10,530
Sarah Ferri: Okay, that makes sense it's like I was just thinking there's potentially other factors that are absolutely needed.

148
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,330
Alison Mondul: This very.

149
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:19,290
Alison Mondul: Simple causal diagram right, you can add lots of things right.

150
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,540
Alison Mondul: You can get these really big causal diagrams and include a bazillion different things right.

151
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:38,400
Alison Mondul: I mean if we added just exercise in here exercise has a direct relationship with type two diabetes it's also associated with tea drinking.

152
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:48,960
Alison Mondul: I would say that BMI is also associated with exercise right, so you can start adding things and then you can put relationships, and this is an entire avenue of like causal.

153
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:58,500
Alison Mondul: causality and causal inference these things are called if you do those certain way they're called tags.

154
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:12,330
Alison Mondul: directed a set of the graphs and people will spend a lot of time learning about these in in higher level methods courses than this, but yeah you can start putting lots and lots and lots of things in there, to try to understand the interrelationships between multiple potential confounders.

155
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:22,290
Alison Mondul: But for this, I think we just wanted to point out that the direction that the.

156
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:35,430
Alison Mondul: Point estimate goes when you adjust for confounding feels like the wrong direction, based on what we know about the directionality of the association between tea drinking and BMI and BMI and type two diabetes.

157
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:52,980
Alison Mondul: Like being able to think through which direction would the crude be pushed if we're with the with the adjust with the crude be biased in from the truth, if we don't take into account, confounding right that's what this The point of this question was that makes sense.

158
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,280
Alison Mondul: Okay i'm gonna have to clear the drawings because they're not really on the page.

159
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,490
Alison Mondul: Okay.

160
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:12,330
Alison Mondul: So question seven says, the authors also examine associations between an antioxidant contained in T and to subclinical markers of diabetes HPA when see and insulin.

161
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,980
Alison Mondul: But found no relationship, and how does this information influence your assessment of the evidence for a causal relationship between tea and type two diabetes.

162
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:40,650
Alison Mondul: So here in the key we're saying that it makes you less likely to believe that the relationship between T and type two diabetes is causal because.

163
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:51,480
Alison Mondul: This is a more objective measure of diabetes and self report right, so you might imagine that there could be information bias in the self report that is causing some sort of.

164
00:20:52,530 --> 00:21:03,360
Alison Mondul: False association biased association, you would expect these laboratory measures to be less by less biased or have less information bias than the self report.

165
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,330
Alison Mondul: Did anybody come up with something different.

166
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,170
Nolaundron Harris: We may have been confused but.

167
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:23,550
Nolaundron Harris: I think, just the way I was standing in question five there was, confounding I would say, we would we would assume that would be in.

168
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,720
Nolaundron Harris: A relationship so if you're saying that there isn't one.

169
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,020
Nolaundron Harris: Okay, just be kind of confusing.

170
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,710
Alison Mondul: Okay well.

171
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,440
Alison Mondul: So.

172
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,520
Alison Mondul: There was, confounding by these factors right.

173
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:52,740
Alison Mondul: Just because you taken into account, confounding doesn't mean that there aren't other sources of bias right so we've adjusted here for confounding by these potential factors.

174
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,790
Alison Mondul: But this is talking about information bias.

175
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,910
Alison Mondul: In the.

176
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:05,940
Alison Mondul: assessment of the outcome by using self report, as opposed to laboratory measures right.

177
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:07,770
Nolaundron Harris: Okay okay.

178
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,370
Alison Mondul: have lots of these things going on, you could have selection bias information bias and.

179
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,810
Alison Mondul: Counting all at the same time.

180
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,960
Alison Mondul: they're not mutually exclusive.

181
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:23,220
Alison Mondul: Okay, so just because they took care of compounding doesn't mean that they don't also have some other problem right.

182
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,040
Okay, introducing automation bias.

183
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:45,660
Alison Mondul: Alright, so this is a different study, this is a European study that explored incident type two diabetes and T consumption, the following table presents the associations for consuming more than zero to.

184
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:53,430
Alison Mondul: More than zero to less than one one to less than four and more than four or more cups of tea per day, as compared to consume no teeth per day.

185
00:22:54,450 --> 00:23:08,490
Alison Mondul: So here are your categories so they've set their table up kind of the other way right the other one had the categories going across the Rose this one has been done column okay so here's your reference category you're comparing everything to know T and so.

186
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:17,370
Alison Mondul: What feature of these findings, makes the association seem more likely to be causal and so in this case they're presenting a hazard ratio.

187
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:26,730
Alison Mondul: Which is a particular measure of association that you get when you use a Cox proportional hazards model which is type of statistical model that you can use with time to event data or person time data.

188
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:32,280
Alison Mondul: don't worry too much about that you would learn about that and an upper level bio stats or methods course.

189
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:38,190
Alison Mondul: You can interpret it exactly the same way that you interpret a relative risk So if you see a hazard ratio.

190
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:47,490
Alison Mondul: You can think of it as a relative risk in terms of understanding, like what it means in terms of the magnitude of the Association and the interpretive conference and confidence interval and all of that.

191
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,490
Alison Mondul: So what do you think what did you guys say about this study.

192
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:02,820
Nolaundron Harris: I just don't know why none of those numbers were one, so I just found mine like.

193
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,830
Nolaundron Harris: Oh crap.

194
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,250
Nolaundron Harris: But oh wow.

195
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,100
Alison Mondul: I don't have to say I don't like when they do it this way when I make a table I always put like 1.0.

196
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:22,650
Alison Mondul: And then ref like instead of the confidence interval I put the word rent so it's much more I feel like it's easy for that to get lost, just like you did.

197
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,060
Nolaundron Harris: Okay okay.

198
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:29,580
Alison Mondul: This is the reference category, so this is one, because it is the reference and you're comparing everything back to that.

199
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,820
Alison Mondul: Because that makes sense mm hmm.

200
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,960
Alison Mondul: So I think one of the things here is that there's a much clearer dose response relationship right.

201
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:59,280
Alison Mondul: It marches it down nicely, as you go up in categories 1897763 nice very strong P for trend right, you also have statistical significance in these top categories and, in fact, in some of the lower categories as well.

202
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:09,120
Alison Mondul: And in this case controlling for confounders results in an estimate that's closer to the north, so this seems more like what we would expect right.

203
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:17,940
Alison Mondul: Moves things in the appropriate direction, it becomes less strong when you adjust for these other things.

204
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,760
Alison Mondul: So that red flag is no longer waiting for us right.

205
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,040
Alison Mondul: um.

206
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:41,970
Alison Mondul: You know model for his closest is pointing for right, so this is closest to the no point seven 1.72 so kind of the more things you would just for the with the I mean two and three are you know.

207
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:51,480
Alison Mondul: one, two and three are all pretty close and two and three are a little bit in the wrong order, but you can kind of see that the more things you adjust for the closer this gets to the know does that make sense.

208
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:54,420
Alison Mondul: um.

209
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,470
Alison Mondul: So.

210
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,920
Alison Mondul: One of the things that.

211
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:09,750
Alison Mondul: is interesting is that you start to approach less statistical significance here, maybe you're adjusting for too many things in this model.

212
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:18,630
Alison Mondul: You do have quite a lot of people in your study here that's The other thing to note is this is much bigger study than the other one it just has a lot more cases and a lot more people in it.

213
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:32,850
Alison Mondul: Which is part of why you're ending up with more statistically significant results but, again, the more things you add to your model kind of the wider that confidence intervals going to get so you know there's some argument to be made that perhaps.

214
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:45,090
Alison Mondul: You know, one of these other models is a better a better model but that's splitting hairs right, so I think this is pretty better evidence right do you guys agree.

215
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,510
Nolaundron Harris: i'm gonna say yes, because that sounds like the right answer right.

216
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:54,990
Nolaundron Harris: i'm honest.

217
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,630
Alison Mondul: Anybody have questions about this one.

218
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,490
Okay.

219
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:07,680
Nolaundron Harris: hmm.

220
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:16,890
Alison Mondul: So number nine it says in each of the studies for this exercise that exam and associations between to assumption and type two diabetes using individual level exposure and outcome data.

221
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:26,430
Alison Mondul: People who fail to answer questions about their intake of tea and people without BMI information were excluded so discuss the situation in which this could introduce bias to your study.

222
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:46,620
Alison Mondul: Right, so the idea here is if the likelihood of failing to report T and BMI was related to the consumption of tea and type two diabetes, you can head introduce selection bias, so people excluded we're more likely to be in one cell of that table, so if we did a quick i'm.

223
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,590
Alison Mondul: Like if we did a quick two by two table.

224
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:20,940
Alison Mondul: Okay, and you've got diabetes and know, diabetes and tea and no tea and i'm simplifying the exposure categories here right because they had multiple but let's just do it easy so um let's say you didn't report your tea.

225
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:34,710
Alison Mondul: or let's talk about BMI so say that the people who didn't report their BMI were both more likely to be tea drinkers and have diabetes right.

226
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,990
Alison Mondul: Because let's say um let's say that.

227
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:53,820
Alison Mondul: People who have high BMI are more likely to be diabetic they don't want to tell you about it because they feel some sort of stigma about their weight right, and so they choose not to tell you.

228
00:28:54,090 --> 00:29:04,440
Alison Mondul: But these people are also, for whatever reason, the people with the high BMI who don't want to tell you about their weight are also tea drinkers and so they're like all in this category, that would be a selection bias.

229
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:09,660
Nolaundron Harris: Because they're only they're telling you what they want you to know but they're not telling you the full story.

230
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:24,360
Alison Mondul: Well, the issue really is that you excluded these people if they didn't if they didn't give you their BMI information you're just throwing them out of your study, so your inclusion criteria are is now dependent on your your both your exposure and your outcome.

231
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,120
Nolaundron Harris: That restriction the instances, it was excluded with that have been restriction.

232
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:39,810
Alison Mondul: You know it's restriction to people who report full BMI information, the reason, people do this usually.

233
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,880
Alison Mondul: Is they will exclude people who don't have information on an important could have founder because they can't adjust for it.

234
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,390
Alison Mondul: Generally speaking, people will not do this if there is a lot of missing this.

235
00:29:52,590 --> 00:30:09,210
Alison Mondul: Usually, when I have done this in studies there's like a handful of like 10 people in a study of thousands, which, even if it were associated with both the exposure and the outcome is not enough people to really skew anything that much.

236
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:19,980
Alison Mondul: So if you have a lot of missing this excluding them as a bad call because there is a big chance that it could be causing a selection bias in your study.

237
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:32,700
Alison Mondul: But it's essentially the way people get into your study is associated with both the exposure and the disease right people get into your study if they report BMI.

238
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:42,330
Alison Mondul: If they're not reporting BMI and their choice to not report is associated with both tea drinking and type two diabetes, you have a selection bias problem.

239
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:46,980
Alison Mondul: Does that make sense.

240
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:50,580
Okay.

241
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,340
Alison Mondul: See that's what happens with annotation.

242
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:08,790
Alison Mondul: Okay, so observing the data from all three papers that you reviewed for this exercise comment on whether you believe that the relationship between tea consumption and type two diabetes is causal.

243
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:19,500
Alison Mondul: Right, so this is kind of getting APP that is there, consistency across studies, this is that criteria right of the of the breadcrumb trail criteria.

244
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:25,590
Alison Mondul: So together they do provide some evidence that there's caught, there is a causal relationship right there was a protective association and all three.

245
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:36,300
Alison Mondul: questions remain, however, because there were some consistencies with a plausible biological pathway limited statistical significance indicating chance could play in particularly in that second study.

246
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:41,670
Alison Mondul: Evidence of important confounding by no risk factors suggesting there could be also residual confounding.

247
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:53,130
Alison Mondul: And, not all of the studies show clear dose response right, so this is the kind of thing that you're going to have to do right, you might be asked to do a literature search and.

248
00:31:53,790 --> 00:32:01,170
Alison Mondul: decide, do you think that there's something going on here, do you think that there's a causal relationship between ti and type two diabetes.

249
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:16,710
Alison Mondul: And it's not an easy, yes, no answer it's kind of like well in column a we got all these things that suggest, maybe, yes, but in column B there's these detriments about the studies and so you kind of have to decide which column carries more weight with you.

250
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,310
Alison Mondul: So what type of study might you propose to do next to attempted attempted to answer this question more definitively.

251
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:40,560
Alison Mondul: The answer here is a randomized control trial, you would look at both incident, diabetes and biological markers right and you would actually randomized people to drink tea or not.

252
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,910
Alison Mondul: Did anybody come up with anything different.

253
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:02,340
Alison Mondul: And so number 12 is a little bit silly right number 12 says a close friend tells you they believe that deconstruction is just an indicator listening to classical music.

254
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:14,130
Alison Mondul: And they believe that listening to classical music is the true protective factor for diabetes, can you come up with a plausible biological argument for this friends explanation, who could not COMP the fossil biological argument.

255
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,110
Nolaundron Harris: I don't argue that foolishness.

256
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:23,850
Alison Mondul: True, but the point here is that even if it's foolish, even if it seems silly.

257
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,220
Alison Mondul: argue in favor of it right so biologic plausibility.

258
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:33,540
Alison Mondul: is one of those Bradford hill criteria that we all kind of go.

259
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:48,540
Alison Mondul: Well, I mean you can make up a story for anything I guess right so sometimes biological plausibility is more or less believable depending upon everything else right, you can almost always come up with some potential biologic pathway for an exposure to be causally related to an outcome.

260
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,310
Nolaundron Harris: What do you think might be related to Mr if that.

261
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:54,810
Alison Mondul: could be.

262
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:06,060
Nolaundron Harris: You may have more sleep so you're more in you you're energized to exercise tomorrow yeah I have to I gotta get out of being penny and just think of where you were right.

263
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,990
Nolaundron Harris: You can you see how to how to explain it.

264
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:20,550
Alison Mondul: But do you think this is real, I mean but you're right it's a little silly right and that's The point is that you can come up with a story that makes even a silly.

265
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,810
Nolaundron Harris: Potential exposure to.

266
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:36,240
Alison Mondul: Face relationship biologically plausible and so just be a little bit skeptical about biological plausibility just because there's biological plausibility doesn't really mean that something is causally associated because you can make up a story about anything right.

267
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:38,820
Nolaundron Harris: Yes.

268
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,000
Nolaundron Harris: Okay.

269
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:43,890
Nolaundron Harris: Okay.

270
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,240
Alison Mondul: All right, any questions about that guys.

271
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:57,000
Nolaundron Harris: Let me i'm just going to be honest, what so would you like for.

272
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,770
Nolaundron Harris: For those groups who did not get all the way down to the bottom, would you like, for us to finish, all the way down to the bottom yeah.

273
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:05,340
Alison Mondul: you're fine.

274
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:21,180
Alison Mondul: We went through those last couple ones, and hopefully you understood them I think that's fine I don't need you guys to spend time doing that I, I think you would be better served, particularly if you're taking a class for credit I think you'd be better served.

275
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,760
Alison Mondul: You know, preparing for the exam tomorrow.

276
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:25,740
yeah.

277
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,090
Alison Mondul: You guys will get full credit no worries.

278
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,090
Alison Mondul: Full effort full credit for full effort.

279
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,630
Alison Mondul: Okay.

280
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,640
Alison Mondul: um let's go ahead and take a five minute break.

281
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:50,640
Alison Mondul: Bad 56 everybody little stretch get a drink and then I will take your questions about exam to okay.

282
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,100
Alison Mondul: we're recording.

283
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:34,410
Joshua Tucker: Think, I saw you took two points off of the total number of points for the exam so I have to get fewer points correct questions correct to get the grade I want.

284
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:42,030
Alison Mondul: I just realized the Th took the exam and realized that there was a question about something that we did not cover which.

285
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:48,810
Alison Mondul: doesn't seem fair i'm going to go and say I probably should just do one things I didn't teach you.

286
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:55,710
Alison Mondul: that's that's kind of not the point, so I took that off yep.

287
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:00,570
Alison Mondul: there's a question about population attributable risk, which is not something we covered in this class.

288
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,210
Alison Mondul: That was a mistake.

289
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:08,010
Zoe Gurney: Okay, see cuz I was gonna be my question Okay, thank you.

290
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:10,320
Sarah Ferri: agreed.

291
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:29,160
Alison Mondul: I mean it's kind of cool measure is basically saying like what proportion of a disease is due to an exposure right like.

292
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:42,660
Alison Mondul: What what like if he made a pie chart of like say all cancer what proportion of all cancer is due to smoking so it's kind of a cool public health measure to be able to calculate but we didn't we didn't go over it in the class so i'm not gonna i'm testing.

293
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:55,080
Alison Mondul: You guys just know it all you feel like you're really confident.

294
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,100
Nolaundron Harris: No, but it is hard to figure out where to begin.

295
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:02,430
Alison Mondul: there.

296
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:10,680
Clifton Addison: yeah.

297
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:23,700
Clifton Addison: One of the I guess the first practice problem, the exam practice problems number one.

298
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,300
Clifton Addison: Number one F.

299
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,160
Clifton Addison: In the.

300
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,480
Clifton Addison: In the response you had that the.

301
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:43,620
Clifton Addison: One that talks about in the maze dormitories students will randomize to hand washing frequency.

302
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:45,660
Clifton Addison: and

303
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,990
Clifton Addison: How wondering about this.

304
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,430
Clifton Addison: group a were.

305
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,680
Clifton Addison: One divided by 0.354.

306
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,660
Clifton Addison: Yes, with.

307
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:06,300
Alison Mondul: yep so you can so you got a relative risk of point 354.

308
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:08,970
Alison Mondul: In your.

309
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:19,440
Alison Mondul: In your interpretation you could have said that students who are randomized a high handwashing frequency were point 354 times as likely to be diagnosed with the flu.

310
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:32,100
Alison Mondul: Or you could invert that one divided by that right and say that people randomize to high handwashing frequency were 2.82 times less likely.

311
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,590
Clifton Addison: Okay.

312
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:44,970
Alison Mondul: Do you see how I haven't or you could say that the people who weren't randomized high handwashing frequency or 2.82 times more likely to be diagnosed with flu.

313
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,360
Alison Mondul: it's just a matter of flipping.

314
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:49,560
Alison Mondul: The rather than.

315
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:50,970
Clifton Addison: yeah okay.

316
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:54,330
Alison Mondul: it's the same thing it's just how you want to say it to interpret it.

317
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,660
Alison Mondul: That makes sense yeah.

318
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:09,150
Alison Mondul: let's have a question, I think we had a couple people start to talk at the same time there.

319
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,090
Alison Mondul: So we go ahead.

320
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:20,220
Zoe Gurney: hey I have a question regarding.

321
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:29,070
Zoe Gurney: The passage exam about bias compounding effect multiplication and causality.

322
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:46,620
Zoe Gurney: I just wanted to know if he had any tips for like one see because I find that often like when dealing with problems that involve miss classification given percentages, they often get confused like which way, like the numbers, should they like be flipped or like you know be.

323
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:51,420
Alison Mondul: changed did the red arrows that we did in the.

324
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,820
Alison Mondul: Exercise help you.

325
00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:03,360
Zoe Gurney: uh no because I think I just I get I still I think I get confused even like with that, to begin with.

326
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:16,380
Alison Mondul: I guess it's saying that people without hepatitis who actually so people without hepatitis, so you can immediately, so let me go ahead and share my screen.

327
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:31,950
Alison Mondul: And so the problem says assume that 20% of persons without hepatitis who actually engaged in IV drug use, did not report it IV drug use Okay, and all others accurately reported so.

328
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:41,460
Alison Mondul: First of all, we're talking about people without hepatitis right, so we can immediately focus just on this um.

329
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,350
Alison Mondul: Just on this column right.

330
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:55,620
Alison Mondul: Because we know we're talking about people without hepatitis, and so we can we can and we know that we need to.

331
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,950
Alison Mondul: focus on people.

332
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:17,460
Alison Mondul: Go me annotation there we go, so this is our correct table and it says so people who actually did didn't report it so would they should you so if people actually did it but didn't report it, you have yeses who are now in the nose.

333
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:39,390
Alison Mondul: They actually did it but they didn't tell you about it so now you've got people who are yeses who are switching over here into the know category of drug use right, but only among the hepatitis non hepatitis people people without hepatitis, so what we can do is if we.

334
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:51,990
Alison Mondul: We can draw here, we can say okay we're focusing on the know hepatitis people and people who actually use IV drugs didn't report it so they're moving from the yes to the no column row.

335
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:55,050
Alison Mondul: Does that help.

336
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:09,180
Zoe Gurney: I think a little bit think a little bit I said it was just got a bit confused because my I actually when I was doing it flipped it by accident, because my thought process was that if there's people who did it who are reporting it like yeah I smell flipped it in my head.

337
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:18,300
Alison Mondul: It is a little hard to get used to I mean you have to think about the fact that, if they actually did it and didn't tell you are you going to have too many yeses are too many no's.

338
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,390
Alison Mondul: you're going to have too many people in the know right you're going to people who should be yes, who are now in the nose.

339
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:29,880
Zoe Gurney: gotcha.

340
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:42,210
Alison Mondul: I guess when you're when you're reading the promises what they truly did and then what they say they did so you're moving from the truth to what they said.

341
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,010
Alison Mondul: Does that help.

342
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,980
Zoe Gurney: I think so yeah okay.

343
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:52,710
Zoe Gurney: Okay, think so, yes.

344
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:53,760
Okay.

345
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:55,830
Zoe Gurney: Thank you.

346
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,180
Alison Mondul: No problem.

347
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,570
Alison Mondul: Who else anybody else have a question.

348
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,450
Alison Mondul: Was there any part of the practice questions that were particularly difficult.

349
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:36,030
Alison Mondul: Because.

350
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:44,580
Alison Mondul: It seems like maybe if you guys didn't get get the practice problem correct you understood after reading the key why.

351
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,030
Alison Mondul: Maybe that's why there aren't questions.

352
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:05,220
Zoe Gurney: To clarify up more often than not it's RC t's and cohort studies, where you calculate the risk ratio, because you have individual data.

353
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:17,040
Zoe Gurney: that's followed up over time, while it's case control studies cross section cross sectional in the like that use the odds ratio unless you're looking at using baseline associations right.

354
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:23,400
Alison Mondul: Right, so the options, the best measure of association for our cities and cohort studies.

355
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:35,340
Alison Mondul: is either the incidence rate ratio or the relative risk and it depends upon whether you have um what information, would you need to be given for a denominator in order to calculate an incidence rate ratio.

356
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:37,350
Zoe Gurney: gotcha.

357
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,490
Alison Mondul: What would you need.

358
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:39,690
A.

359
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:43,500
Zoe Gurney: Great.

360
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:53,550
Zoe Gurney: Time person time.

361
00:45:53,610 --> 00:46:03,390
Alison Mondul: that's exactly right, so if you're given cases and person time, you should, and you have in our sequel and you wouldn't have this information for any other kind of study, but you got an rct or a cohort study.

362
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:14,070
Alison Mondul: they're giving you case numbers and person time you're calculating and incidence rate ratio if you're giving cases and non cases in a cohort or rct you're calculating a.

363
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:17,970
Zoe Gurney: Real risk ratio.

364
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:27,660
Alison Mondul: express your relative risk Chris Chris you're exactly right, you have you have a case control study you're always going to be calculating a.

365
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:30,390
Zoe Gurney: odds.

366
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:31,590
Alison Mondul: odds ratio.

367
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:35,550
Alison Mondul: exactly right case control study odds ratio and then you've got a.

368
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:42,540
Alison Mondul: A cross sectional study where your outcome is not rare.

369
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,360
Alison Mondul: You could calculate a prevalence ratio right.

370
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:49,380
Zoe Gurney: huh.

371
00:46:50,310 --> 00:47:00,390
Alison Mondul: You can also calculate a prevalence odds ratio, but if your outcome is not rare that's going to be a not a good estimate of the prevalence ratio.

372
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,750
Zoe Gurney: gotcha Okay, thank you.

373
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:05,910
Alison Mondul: No problem.

374
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:13,020
Nolaundron Harris: i'm going to ask that that was super helpful so i'm just going to ask for that.

375
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:22,320
Nolaundron Harris: relational stuff again if this is the type of study, then this is typically outcome.

376
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:33,960
Alison Mondul: So the most appropriate measure of association relic we're talking about relative better so there's also different measures, but we didn't spend as much time working with those so i'm going to concentrate on the relative measures.

377
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:42,780
Alison Mondul: If you have a cohort study or randomized control trial, the measures of association that you count the relative measures of association that you have are the same.

378
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:53,250
Alison Mondul: doesn't matter if it's darcy to your cohort they're the same if you have person time data you're going to be calculating an incidence rate ratio right.

379
00:47:54,690 --> 00:48:00,600
Alison Mondul: If you only have people number of cases number of non cases you're going to be calculating a relative risk.

380
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:09,510
Alison Mondul: You could calculate an odds ratio, but why would you if you could calculate those other things.

381
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,290
Alison Mondul: In a case control study you can only calculate an odds ratio.

382
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:25,140
Alison Mondul: If your diseases rare, you can argue that it is a good estimate of the relative risk.

383
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:31,890
Alison Mondul: If you have.

384
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,410
Alison Mondul: Cross sectional data.

385
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,110
Alison Mondul: You can calculate a prevalence ratio or a prevalence odds ratio.

386
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:50,370
Alison Mondul: But if your disease, if your outcome is not rare the prevalence odds ratio will not be a good estimate of the prevalence ratio.

387
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:00,420
Thank you.

388
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:40,320
Alison Mondul: So yeah, I think, and I think we talked about this and going over the effect modification and confounding stuff right, but I think the first thing to ask yourself, is what is my study design and a lot of the questions were set up this way right, what is your study design.

389
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:50,130
Alison Mondul: Then, think about given that what is the appropriate measure of and the data that i've been given what is the appropriate measure of association that I should be calculating.

390
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:54,060
Alison Mondul: What is my exposure and my outcome.

391
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:56,880
Alison Mondul: Excuse me one moment.

392
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:43,980
Alison Mondul: I apologize my son was calling me, so I wanted to make sure it wasn't an emergency, it was not he told me he doesn't want to go to swimming class tonight and like maybe we can talk about that, when I pick you up and i'm not teaching.

393
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,390
Alison Mondul: Okay um.

394
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:58,470
Alison Mondul: yeah, so I think a good way of doing this is to start what is my study design, therefore, what is the most appropriate measure, given the study design and the data that I have.

395
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:04,350
Alison Mondul: right because, if I have person time data or account data that that changes things in terms of what you're calculating right.

396
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:09,810
Alison Mondul: What study design do I have what data do I have, therefore, what is my measure of association, I want to calculate.

397
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:22,110
Alison Mondul: And then writing down my exposure is this the exposed category is this the unexposed category is that my disease is this people with the diseases this people without the diseases that right.

398
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:25,020
Alison Mondul: And I think that will help.

399
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,370
Alison Mondul: set everything else up for the question.

400
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:42,210
Alison Mondul: And if it's an effect if it's a you know my third variable that i'm evaluating as a potential confounders or effect modifier is.

401
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,070
Alison Mondul: Whatever right if that's part of the question.

402
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:59,970
Alison Mondul: And that will help you for all kinds of questions, it will help you for questions were you asked to calculate a measure of association and we'll help you for questions where you're talking about confounding and effect modification.

403
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:03,690
Alison Mondul: It will help you set up to I two tables it's going to help you set up.

404
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,280
Alison Mondul: um.

405
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,750
Alison Mondul: I had something else in mind, and now it flew out of my head i'm sorry.

406
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:25,890
Alison Mondul: I mean all of that right information bias right it's going to help you say okay when i'm deciding if this is differential or not differential Am I miss classifying the outcome, or the or the exposure.

407
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:33,660
Alison Mondul: Once you've because you're going to go back to your list so this was my exposure we're talking about miss classifying the exposure we're talking about getting the wrong data for the exposure so.

408
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:38,310
Alison Mondul: In order to decide if it's differential or not, I have to decide if that's different by the outcome.

409
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:50,370
Alison Mondul: Right so kind of just laying all that out up front, when you read the question I think will help you keep everything straight, no matter what kind of question you're answering as you go forward.

410
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:10,050
Alison Mondul: What do you guys think of that approach does that feel like it would be helpful.

411
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:16,980
Clifton Addison: yeah, I think, once we have an understanding of that the path that.

412
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,770
Clifton Addison: will make things a lot easier.

413
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:27,720
Alison Mondul: And it helps to when you're I mean I think it's just easy to get everything a little bit muddled when even when you're reading a paper right.

414
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:33,630
Alison Mondul: So immediately say what does the study design what measure of associate association, therefore, should they be looking at.

415
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:41,250
Alison Mondul: What are they considering their exposure and outcome, what are the things that they're considering as confounders, what are the things that they might be considering as effect modifier right.

416
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:49,770
Alison Mondul: When you read a paper and you kind of organize it in your mind that way or even like take notes that way, then you can start to think it through a little better.

417
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:08,640
Alison Mondul: Writing down the study design will also help you if you're asked to identify potential sources of bias right, because we know that selection bias is a much bigger problem.

418
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:15,930
Alison Mondul: And in the case control study right as soon as your as soon as you know, you have a case control study you should start start thinking about whether you've got selection bias.

419
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:33,030
Alison Mondul: Right information bias is a problem at all studies, but differential information bias is a much bigger problem in a case control study right because you are assessing exposure after people already have the disease.

420
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:45,840
Alison Mondul: So it's much easier for that to be different, you can get recall bias right, you can get different answers between your cases you controls if you're doing a cohort study and you ask people upfront.

421
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:57,900
Alison Mondul: About exposures and then wait for them to get disease it's real hard to imagine we sound impossible, but it's harder to imagine a scenario in which people who have the disease and don't have a disease are.

422
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:06,030
Alison Mondul: Remembering differently, because they didn't have the disease or know about the disease when they gave you those answers right.

423
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:14,580
Alison Mondul: So differential misclassification is less of an issue and a cohort study.

424
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:25,080
Alison Mondul: confounding as an issue in almost all studies, but not a randomized control trial, if you if your randomization worked.

425
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:49,620
Alison Mondul: Right, so all these sources of bias, you know the the study design should raise red flags for you about what sources of bias, you should be thinking about so that's why I think kind of laying all of that out.

426
00:55:53,790 --> 00:56:00,300
Alison Mondul: Because if you lay out the study design, you can say Aha I should be most concerned about these sources of bias I got my exposure and my outcome.

427
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:03,270
Alison Mondul: Let me think about whether I might have measured them.

428
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:18,570
Alison Mondul: either of them incorrectly leading to information bias, based on my study diet would that be differential or non differential okay now i've got my exposure and my outcome, I can think about third factors that might be associated with either of them as potential confounders.

429
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,300
Nolaundron Harris: let's see what you over a billion.

430
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:27,960
Nolaundron Harris: People pieces together, I see you.

431
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:33,450
Alison Mondul: gonna be like a pretty picture of a sunrise.

432
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:37,320
Nolaundron Harris: This is awesome for people who don't like getting bored.

433
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:41,460
Nolaundron Harris: Because it just it keeps you thinking all the time.

434
00:56:54,300 --> 00:57:02,910
Alison Mondul: And i'm going to talk about one of these, one of these scientists in my talk on Friday when I tell you about some of my own work, but there are people whose entire job is to be a methodology just right.

435
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:08,370
Alison Mondul: you're thinking of new methods they're thinking of new types of bias.

436
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:13,080
Alison Mondul: I mean they're basically like sitting there ruminating about all the different ways, new ways that.

437
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:16,020
Alison Mondul: Maybe we have been screwing up our studies that we didn't think of.

438
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:20,940
Nolaundron Harris: See you saying that also makes me think like.

439
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:39,840
Nolaundron Harris: So all of us are here in this course together but it's not necessarily stopping it just epidemiology its components of that the whole subject you may be better at like you said, thinking of bias bias ease and things that you could.

440
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:48,060
Nolaundron Harris: Like so it may just be where does your brain fit into epidemiology, instead of the entire subject.

441
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:52,710
Alison Mondul: yeah I think that's probably true, particularly for people who aren't.

442
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:57,600
Alison Mondul: So people who are at the PhD level who are running a.

443
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,350
Nolaundron Harris: Research group.

444
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:02,340
Alison Mondul: You kind of do have to be thinking about all of that, I would think.

445
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:11,160
Alison Mondul: But for people who are like at the Masters level, you could be a person who's working like on a team during study design, you could be a person who's doing.

446
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:11,820
Alison Mondul: Statistical.

447
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:14,220
Alison Mondul: Programming so you could be doing more of that kind of piece of.

448
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:28,590
Alison Mondul: juicing you're writing kind of person right so some of these different pieces, certainly, you can have strengths and them and have your role in you know kind of the whole thing be one or more pieces of that I think that's valid yeah.

449
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,330
Alison Mondul: Any other questions about the.

450
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,420
Alison Mondul: Any of the.

451
00:58:56,490 --> 00:59:00,120
Alison Mondul: Do these things, called practice problems sorry words.

452
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:07,770
What do you think.

453
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,910
Alison Mondul: woke up apparently he's interested in this part.

454
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:13,920
Alison Mondul: says hey.

455
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,420
Alison Mondul: falling behind my computer.

456
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:26,850
Alison Mondul: There we go.

457
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,660
Alison Mondul: All right, I think format and length are similar to last time.

458
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:38,580
Alison Mondul: ellie and Rachel, what do you guys think length about the same.

459
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:40,890
Rachael Jade Beer: yeah I think so.

460
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:42,390
Alli Seeley: yeah.

461
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:47,310
Alison Mondul: So if that's something you struggled with last time, think about budgeting your time.

462
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:51,360
Alison Mondul: Maybe you look through.

463
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,400
Alison Mondul: and see there's going to you know the.

464
00:59:54,600 --> 01:00:00,090
Alison Mondul: More Matthew ones are going to come at the end so don't like waste not waist but like don't spend all your time on the ones.

465
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,940
Alison Mondul: The quicker ones at the beginning.

466
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:09,210
Alison Mondul: it's open note open book, so you can have all your stuff but maybe organizing a little bit like.

467
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:13,290
Alison Mondul: Make writing yourself a cheat sheet to kind of like think through the things that I just said.

468
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,690
Alison Mondul: Like how to organize your thoughts for each problem.

469
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:34,440
Alison Mondul: We will be you guys don't have to log on to the zoom call tomorrow we're going to do it, just like last time you don't have to log on to the zoom call, but we will be on the zoom call in case anybody has questions.

470
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:42,600
Alison Mondul: Anything else I forgotten.

471
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:54,270
Alison Mondul: right if you're taking it for credit, you have to take the exam if you're not, I think it's a good opportunity to kind of see where you're at um.

472
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,400
Alison Mondul: and

473
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,770
Alison Mondul: I will see you guys back on Friday.

474
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:12,330
Alison Mondul: And I will give you i'm going to give a lecture on my work and some examples of like some of these methodological issues that have come up.

475
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:16,140
Alison Mondul: In my studies and how we dealt with them.

476
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:21,750
Right.

477
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:28,470
Alison Mondul: You guys have a great afternoon i'm gonna go make my kid go to spinning.

478
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:32,190
Alison Mondul: want to.

479
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:36,450
Zoe Gurney: feel.

480
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:37,470
Zoe Gurney: Good life.

481
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:42,630
Alison Mondul: Like it once he's there what he really wants to do is come home and get online and play minecraft with his friends.
