1
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,685
After watching this video,

2
00:00:11,685 --> 00:00:13,140
you will be able to describe

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,490
the SAS environment and

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,420
the basic structure
of SAS coding.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,605
Once you open SAS,

6
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:22,110
the first thing that you
see is three windows,

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,230
with tabs and a menu,
with some icons.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,245
The window on the
left has two tabs.

9
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:31,380
By default, you will
see the Results window,

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,784
which does not really
give you results,

11
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,640
but help you navigate the result.

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,570
Once you start running code,

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,530
you will see there a list
of different results.

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,460
If you run a lot
of code together,

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,080
you can easily identify

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,340
the ones you want to see
in any given moment.

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,910
The other tab, the Explorer tab,

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,244
will help you navigate the
libraries and dataset.

19
00:00:54,244 --> 00:00:57,410
We will go back to this in
the next video once you

20
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,870
understand what a library
is and how to create it.

21
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,955
In the central part, by default,

22
00:01:02,955 --> 00:01:04,920
you have two windows open,

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,640
the Log on top and the
Editor on the bottom.

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,250
But you can see that there are

25
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,310
other tabs that will
open two other windows,

26
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,310
the Output and the
Results Viewer.

27
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,910
The Log window helps you
to check the progress of

28
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,380
your analysis and it's very
useful to check for errors.

29
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,075
When there are no errors,

30
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:28,600
SAS will use the color blue
to tell you what is going on.

31
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,020
Warnings will show in green,

32
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,560
and note that warnings are
not necessarily errors,

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,270
but sometimes you have

34
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,075
to pay attention and
be aware of them,

35
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:42,565
just in case, and errors
will show in red.

36
00:01:42,565 --> 00:01:44,840
Also know that sometimes may

37
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,805
be difficult to
identify an error,

38
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:49,520
you just mistype some
part of the code.

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,220
For example, if you
forget to add one of

40
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,060
these semicolons at the
end of one statement,

41
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,000
SAS is now going to tell you,

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,530
"Hey, dude, pay attention.

43
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,465
You just forgot a semicolon."

44
00:02:00,465 --> 00:02:02,130
SAS is not that cool.

45
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,610
What will happen is
that SAS will not

46
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,610
be able to interpret
that part of the code,

47
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,055
and some some type of

48
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:11,750
random error that may be

49
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,760
difficult to interpret
will show up.

50
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,395
But don't worry, with time,

51
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:17,245
you will get used to that.

52
00:02:17,245 --> 00:02:20,250
Moving on, the last
window that you see by

53
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,470
default is the Editor window,

54
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,480
and that's where
you type your code.

55
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,505
Note that those windows,

56
00:02:26,505 --> 00:02:29,945
as all windows in any computer
environment can be closed,

57
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:34,375
minimize, maximize, and
reshape to your convenience.

58
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,440
The Results Viewer
window will show

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,230
once you run some
code with results.

60
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,365
It is where you will
see your analysis,

61
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:44,574
your tables and models.

62
00:02:44,574 --> 00:02:46,335
The Output window is

63
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:49,410
exactly the same as
the Results Viewer,

64
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,870
but with no format.

65
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,805
Depending on your settings,

66
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,530
your results may show in

67
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,865
the Results Viewer with fancy
format and nice tables,

68
00:02:58,865 --> 00:03:02,125
or in the Output window
with no fancy formats.

69
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,060
Note, however, that the
results are exactly the same,

70
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,295
it's just the formatting
is different.

71
00:03:07,295 --> 00:03:09,530
During this whole course,
I will be showing you

72
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,870
results with and without format,

73
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,390
so you get used to both of them.

74
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,940
Finally, on the top you can see

75
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,830
the SAS menu bar with

76
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,390
a few icons that I will
describe in the next slide.

77
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,170
Here you can see
the SAS menu bar.

78
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,090
Most of those icons are

79
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,990
standard icons that are used
in many other software,

80
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,565
and many of them you may
not even used in the end.

81
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:36,830
I will just stop on the
really important ones,

82
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,690
but I'll mention all of them.

83
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,880
From left to right you can

84
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,045
see the icon to
create a new program.

85
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:47,720
Then you have the icon to
open an existing program.

86
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,555
Since many times you don't
need to start from scratch,

87
00:03:50,555 --> 00:03:52,205
but just save your SAS code

88
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:54,460
in a file and then open it later.

89
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,070
Then you have the icon
to save a program.

90
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,020
This is a very important
one in every software.

91
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,030
Usually, highly recommended to

92
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,680
save your code from time to

93
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,295
time to avoid losing it in
case something happens,

94
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:10,540
like a board outage
or a zombie attack.

95
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,125
Then you have the "Print" icon.

96
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,465
Then you have the
"Print Review" icon.

97
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:16,980
Then you have the "Cut", "Copy",

98
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,900
and "Paste" icons, are exactly
the same as you are used.

99
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,300
Then you have the "Undo" icon.

100
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,420
Then you have the "Create
a new library" icon.

101
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,550
Again, we'll go
back to this one on

102
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,565
the next video when you
know what a library is.

103
00:04:31,565 --> 00:04:35,045
Then we have the
"Open Explorer" icon.

104
00:04:35,045 --> 00:04:39,095
Now we have one of the most
important ones, the Run code.

105
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:41,120
This is a very
important icon that you

106
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,325
will be using all the time.

107
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,915
While you write your code,

108
00:04:44,915 --> 00:04:46,350
you will have to run it,

109
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,150
and this is the icon you
have to click to do so.

110
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,550
Know that you can run

111
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,040
the whole code you have
written in your program,

112
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,560
or more often, you will run
only part of your code.

113
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,285
To do that, what you do
is you will highlight

114
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:02,440
those parts in your code and
then click the "Run code".

115
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,550
Then you have the
"Clear all code" icon

116
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,680
if you want to stifle a
scratch on a blank window.

117
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,860
Then you have the
Stop submitted code,

118
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,960
this is very useful
when by mistake.

119
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,900
You click the "Run code"
without highlighting anything,

120
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,630
and before you panic
because you're

121
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,285
running a whole bunch of
things that you don't want to,

122
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:21,695
then you can click the "Stop

123
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:24,355
submitted code" icon
and then they save.

124
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:26,680
Finally, you have the Help code

125
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,415
that will open the SAS help,

126
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:30,860
which by the way
between you and me,

127
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,120
is not always that helpful,

128
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,605
is pretty overwhelming,

129
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:35,705
particularly when
you're new to SAS.

130
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:38,615
But eventually, it
will be helpful.

131
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:41,060
Note that many of
these things that you

132
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,980
can do with a shortcuts or icons,

133
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,780
you can also do with
the menus, of course,

134
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,880
like open files and so on.

135
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,530
Now, we are going over
a few basic things,

136
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,875
but very important of the
structure of the SAS coding.

137
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,590
Don't worry, you don't get
some of them because I

138
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,625
will be reminding you
those in the next videos.

139
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:05,465
Usually, every file with SAS
code has three components.

140
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,430
Usually starts with a series

141
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,230
of SAS session instructions like,

142
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,595
for example, the LIBNAME,

143
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:12,185
that will create a library.

144
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:14,920
Again, I'll come back to
that in the next video.

145
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,120
Then most of the time,

146
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,745
you need to do some type
of data management,

147
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:23,060
either managing datasets
or creating new variables,

148
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,725
or the deleting observations,

149
00:06:24,725 --> 00:06:27,400
and that will require
some data steps.

150
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,370
Then finally for the analysis,

151
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,290
we will need the procedure steps,

152
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,900
they are called PROC in SAS.

153
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,145
There is a specific PROC
for everything in SAS.

154
00:06:37,145 --> 00:06:39,500
For example, PROC means will

155
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,000
help you to get the means
and standard deviations,

156
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,005
and other descriptive
statistics or valuables.

157
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,700
PROC BREAK will help you to do

158
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,275
linear regression and so on.

159
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:51,530
There are tons and tons of PROCs.

160
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,090
There is [inaudible] in
SAS and sometimes you can

161
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,935
do the same thing with
more than one PROC.

162
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:57,440
But we will see that once

163
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,560
we are more advanced
in the course.

164
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,260
Finally, a few very

165
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,080
important things that you
need to know about SAS.

166
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,545
You use semicolons to
complete each line of code.

167
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:11,815
Note that this is
a usual source of

168
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:14,870
errors because sometimes you
forget to add a semicolon.

169
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,580
In that situation, is
not the SAS is speaking,

170
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,245
I mean, we can be a little picky.

171
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:20,610
But what happen really

172
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,090
is that SAS cannot
really interpret

173
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,390
the code properly if you
don't put the semicolons.

174
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,610
So please be careful and
pay attention to that.

175
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,290
Now, the keyword RUN triggers

176
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,000
the execution of the
DATA and PROC steps,

177
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,480
so you will need a run after
each section of a code.

178
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,100
Now one thing that
SAS is not picky

179
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,320
at all is with upper
and lowercase,

180
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,245
so you can write your
code whatever you want.

181
00:07:46,245 --> 00:07:49,190
It doesn't matter if
you write RUN with

182
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,720
all capital letters or
with a mix of everything.

183
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,770
But of course, it will matter

184
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,390
to you and they're
also really it is.

185
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,420
So please be polish.

186
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,250
Finally, Data and PROC statements

187
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,055
must be complete with
uninterrupted code.

188
00:08:04,055 --> 00:08:05,840
So you cannot write a PROC

189
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,845
in-between a DATA
step and vice versa.

190
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:11,175
In summary in this video,

191
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:13,250
we learn about the
SAS environment and

192
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,905
some basics of the
SAS coding structure.

193
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:17,870
In the next one, we
will learn about

194
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,547
SAS variable names
and SAS libraries.
