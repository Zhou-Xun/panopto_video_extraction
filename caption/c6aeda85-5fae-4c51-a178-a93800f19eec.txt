Hello, this lecture will cover inference
for binary and categorical outcomes, and

2
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:13,080
specifically on the estimation
of an odds ratio.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,484
Recall we had a previous example in
which we had two populations of infants

4
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,339
looking at the risk of caries.

5
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:24,799
In the control population, we saw
an observe proportion of 10 out of 36,

6
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:27,260
or 23% of infants with caries.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,080
And in the intervention sample of infants,
we had 6 out of 68, or

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,960
9% of infants developing caries.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:42,490
And we compared 28% to 9% to get an
absolute difference in the caries rates.

10
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:47,750
The odds ratio is a different
way to compare these two rates.

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:53,012
First, if p is the probability of an event
occurring, then the ratio of p and

12
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:57,960
(1- p) is known as odds
of the event occurring.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,360
We can then compare two groups
by simply taking the ratio of

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,520
each of their individual odds,
creating an odds ratio.

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,579
Therefore, we see an odds
of 0.28 over 1- 0.28 for

16
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:14,015
the control sample,
which is an odds of 0.39.

17
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:18,187
And in the invention sample,
we see an odds of 0.1,

18
00:01:18,187 --> 00:01:21,375
which is the ratio of 0.09 2.81.

19
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:26,657
Again, you should note that in odds of
one would be the ratio of 0.5 to 0.5.

20
00:01:26,657 --> 00:01:30,970
Meaning that the event is equally
likely to occur or not occur.

21
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:36,950
In odds less than 1, it would tell me
that the event is less likely to occur.

22
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,147
And in odds larger than 1,

23
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:42,983
it would tell me that you were more
likely to experience the event.

24
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:47,631
Our observed odds ratio,
which I denote as OR hat, is the ratio of

25
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:53,020
the odds in the intervention sample,
to the odds in the control sample.

26
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:59,830
This ratio is 0.1 over 0.39,
or basically 1 and 4, or 0.25.

27
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,990
We can also compute an odds ratio directly
from a two-by-two contingency table,

28
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,680
which is a way to summarize
all 104 subjects in my sample

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,860
with respect to their caries occurrence
and which group they belonged to.

30
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,635
The odds ratio is simply the product
of one diagonal, 6 and 26,

31
00:02:17,635 --> 00:02:21,915
divided by the product of
the other diagonal, 10x62.

32
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:27,325
This computation, again,
produces an odds ratio of 0.25.

33
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:32,330
And I can interpret this odds ratio as
the conclusion that the odds developing

34
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:38,230
caries is 4x lower in the intervention
infants than in the control infants.

35
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,490
It is important to note that an odds ratio
is a relative comparison of one group

36
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,860
to another group.

37
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,030
One group is represented
in the numerator and

38
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,250
one group is represented
in the denominator.

39
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,310
Again, we could've computed the odds
ratio simply by flipping the rows of this

40
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,730
contingency table.

41
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:01,252
And we would have produced and
odds ratio of 10x62 over 6x26, or about 4.

42
00:03:01,252 --> 00:03:04,120
Again, that number would still
quantify the risk correctly,

43
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,636
it's just that we are speaking about one
of the groups relative to the other in

44
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:10,410
the reverse order.

45
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:15,140
We can also do inference with odds ratios,
and we have the following hypotheses.

46
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,420
The null hypothesis, again,

47
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,650
states that the developing caries is
independent of receiving the intervention.

48
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,220
If these two quantities are independent,
then the odds ratio must be 1.

49
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,530
Both groups must have
equal odds of caries risk.

50
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,940
If they have equal odds,
they also have equal risk and, therefore,

51
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,520
p1 is equal to p2.

52
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,070
Which is the same null hypothesis we saw
with the chi-squared test of association

53
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,520
and the two sample tests of proportions.

54
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,090
The alternative hypothesis is that caries
and intervention are associated with each

55
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,008
other, which means that
the odds ratio must not be 1 or

56
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:55,411
that the two populations do not
have the same risk of caries.

57
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:58,756
We could use a chi-squared test of
association to determine whether or

58
00:03:58,756 --> 00:04:01,110
not to reject the null hypothesis.

59
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,042
We saw earlier in a previous
lecture that the p-value for

60
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:06,922
the chi-squared test of
association was 0.009.

61
00:04:06,922 --> 00:04:10,967
And because this p-value is less than
0.05, we would reject the null hypothesis

62
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:15,960
and conclude that there is no association
of carries with the intervention.

63
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,940
We can also compute a 95% confidence
interval for the odds ratio.

64
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,970
In a previous lecture, we computed a 95%
confidence interval for the absolute

65
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:29,930
difference of p1 and p2, but now we have
a confidence interval for the odds ratio.

66
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,360
I have not shown the computation for

67
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,710
the confidence interval because it is not
as intuitive as previous computations.

68
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,056
But that confidence interval from
a computer would be 0.08 to 0.78.

69
00:04:41,056 --> 00:04:44,370
Again, this confidence interval
excludes the null value of 1 for

70
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,855
the odds ratio and, therefore,
we would reject the null hypothesis.
