1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,950
There was one. All right.

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:20,770
Good morning, everyone. So a couple of things to start with with regards to the schedule.

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:34,050
Someone alerted me. I didn't quite clarify. And besides, for Thursday's class in the I think do column over to the right it says intro to proposal.

4
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,130
There's nothing do. That's just a reminder. I think I mentioned it very briefly at the beginning of the semester.

5
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,360
It's mostly a reminder to myself that on Thursday I will very briefly introduced the proposal assignment.

6
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,680
That's all that means. There's nothing that you have to do. It's just to orient you a little bit.

7
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,459
And then after I introduce it, I'll ask you to forget about it and just focus on working towards our first exam,

8
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,790
which is coming up on I think October six is still a couple of weeks away.

9
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,590
So anyway, just as a clarification, that's all that that means.

10
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,340
And there's nothing you have to do in preparation for Thursday's class.

11
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:21,510
I will use the opportunity to let you know that a week from today we'll have our second exposure science in the news as well.

12
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,530
So I'll, I'll post an announcement and a very brief description.

13
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:34,799
Um, and it'll be similar to last time to ask you to look for and bring in an article to be prepared to discuss in class in breakout.

14
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,430
And then we'll kind of reconvene like we did last time. I'll try to leave a little bit of time so all groups have a chance to break out.

15
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,620
But we'll take it a couple of steps further.

16
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:53,160
So in addition to just, you know, identifying a topic and maybe characterizing whether it's a biological or chemical or physical hazard,

17
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,170
I'll ask you to go a couple of steps further.

18
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,580
What are the primary exposure routes that we re concerned about for that particular hazard that you've identified?

19
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,510
What are the exposure pathways that might be concerning?

20
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,230
So anyway, there was a couple of heads up for the notes on the on the canvas page.

21
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,240
Any any questions along those lines regarding some of the logistics or class schedule?

22
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,090
All right. Sounds good. So let's see this week.

23
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:33,920
So I just actually kind of mentioned we've we've talked so far about our exposure science model.

24
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,559
Right. Kind of going from sources to outcomes and important components along the way.

25
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,640
So we've talked about, uh, those routes of exposure, how the, how hazardous agents can enter our bodies.

26
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,120
We've talked about various exposure pathways, right?

27
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:58,850
Once they're emitted into the environment, how they might be, how they might traverse, whether it's large scale environments or micro environments,

28
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:04,730
uh, that combined with our behavior, we can end up coming into contact with some of these hazardous agents.

29
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:14,479
We've also talked over the last few class periods and a little bit of detail independently about, uh, physical hazards, right?

30
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:24,080
When Professor Neitzel was here about chemical exposures and then most recently about biological agents when Professor Meeker was here.

31
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:36,169
So we're now going to kind of continue along that path and continue to develop this foundation around exposure science both this week and on Thursday.

32
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:42,820
In class, the topics are topics are going to cover two different components of exposure assessment, right?

33
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:49,850
So how do we actually go about assessing one's exposure to any of these, the changes that we might be concerned about?

34
00:03:50,990 --> 00:04:01,969
And today we're going to talk about how we differentiate an exposure assessment between different methods of assessing exposures and indirect methods.

35
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:08,840
So today we're going to focus on some of those opportunities for direct methods, one of which is personal monitoring.

36
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:16,040
We'll kind of reorient ourselves around the hierarchy of exposure data.

37
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:22,760
What type of data would we prefer to have? Understand some subtle differences,

38
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:31,640
whether we're doing exposure assessment with an occupational setting versus in a more of a community or environmental setting.

39
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,960
Understand the framework, right?

40
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:43,430
We talked about the difference between direct methods and indirect methods and then be able to apply some of these exposure assessment

41
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:51,920
scenarios and kind of go through a couple of examples to hopefully help illustrate how some of this might work in practice.

42
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:59,060
All right. So we looked at this slide previously just to kind of reorient ourselves.

43
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:04,310
We've have several different types of data that might be available to us.

44
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,870
And at the top here are quantified personal measurements.

45
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,280
So these might be some sort of biomarker measurement.

46
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:20,490
So a saliva sample, a urine sample, etc., that might be indicative of one's exposure.

47
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,110
Based on the outcome of that biomarker analysis.

48
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:34,790
And then also external measurements. Right. So wearing a pump that has a tube going up into my readings now, I go ahead and I walk around for the day.

49
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,790
It's measuring the quality of the air that I might be breathing during that time period.

50
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:48,170
So these are by far our preferred and our best data that might be available for estimating

51
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:54,590
what actual exposure is someone either through biomarkers or external measurements.

52
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:01,280
And we would kind of refer to these as personal measurements of exposure going down the list.

53
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:07,640
You know, second would be area measurements. We kind of gave an example earlier in the semester around.

54
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:12,410
We had a stationary monitor and we just put it, you know, kind of right here.

55
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,720
It didn't move. And maybe it's monitoring the quality of the air during the class period.

56
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,920
It's not on your person or in your breathing zone.

57
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,650
But over the course of a long enough time period, the air is maybe a little bit well-mixed in the room.

58
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:34,250
It might be a decent estimate of all of our exposures, you know, during the class period.

59
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:45,170
Uh, other surrogates of exposure. Uh, we might not know anything about the amount of sea level in the drinking water,

60
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:52,700
but we can estimate what a typical LED concentration might be if we have an understanding with

61
00:06:52,700 --> 00:07:00,170
maybe we're quantifying how much water someone takes in from that drinking water source.

62
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,090
Might be a way to estimate how much,

63
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:12,290
when they've been exposed to distance from a site combined with the duration of exposure might help us uh, distance or duration of residence.

64
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:19,980
So if you lived in a particular city or area that can help inform and again these are with kind of decreasing preference, right?

65
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:28,270
The quality of the data is getting poorer and the, the uncertainty associated with our results,

66
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,350
the exposure assessment is getting greater, but it's in many cases, it's better than nothing.

67
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:45,109
So kind of further down the list, uh, knowing where somebody worked or a geographical area, um, employment rate in a defined geographic area.

68
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,749
So we might not even know the specific, you know, company or business that the person works through.

69
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,250
We know that they were employed somewhere in Washtenaw County, right at its most basic level.

70
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,220
You might be able to apply some sort of estimate of exposure.

71
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:06,770
But again, these are details here at the bottom, one of our worst opportunities for data to utilize to estimate.

72
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,370
And these would all be considered surrogate measures of.

73
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,580
Right. We're not actually quantifying with the measurement, say, in a field or in a.

74
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:27,350
All right. So this diagram is kind of highlighting a couple of different branches.

75
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,850
You know, up at the top here. These are exposure assessment approaches that might be available to us.

76
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,299
Over here on the left are the direct methods that I kind of alluded to in the first couple of slides and with,

77
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:48,110
you know, two of those being biological monitoring and then those external measures of personal monitoring.

78
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,560
For example, as I was reading on Thursday's class,

79
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:58,100
we'll talk about some of these indirect methods we might not have the opportunity to actually measure,

80
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:07,010
but we might be able to do questionnaires or diaries, right? So for example, that that led in drinking water, we might have the person clicked.

81
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:14,000
Diary How much water did you drink over the course of the day and what from what source did you get the water that you were drinking?

82
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:22,550
And in the end, these helped to inform, uh, dose models, various exposure models and so forth,

83
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:30,620
which is often the goal in an occupational setting where we have individual workers doing individual tasks.

84
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:37,790
Yeah. And that small scale we might want to know really what is that individual's exposure and that inform helps

85
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:45,500
to inform what mitigation strategies need to be implemented to ensure a safe workplace on a larger scale.

86
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:52,100
On populations, we might estimate exposures based on just a few measurements.

87
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,270
So there are select people that are we actually have measurements on.

88
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:05,780
But the goal then is to build an exposure model so that we can actually make an estimate of exposure to a wider.

89
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,940
All right. So I talked about how we'll try to differentiate as we go through the semester

90
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:22,020
between occupational settings and kind of community based exposure monitoring.

91
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,590
And overall, the principles and these approaches are similar.

92
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,150
But there's also some distinct differences.

93
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:44,360
So in this case, here is a factory, workers inside the factory, and then there's also a community that maybe surrounds the factory.

94
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:51,740
There may be some difference in magnitude of exposure to whatever the factory is producing, but.

95
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,580
The approaches that we might take really aren't fundamentally different,

96
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:03,670
whether we're doing something exposures inside the factory versus in the neighborhood surrounding the factory.

97
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,839
Okay. So just a quick review, but you know, it's for that exam coming up in two weeks.

98
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,350
This is important stuff. You know, often people ask, you know, what?

99
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,020
What things should I be studying? These are things.

100
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:26,730
These are basic principles that really have a good handle on are four different rates of exposure, ingestion,

101
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:33,540
rate, food, water, things are purposefully putting into our bodies, oftentimes in the case of children.

102
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:41,910
Right. Uh, house dust soil with a lot of hand-to-mouth contact inhalation is another important one.

103
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:51,360
And then both skin contact and skin absorption where the agent goes through the skin barrier and enters perhaps our bloodstream.

104
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:59,170
So within workplaces, uh, inhalation is usually the, the greatest route of exposure of concern.

105
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:04,530
This is where most exposures take place is through the inhalation of areas.

106
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,030
Uh, generally speaking, skin absorption is,

107
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:17,490
is next important especially for things like organic solvents which are very common in a lot of manufacturing applications.

108
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:23,550
Uh, ingestion is usually a minor concern within a workplace.

109
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:30,629
If we look at a more of a community setting, uh, inhalation is,

110
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:36,390
is also important for kind of for different reasons, just especially in urban settings, right?

111
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,500
Uh, we still live in an urban area everywhere they go, whether they're working,

112
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:48,150
playing, traveling, transporting themselves, they're exposed to pollutants.

113
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:52,760
Inhalation is a primary route for them and then certainly ingestion.

114
00:12:52,770 --> 00:13:00,240
Right. Um, most of our time eating and drinking isn't in that workplace.

115
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:09,870
So that's why it's kind of listed under the community as being a little bit more important of a route of exposure and then skin contact.

116
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:14,670
And this can be, you know, highly variable, uh, different specific scenarios.

117
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:27,890
Um, but many do consider. And then differentiating right between those routes of exposure are the exposure pathways that we're concerned about.

118
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:36,410
And this is basically the medium through which those agents are being transported to eventually

119
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:43,610
possibly come into contact with us and have an exposure actually take place within a workplace setting.

120
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:52,860
These pathways are usually short, simple, direct and easily identifiable, right?

121
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:59,510
And it's just because the variables to consider are so few compared to that community setting.

122
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,730
If we said, all right,

123
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:13,580
what's what are the exposure pathways that we need to consider about being exposed to chemical agents during during this hour and 10 minutes and 1655?

124
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:19,250
There aren't that many things to consider. We are pretty much stationary.

125
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:25,760
It's over a short time period and they're pretty direct and easily identifiable.

126
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,850
Contrasting that with the community setting, if we say, okay, you know,

127
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:35,570
what are this possible exposure pathways that you come into that you encounter over the course of a 24 hour day?

128
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,260
Right now, it's like, oh, my gosh, where was I this morning?

129
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,559
Where am I later this afternoon? And in and out of buildings.

130
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,709
I'm on campus, I'm off and I'm inside residences.

131
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,160
I'm an outdoor environment. A lot of different things to consider.

132
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:59,790
Uh. Yeah, typically, you know, within that workplace setting the contaminant generate the source of the contaminant is,

133
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:04,390
uh, is known at a location inside the actual facility.

134
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:15,070
And then whether exposure occurs or not is dependent on a lot of the, uh, the administrative controls that are in place, right?

135
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,570
Uh, to reduce, uh, an emission actually reaching a worker.

136
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,219
And then also the personal protective equipment that a worker might be wearing

137
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:30,010
as part of conducting tasks associated with this within a community setting.

138
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:35,050
You know, like I said, uh, the exposure pathways can be multiple, it can be pretty complex.

139
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:43,360
And some scenarios over here on the right is that, uh, that one example that we walked through, uh, considering a chemical disposal site right away,

140
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,290
might have volatile chemicals that are released into the air, some that seep into soil and groundwater.

141
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:57,730
Uh, so our routes of exposure can be pretty much any of them inhalation ingestion, direct contact.

142
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:04,270
And then the way that they reach us through these different exposure pathways, through the atmosphere,

143
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:15,250
that might be the water we drink, perhaps the food that's grown in the soil, or maybe fish from the aquatic environment.

144
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:28,210
Lots of different exposure pathways that might be involved in that breathing sample with regards to magnitude and range,

145
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:36,400
uh, in terms of exposure levels within a workplace, that's usually where we see these highest levels of exposure,

146
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:43,480
right, that make sense, especially within kind of manufacturing settings where people are dealing with,

147
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:53,320
um, for the most part known but yet still uh, dangerous or potentially unsafe, uh, exposure levels.

148
00:16:53,740 --> 00:17:01,090
Uh, this might be chemicals, it might be physical stressors like Professor Hazel talked about different workplace settings,

149
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,540
whether it's extreme heat, vibration and so forth.

150
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,600
For the most part,

151
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:17,380
A levels of exposure within a workplace setting are orders of magnitude higher than what's typically encountered in a community setting,

152
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:21,580
whether we're outdoors, in a park, in a public place or inside our own homes.

153
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:30,790
Uh, interestingly, these are the levels that are often used in animal models of exposure.

154
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:36,640
So this is a big challenge. Animal models of exposure are really useful.

155
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,090
They're very helpful for people that do that type of research.

156
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:48,010
Uh, the tricky point and the value of that animal model is how translatable it is to people.

157
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:53,440
And one of the important criteria in the study design is, well,

158
00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:00,790
how relevant is the level of exposure that was used in that animal model and so many animal models?

159
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:10,150
Plus you will adopt, uh, kind of the maximum levels of exposure that have been documented to occur in a workplace setting.

160
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,210
That's kind of the starting point for that. But that animal models.

161
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:25,450
And then if we again look at community levels, usually those exposure levels are much lower compared to a workplace setting.

162
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:31,749
And these this is even after adjusting for exposure over a 24 hour time period.

163
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:38,280
Right. Whereas an occupational exposure might take place over only a few hours a day, uh,

164
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:43,690
and then again multiplied by seven days per week of that person over their entire lifetime.

165
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:54,460
Uh, talking a little bit about, uh, method beginning to talk a little bit about methodology,

166
00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:02,230
but then also accuracy in contrasting between a workplace setting and a community setting.

167
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:12,220
So as a positive aspect, uh, in terms of methods that are available to us for assessing exposure within a workplace,

168
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,110
we're often able to assess a real person, a real life person.

169
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:23,350
We know a lot about them. We can document perhaps their history in that workplace.

170
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,649
Uh, so we have a reasonable ability to determine if exposures,

171
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:35,400
our assessment of exposures are actually representative of that person or perhaps their coworkers.

172
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,040
We can make direct measurements with with relative ease.

173
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,400
Right. As part of the person's job. Whether it's initiated by the employer or some external body.

174
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,230
Uh, usually there are requirements in place through standards or regulations.

175
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,520
And so for the most part, it's pretty easy to go in and make direct measurements.

176
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:05,010
And that's, again, our highest quality of data available to us, which is going to result in more accurate assessment of exposures.

177
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,169
And then like we talked about a little bit on the previous couple of slides in the workplace,

178
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:17,430
it ends up being easier to account for those different exposure pathways that might be contributing.

179
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:26,680
Contrasting that again within a community setting, it's more difficult to make those direct investments.

180
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,340
We'll talk about this a little bit in the example that's coming up.

181
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:37,920
And to me, again, like you mentioned, pretty hard sometimes to account for all of the possible exposure pathways that might be contributing.

182
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,790
All right. So really quickly here, actually a note on accuracy.

183
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:54,390
So what is the difference between accuracy for precision and how this comes into play

184
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:59,790
when we're assessing exposures and when we have some of these direct measurements?

185
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:05,129
So there are four different scenarios here where this might be,

186
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:11,430
how our data looks in regard to the true value, right, which would be inside the red circle.

187
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:18,480
And the further out those points go, the further away they get from that true value.

188
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:34,020
These are four different data sets represented here that indicate both precision and accuracy and whether there might be some bias involved or not.

189
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:45,420
So what would be our preferred? Which of these schemes would be our preferred data if we were able to choose?

190
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:55,460
And let's let's name was number one, two, three, four, three, three.

191
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:59,880
Okay, let's say three. Right. So yeah, absolutely. For a couple of reasons.

192
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:06,360
One, it's very precise. Right. All of these data points are weighing very close to one another.

193
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:13,200
And it's also very accurate, either lying or what we know to be the true value.

194
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,970
So that's a relatively easy one.

195
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:26,460
Getting a little bit more challenging is what you folks think would be our second preferred rank of data outcome here.

196
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:34,520
For some suggestions for one. Any others?

197
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,310
Four or over four.

198
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,860
Was also fought for. Okay. Good for.

199
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,380
All right. So, yeah. So actually, I would say it's probably a tie.

200
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:56,140
So one and four would be our maybe equally preferred second choice.

201
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:06,480
So in the case of data outcome one over here, uh, on the downside, the data is not very precise, right?

202
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:14,740
There's a pretty big spread. However, uh, it's still relatively accurate if we take an average of all those data.

203
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,280
It's pretty much line right on our own true value.

204
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,300
So accuracy is good. It's just a little bit imprecise.

205
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:33,530
So the uncertainty around that is exposure assessment would just be a little bit larger right around our true value over here for number four.

206
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:42,280
This is a little bit of a different scenario. We have the benefit of still maintaining like like scenario three, some really precise data.

207
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:46,480
Right. We're just getting on the same values over and over and over again.

208
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,790
That's a positive thing. That's good. However, there's there's some definite bias here.

209
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,410
We're off target or we're off of a known value.

210
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:06,680
But in the case where we have precise data and we can document pretty well how far off it is, it offers a good opportunity to apply it.

211
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:18,940
So for those reasons, I would say one and four would probably be kind of tied for second for a preferred exposure assessment data outcome.

212
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:26,320
And then of course, scenario two, here would be our lowest preference of outcome data.

213
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:33,220
In this case, it's not very precise. Right. We have a pretty big spread in these results and it's biased.

214
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,240
Right. We see it veering off here to the top, right.

215
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,710
From the known value of this. Okay. Excellent work.

216
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:51,159
Thank you. All right. So let's jump into an example just to kind of help us, uh, see what,

217
00:24:51,160 --> 00:25:01,360
what types of opportunities as well as challenges might even present comparing an occupational setting of exposure as well as a community setting.

218
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,959
And we'll actually kind of refer to this example through both class periods.

219
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,560
We'll look at it today as we talk through some of these direct monitoring methods for assessing exposure.

220
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,580
And we'll talk about that third Thursday as well when we look at some of the indirect methods.

221
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:22,890
Okay. And excuse me, so we've got Person A here who works in a lead smelter, right?

222
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:28,120
So this is the facility depicted in the diagram here.

223
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:38,890
We also have Person B who lives in a community nearby that surrounds that led smelting facility.

224
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:45,310
So how can we do personal exposure monitoring on these two individuals?

225
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,990
And this is actually going to be a real question for you.

226
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:56,290
And I'm going to I think we have time. Let's do a quick five minute break up.

227
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,580
I'll let you guys self-select into groups of, say, three or four.

228
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:05,740
I'll give you one minute to go ahead and do that, and then I will assign groups.

229
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:19,420
I'll say these groups are tasked with looking at how do we assess exposure in that worker for person and other groups per person B in that community.

230
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:30,280
So go ahead and take like 30 seconds and self-selected to work and then I can assign a school teacher them.

231
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:40,900
Yeah. Yeah, that would be.

232
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,340
I know. All right.

233
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,460
So let's go ahead and have the two groups on the sides.

234
00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:04,210
You folks and you folks work on person. So talk about what types of personal exposure monitoring you can do on the worker within that led smelter.

235
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,000
And then I think I see three groups here right down the middle.

236
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:12,640
Why don't you all talk about person B and what opportunities there might be for personal exposure monitoring?

237
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:30,380
We'll take 5 minutes and then we'll go ahead and reconvene on the smoking measures for any specific financial situation.

238
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:39,400
Personal. So my clients budget, it's like for me it's like, yeah, more like.

239
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:49,470
And I'm like, monitor.

240
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:55,760
It's like it's like like different story.

241
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:09,940
I mean, I think it was a Christmas Carol or something or someone for personal reasons to keep the water.

242
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,480
That's cool person. That's a nice thing.

243
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:25,710
So they can tell in real time where they are and how it's like it's just so loud when they come in.

244
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:43,220
Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's what's really helpful to know if it's like in the 20th century to see how much hope they like.

245
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:50,139
You can see your clothes and things like that,

246
00:28:50,140 --> 00:29:04,200
but it's a very different space or something like that is that is physically in looking where the external thing or you know,

247
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:10,600
they could do that large data collection filters.

248
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:21,660
So once they know like we concentrations areas grow so we might see to see how much time

249
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:27,450
is spending in each area so much as it's like if there's a stationary on like a sedan.

250
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:33,340
Because we do like whether each time they spend time to make sure out to be like

251
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:43,120
during the season and duration of residency that if somebody should change clothes,

252
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:52,680
they always want to make a presumption.

253
00:29:54,310 --> 00:30:05,650
So what are they doing that would be like getting your lunch green in one or two steps we have to take from

254
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:28,510
the first day of the year to use like in dress one how much dietary habits like to ones what she wants.

255
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:47,070
Yeah. So I could understand what it would be like a better option maybe.

256
00:30:47,080 --> 00:31:16,690
Or is it about the personal frame is interesting to like see more of a general group or individual products are very careful to think that maybe

257
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:43,810
health and education degree is going to be something reasons people should just look out for people usually use because this person is good.

258
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:58,360
Oh, they just did. Here. I think it was like, okay, the laptop takes like all inclusive.

259
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:09,750
All right, let's go ahead and reconvene. You can actually actually do this.

260
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:15,680
Let's go ahead and start with the two groups who are assigned to Person A.

261
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,220
So within that workplace setting, what are some, uh,

262
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:27,520
personal goals or monitoring opportunities that we might consider for person and I'll let you come up with.

263
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:37,470
Are you guys got the easy one? Definitely going to come up with something here.

264
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:50,750
Do you measures on biomarkers and could like a 20 day half life in blood collected blood.

265
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,420
Okay, so a blood sample might be a good one. What else?

266
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:01,070
Yes, he said you can also use like a personal external monitor while at work.

267
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:07,610
Okay. So you might assess what how much led in the air, perhaps, that they're being exposed to.

268
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:17,360
Excellent. The others we also discussed, like airflow and the engineering of the building.

269
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:27,410
Okay. Looking at that and then looking at like PPE or hand-washing or like equipment that the individual.

270
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:34,190
Okay. So other mitigating perhaps mitigating factors that might impact their exposure.

271
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,470
So those are those are good examples, but they wouldn't be personal exposure monitoring.

272
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:46,850
Those might be some indirect methods that might help us further articulate our our exposure assessment.

273
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,440
Okay. Nice, nice job to the folks studying person, eh?

274
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,130
Now to the tough one. What about person B?

275
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:59,360
What did you all come up with for opportunities? For personal exposure monitoring?

276
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:15,360
Anything in it. Anything and everything. Such as our group was thinking we could use monitors to see stationary responded to.

277
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:20,280
Like the ground in the air, the water. Stuff happening.

278
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:24,770
Okay. So these would be the term to describe. That would be an area source.

279
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:31,459
And right then, for the most part, those are stationary. That would be a good surrogate measure.

280
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:37,640
And in this case, it wouldn't be a personal exposure matter, but it would be a direct measure.

281
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:46,200
What other ideas did you come up with? We had testing for water.

282
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,330
How long? Like cold water they're drinking from.

283
00:34:49,900 --> 00:35:00,100
Okay, so you might be able to not just quantify how much they're drinking, but actually test the levels of lead in the water.

284
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:06,850
Okay. You get personal exposure and prevent any others.

285
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:22,630
Okay. So. So thanks to everyone, the lack of responses or the limited responses for person B is kind of indicative of the challenge here, right?

286
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,960
This is a take home message within that workplace setting.

287
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,669
There's going to be opportunities that are going to be easier to implement for making actual

288
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:37,750
personal exposure measurements on an individual or person with within a community setting.

289
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:43,450
It's going to be much more challenging. So let's walk through some of those.

290
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:51,040
So we already did this. And the potential exposure pathways that you've already talked about,

291
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:59,830
a couple maybe there talked about ingestion, drinking water, about two different exposure routes.

292
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,580
And for that, it can be pretty complicated.

293
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:13,330
So I think we looked at, uh, one of the water disinfection byproducts and how those exposure pathways can be so challenging.

294
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:18,049
This is also the case for a lot. All right.

295
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:24,880
So let's step through a little bit more detail around this exposure scenario, Aaron.

296
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:31,340
Person and person B, so contrasting that occupational setting with more of a community setting.

297
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:38,270
So person A and again, the group over here that mentioned blood lead levels,

298
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:48,140
perhaps there's a workplace surveillance program where twice a year, if they're concerned, which would make sense, they work in a lead smelter.

299
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:53,030
We're concerned about exposures. We can monitor blood lead levels and workers.

300
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:58,670
So this would be great data to help us assess Person A's exposure.

301
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:04,670
There are some, uh, uh, confidentiality.

302
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:12,470
We need consent from that individual, right? We were exposure assessment workers coming into this environment.

303
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:21,560
And so we need consent from the individual or perhaps from the facility itself to access those records.

304
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:31,100
However, lucky for us, that consent was provided so we can use that blood level data to help us assess what exposure might be.

305
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:38,479
This is a personal exposure measurement and a direct measurement of exposure for person B,

306
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,320
you know, in that community they've never had a blood lead level measured.

307
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:47,870
Uh, they happen to be terrified of needles and this would totally be me.

308
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:56,059
So they refuse to even participate in a blood draw. So there's no biological monitoring available for this person.

309
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,630
And this is this is a common challenge in community settings.

310
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:10,490
So if a person, A, we have this data and we might indicate those blood lead levels and compare them to recommended limits.

311
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:20,480
Right? Uh, we know after accessing, getting consent and accessing the data, their blood at that level is 30 micrograms per deciliter.

312
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:29,270
If we compare that, uh, to a recommendation that says, hey, it should be 25 or less.

313
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:39,100
And so by comparing that, we would determine that this person has a high level of exposure to person B Uh,

314
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,800
we've got, you know, zero information out of this scenario.

315
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:52,570
Uh, one of the limits of biomarkers and Professor Meeker is going to come back a little bit later in the semester and,

316
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:56,179
and give an entire lecture on, on biomarkers themselves.

317
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:05,660
So we'll go into a lot more detail. But [INAUDIBLE] highlight, uh, this is a limitation of biomarkers.

318
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:14,810
They are a direct measurement. They are a personal exposure measurement on an individual for assessing exposure.

319
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,580
They can do a good job of an accurate assessment of what exposure was.

320
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:26,600
They do have a limit, though, in informing us about what the source of the light might be.

321
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:31,309
All we know is that the person received, they were exposed.

322
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:36,500
They received a dose internal to their body and they have this blood lead levels to prove

323
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:43,040
that that dose was received and they've been exposed just from that biomarker sample.

324
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,379
We don't know whether it came from that.

325
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:54,470
It was in the lab, was in the air that they breathe, was in some other skin contact that came into play, whatever it might be.

326
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:09,500
There is something called PDK or physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling that might help to estimate, uh, what their exposure might be.

327
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:17,780
And it helps if we have like an idea, if we suspect that it's coming from right and the route is through inhalation.

328
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:25,200
We won't need to go into detail on how people became model works.

329
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:30,840
I mentioned Professor Mika will come back and talk more specifically about our biomarkers but

330
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:36,659
make by making some assumptions and also based on the type of biomarker data that we have,

331
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:42,930
whether it's one we can also assess lead levels in bone.

332
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:56,910
Um, and based on some of the target organs that might be containing lead, we can use things like nails, perhaps theses based on some of these things.

333
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:04,860
We can kind of work backwards using this data to help inform what that exposure might

334
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:09,090
be and what that ultimate source of lead in the facility could have come from.

335
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:21,680
Okay. So we talked about a question. So with somebody who works there, presumably they might live close to the factory as well.

336
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,370
So is that ever taken? And when we get even more complicated, right?

337
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,410
Yeah, great question.

338
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:35,380
So I work in the facility, but when I'm not working, I basically have a similar scenario as Person B that I live in that nearby community.

339
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,850
So my exposure perhaps doesn't end at the end of my work shift.

340
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:47,590
Excellent point. And this is where it gets challenging, but it's not like covertly added to occupational therapy.

341
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:55,360
No, it's not. Yeah. I mean, the occupational settings, the standards, the limits and so forth are for that workplace setting.

342
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:05,299
That's a great question and a great point. So we we just talked about an example of biological monitoring in this scenario.

343
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:10,760
Right, of one of the direct methods. Excuse me, let's look at personal monitoring.

344
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:18,620
So some of these external measures on an individual that are also considered direct methods that might be available in this scenario.

345
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:31,900
All right. So we've learned that within the lead smelting facility that the company measures time weighted

346
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:41,260
average concentration of airborne lead every six months using personal air sampling pumps.

347
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:54,100
So in this case, a worker puts on a pump with a tube filter coming up into their breathing zone and they wear that during their work shift.

348
00:42:54,520 --> 00:43:03,100
And that gives some estimate of exposure. We learned that Person A has never actually worn one of these problems.

349
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,760
Right. It's ended up being other coworkers that have worn it.

350
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:20,440
But if enough of the coworkers have done this, we have a significant kind of representative, uh, data of numbers of samples collected.

351
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:25,100
Uh, this might allow us to actually utilize this.

352
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:34,300
The coworkers that are doing the same tasks at the same shift as Person A, we might be able to use this data to estimate Person A's exposure.

353
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:48,670
Assuming that she behaves similarly and comes into equal exposure during the course of completing her tasks for person B Uh, they said, no way.

354
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:56,140
I'm not going to like put that thing on me and walk out into public, into my own workplace.

355
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:00,870
I go visit my family and friends while wearing this.

356
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,220
You know, you're only giving me 25 bucks. It's not worth my time.

357
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:09,100
It's going to draw a bunch of unwanted attention to me. Uh, no, thank you.

358
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:18,040
And this is comment rights for compliance. Uh, and getting someone in a community setting to wear a personal monitoring device.

359
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And again, we'd be asking them to wear it pretty much 24 hours a night.

360
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,480
So what other options are there?

361
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:34,660
There are these swab kids that are less burdensome, less intrusive that we might be able to collect in might for environments where they spend time.

362
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:43,790
Right. Maybe in their home, in their car, perhaps in their workplace, whatever it might be that might give us, um, estimates.

363
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:49,240
These would be, uh, these would be more on the lines of like an area measurement.

364
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:56,530
Right. Uh, but it would give us some actual real data that's related to where that person spends their time.

365
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,330
So in the case of Person A for personal monitoring,

366
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:12,230
we could use those time weighted average measurements using those personal sampling calls from the coworkers.

367
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:16,610
As long as we know that those coworkers were doing similar activities right.

368
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:24,110
We could perhaps assign an average of all those measurements as a way to estimate what person A's exposures are.

369
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:33,320
And again, you know, person B, we are still in a difficult spot trying to come up with some exposure estimates because they simply are,

370
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:37,790
you know, refusing to wear this personal airpods.

371
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:50,610
All right. So in terms of these results for Person A, we have a couple of different direct measurements, right?

372
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:57,940
We have that internal dose overlay from the blood lead level, the biomarker sample.

373
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:06,460
And if we can maybe have a good PDK model available to us, we might be able to to assess,

374
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,440
you know, the source of that exposure or at least the route of exposure.

375
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:22,000
But we also have right separate from the biomarker, we also have the ear monitor and the personal ear monitoring to Woodstock, my coworkers.

376
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:27,940
So we have two different estimates of of exposure to this person to person.

377
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:35,080
So this is really powerful in this case. Now, what we can actually do is kind of a validation exercise.

378
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:40,150
We can compare these two independent, direct methods of estimating exposure.

379
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:50,490
This would give a lot of confidence in and reduce the uncertainty by having these two independent estimates of what athletics to be.

380
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:53,770
Again, you know, for person B, it's the same old story.

381
00:46:54,310 --> 00:47:03,390
We didn't have any direct methods available, wasn't willing to participate in a blood draw, wasn't willing to do the personal monitoring.

382
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:07,660
So we need to think creatively, try something else.

383
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:14,470
And again, we'll, we'll talk a bit more about what some of the options might be for person B in Thursday's class period.

384
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:25,149
All right. So that was a maybe a little bit of a silly example, but a real example, you know, within this light smelting facility,

385
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:34,150
having a worker but then also a relevant community is nearby the smelter where it might be concerned about community level exposures to lead.

386
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,770
Like I said on Thursday,

387
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:44,960
we'll come back to this example as we look at some of the specifically indirect methods that might be available for assessing exposure.

388
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:54,850
So I want to shift gears a little bit and talk about exposure data and some of the important considerations,

389
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:00,159
starting with if we're concerned about errors in our data.

390
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:00,390
Right.

391
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:09,100
We talked about a few slides back about having some data that's accurate, some that's not biased, some of it's precise, some of it's imprecise, etc.

392
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:19,370
So how to help inform us of whether we are close to that true value or not and how representative the data is.

393
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:27,010
So like for Person A's example, where there wasn't actually personal monitoring using the air pumps for that worker,

394
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:32,440
but her coworkers had real data collected. Right. And we determined that it's representative.

395
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:36,700
So we would know that that's useful to estimate Person A's exposure.

396
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:41,409
So knowing who collected the data will step through.

397
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:45,070
Each of these, for example, is important.

398
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:50,470
What type of data was collected? When was the data collected?

399
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,240
Where was the data collected? Why was it collected?

400
00:48:55,420 --> 00:49:00,970
What was the purpose of doing the sampling in the first place? And then methodologically, how was it actually collected?

401
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:12,980
So we often end up with this with two primary distributions of exposure data.

402
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:21,080
One is a normal distribution, which is kind of indicated in the plot over here to the right on the top.

403
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:30,110
We have this symmetrical shape. It's common for many natural phenomena of measures.

404
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:43,730
Uh, it's, uh, takes into account or is, is dictated by sampling flow rate variations and analytical errors that are common.

405
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:49,040
Uh, in the laboratory, our chemical assay, for example.

406
00:49:49,910 --> 00:50:01,100
But what this ends up giving us is a symmetrically shaped distribution of data that kind of spreads out both to the low end and the higher end.

407
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:09,530
Another type of statistical distribution is one with this log in normal where we see, uh,

408
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:19,220
perhaps a level of exposure that surrounds the true or common value, uh, but then tails off to the right.

409
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:29,149
So in this case, it would be positively skewed to this type of statistical distribution is very common in exposure assessment,

410
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:33,710
both within occupational settings as well as within community settings.

411
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:44,480
And some of the reasons for it is variations in time, rate of exposures, variations from person to person,

412
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:50,900
and then also variations from place to place end up being the important drivers that

413
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:56,720
can lead to this log normally distributed data that's positively due to the rate.

414
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:04,100
So what's what's the point? Why do we care about statistical distribution and why is it happen?

415
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:08,150
So for a couple of different reasons, for descriptive reasons.

416
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:20,890
So you know what type of a summary of the data, uh, gives the best representation of being able to describe that data for statistical reasons.

417
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:23,060
Right. So we're going to want to do a statistical test.

418
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:30,650
Is the level significantly higher for this person than that person or this occupation and that occupation, etc.?

419
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:39,140
And the validity of the statistical test is dependent upon a particular type of distribution of data.

420
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:48,080
And then there are some epidemiologic issues. So, you know, a big part of this class is exposure, science and health.

421
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:50,000
So it's both pieces of it.

422
00:51:50,120 --> 00:52:01,430
We're interested in assessing exposures for the purpose of what are the associations with with health or outcomes on the other side of that model.

423
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:16,350
So the nature of the relationship between exposure and health outcome is also influenced by, importantly, by the statistical distribution of data.

424
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:25,490
We talked about that here. Also an example of analytical errors from chemical assays.

425
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:35,780
Right. So this is a common type of scenario where a sample was collected and then it's analyzed later in a lab setting.

426
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:41,719
Or it might be a direct reading instrument where we have this monitor that has a digital readout.

427
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:48,320
Right. And every 10 seconds it updates, it's able to not just collect the sample, but analyze the sample almost in real time.

428
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:59,910
So there are some concepts of limits of detection that are also important to be able to understand conceptually what what these are.

429
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:04,950
There are some measurements that are truly non detectable, right?

430
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:09,540
So I have, you know, some really cool sensor up here. I'm waving it around in the room.

431
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:18,060
It has a digital readout and every few seconds it displays a value and it might just say zero.

432
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:27,090
So that that means that whatever we're trying to measure is not detectable in reality,

433
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:31,980
the value, the true value of what we're trying to measure is not zero.

434
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:37,770
It's probably some very, very small level, but it's not zero.

435
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:47,050
It's just that the limit of detection in this case of our sensor isn't able to go down below a certain threshold.

436
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:56,700
Right. It's going to take a level of a certain value before our monitor registers with its lowest reading of one, whatever that number might be.

437
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:02,070
But in this case, we we are because we're informed.

438
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:13,280
We assume even when we can't detect a value, we assume the true level to not be zero.

439
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:25,170
It's some number above zero. Another aspect of limit of detection is what is actually referred to as the detection limit of an instrument.

440
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:30,180
So this is a quantified and or known amount.

441
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,510
What the smallest amount is that that measurement device or that instrument can measure?

442
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,230
This would be the same as the threshold for like that, for the example of that direct to reading instrument.

443
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:48,420
So this is something that we would know either by kind of determining on our own through laboratory experiments,

444
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:53,420
or what's more common is if it's a commercially available sensor, right?

445
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:56,400
The manufacturer would have already quantified what that is.

446
00:54:56,670 --> 00:55:03,220
It's usually part of their marketing and sales is that, hey, we have detection limits all the way down to 0.5, right?

447
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:08,070
So we would know, okay, we have a device that can measure down to 0.5.

448
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:13,770
If we expect the level in this classroom, it's never even going to reach 0.5.

449
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:20,489
That's kind of a waste of money for us to buy this monitor. And it's not going to give us we're never actually going to measure anything.

450
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:27,000
And the value is always going to be below the detection and that we need to search for another monitor

451
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:34,470
that's more applicable to our scenario for other types of sampling devices that aren't direct reading,

452
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:34,980
right?

453
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:43,520
So let's say we use the case where we have a filter and we're drawing air through the filter and we're measuring it over the entire class period.

454
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:48,239
Right? We take that filter back to the laboratory and we analyze it.

455
00:55:48,240 --> 00:56:00,720
Or in the case of our example here for lab, so our detection limit, our ability to take the lead that that level goes gets lower and lower and lower.

456
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,330
But the longer that we sample for, right?

457
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:13,020
So if we only sample for an hour versus that we sample for let's say 10 hours, we're going to accumulate a lot more lag on the filter.

458
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:18,390
So it's going to increase the chances dramatically that when we take that filter back to the laboratory,

459
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,320
we're going to be able to detect and quantify that value.

460
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:33,060
So in that case, we have a greater detection limit or a lower limit of detection with an increased duration of sampling.

461
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:35,620
Let's see.

462
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:49,620
Question Down here at the bottom, do we expect more measurements less than the limit of detection in occupational settings or in community settings?

463
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:55,290
Used community settings? Absolutely right. So again,

464
00:56:55,290 --> 00:57:03,360
we kind of started a few minutes ago by talking about how some of the highest exposure levels are typically occurring in occupational settings.

465
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:05,429
So it might not be an issue.

466
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:14,160
And this is also common is that there is a device that measures that in the air and it works really well in occupational settings because it's it's

467
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:23,790
designed limit of detection is perfectly in line with the types of airborne concentrations that are typical of some of the workplace settings.

468
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,610
We take that monitor and apply to any settings.

469
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:32,220
We might just get a bunch of values that are below this limit of detection, which isn't going to be very helpful.

470
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:39,959
All right. So who collected the measurements? Why might this be important?

471
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:45,360
Why would we want to know this? There are a couple of different scenarios.

472
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,020
We're collecting measurements. Perhaps it's a compliance.

473
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:54,650
Officer. Right. So someone from OSHA.

474
00:57:54,920 --> 00:58:04,490
Right. So Occupational Safety and Health Administration might come into a workplace and conduct some measurements.

475
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:09,380
Alternatively, we might have individual companies.

476
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:14,270
Right. Like that led smelter to go ahead and conduct their own measurements.

477
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:20,630
Or we might have, you know, people like us, we're designing a study, we're asking for access.

478
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:24,049
We're going to go in and make our own measurements. So why is it important?

479
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:32,690
Why would we differentiate between who it is it's making well for a compliance officer or a regulator know they might be going in.

480
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:39,780
They don't get the measure very often and they want to make sure they're catching whatever might be going on that's wrong.

481
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,720
Right. It is a safety. A concert.

482
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:53,020
So they're going to go to the highest risk task or microenvironment within that facility and make measurements there.

483
00:58:53,200 --> 00:59:01,960
Right. It might only be that one task out of 50 at the facility that actually has high lead levels, for example.

484
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:07,300
But in this case, it might it might result in kind of like the worst case scenario.

485
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,470
They're going right for what might be the worst in this facility.

486
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:18,070
And then, you know, if we are then trying to assess exposures for everyone in that facility,

487
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:23,890
those measurements are probably not going to be very representative. Right. Because it's only representing kind of worst case.

488
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:30,400
It might be a flip scenario where we have individual companies that are doing this.

489
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:40,450
They're required to collect data to kind of report data to report any safety concerns where values inside the facility are exceeding a set limit.

490
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:48,590
This might be in the opposite direction where they they know where the concern might be.

491
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:49,239
So you know what?

492
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:56,560
We're we're going to kind of steer away from these particular tasks, but we think there might be actual high levels of light in the air.

493
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:00,370
And instead we'll monitor some of the other tests and report that data.

494
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:06,490
So that might result in kind of some best case scenario where we have very low levels of exposure.

495
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:13,930
But again, if we're trying to investigate what are the exposures of the folks that work in this facility, they might not be representative.

496
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:18,460
And then, you know, researchers say we're going to give ourselves some credit here.

497
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:26,049
We know what we're doing. We can exert a lot of control over how the measurements are made and which tasks.

498
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:35,110
And we would do them very purposefully so that the measurements that we do get are representative of the workers in this facility.

499
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:39,729
On the plus side, right, we're going to come away with good data.

500
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:50,430
That's representative on the negative side. And this is kind of a self dig is that researchers tend to be more cost and resource intensive.

501
01:00:50,440 --> 01:01:00,230
So a lot of expense to carry out. So some of the sampling strategy questions we might ask.

502
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:04,500
So why was the sampling performed right?

503
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:07,710
Was it to comply with regulations?

504
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:13,649
So in this case, we're only looking to see does it and does it clear a limit?

505
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:18,930
Is it above a safety value or regardless of whether it's above or below a safety value?

506
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:23,080
Do we just simply want to characterize what the exposure readings are?

507
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:28,620
Who was the sampling performed on and where was the sampling performed?

508
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:33,660
So was it random, right? Which individuals did we select?

509
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:35,500
Or was it systematic?

510
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:41,910
Did we have some particular rhyme or reason for which individuals wanted to market, or was it selected right where we just said like,

511
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:48,660
Hey, I know, I know these three people, so I'm going to ask them because they're going to be pretty friendly about the whole thing.

512
01:01:50,550 --> 01:02:00,780
When was the sampling performed? So there could be some auto correlation due to a true cyclical nature of the of the exposure.

513
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:13,500
Let's see. For example, the task that results in a pretty high exposure is only performed at a facility on one day, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.

514
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:21,690
And we kind of come up with our sampling strategy and we say, all right, we have access to the facility on Mondays and Wednesdays.

515
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:25,710
On Monday, we're going to capture that exposure because they're performing the test.

516
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:31,469
On Wednesday, we're going to get some low values because they're not performing that perhaps we don't know that.

517
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:38,970
Right. So this is going to be this is going to cause some grief in our sample collection and our eventual data.

518
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:45,210
And then how many samples were collected. Right. If we go in on Monday and collect one, go in on Wednesday and collect one,

519
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:53,370
that's really not going to be representative enough to know with good level of confidence what that exposure is to folks.

520
01:02:53,760 --> 01:03:02,000
We're going to have to repeat these measures over a significant amount of times or to be represented in.

521
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:15,490
So the takeaway from some of this is that there are some practices that can result in an underestimation of the true exposure.

522
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:24,910
One of those scenarios might be where we take current measurements, we go into a facility, this light smelting facility,

523
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:33,100
for example, we measure the light in the air and we say, okay, now we have a measure of what the lead is in the air.

524
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:39,070
We're trying to estimate, say, chronic exposures of over time to the worker.

525
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:43,630
They work at this facility their whole working life for the last 30 years.

526
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:48,190
So we say, okay, we have this measurement on them. It's a direct measurement of personal measurement.

527
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:52,060
It's 0.5. They've worked there for 30 years.

528
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:57,760
So can we take 0.5 and assume that's been their exposure for the last 30 years?

529
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:06,070
That wouldn't be a good, good assumption, right? Because likely their exposures were higher in the past, generally speaking,

530
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:11,320
because of regulation and standards, working conditions have improved over time.

531
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:19,000
So we made we took this approach. This might provide an underestimate of what that person's true exposure was over 30 years or so.

532
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:26,350
Again, you know, the example of the employer actually conducting the sampling.

533
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:31,930
You know, they're looking for some of those best case scenarios. They want to kind of avoid where the levels might be high.

534
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:42,160
This could also be underestimating what the true exposure is and actually kind of both whether it's the employer or the employee.

535
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:52,390
And then on the flip side are some scenarios where we might overestimate what the true exposure is.

536
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:55,620
So again, this is, you know,

537
01:04:55,630 --> 01:05:06,220
maybe like that that regulator who comes in externally sampling in places where they think exposures might be set in place.

538
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:10,240
Right. They're going to capture that specific for that specific location.

539
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:17,020
But then take that data and say this is the amount of exposure to all of the employees in the facility,

540
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:21,100
but it's going to be an overestimate of what you exposure is.

541
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:28,569
And then again, you know, three sampling of only jobs previously noted to be exposed.

542
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:35,020
Right. We're concerned about this task. It was high previously, so we're gonna go back and monitor that one.

543
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:43,120
That's going to give us an overestimation of the true exposure within the facility and kind of converse to the example we just talked about.

544
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:50,380
Let's say we're estimating exposure to a worker, a current employee in the facility.

545
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:56,350
We don't have any measurements available to us. We can't go in and make new measurements now.

546
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:59,890
But there was data collected going back 30 years ago.

547
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:08,260
That would likely result overestimation of that person's current exposure within the facility again,

548
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:11,980
because likely conditions have improved over time.

549
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:24,610
And then there are some scenarios where an employee who, instead of trying to avoid areas that might trigger an alert because the levels are too high,

550
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:28,480
perhaps they're really concerned about their exposure, right?

551
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:35,270
They're asked to wear a personal monitor like one day, and they've been concerned for the last two years.

552
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:42,280
This particular task, they're doing so now instead of they're exhibiting their usual behavior with carrying out the task,

553
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:47,620
they're now kind of hovering right really in this is my only chance of collecting this data.

554
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:49,570
I want to make sure that it captures it right.

555
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:56,620
And so this could bias it and actually result in overestimation of what the true exposure is on a typical day.

556
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:04,450
Any any questions so far? I feel like I'm going slide the slide here pretty quickly.

557
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:15,060
Okay. Fair enough. So personal exposure, some considerations from point sources.

558
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:22,690
This one is the challenge in the case of large scale disasters.

559
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:31,110
These can be pretty difficult to quantify exposures resulting from them because they're generally not announced.

560
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:37,320
Right. We don't have any advance warning and they're usually a single brief occurrence.

561
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:44,010
So there's not any time to kind of like run out quick and get some sort of measurement of that exposure.

562
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:52,210
However, routine exposures, uh, are much easier to to quantify, right?

563
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:58,050
They're generally a continuous occurrence. Even better if it's from one particular source.

564
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:08,820
And even if exposures are lower under this case, we it's easier for us to measure and quantify and get good exposure estimates.

565
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:12,880
So those are point sources.

566
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:22,149
Now, if we if we talk about the same scenario, but looking at some diffuse sources in this case, you know, some of these routine exposures,

567
01:08:22,150 --> 01:08:29,020
again, where there are continuous but there might also be many sources, which can be a little bit complicating.

568
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:40,689
So, for example, air pollution from vehicle exhaust, pesticides from yield drift, methylmercury that's in fish,

569
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:49,120
chlorinated solids and drinking water uses in furniture and then lead paint chips.

570
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:57,889
And then coming back around to the some of the biological monitoring.

571
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:04,850
And again, like I mentioned, Professor Mead will come back and and talk in pretty good detail later in the semester around biomarkers.

572
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:13,560
But we have, you know, a couple of different options available. One very common one is a blood or serum, right?

573
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,890
So this might be used to measure alcohol level.

574
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:24,610
So exposure to things like blood or that we talked about or mercury or perhaps even some of the organic

575
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:31,250
chlorine or flame retardants similar to what Professor Breen discussed in that TED talk last time.

576
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:38,300
And there's also some urinary markers as well for urine biomarkers, things like arsenic.

577
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:49,100
There's a there's other types of biomarkers or which we talked mostly about, about blood through our examples here.

578
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:57,650
But there are some pretty noninvasive ones. There are some spectroscopy approaches to also characterize lead, for example.

579
01:09:57,650 --> 01:10:07,070
But in bone, things like toenails can serve as a good estimate of exposure of some contaminants,

580
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:16,580
especially toxic metals that pad measurements and then also exhaled breath.

581
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:28,430
So this is a little bit rhetorical, only to assess for exposures is the biomarkers, right?

582
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:33,110
And this gives us all the information we want. No, that's not.

583
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:36,710
They are really good. Absolutely.

584
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:44,540
The advantage here is that it is quantifying what the actual dose received was right.

585
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:55,339
We have a pretty high confidence estimate of what someone's exposure was through the use of biomarkers, and this is the primary advantage.

586
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:59,300
We're able to demonstrate that exposure has occurred.

587
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:08,060
It also is an actual advantage that it integrates over all of the exposure routes for the most part.

588
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:17,659
Right. So if we're looking at like the phone or and what it's doing a pretty good job of characterizing which land was inhaled,

589
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:22,400
which lead was ingested, and combining them all into one total dose.

590
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:31,230
Some of the limitations. So the primary one is that it doesn't it just tells us that that dose was received.

591
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:43,910
It doesn't tell us where that might come from or even what the route of exposure was, was it inhale was ingested and so forth.

592
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:50,330
Think I'm getting a couple of examples here of methodologically.

593
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:56,450
So there are some passive approaches to monitoring that.

594
01:11:56,450 --> 01:12:00,050
These are both for air and for water.

595
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:04,700
I talked to a couple of examples about like a pump, right, that draws air.

596
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:12,050
That's actually an active sampler. I have an example here on the next slide, but contrasting that is with the passive sampler.

597
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:16,710
So in this case, there's no power demand. It doesn't need to be battery power.

598
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:21,080
It doesn't need to be like one time in order to operate if there's no active.

599
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:26,840
And these are pretty common. Here's a photo of a badge that someone's wearing.

600
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:29,239
It's kind of clipped to a collar in the beginning.

601
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:36,650
So there's a way to estimate exposure through direct measurements, perhaps to become a force in the air.

602
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:41,240
There's also, like a alluded to here, this active sampling approach.

603
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:48,920
So you can see the image here. The person wearing the monitor with the tune coming up for the sample inlet is also clipped.

604
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:57,589
They're breathing sound. But this is drawing in a known amount of it's quantified whether it's air or it could be

605
01:12:57,590 --> 01:13:04,940
water that goes through something like a filter that collects the contaminant of interest.

606
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:12,970
And like I mentioned previously, it's typically integrated for amount of time for the worker, it might be their work, right?

607
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:22,250
The downside is that these can be a little bit bulky or that they can't operate on a small battery.

608
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:25,909
They're too large where they actually need enough power to operate.

609
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:32,960
They need to be partly electricity source of electricity in this case, if that's all that's available technologically,

610
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:37,520
it might relegate us to areas like rehab at station or monitor view on the part

611
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:42,470
of the classroom versus all of us having our own individual personal standpoint.

612
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:49,760
Then some of the important information that we need to know, we're going to take that that filter that's collected in the breeding zone.

613
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:54,860
We're going to take it back to the laboratory, quantify it for the contaminant of concern.

614
01:13:55,290 --> 01:14:02,270
Right. We've been talking a lot about land, but there's some information we need to know in order to actually calculate the concentration.

615
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:10,370
The person when exposed to, we're going to need to know what was the flow rate of the air going through that pump while they were being sampled.

616
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:15,320
So it might be something like four liters of air per minute sample.

617
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:25,290
And then we also need to know how long they wore it for, for six and a half hours, because that was the duration of their work shift on task.

618
01:14:26,150 --> 01:14:36,620
So knowing the flow rate and the amount of time we can calculate the total volume of air that went through the filter, that would be our denominator.

619
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,700
The mass of LED that we quantified is our is on top.

620
01:14:41,450 --> 01:14:44,630
And so we might quantify mass of lead.

621
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:53,959
One micrograms per cubic meter of air sample would be how we would come up with that ambient concentration of exposure.

622
01:14:53,960 --> 01:15:01,460
There are some direct reading instruments that we talked about, right, where it's not just sampling the media,

623
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:08,540
it's actually able to analyze that that sample and report a value in real time.

624
01:15:08,990 --> 01:15:12,770
Some really common ones are things like temperature range.

625
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:21,920
Talked about some of these, right, a couple of days ago, noise, radiation, either some traditional examples of direct reading instruments.

626
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:31,489
More recently, as technology has evolved, we have some of these opportunities for for air monitoring, both for particulate and gases.

627
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:36,710
I think I have some images coming up of those. This is going back to some of those integrated measures.

628
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:43,610
But we do have some really cool approaches for particles specifically just to size select.

629
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:50,600
Remember the example of particles that are really big that that don't really get into our airways because our

630
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:56,450
nasal cavity or in our nose hairs and our mucous membranes do a good job of filtering out those particles.

631
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:00,910
But once they get small enough, they evade that defense mechanism.

632
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:04,729
It can get into our lower airways. So for assessing exposures,

633
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:10,160
we designed samplers that also kind of mimic our respiratory system so that

634
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:17,390
only letting particles of a certain size into the device to be collected up.

635
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:24,010
Here is some example of some of those direct reading instruments for corporate.

636
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:30,009
And then, you know, what are some of the advantages?

637
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:38,680
Why why would we want to have a direct meeting instrument technologically versus collecting an integrated sample?

638
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:44,140
And we came to talk you about this. A lot of the jury pool is that it gives us a lot of information.

639
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:49,660
Uh, it serves both space and time.

640
01:16:50,420 --> 01:17:00,309
Right. So if one of you wears an integrated personal sampler for a 24 hour period at the end of the 24 hour period, we we collect that filter.

641
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:05,920
We analyze it in the lab, and we come up with an average concentration that you're exposed to for 24 hours.

642
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:12,550
It's really hard to interpret that value to say, okay, we're in the course of 24 hours.

643
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:21,070
Did that exposure come from? If we have direct reading instruments that are able to report maybe on a one minute time scale,

644
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:25,300
it really allows us to investigate the temporal component.

645
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:33,220
Right. So how did your exposures vary over time? But then combining that with your personal activity, what were you doing in the morning?

646
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:39,399
What were you doing in the afternoon? Where were you? And allows this to to inform that space.

647
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:44,020
Right. What so what are the spatial differences within your exposure as well?

648
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,000
And then just a quick summary slide here.

649
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:57,490
And we're just about done based on our roots of exposure and our different pathways that we're concerned about.

650
01:17:57,850 --> 01:18:02,680
You know, we have some approaches for personal monitoring, for direct monitoring,

651
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:09,280
both for biomarkers, as well as for things like air and water and so forth,

652
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:19,270
to directly assess exposures both within workplace settings more challenging but still available technically within community settings.

653
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:25,670
I think that is my last slide is are there any questions from both before we break?

654
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:45,180
All right. Thanks so much. Have a great rest of your day, sir.

655
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:49,050
I think.
