1
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:15,220
So last week we'll talk about the resources and the resources and the resources is that

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,700
you can define you can identify the source of distress as most important sources.

3
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,480
A measure also already in the United States address this issues.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,329
We have the management, although we don't really resolve all the problems.

5
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,230
But yes, we do a very good job in terms of the policies.

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,920
But the issue we still have, whatever we have is not what I think about it.

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,880
My question was what other non points office think about what what do you consider non point sources?

8
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,830
Well, runoffs. Stormwater runoff. I was.

9
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,700
That feels. Net inflows and outflows, if you can consider it now twice those.

10
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,410
Okay. We're going to define identify the source of the pollution.

11
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:26,160
I was. Would you say like agricultural practices as a whole, or is that too related to runoff?

12
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,910
Yeah, that's that's that's agriculture is what took them off the map.

13
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:42,240
I guess a lot of incoming light can be focused on things like the census issues and others.

14
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:53,720
What conclusion? And the one of, like, carrying the sediments from the soil back and contaminated with gravity.

15
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,010
Yes. That's really for example, the we built all these highways.

16
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,960
Right. There are all these highways. We have the rain that can wash off.

17
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,250
And that's the non-point source. Okay.

18
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:14,870
That's a number important source. What about like animal people that are in, like, in two rivers or like house?

19
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,509
Yeah, that's half of the pollutants you can have about Source River from agriculture, from small farms.

20
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,960
Yes. That's mostly wild and wild animals. Yes.

21
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:39,170
And the other kinds of fertilizers used by households to fertilize and water their gardens.

22
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah, that's that's that's the one the source of pollutants.

23
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,110
But that's kind of built into the stormwater runoff.

24
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,980
Stormwater. I told you the stormwater. It's interesting.

25
00:02:51,990 --> 00:03:03,139
Right. Is, is a the when you think about the stormwater person who could be poisonous could be okay from the of from the

26
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:09,340
stormwater diffuse that's the place non-point sources like free stormwater collection they are for that proposal.

27
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,370
Okay sources I stormwater we don't really collect all the stormwater to get it out.

28
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:23,300
We don't click a positive thing okay some get wash off runoff that's that's the that's no point.

29
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:33,800
Okay. So a lot of what we discussed today was the non-point sources.

30
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:47,890
Vampires impasse is. Caused by the rainfalls come from many diffuse sources, of course, diffuse sources by way for the slow moving over to the ground.

31
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,220
Think about here. Think about your résumé as one of them.

32
00:03:54,610 --> 00:04:02,380
But in slow, heavy school, with all this heavy snow during the melting season and the melt, and then they also wash off.

33
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:11,530
And one of the one to think about what could was one of the major contaminants we have here in Iowa, all in the Michigan.

34
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,769
You know, what does it look pretty even like?

35
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,830
Snow. Yeah, those salt salts. Okay.

36
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:28,350
So we use consensus among the stars to clean the domes and it gives us it can cause the contamination to the rivers.

37
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:37,040
To the lakes. And so that's really when that move pick up carries that goes into the legs.

38
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,990
So this is think about what kind of proteins you may have.

39
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:53,550
You may have this foot in either upside insecticide, agriculture, oil, grease, toxic chemicals, sediments, mRNA.

40
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,890
That is one of the key contaminant we have source, source.

41
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:04,040
That's also another. And then we have a lot of in pathogens, transgenic organisms.

42
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:10,240
The other ones, the major source, one of the easy sometimes could be made sources of deposition.

43
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:19,080
From the air. We have the rain. They will capture all these contaminants from the air into the water.

44
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:26,220
So what could be like. Like one of the worst the.

45
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,420
Some. Some before. Historically among the most dangerous we have.

46
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,140
Great. Okay.

47
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:47,220
Because the contaminants, improvements in the air, we have the grade and then the use of that and it gets into the deficit the right.

48
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:56,420
So we think about the Great Lakes. You have Great Lakes. One of the major source of the mercury contamination is from.

49
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,580
Atmospheric deposition. Okay.

50
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,940
Where can I read this examples of these numbers?

51
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,790
That's really why it's so difficult to control. You cannot prevent the rate.

52
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,780
Right. So that's that's that's another major source.

53
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:27,930
Non-Point sources from atmospheric deposition. Even as effectively as we have one with everyone probably would love to keep the world.

54
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,520
And he has some projects to try to capture the way.

55
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,750
And then to look at the contaminants that produced.

56
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:44,430
And then use that as a model to predict how that, especially our mercury, have that affect the water quality in the Great Lakes.

57
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,730
And then there was the microcosm with a sort of mercury.

58
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:06,840
How open. Okay. They were at Miss Mercury and then they were deputies to the to the to the to the receiving one.

59
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:21,280
Okay. That's the. So the source of the numbers was pollution's massive sources, subsurface sources, drainage system,

60
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,520
a road of drainage channels from the contaminated sediments we're trying to position.

61
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,100
The other you think of as that mom parcels the settlements.

62
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,200
So, for example, in the Great Lakes, we have called aerial reconnaissance.

63
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:47,390
Why do they have the area of concern is because historically with this that so much contaminants into the into the lakes.

64
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,610
So all these now accumulate all remain and still remain sediments.

65
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,840
And then he came. So if you don't really do anything with the statements.

66
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:07,050
They come out. So that's also not good.

67
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,770
So think about like all these all this situation that could contribute to the contamination.

68
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,500
That's also one of the reasons why would a lake be contaminated, polluted.

69
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,450
It takes a very long time. To restore it.

70
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,010
So some people are saying, why are we just some places do that.

71
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:34,320
Okay. I just pump out all the water and then it's new will come in and then, unfortunately, it's a few minutes of you.

72
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:44,640
Okay. So you need to control the this the decides influence the inflow to the to the lakes to the rivers.

73
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,890
But also you have to control the same. So in the Great Lakes, we have this area of consensus.

74
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,140
That's statements. Okay.

75
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:05,890
We'll talk more about that. That's another really nontraditional source who you may not familiar with, but that's almost like a declaration.

76
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,350
And then from. Okay.

77
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:19,480
So. One of the this kind of disciple I come to disciple.

78
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,580
So we you have this excessive growth of the plants.

79
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,800
You can think about the excessive, gruesome plants.

80
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:36,420
And then during the winter, the die by the die, and then there would be the credits for all these organic medical trees in the settlements.

81
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,470
And during the summer, they could come out. So that's non-point pollution.

82
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,550
Okay. As opposed to the lakes in the rivers we have.

83
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:59,350
So category as much as it's mine drainage, agriculture, forestry and hydro modification.

84
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:09,070
All this could contribute to the to the to the to the numbers of solutions road highways, bridges, open sources, wetlands.

85
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,090
And those are more or less as often the important source.

86
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:21,760
So see some recreational use with a big with a big.

87
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:28,180
Now the cruise we have the regulations now we have the revision though but.

88
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:36,080
Recreational ball. For example, we do the kayaking in the river, in the lakes and rivers by small boats.

89
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:48,200
I mean, that's one point of pollution because the number of. Okay I'm poison bird for the big cruise psilocybin people in the in the cruise when

90
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,580
they come to the practice they are doing some of the practice they are doing.

91
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,050
When we do the regulation we can only reservation. So the distance code, the coast.

92
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,780
Okay. You've the public open ocean.

93
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,750
You are regulations. Okay.

94
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:13,280
They may just dump it in the ocean. But that's considered poisonous because it fits the poisons.

95
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,020
So we do have them now or worldwide agreements, how they can do these things.

96
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:27,479
Now they have to do on site treatment because think about think about the sewage they produced a month,

97
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,310
a week of thousand people living in the cruise and the boat.

98
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:40,810
All this activity is crazy. Actually, they have. Though amount of waste.

99
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:47,820
Okay to a waste. So. So if I don't do the outside treatment.

100
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,870
They will have. They will continue the river, the lakes, the ocean.

101
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,760
But in terms of regulation now, the Clean Water Acts will define this.

102
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:08,200
We don't really cover that project. That's not really that.

103
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,270
That's the NOAA and some other agencies.

104
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:20,260
The Coast Guard and also regulated. But it's not like covered by the Clean Water Act.

105
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,990
Okay. But as small things make small boats like, well, we can still non-point source.

106
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,180
But if you have the crews like big banks on the Great Lakes, yes, it will be regulated.

107
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,920
There's some questions thing about boats and how they can transport aquatic invasive species.

108
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,040
Is that considered a pollutant? Yeah, that's pollutant. Yes.

109
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:45,250
So the plastic water bottles and they have the now was a new regulations is that

110
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,110
you have to disinfect you have to treat before you can dump into the rivers lakes.

111
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,000
Okay. But consider. Let's think about this, okay?

112
00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:03,520
Think about this topic. Okay. This crew is the boat without people on board.

113
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:12,470
And then with all this activity we have sort of it's a really good confined environment.

114
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,680
So that's one of the reasons when we have outbreaks.

115
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:25,420
Colleagues. Norovirus. Very frequent on this cruise.

116
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:38,340
Ernest Cruz because the confined environments and then density of population and the West and the generation is very.

117
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,640
High risk areas for the preservation of diseases.

118
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:53,370
Okay. It just shows you like construction ready.

119
00:13:53,810 --> 00:14:03,410
Some of them consider the importance of this and and see the diffuse more diffuse from

120
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:09,560
these areas could be the the the the contribute to the contamination statements all this.

121
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,290
Urban stormwater. So like you just mentioned that you have to finalize your loans.

122
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:25,300
And then we when you have the heavy rains that you feel from the street and the impervious area, they can cause the contamination.

123
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,520
Agriculture. Surely that's one of the major sources for the for the.

124
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:41,459
The pollutants get into our receiver system and and this kind of this careful that's to see to

125
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:46,380
be point sources if is a careful person error that could still have some non-point sources.

126
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:55,860
Okay because these practices have then disposed of and that can be also that um point sources forest.

127
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:05,370
This practice is also known for the use of trees, wood, others.

128
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,450
What they are doing there is the importance species.

129
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:17,970
Okay, that's not considered part of the can. The numbers of this again the other way is really the the atmospheric deposition.

130
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,149
Okay. I'm going to fix it the other way.

131
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:27,150
You need to remember. One of the stars could be a major source is a contaminated sediments.

132
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:34,320
Contempt of citizens is considered a non-point sources. Recreational boating.

133
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:44,550
That's the norm for us mining. So here we we try to now I mean mining is not really a common practice here in the United States,

134
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:50,430
but if historically we have a lot of mining activities in the United States,

135
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,460
if you think about it, I mean, that also could contribute to the contamination or to the receiving water.

136
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,050
And some of them, number one, source pollution is not pleasant pollution.

137
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,360
Now here is just to show you why the long pause was crucial.

138
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,570
Pollution could be the issue right now. How can we achieve that?

139
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:14,610
So we have this precipitation, okay? We have this precipitation.

140
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:21,270
The water comes. They have the if is like a major area, not development concrete.

141
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,830
The water came in first. Filter into the grass, meets the soil.

142
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,030
Okay. Into the story I saw. So soon as the process.

143
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:37,629
They can remove a large portion of the food.

144
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:43,340
That is, first of all, getting that organic when the water goes through the sand soil.

145
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,190
That's a major process. What we use to remove the contaminants.

146
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:59,330
Organic methods. But when we have the urban development of this, all this water, we're just a wash away to get into the.

147
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:09,440
Lakes and streams. Is no process will be able to remove the pollutants so that getting into the river lakes the contemporary lakes.

148
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:15,090
But when we have all these areas in those areas,

149
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:23,070
then they can get into some of the filtration and then get into the point where those can reach out to the groundwater.

150
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:33,390
So we can use this process, we can take advantage of this process, so we'll be able to reduce the pollutants.

151
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:41,190
Right. For example, now when we have this patina, think about what is putting on the water can already get through.

152
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:49,810
But if you go to this parking lot with some open space, with open space, then the water can get.

153
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,230
That's the one that you just mentioned in the most tempered that tried to do something

154
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:01,650
like this in a city about how in the Arab world we try to promote to do that.

155
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:11,340
So the way we do this is as through the water can infiltrate or stay in certain areas for quite some time so that this is a major process.

156
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:16,650
For the most. Okay. So.

157
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,879
But without this process. Think about the process.

158
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,430
The person can just get into this. Okay. Especially now we have these open forms of this.

159
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:33,730
And in chemical, we are using it just wash away directly into our ground, into the mix.

160
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,520
This process will not be able to remove all the contaminants that we can't have.

161
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,969
They may not be fast enough to remove all the contaminants, for example,

162
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:51,270
the nitrogen or the pesticides atrazine we are using in the agricultural practice.

163
00:18:52,020 --> 00:19:00,569
What happened there is that even you have the infiltration into the ground because this process is so slow and they will be able to contaminate again,

164
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,860
one of these not really covered by the Clean Water Act.

165
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,000
But you can see here, this process is have the capacity.

166
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:14,900
He has a capacity and is slow process. Okay.

167
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:19,370
So process. So some of the contaminants, most of the organic matter is not the issue.

168
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,130
We'll be able to use this process to move our game as we have it.

169
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,670
We have tons of microwaves in the soil.

170
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:33,790
Think about this. Soil is a really rich source of the microwave ovens and then they are hungry.

171
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,260
So when you have this again, that is the ultimate ability to take a buck to use that.

172
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,040
But the one with the others, like atrazine, for example, is very difficult for microwave rhythm.

173
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,530
And then if they cannot be close it to this portion of the parts of it that can be moved.

174
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:57,720
But most sometimes they can most most kids will continue to outgrow when they get into the problem.

175
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:04,120
So that's actually is one of the example for that purpose. So how can we do it?

176
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:09,450
How can we manage this? Let's take a quick break and then we'll talk about amendments.

177
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:18,120
So how can we manage the numbers of increasing numbers of the social workers support urban development?

178
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:22,710
We know the major approach we are using is what's more important.

179
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,850
Obviously, we will be able to 2 to 2 tourism.

180
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:31,320
Okay. And then before you said, for the non-point sources, what are we can do?

181
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,720
Basically, I just mentioned, for example, now with all this concrete that we have,

182
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:42,450
that's not very bad for the for the clean for the the prevent the pollution.

183
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:49,500
So what are you to do for damages? Collect these impervious areas, promote the infiltration.

184
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:55,379
That's how we can do to promote the infiltration. And this really prevent the pollutants and runoff.

185
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:59,250
So mixing remove prints from round before into the surface water.

186
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,160
So that's a different approach we can use. And then we have different ways.

187
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:09,780
We have long cultural practice and can also have these structural practice and then use zoning restrictions.

188
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,560
For example, use them make the urban.

189
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:19,560
We have the zoning restrictions as one way we can we can be able to reduce the contamination.

190
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:27,810
For example, the arable is a typical example now and some of mom for profit organizations try to purchase

191
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:33,600
the many surrounding arable so that we can reduce the development of the development.

192
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:43,350
So that way you can reduce the stormwater pollution pollution from this you have the concrete that's really called this crucial area.

193
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,550
So control, practice, preparation, prevention, you know,

194
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:56,550
some places where the try to remove the first was phosphorus from the fertilizers when you apply to land can

195
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:04,890
promote organic foot nice as well another one way to reduce approach is to go into the water education.

196
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:12,300
So just don't dunk all the stuff just on the street that's that's kind of the.

197
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:19,710
And then we also have a structure practices so measure or alter the flow characteristics to a fabulous waterborne pig discharge.

198
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,419
So measure times would like for that for example we have these wetlands can build in

199
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:31,380
this community in the in the in the one of the typical example is the in New York.

200
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:37,620
We have a central park. No. You have the Central Park.

201
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:46,590
That's one way you really try to use a structure approach to help reduce the discharge into something.

202
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:55,400
Okay. That's how we know for the urban non-point sources of the water practice.

203
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:05,000
Is that used for the agriculture? What we can do, I mean, especially for agriculture, agriculture is a major source for the importance of pollution,

204
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:10,040
also a major contributor to within 50, 40, almost 40%.

205
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,110
I attribute to the some of the impure water in the United States.

206
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:25,050
Okay. In the United States, primary pollutants like sediments, nutrients, animal waste, salt, pesticides we can think of.

207
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:29,310
Oh, by the way. So we just mention with Urban. Now the source.

208
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:38,860
Especially during here. The stone is one of the major contaminant pollutants you can see from the from the practice.

209
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:42,590
What do we how can we remove to reduce that?

210
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:55,790
Um according to Heather so animal wastes or pesticides sediments nutrients that up B could be the the the in the non poisonous

211
00:28:55,790 --> 00:29:03,470
pollutants so sediments another predator another source of the pollutants are the big polluters in the sediment itself.

212
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:12,439
Stolen materials get into the ice a route like the and the future.

213
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:21,300
With this agriculture forms the waves erosion stream bank into the way have the the strong winds for them

214
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:27,950
all these sand all the soil can flow through into the water that's there's also concern for pollutants.

215
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:35,790
Nutrients, soil structure, wind can also cause microbes, structures, air pollution, all this stuff.

216
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:40,920
You can find chemicals, especially the pesticides, phosphorous, ammonia.

217
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,430
We use very heavily again in the United States.

218
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:50,130
In the United States, we rely without code of practice.

219
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:54,300
We rely heavily on the chemicals. Okay.

220
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:59,670
With big man, with a heavily on the on the chemicals to use to control.

221
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,020
And and we apply tremendous amount of the chemical.

222
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:13,260
So we think about organic farm. Sometimes the organic farm is not really organic farming is not really an organic farm.

223
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,430
Even say we are organic farm, it's not really organic farm.

224
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:27,600
But, but the, the, the practice they are using really introduced a lot of company into it.

225
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,260
So west like Michigan, Ohio,

226
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:40,800
we have big agriculture states and we'll see how can we a lot of programs are using is really a voluntary program for that.

227
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:53,660
Okay. Samus Fury has a lot of issues because the water reduce, the water quality decreased, for example,

228
00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:01,250
where you have these sediments getting into the river and then you can cover the life,

229
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,600
I mean, reduce the the light penetration and therefore the equity plant.

230
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:10,150
And and the other thing to beautiful example, when we have these heavy rain,

231
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,970
all these to be decomposes decrease and if you use other source for the drinking water or decrease the

232
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:21,140
disaffection efficiency to manage because you have all these particular sitting in the soil in the water.

233
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:29,010
Who may use high also reduce the transportation capacity of this from from the formal statements.

234
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:33,690
The other is the neutral the one of the the same as is the one major source the

235
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:38,550
are the major issue pollutants we have from agriculture practice is a neutral.

236
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:49,020
Okay we we need to provide the nutrients like phosphorus nitrogen to promote the crop growth without cannot with soil.

237
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:55,950
So in some places like Lake Michigan, you mean if you put the U.P., you probably don't need that much.

238
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:02,130
So tonight, because of Sawyer, we have a tweet. We have a really good source.

239
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,370
And then you also have this. That means all of this.

240
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:10,830
And that can also provide the nutrients in addition to the soil.

241
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,400
When you when you when you when for for that kind of practice.

242
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:23,160
But in other places, when they use very frequent crop rotations and then if they apply tremendous amount of the nutrients.

243
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:26,510
Okay, we have two major crops.

244
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,420
We are going to hear crops that why you the soybean, why the corn?

245
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:38,610
That's the two crops that we hear. And with the with the with the pole, we have to use our nitrogen source more.

246
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,880
But then with soybean they use less actually. But we use a lot.

247
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:53,870
Foster's. Okay. So that's causes this and then we actually especially that we use quite a lot for that purpose but

248
00:32:53,870 --> 00:33:01,130
this run of come from this really will be contribute to the introduction issues that we have.

249
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,230
In the lakes. We have Great Lakes.

250
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,850
Now we have the fishing issues during the summer have harmful algal blooms.

251
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:18,770
That's a fiction. And if you see small ponds, small lakes, a lot of places now you see we have excessive growth of plants.

252
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:23,740
That's because because tissues have the nutrients getting to that. Okay.

253
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:28,060
You should forget that. So groundwater is another issue for that.

254
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:40,480
The concentration. Normally how this comes usually pretty low between the 0.3 to 0.01 mg per liter for this.

255
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:48,490
We want to keep that they can do level, but then if we increase them, we go increases each application.

256
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:57,830
And if we have this excessive growth of another issue that you should have because the issue is very serious of the 1.8 and then becomes a rocket.

257
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:01,540
Okay. They needed the excessive oxygen to remove this.

258
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:11,079
And then, of course, the anaerobic. That's cause the the a lot of issues of the attack of water from water and methane come up from these this, this,

259
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:18,110
this water and the Cuyahoga if that does the the the river for them to cause a fire because it may see

260
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:26,920
as because the the anaerobic conditions the bacteria degrade organic matter to produce the methane gas.

261
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:30,190
So all added together cause this issue that we have.

262
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:42,970
So again the nitrogen phosphorus does the the and that is also another issue with nitrogen is not only just the the beautification,

263
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:48,759
but it can be converted to the nitrate and nitrate. They can contaminate other chemicals.

264
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,490
Now, they can also cause health issues. So one of the one of the issue cause a blue baby.

265
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:01,870
And when they drink the water with excessive nitrate and they can reduce the blood transportation.

266
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:18,319
Yeah, that's that's one of the issues that we have. The other comment we can see especially the impacts our our our the beautification issue from

267
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:27,080
agriculture is zone in the Mexico Gulf Gulf of Mexico every year for Mississippi River.

268
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:34,210
For Mississippi River, which carries a lot of nitrogen phosphorus into the Gulf of Mexico.

269
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,100
Okay. During the summer. There's a lot.

270
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:45,230
I just don't. The modest goal of the exceptional growth, algae and other things.

271
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:52,310
And that now becomes that then the oxygen will be depleted.

272
00:35:53,780 --> 00:36:02,200
For the UK with no government. And that's become in horror or in interrogative the to the according Edmund.

273
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,280
Basically there's no camouflage in life.

274
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:14,860
I would imagine that you may be able to find some, but my volumes are not the the higher always in that spirit.

275
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:26,530
So every year is really becomes a really big issue in the in the Gulf of Mexico because of the the excessive discharge of these nutrients.

276
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:31,120
And in the summer, that's another issue we have.

277
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,860
I mean, you see the maps of the zone of this is only in this area.

278
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,910
It's become bigger and bigger every year. Okay.

279
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,990
Phosphorus is a it's a similar to the to the nitrogen.

280
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:54,390
But the first was contamination. Many is a big problem for the freshwater that's the the key nutrients we have.

281
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,890
But in the ocean, naturally, nitrogen is a big issue.

282
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:05,390
That is a big issue because in the in the.

283
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:12,330
Here in the fresh water. We have some mold and we can fix it to provide the source.

284
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:18,470
So there's not really much you can do for that because. From practice.

285
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:28,180
It's a. One of the issues we have with the phosphorus is also the total number, total concentration to the amount.

286
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:33,340
So we'll talk about Great Lakes practice. We try to reduce half, 50%.

287
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,220
One of the issues now we have with the first was ever will reduce further.

288
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:50,680
But apparently we find this active bio biological available phosphorus becomes part of the ratio.

289
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:59,860
So now we need to control not only just put on phosphorus amount in the water, but also by available phosphorus in the in the.

290
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:11,150
Deciding we have phosphorus is a one of the major nutrients that we try to regulate to improve the Great Lakes water quality.

291
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:19,730
With all the states again, sorry for the Ohio State and Ohio State of Ohio is a big pollutants fall in this regard.

292
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,810
Okay. In this regard. As for the first offer from agriculture.

293
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:38,170
Pesticides. Yes, we use quite a lot of pesticides. In agriculture just mentioned, atrazine is one of the typical example, a typical example.

294
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:46,150
So one of the policy we have like several years ago and decades ago, the ethanol.

295
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:55,030
So try to produce more ethanol and then use that to to mix it together with gas, try to save the environment.

296
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:59,790
So that's one of the renewable. So what happened with our policy?

297
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,860
What happened with that policy is now the Midwest states.

298
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:09,660
Enjoy. Ohio. Iowa.

299
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:19,120
So what do I do? Used to export the coins to the US as a defeat for any type of these plans.

300
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:25,020
Now the the the the the the the the industrial subsidies.

301
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:28,530
So all these states now they brought all these ethanol plant.

302
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:35,100
So basically now they use all the point they have and now they have import to that plant.

303
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,920
Okay. In the plan to produce Bethel instead of to use as a for.

304
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:52,560
And and with that policy now, what they found is that atrazine, for example, contamination in the groundwater, anyway, is pretty high.

305
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:56,450
The only states. Okay.

306
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:02,030
So that's some of the amount of policy, if you think about it,

307
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:09,410
especially for the Obama House we need to see is think about what's the could be the immediate consequences to that.

308
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:13,640
So one of the ways that you can do is lifecycle assessment approach.

309
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:19,730
If you are interested in this, the lifecycle assessment is one of the ways try to evaluate the whole process.

310
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:24,800
Is there just one? So we serve ethanol with great means using this gas.

311
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,170
But if we think about the footprint from this regard, that could be the issue.

312
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:46,130
Yeah. Pesticides. One of the pesticides, especially the the the the not only does it affect the aquatic life, but also our human health.

313
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:50,959
The cortisone. How's the Jamaica professor?

314
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,720
Jamaica is working in this area. The run up.

315
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,460
Run up is one of the typical pesticide we are using.

316
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:05,030
That's cause one of the could be an issue for the French River crisis, free water crisis.

317
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:08,179
One of the reason could be from growing up, we have a pest that's about it.

318
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:12,620
We don't really find one up in the in the receiving water in that area.

319
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:21,200
But that's the of this this pesticide can induce reduce the impact of the reproductive effect.

320
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:29,900
So there's a study farms the study worldwide found is that in the Western population.

321
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:35,480
The number of men decreased about 50%.

322
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:41,240
Okay. In this decades we have.

323
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:50,830
That's pretty alarming. Pretty alarming because the total number as to the lab concentration of the skin dropped by 50%.

324
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:58,980
That's pretty alarming. And then once that, of course, is attributed to the pesticides we have.

325
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,600
But we exposed to that calculus both the.

326
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:15,810
Animal waste which does talk about the animal was animal as will have the nutrients we have the organic matter but also think about

327
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:30,090
the nutrient the the contaminants also the positive and excessive passion group the spirit idea viruses and and and the bacteria.

328
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:38,070
So that's also could cause these excessive discharge of these microbes into the into the receiving water.

329
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:48,560
So that's is omeprazole from the from the end most. So what can we do to control this non-point source pollution from agriculture?

330
00:42:50,070 --> 00:43:00,470
Okay. Well. Unfortunately there's no any no much effectual approach we can use.

331
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:05,350
Okay. And our program is a voluntary program.

332
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:11,940
It's voluntary program. The best management practices.

333
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:17,110
The best management practices. Some.

334
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:33,330
Voluntary programs we are using for the for the agriculture for farmers to join for the benefit of the the the world,

335
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:38,990
what the population or the environment. But if the farmer says no, I wouldn't want to participate.

336
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:49,020
There's not really much you can do except except the commentary and mafia operations as non-point source.

337
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,220
That's regulated. That's regulated. You have to produce.

338
00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:02,240
You have to. That's the that's the on the on the on the. But if it's non-point source, it's very difficult to produce.

339
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,650
So. Conservation practice by the Natural Resource Conservation Services Department.

340
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:21,720
Agriculture. Some of them can use to minimize brutal avoidable social of to reduce the transport delivery of the pollutants.

341
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:32,120
Do some buffer zones and increase the fruit in the delivery, redirecting from the surface of what to the ground water?

342
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,840
It's not a very great way to do, but that's not one of the.

343
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:41,870
We're talking about wastewater, the sludge application and the storage sludge application.

344
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:47,450
When we have these with what your implants, they apply to the to the land, to the foot in the first night, to the land.

345
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:55,910
Sometimes there's a lot of issue with that. So we try to reduce our practice because of potential pollutants to our groundwater, the surface of water.

346
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,930
When they apply this kind of 50 miles into the ground.

347
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:07,610
So control study one of the innovative families of the Michigan mission.

348
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:19,290
We have a lot of funds for this. We will have no funds. So they try to work together, try to see how can we reduce the the.

349
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:26,000
With discharge from our agriculture practice of private practice because some funds

350
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:32,270
received from the from the agriculture and also from the EPA to to to work on these.

351
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:39,290
So these are voluntary for web. So they say, how can we improve come together?

352
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:42,880
How can you practice and reduce the distance? Okay.

353
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:48,230
And that is available for for that purpose. So what's a practice?

354
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:54,260
They have to try to reduce that. One of the ways they are using this because intercropping.

355
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:05,910
So it puts like we know this for demo so we would be able to fix motion itself is going to be added extra addition of a.

356
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:17,759
So every year we use the to the solving for the next year we pull the close to that so be when you go to the solving you have this fertilizer applied

357
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,530
already allows you and then when you use that soil you can use for the controls

358
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:29,940
so that way you can reduce the just the the use of the the night shoot.

359
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:38,370
But also we try to intercropping each other through different crops together so that it can protect the soil surface.

360
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:43,950
Okay. And you reduce the erosion issues.

361
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:49,500
Okay. You improve the coverage. You reduce the segments from that focus.

362
00:46:51,550 --> 00:47:02,020
Okay. That's that's kind of program we have. They do have some the organizations associations from the farmers try to work together to promote that.

363
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:07,360
But again, this is voluntary program. So when we want to do some of the research with farmers.

364
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:13,870
Especially that with labor. The organic farmers who have to work on that?

365
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:22,060
No. So we don't have access. We can just get access and get access to the sites to do the analysis.

366
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:29,050
We're interested in the agriculture. The antibiotic resistance from the agricultural practice.

367
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:33,730
What was the contribution from agriculture practice to the animal releases?

368
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,740
We tried to go there to take the samples. No, we didn't allow us to cull.

369
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,150
And the reason for that is it ensuring be that the ones who find the problem,

370
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:53,170
if there's any problem and I'm not trying to blame the farmers because they are very involved with the work of our with and they are adamant.

371
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:57,790
That's why you just put your finger through us. Then you have all the other pollutants here.

372
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:02,680
I just wanted to give us. And we do a very important job.

373
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:07,010
I needed to win the cross and support the like. So.

374
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:11,610
So but the reality is, yes. The majors.

375
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:19,710
And so causes impairment of the water in that house is 55%.

376
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:24,670
That's pretty high to me. That's from my private practices.

377
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:30,190
So. But how can we improve that thought if some innovative way that we need to do?

378
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:42,160
But unfortunately and in the especially for prison administration, we kind of kind of like move away from this practice, think from this practice.

379
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:47,049
So federal agencies, what are the federal agencies?

380
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:54,310
Are many involved in the in the management of controls non-point source pollutions from agriculture.

381
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:59,170
USDA that's really the one. And then the Environmental Protection Agency.

382
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:04,040
Okay. Protection Agency. A lot of other places.

383
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,179
Department of Interior and national.

384
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:12,290
Of of course any. And Atmospheric Administration.

385
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:16,250
Department of Defense. So what the Department of Defense is involved.

386
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:31,360
For the members of. Because they want to make sure that there still concern constant food supply of goods.

387
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:38,010
Because they'll still want to have a reliable food supply from the farm department defense.

388
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:48,600
Okay. Okay. Maybe this is several steps in a different department defense because we are big polluters.

389
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:57,050
Okay. So they're big polluters, okay. So if you think about the operation they have.

390
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:04,280
In fact, a lot of love point sales have come from the royal commission, come from the Department of Defense.

391
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,500
Okay. Um. The. The.

392
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:16,660
Perkovich want to talk about Kucoin talk about Poco radius as one of the so WhatsApp kind of programs we

393
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:23,860
have again is a combination reserve program about liquidity incentive programs where land reserve program,

394
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:31,060
grazing reserve program. So these programs are available for the farmers to participate.

395
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:38,050
They also provide funds, if you like, that you can buy fund to to do this program.

396
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:44,170
So that that way would be able to reduce the pool from agriculture pools.

397
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:55,030
EPA. We have these the National Employees Loss Program. Also, they provide the funds again to the states, to the all the tribal areas,

398
00:50:55,970 --> 00:51:02,800
try to make sure that this the agriculture would be able to improve the practice management practice.

399
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:10,870
So best practice. Hopefully they want to make sure that the agriculture I mean, they follow this Fifth Amendment practices.

400
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:16,270
Okay. Some of these programs, it's.

401
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,080
Required by the Clean Water Act, the Clean Water Act.

402
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:28,680
And some of them is the mandatory, some of them voluntary.

403
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:36,060
And they also have the clean water standard revolving farm program, basically funds for states.

404
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:42,150
So if you do the practice, give you the fund for this to to to improve the water quality.

405
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:47,560
Another farm program, drinking water stage one farm program as well.

406
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:56,100
That's addressing when you use the social water, the rivers, lakes as a source for the future.

407
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:00,690
So we can use these funds to protect the source of drinking water.

408
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:07,979
Go places like. Like the the pollen.

409
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,760
Pollen, for example, the contaminants are many from the number of sources.

410
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:20,870
So the Safe Drinking Water Act also can can protect our source for the drinking water.

411
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:24,620
Then they can provide funds to address this non-point source pollution.

412
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:30,330
Okay. Composers peruses some of the programs from National.

413
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:36,510
I saw a program, pesticide program such as water protection program and then coastal rampart producing

414
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:43,200
programs of all involved in the program of the last one is involved in the.

415
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:47,910
Given the both questionable makeup, how can we protect this?

416
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:59,420
So there's multiple programs, again in place to try to protect to reduce the contaminants from the non-point sources.

417
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:04,430
