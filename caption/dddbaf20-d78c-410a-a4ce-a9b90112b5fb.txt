1
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:08,440
I wanna try a question for
Scott concerning business models.

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,700
I have to say,
I think it's really terrific to have

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,120
the focused individual patient
personalized medicine, and

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,310
then the idea of population health but
kind of within a healthcare system.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,130
And then over here, we've got the whole-
>> The whole world.

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,170
>> The whole world, that's right.

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,300
So the business model that
Mary Anne was talking about

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,150
is a challenging one to get a real
focus on population health within

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,330
what we call healthcare systems that
are basically medical care systems.

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:41,436
Personalized medicine has always seemed
to me as having the opposite kind of

11
00:00:41,436 --> 00:00:46,795
set of incentives from what we see as
the business model for most of healthcare.

12
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:49,940
For pharmaceuticals in general,
for example.

13
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,230
Pharmaceutical companies want
blockbusters, they want a drug that treats

14
00:00:54,230 --> 00:01:00,850
a huge range of people who have varying
degrees of a very common condition.

15
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,000
personalized medicine is very different.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,990
How do we fit that into a business model?

17
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,290
>> So I think there's a lots
of ways to fit that in, and

18
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:16,530
there's been lots of successful ways to
fits that in in terms of business success.

19
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,393
And so, I think exactly as you said, most
pharmaceutical companies are looking for

20
00:01:21,393 --> 00:01:22,634
a blockbuster drug.

21
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:23,348
And again,

22
00:01:23,348 --> 00:01:29,000
sort of speaking in cancer, that can be
really hard to find a blockbuster drug.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,900
There was actually a recent

24
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,640
drug that was approved for
a subset of patients with lung cancer.

25
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,375
On the day the approval was announced,

26
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:43,580
the pharmaceutical company's
stock dropped because it was

27
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:49,080
only approved in a subset of lung
patients who had the molecular marker.

28
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,781
And so, that shows that that's what
analysts were hoping that they were going

29
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:54,410
to have, and that was priced in.

30
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,760
On the other hand, a different
pharmaceutical company testing a very

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:04,060
similar drug and a very similar patient
population did not pre-specify and

32
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,790
select patients based on the molecular
test, and their drug failed overall.

33
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,224
And their stocked dropped as well.

34
00:02:10,224 --> 00:02:10,770
>> Okay.

35
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,270
>> [LAUGH]
>> Fascinating.

36
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,784
>> So I think there's lots of ways you can

37
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:17,498
actually incorporate that.
And there are companies that

38
00:02:17,498 --> 00:02:22,283
are developing now, and they're certainly
much more of the smaller biotechs

39
00:02:22,283 --> 00:02:27,286
than large pharma, that are focused on
we're going to find the 5% of lung cancer

40
00:02:27,286 --> 00:02:32,026
that we know this is a molecular change.
We can make a great drug to that, and

41
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,921
we expect to have very strong responses.
And

42
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:39,639
so, we don't need to spend as much
doing a very large, phase one,

43
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:43,686
phase two, and phase three trial,
taking years to do and

44
00:02:43,686 --> 00:02:48,383
complete that, and get approval.
And instead, we're gonna find the subset

45
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:52,026
of patients, we're gonna spend more
money to find those patients, and

46
00:02:52,026 --> 00:02:56,990
we can do a much smaller trial and get the
drug approved even from a phase one study.

47
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,200
>> Speaking as an that's gonna be
an enormously expensive drug when

48
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,380
that goes to market, right?

49
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,410
>> Yes.

50
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:04,955
>> Wow.

51
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:08,900
>> Yeah, but I think that speaks to our
healthcare system where cost of the drug

52
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,720
is not factored in to whether
the drug gets approved or not.

53
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,240
>> Yeah.
>> And largely whether,

54
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,470
particularly from the public Medicare or
Medicaid, whether the drug is covered.

55
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,930
>> Yeah.
>> And that's very different

56
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:27,040
than in other systems where
the cost benefit is incorporated.

57
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,400
So and even now, some of the not just
looking at subsets of the population,

58
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,090
but some of the brand new immunotherapies,

59
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,230
we're going to take the body's own immune
system and let it help fight cancer.

60
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,406
That's really been a focus and
just incredible benefits for patients,

61
00:03:42,406 --> 00:03:45,905
some of which have some diseases,
for example, melanoma.

62
00:03:45,905 --> 00:03:49,721
Once that's sort of spread from
the primary site, almost uniformly fatal,

63
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:51,600
there are now patients that are five or

64
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,610
ten years out after immunotherapy
that are probably cured.

65
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,900
So incredible potential for
benefit for that drug.

66
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,074
A combination of two drugs that
turn on the immune system.

67
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,170
$200,000 a year for that drug.

68
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:04,810
>> Yeah.

69
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,166
>> And so, the question, though, is you
have a real chance that patients are not

70
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,479
only going to benefit, but may be cured.

71
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:15,080
So how much should they be
able to charge for that?

72
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,790
And that's when you hear people say well,
we have the cure for

73
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,442
cancer, pharmaceutical
companies don't want it.

74
00:04:20,442 --> 00:04:21,950
They do.

75
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,774
They would have it, and

76
00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:25,178
they would charge hundreds of
thousands if not millions of dollars.

77
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:27,513
And maybe you can make a good
argument that they should,

78
00:04:27,513 --> 00:04:30,345
or you can make an argument that well,
they should for that, but for

79
00:04:30,345 --> 00:04:32,976
these drugs that only allow people
to live a few months longer,

80
00:04:32,976 --> 00:04:35,498
they shouldn't be able to
charge very much for that.

81
00:04:35,498 --> 00:04:39,740
>> This is gonna be huge public
policy debate because we're already

82
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,680
at 18% of gross domestic product for
healthcare.

83
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,425
And you add these drugs, and many
consumers now have very high co-pays and

84
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:48,817
deductibles, and
they're gonna have to pay.

85
00:04:48,817 --> 00:04:52,700
So we're gonna have a lot of haves and
have nots, I think, in that model, right?

86
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,416
>> Yeah.
>> Where some

87
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,596
people won't be to afford
even their co-pays.

88
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:56,398
>> Yeah.

89
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:57,905
>> Wow, that's gonna be a real challenge.

90
00:04:57,905 --> 00:05:02,682
>> Will the sub-populations targeted for
certain drugs,

91
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:07,557
are they found globally, or
are they found amongst the top

92
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:11,750
10% of Western countries' earners, right?

93
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:18,400
It seems like there would be an incentive
there to look for diseases and

94
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,070
target therapies for
diseases to people who can pay for them.

95
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,520
>> Yeah, so-
>> Is that a reasonable statement?

96
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,430
>> It is.

97
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,860
And so, cancer, again, provides
a really great example in that area.

98
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,630
So some of the molecular changes
that occur in lung cancer

99
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,630
are much more frequent in
Asian populations in Asia.

100
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:45,380
And so, for a while, the FDA wanted the
vast majority, if not all of the patients,

101
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,780
to be treated for a drug in a clinical
trial to be done in the US.

102
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,140
And that's changed.

103
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,979
So the specific alteration
I'm talking about is about 5%

104
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:59,150
to 10% in Asia, and
maybe 1% to 5% in the US.

105
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:04,123
And so, if you're a pharmaceutical
company and you have to screen thousands

106
00:06:04,123 --> 00:06:08,180
of patients to find the patients
to go into the clinical trial,

107
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,566
it is worth it to go open
that clinical trial in Asia.

108
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:15,400
And actually, for one of these, the vast
majority of the patients that were treated

109
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,640
on the sort of the pivotal trial that
led to the approval, were found and

110
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,168
were treated in actually Korea.

111
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:25,738
And so, pharma will certainly
go over there and will do that.

112
00:06:25,738 --> 00:06:31,250
And then, the issue is a lot of these,
they have to make their money in the US.

113
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:37,770
And so, that's why we pay more for
drugs in the US than other countries do.

114
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,440
But certainly there are certain
populations that may have different

115
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,920
frequencies of these alterations.

116
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,122
And we kind of, again, we're so sort of
hyper-focused on the US population, and

117
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:47,211
the types of action.

118
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:51,733
Even the people have come to, say, an
academic medicine, academic medical center

119
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:55,362
like U of M, they're much more likely
to get this kind of testing and

120
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:59,059
to have the really comprehensive
assessment done than patients that

121
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:03,140
are in a rural community who don't have
access to that kind of of testing.

122
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,930
>> Sure.

123
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,680
>> And of course,

124
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,230
you're touching on one of the big
problems in our healthcare system.

125
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:13,150
Is the diversity of responses that we
see in different parts of the system.

126
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,180
I must say, I'm going to start
stuffing my piggy bank to save up for

127
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,030
when I need the [LAUGH] $200,000
>> Yeah.

128
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,070
>> For the test, or what have you.

129
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,740
>> Yeah.

130
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,090
>> But it's fascinating,
it's intriguing, and it's worrisome.

131
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,570
Something that the students in this
course have heard throughout the course

132
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,660
is that we do spend a whole lot
more on our health care system

133
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,800
than any other country in the world.

134
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,000
And yet,
if you look at the OECD countries,

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,734
we're ranked roughly in the middle of them
in terms of standard health outcomes.

136
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:45,664
And we just know that there
are a lot of public health issues,

137
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:49,760
population health issues,
that aren't getting addressed.

138
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,390
So this is gonna be a tough one for
some time to come.

139
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,975
>> This is really the core
challenge in healthcare, right?

140
00:07:55,975 --> 00:08:00,045
Because every other country in the world
spends far more on social services

141
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:01,255
than the US does, right?

142
00:08:01,255 --> 00:08:06,055
So they spend more on childcare, early
childhood development, on housing and

143
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:07,585
food, and those kinds of things.

144
00:08:07,585 --> 00:08:09,475
And we don't.

145
00:08:09,475 --> 00:08:13,960
And yet, we spend a tremendous
amount of very high-tech care.

146
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,382
And for some people,

147
00:08:15,382 --> 00:08:20,439
the US is the only place that's doing
this kind of innovative work, right?

148
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,670
And we're supplying that for
the rest of the world.

149
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,140
But other countries have
made different priorities.

150
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,481
They want to do more funding of those
basic services, prevention services,

151
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:32,901
and less on this high-tech end of things.

152
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:34,450
It's a real dilemma.

153
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:38,350
>> So what really intrigues me about this
is, getting back to the climate change

154
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:45,030
area, climate change really is a public
health issue with a big P and a big H.

155
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,280
>> Absolutely.

156
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,610
>> Right, personalized medicine
sounds like it has public health

157
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,420
policy implications that are huge.

158
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,690
But it's focusing narrowly on individuals.

159
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,550
And I'm just wondering when you're
listening to this as someone who is

160
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,600
focused on climate change,
how do you react to this discussion?

161
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,940
What does it make you think about?

162
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,754
>> So
it actually makes me think about kind of

163
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:17,570
differentiating health crises into kind of

164
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:22,360
long term chronic versus short term acute,
personal versus public.

165
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,400
So I'm thinking, okay,
if you're stricken with cancer,

166
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,400
that's something that will
be diagnosed at some point.

167
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,670
Hopefully, it will be slow growing and
you will have years to treat it.

168
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,560
And so, there's the time constant,
if you will, for

169
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,481
responding to it is longer and
it's very personal.

170
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:49,355
And I can imagine if we're talking about
a disease outbreak, it's unanticipated,

171
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:53,891
and if it's a viral disease where the
response would be a vaccine, then you have

172
00:09:53,891 --> 00:09:58,110
a much shorter time constant over which
you need to develop that vaccine.

173
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,670
Or you need to do something in order
to quell the spread of the disease.

174
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:07,560
And so, for me, I don't see them
necessarily as being in conflict,

175
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,700
as just operating on
different time scales, right?

176
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,610
>> But what you were talking about earlier
about pathogens now developing that

177
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,508
didn't exist before or were suppressed
by permafrost, for example.

178
00:10:19,508 --> 00:10:23,790
You're almost talking about
a situation where if we don't invest

179
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,860
in the prevention in the broadest sense
in the public health protections for

180
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,450
stopping this from happening, we're gonna
release a whole bunch of diseases that

181
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,545
are gonna end up needing
these new treatments.

182
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:36,545
>> Sure.

183
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:42,490
>> And again, we're not having that dialog
about how do we spend our resources.

184
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,380
>> Right, where should we invest?

185
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,100
>> Yeah.

186
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,960
>> In order to minimize cost and
minimize harm?

187
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,851
>> Yes, yeah, yeah.

188
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:51,973
The scenario you painted before was so

189
00:10:51,973 --> 00:10:56,560
scary about these new pathogens developing
and coming out into the environment.

190
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,780
It's kind of makes you think of Ebola and

191
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,100
those viruses that are now
much more prevalent.

192
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:09,320
>> Sure, and certainly in this day and
age, and going forward,

193
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,680
fortunately for
people not directly impacted by Ebola,

194
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,180
it generally isn't and
wasn't transmissible long distances.

195
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,110
But if you look at SARS,
acute respiratory syndrome, and

196
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,980
MERS you have people who are infected.

197
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,920
And those aren't the only viral
diseases that have that characteristic.

198
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,580
But they travel halfway around the world,
right?

199
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,268
Potentially infecting all the people
that are around them on the plane and

200
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:38,018
infecting people far away
from the initial outbreak.

201
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:44,123
So I think kind of the, again,
it's so much more complicated than

202
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:50,050
perhaps a disease outbreak might
have been a century or two ago.

203
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,030
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.

204
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:55,090
>> You can also imagine that we probably
have the technology now where we could go

205
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,780
to the arctic or areas of permafrost.

206
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,055
We could use incredible,

207
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:03,060
cutting-edge next generation sequencing
to find what are all those microbes.

208
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,767
We could make vaccines, several of them,
if that was an important priority.

209
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:10,333
And you really see that with
sorta the zika virus outbreak,

210
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:14,325
that there had been work on a zika
vaccine that was done before, but

211
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:16,631
that wasn't at that time a priority.

212
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:17,133
>> Right.

213
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:20,352
>> And then, the problem is, I think
particularly we talk about these sort of

214
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:23,280
crisis healthcare things,
is they become an immediate priority.

215
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,990
And then, the public doesn't understand
why we can't just have a vaccine turned on

216
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,660
to tomorrow.

217
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,160
>> Right.

218
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,490
>> And we have the technology to,
any new outbreak,

219
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,560
we will have the technology to
track that with incredible detail.

220
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,090
We can figure out what the virus
is almost immediately.

221
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,880
There are now three or
four FDA approved tests for the Zeka virus

222
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,210
>> That accelerate,

223
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,550
that you can really compress that
timeline when that becomes a priority.

224
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,445
>> Sure.

225
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:51,140
>> But your point is so right.

226
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,900
When we spent, as a public sector,
when I was in state government,

227
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,850
and when you look at the federal
government, we spend money on crises.

228
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,938
Talk about climate change, we're spending
money on hurricanes and repairing places.

229
00:13:03,938 --> 00:13:08,560
But prevention and early intervention,
those always get cut first, right?

230
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,300
Cuz they're not the most
immediate need for resources.

231
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,070
>> Right, right.

232
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,480
>> And historically, we've not been,
especially in this country,

233
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,990
not been willing to tax ourselves
to invest for the future, right?

234
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,550
That's another difference
with other countries.

235
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,123
They have much higher
taxes than in the US.

236
00:13:23,123 --> 00:13:26,220
But they believe in making
those investments, and

237
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,190
we don't seem to do that in this country.

238
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,930
>> And if you believe the surveys,
they're happier.

239
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:32,740
>> In other countries.

240
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,450
>> In other countries.

241
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,300
That's right, with their higher taxes and

242
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,008
their greater concern with the health and
well-being of the community.
