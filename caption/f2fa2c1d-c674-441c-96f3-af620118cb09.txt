1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:07,410
Maybe like tomorrow after conditions that are.

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,709
Welcome back, everybody. Last class of the semester.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:17,610
I'm sure you're all pleased that things are winding down, although I think they always get more intense before they finally wind down.

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:25,980
Maybe before I jump into the lecture today are last on heat and cold stress especially relevant today.

5
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:32,999
Just a couple final comments. One, you probably have seen my announcement about course evaluations.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,219
So please do take a moment and fill those out.

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:45,750
I would greatly appreciate it to you have the heat or the thermal exposure assessment assignment that's due on December eight.

8
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,200
So that's your last sort of class assignment. And then I also wanted to highlight the final exam.

9
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,790
So a few words about that. It's going to be very similar in format to the noise exam, for instance.

10
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:06,510
So it'll be a little bit of solving problems, a little bit of just answering text questions.

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,340
It's technically to be taken during finals week between the 12th and the 15th, but frankly, it's open now.

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,590
And so if you want to knock something out early, you're welcome to you don't have to, but it is available.

13
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,739
And then the one other thing I'll say about that is it covers everything in the class except ionizing radiation.

14
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,890
So it's cumulative except for basically the first month of class.

15
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,100
Any questions about the exam? I should say it's also fully online on canvas.

16
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,000
And again, my only expectation it is open. No, just don't work with anybody else.

17
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,600
Day or two of your own work. Well, that makes sense.

18
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,360
Any questions? Okay.

19
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,970
Well, hearing that, we will go ahead and dive into our last session here on heat and cold stress.

20
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:58,430
And so, you know, I can think of a couple of environments today where cold stress was quite likely for me.

21
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:06,250
You probably all can as well. But we're going to talk about places and settings where we might expect both high exposures to heat as well as too cold.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,460
We're going to walk through the process of thermoregulation or how our body tries to maintain an ideal temperature.

23
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,410
We'll talk a bit about measurement and evaluation, both of heat and cold.

24
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:22,270
And then as always, I'll sort of point you to some of our relative exposure guidelines.

25
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:28,810
And for both heat and cold, we're going to talk about the health effects as well as, of course, our control strategies.

26
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,149
So, you know, it's easy to think of all the physical hazards we've talked about in class,

27
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:41,240
and there are many as kind of distinct, unrelated exposures and to a degree they may be.

28
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:49,610
But I do want to highlight that there are places where these come together and I've mentioned sort of weaponry and crowd control devices previously.

29
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,690
And there's another example here that I'd like to highlight.

30
00:02:52,700 --> 00:03:00,830
So this idea that, gosh, if we want to control crowds or we want some sort of non-lethal deterrent to keep people out of places,

31
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,870
we can turn to physical hazards.

32
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:08,900
We talked about the long range acoustic device that makes an area basically so loud that people don't want to be there.

33
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:20,580
And there's also been efforts to develop products and weapons, essentially to use electromagnetic energy for non-lethal and so-called sleep injury.

34
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:30,080
And so this idea of an active denial system here, basically where the military has developed technology that uses microwave radiation.

35
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,300
So we're we're sending out a beam of energy essentially at just the right

36
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,879
wavelength that it penetrates to no more than a 64th of an inch into your skin.

37
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,030
So, you know, very minor in penetration into your body.

38
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,100
But in that 164 inch of skin, there are a lot of nerve endings.

39
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:55,340
And so it essentially activates all those nerve endings and gives you an immediate sensation that you're being burned to death, essentially.

40
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:02,900
And so you might imagine that causes people to remove themselves from that situation because no one wants to feel like they're being scalded.

41
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,720
You know, it's sort of bad enough that we're using these things.

42
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:15,890
I will say this is a relatively fine tuned instrument where this beam can be sent out potentially hundreds of meters.

43
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,580
And it is aimed like a searchlight. So it's not like it's just irradiating an entire broad area.

44
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:29,480
But the idea here again, is this is certainly better than shooting and killing people and hopefully we can all agree on that.

45
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:36,260
And so they've developed this weapon essentially to induce this repel effect or the idea that it

46
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,880
sort of activates your fight or flight response and you immediately want to escape that situation.

47
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,790
So we talked in our previous lecture about how EMF can be an unwanted consequence

48
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:51,679
of work around lots of different types of electrical and magnetic equipment.

49
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,909
And that's true in the occupational sense. But on the flip side, we do have people who are purposely exploring this technology to figure out, well,

50
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:05,840
how can we use this to make people do what we want them to in this case, not gather in a particular area?

51
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,150
Okay. So that's maybe just an interesting little sideline,

52
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:20,210
but shifting gears to focus on heat as its own sort of exclusive physical hazard, not one that's being induced by EMF.

53
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:30,380
I'll just draw your attention here. So this is a map that was generated by the Natural Resources Defense Council, the NRDC, a couple of years ago.

54
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:39,769
So some of you may know the NRDC, they tend not so much to be a human health focused organization, as you can kind of tell by their name.

55
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:45,260
Their their primary mission is to preserve the environment. Of course, there's many reasons to do that other than human health.

56
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,940
But in environmental health, we tend to focus on what is the environment doing to health and how can the environment

57
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,290
promote health ideally and this is a nice place where those things overlap.

58
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,569
So this is a heat map basically.

59
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:03,620
And if you can just read down in the corner here, perhaps you can't see the red coded counties and this is county level estimates.

60
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:13,190
Here are counties that are expected to experience more than 14 days or more than two weeks per summer of essentially extreme heat for that region.

61
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:19,610
Going down to orange and a snag of 14 days, yellow is less than excuse me, less than nine days.

62
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,370
And gray is sort of data unavailable.

63
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:32,629
So this is essentially a map looking ahead to the near future and talking about what fraction of days within a year are going to be,

64
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:40,880
you know, sort of pushing the limits of human endurance or at least well above what these areas are used to historically.

65
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,080
So, you know, we think about climate change.

66
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,300
We should always be thinking about climate change because this is the preeminent threat to public health ever, frankly, on the planet.

67
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,059
And so as our climate continues to warm, we're going to see more and more maps like this.

68
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,469
And in fact, I was just reading an EPA report that was talking about the state of Kentucky,

69
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,940
of course, to the south of us, kind of known for their broiling hot summers.

70
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,260
And this EPA report was essentially saying,

71
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:16,579
how many years is it going to be before Summers in Michigan are like Summers historically have been in Kentucky.

72
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,620
So we can start start to talk about sort of the migration of heat patterns with the changing climate.

73
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:29,360
So this is concerning and again, not so much for the perhaps yellow coloration on here, which is a relatively.

74
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,090
You were number of the sort of extremely hot days,

75
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:39,350
but all of the many red counties that you can see here are in for kind of some of the biggest changes in expected heat.

76
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,410
So if we zoom in on Michigan specifically here and I will say, you know,

77
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:52,399
climate science and the sort of forecasting in the future is it's a forecast, it's a prediction.

78
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,629
So it's not perfect. Also, as is routinely the case with environmental issues in the U.S., there are some places,

79
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:04,910
the gray counties here for which we just don't have enough data maybe to make a robust estimate.

80
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:13,490
I'll highlight here that the gray counties that you see on here are some of the counties in Michigan that have the least population.

81
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:20,230
So the good news here is the counties where most of the people live in Michigan we have estimates for.

82
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,460
So again, from an environmental health perspective,

83
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,620
we're interested in what's happening to the environment, but we want to know how is that impacting people?

84
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,780
And so where people live is where we should focus.

85
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:38,660
So the energy see, is, is basically saying in the near future here we've got 61% of people who live in Michigan,

86
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:45,260
live in counties that have already more than nine extreme heat days per summer per year.

87
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:51,440
There's been an 11 degree Fahrenheit increase from historical records.

88
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,940
That's projected to happen by 2100 if our current emissions profile.

89
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:03,200
So our greenhouse gas greenhouse gas emissions are what's driving climate change to a large degree.

90
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:14,840
And again, thinking back even to the early 2000s, there were 17 people in Michigan in 2006 who died as a direct result of heat related illness.

91
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:22,190
So I don't happen to think of Michigan as an especially hot state, and certainly there are many in the South that are much warmer.

92
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:30,709
And yet we're still seeing impacts up here. So so part of the reason I introduce you to this is, you know, if you haven't heard of climate change yet,

93
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:34,100
we are utterly failing you as a program in environmental health.

94
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,680
But it is important to sort of map climate change under all of our exposures, including physical hazards,

95
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,489
and recognize that many of them are going to increase with the changing climate.

96
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:51,049
So that's just another set of challenges for us to face. And so this is that report that I mentioned.

97
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,700
So climate change in heat and the energy.

98
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,450
See here again, is is focusing in this particular report on the impacts on people,

99
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:05,359
which is not always their their primary focus here, and pointing out that the death toll and of course,

100
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:14,480
people die every year in America from extreme heat exposures, that exposure and the associated death toll is going to increase with a warming climate.

101
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:22,520
Okay, so that's a little bit of grim news to start your Monday afternoon with here.

102
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:30,920
We'll zoom in a little bit from sort of apocalyptic talk of climate change to focusing just on heat stress and maybe more micro environments.

103
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,079
We can think of it. And so I'm just curious of the places you've worked, you've lived,

104
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:42,979
you've been or places that you know about what are work environments or situations or,

105
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:50,420
you know, non-work activities that well, that you associate with potential for high stress or high heat exposure.

106
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:58,130
Yeah, for sure. On a sonnet, you say, Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

107
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:04,110
So if you're from a Nordic country, you actively seek out these high heat environments because they're a nice break from,

108
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:12,210
you know, 24 hours of darkness and very cold temperatures in the winter. So there's an example of a recreational exposure to agricultural work.

109
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:21,090
Yeah. So if you think about workers who are outside in the summer, in the sun, during the hottest months, agricultural workers are a great example.

110
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:27,510
And they're some of the workers who are at highest risk of potentially having a fatality from the heat exposure.

111
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,050
Yes, they're glass blowers. Glass blowers. Right.

112
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:37,590
So we talked about how they're exposed to infrared energy from that molten glow of glass right in front of their face.

113
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:42,899
They also have tremendous amounts of heat, not only from the molten glass, but from the furnaces that they use to melt the glass.

114
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,010
Great example. Yeah. Firefighters. Firefighters.

115
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:55,320
Okay. So firefighters are an example of people who sort of are paid to actively seek out high heat situations and make them low heat situations.

116
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:03,390
So when a firefighter rushes into a burning structure, they're getting exposed to heat from the outside, of course, from the building itself.

117
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:09,600
But if you've ever seen a firefighter in full turnout gear, that gear is designed to keep heat and flames off them.

118
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,720
But it also does a really good job of holding feet in so the gear that they wear can also add to that heatwave.

119
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,420
So that's a great example. Yep. Construction workers, construction.

120
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:28,320
Another example actually I think maybe I've admitted in class here, but I was shocked when I moved to Michigan that people work in the winter here.

121
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,750
It's so cold. How can you possibly be outside?

122
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,490
So construction workers, like some agricultural workers, are a good example of people who might have really high cold stress exposures.

123
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:44,340
But certainly, you know, kind of the lion's share of construction here in Michigan happens in the summer during the hottest months.

124
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,840
And those folks, just like agricultural workers, often don't have any cover.

125
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,650
They're working out of direct sunlight. Great example anymore.

126
00:12:54,270 --> 00:13:03,990
It's like people who work with molten metal and they have to make I don't know, I can't think of the term, but sure.

127
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:12,239
Yeah. So the industry of primary metal manufacturing, which is where we create aluminum and steel and other types of alloys,

128
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:19,560
melting the raw ingredients to make the metal requires extreme amount of electricity and generates extreme amounts as well.

129
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:28,350
And enter. Did you have one more snow blowers, snow snowplows in terms of heat exposure or.

130
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,729
Oh, we're talking about heat. Yeah. Okay. Just hold that one for a little while.

131
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,870
We'll get back to them. Yeah. Minors. Minors.

132
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:41,279
Sure. So, you know, there's a couple of different sort of types of mining.

133
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,870
There's surface mining where people might be out exposed to the elements and to the heat.

134
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:52,680
And then, of course, there's underground mining where heavy equipment and just the heat of the earth can make for a quite warm environment,

135
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,729
especially when you think about people, you know, mining two miles below the surface, for instance.

136
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:01,080
So that's another great example. All right. So great ideas.

137
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,770
You've already hit some of the ones that I was thinking of highlighting here.

138
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,430
So Swati mentioned molten metal. Absolutely.

139
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,049
In fact, I'll tell you, just anecdotally, I did a lot of work with Alcoa,

140
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:18,990
the aluminum manufacturer, over about a 15 year period, spent a lot of time in aluminum smelters.

141
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:23,910
And these are some of the biggest buildings in the world where you have all these

142
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,750
aluminum pots where they essentially melt down raw ingredients and make aluminum.

143
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,350
And talking of workers at some of these places, especially in the south of the US, they would say, oh, yeah, you know,

144
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,740
you typically know if a worker's going to make it here on the job,

145
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,710
if they last a week and they'll be throwing up like every 2 hours for that first week because it's so hot.

146
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:50,530
And as we'll talk about later, a week or eight days turns out to be kind of the point at which people become acclimatized.

147
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:57,899
If you can make it that far, you're a survivor. But many people don't even make it past the first few days, and it's not hard to see why.

148
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:06,540
So standing next to flowing molten metal like we see here, or between a couple of aluminum past, the air temperature going to be 200, 250 degrees.

149
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,570
And the workers are working in that. It's incredibly intense.

150
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:17,309
I'll also mention we're going to talk about sort of ways to control exposure smelters, especially.

151
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:23,640
There's almost always a worker whose job it is to ride around essentially on a tricycle all day with a cooler on the back,

152
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:30,450
just handing out cold drinks and order pops and frozen stuff just to help people stay hydrated and get cooler.

153
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,530
So that's a super nasty environment from a heat perspective.

154
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,559
We also talked about firefighters. Absolutely.

155
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,280
And other emergency responders have potential there.

156
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:47,010
So why do you mentioned construction workers and construction workers in general can have a lot of exposure.

157
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,630
I think we also talked in our last session about Road.

158
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,430
Construction workers who are working typically in summer months.

159
00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:01,370
So it's very hot outside and they're playing hot asphalt. So they're getting heat from above as well as from below.

160
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,250
You know, a group that often gets overlooked is people who work in kitchens.

161
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,959
So kitchens tend to be a hot environment. You might have heat lamps, you might have a hoop in flames.

162
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,550
There's potential certainly for just a high heat load, but also for burns as well.

163
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,430
We haven't talked so much about sort of hazardous waste workers.

164
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,660
People have to wear fully encapsulating chemical protective suits.

165
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:35,150
And for those of you who are first year IAEA students will send you to do has water training in the spring and you're going to have

166
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:41,600
an opportunity to suit up in these fully encapsulating suits and you will realize that immediately when you put this thing on,

167
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:48,709
the humidity inside goes to 100%. So you're no longer losing heat by evaporation, as we'll talk about in a moment.

168
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,870
And that can be a really unpleasant situation.

169
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:57,950
And then, as Jordan said, we've also got agricultural workers who are maybe some of the workers who are most at risk because,

170
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,630
A, they have high exposures and B, there's a lot of them working in these conditions.

171
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:13,370
So our bodies drive is essentially to maintain thermal balance, by which I mean, we have a pretty narrow range for some of us.

172
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:20,479
Maybe it's even narrower than others, but we have a narrow range of temperatures that we try to maintain our body that we perform most efficiently.

173
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,980
That's kind of our comfort zone. And we've got a couple of different options here.

174
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,240
So if we look on the Y axis, we can see sort of above the zero line here.

175
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:36,830
We might be increasing heating to our body and below zero we might be decreasing heating or potentially using heat.

176
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,440
And we can also also think about what happens in hot conditions versus cold conditions.

177
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,770
So it turns out our body is much better at adapting to hot than it is to cold.

178
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,240
So if we get heating of our body, so we're sort of in this upper quadrant here,

179
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:59,270
our body is actually able to respond quite well and keep us at a relatively stable

180
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:04,940
temperature for quite a while until eventually we exceed our body's ability to cool itself.

181
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,430
And then we run the risk of a heat stroke and maybe even death.

182
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:18,530
And then on the flip side, when we look down here in the cold conditions, we are not so good at maintaining sort of status in cold conditions.

183
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,160
Our body temperature tends to drop off more rapidly than it heats.

184
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:28,490
And of course, eventually we run the risk of potentially hypothermia or even death from freezing.

185
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:35,209
So really what we're trying to maintain here is this thermal balance where our body is neither increasing or decreasing in heat.

186
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,720
And we have several systems that are designed to help us do that.

187
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,559
So we'll dive for a minute here into some physiology.

188
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:48,740
And really what our body is trying to maintain is a word I'm sure many of us remember maybe from high school

189
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:56,210
or even before homeostasis is the fact that we are in essentially a static condition temperature wise.

190
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:02,120
So there's two things that could happen, right? We could be heating up, we could be losing heat.

191
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,560
And then the third condition, which we're striving for is maintaining thermal equilibrium.

192
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,720
So we'll start on the left hand side here. Let's say our body temperature is increasing.

193
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,650
We're in a hot environment, so we're moving out of homeostasis.

194
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,740
Our temperature is actually increasing. But what does that trigger?

195
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:25,040
Essentially, we've got what you can think of as a thermostat in our hypothalamus, in our brain,

196
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:32,129
and that detects the increasing temperature and activates essentially the primary cooling mechanisms in our body.

197
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:37,250
And we've got two. The first is that the blood vessels in our skin will dilate.

198
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:42,290
And so what that does is essentially it fills our capillaries with warm blood from our core.

199
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,000
And as that blood gets closer to the surface of our body, that heat can radiate out.

200
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:55,820
So that's a very efficient way to shed heat. And an even more efficient way to shed heat is we activate or sweat glands, so we start sweating.

201
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,830
That sweat evaporates and that results in extremely effective cooling under most conditions.

202
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,680
So once those two systems are activated, ideally our body temperature decreases,

203
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,960
the hypothalamus says, Good, we're headed back to where we want to be and we are back at homeostasis.

204
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,960
So those systems work really remarkably well for a body that's heating up.

205
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:25,760
The flip side is if we're cooling down, so let's say our body temperature is dropping, we're now dropping below homeostasis.

206
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:32,690
That same hypothalamic hypothalamic thermostat kicks in and says, we need to do something to heat ourselves.

207
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:41,720
And we've got two mechanisms here that are generally much less effective than the two for heating, but still work pretty well.

208
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:51,170
So the first is instead of expanding now our blood vessels that our skin contract and that tends to force more of the blood into our core.

209
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,900
Where it can protect our critical organs and maintain our core body temperature.

210
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:02,770
And the second is we can shiver. So shivering is just involuntary movement of our skeletal muscles.

211
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:07,990
And as muscles move, they generate heat. And so we can shiver and warm our bodies up to a degree.

212
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:15,630
And if that works and is effective, then the hypothalamus detects, okay, we're headed back into the Green Zone, where returning to homeostasis.

213
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:25,219
I can shut these systems off. So thermoregulation here again is how our body strives to to keep us in that comfort zone.

214
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,720
And we've got a couple of different things to think about. So one is heat production.

215
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,930
Just by being alive, all of you are generating heat.

216
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:38,870
So everybody has a so-called basal metabolism, which we'll talk about more in the next slide.

217
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,340
So that's the heat you generate through respiration and movement, etc.

218
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,210
And then we've got work that we can layer on top of that.

219
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:54,560
So it takes energy and it creates heat to be alive. And then the harder we are working, the more heat our body is creating through that work.

220
00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:03,020
So that's internally generated. And then we can think about really the four ways that he can be exchanged between our body and the environment.

221
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,030
And so one of those is evaporation.

222
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:14,870
So if we've got hot skin surface and we've got sweat being created on the skin, that sweat will evaporate and we end up with evaporative heat loss.

223
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:23,179
We can also think about radiation. So if I'm standing near a source of radiant heat, molten glass, like Emily said,

224
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:31,459
or I'm standing on hot asphalt that is radiating heat to my body, or if I'm standing in a cold environment, I'm of the warmest thing there.

225
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,610
My body is actually radiating heat out into the environment.

226
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:44,929
We can also talk about convection. And so convection is basically heat exchanged through the movement of either a gas or a liquid across your body.

227
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:54,110
So a hot breeze blowing across you or a cold wind blowing across you, or, for instance, being in a sauna or a hot tub or a cold pool.

228
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,750
All of those things are going to have convective heat loss.

229
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:04,099
And then we can talk about conduction as well, which is basically heat loss through direct energy transfer through contact with a surface.

230
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:11,809
So we don't really focus on this so much in terms of heat stress with the exception maybe of people who work in kitchens

231
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:17,510
or other environments where you might touch something hot and you get immediate transfer of energy and it burns,

232
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:23,240
this becomes conduction a much more important issue actually for cold exposure.

233
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:31,220
And I'll tell you, if anyone is having their first winter in Michigan, you know, the first part of me that typically gets cold is my feet.

234
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,920
And that's because they are in contact with the cold ground.

235
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:38,870
So that's essentially our primary loss through conduction in the wintertime is through our feet.

236
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,969
Actually, he paused for a second, realizing I may not have started.

237
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,780
All right. Sorry, little brain fart. There. I'm back.

238
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,769
Okay, so just diving into these a little bit more.

239
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:58,330
Again, the basal metabolic rate is just how much heat we create being alive.

240
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:03,940
And an important thing to consider here is bigger. People have more of a basal metabolic rate,

241
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:11,799
so they create and essentially use more energy and create more heat just by being alive and smaller people do and then work,

242
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,980
of course, as we're doing work.

243
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:21,400
So imagining, you know, digging a hole with a shovel or carrying a heavy load, your muscle temperature rises as your muscles are working,

244
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,160
that heat from your muscles actually transfers into your blood, which then pumps throughout your body.

245
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,850
So we get some convective heat exchange there and eventually comes to your skin

246
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:35,410
and we can actually get some radiant heat loss through that mechanism as well.

247
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:42,520
Something else to remember about work, of course, you can work at different intensities and we'll talk about that later.

248
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:50,980
You can work at different speeds. You can have different loads and clothing for both heat and cold stresses is a critical thing to consider.

249
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,580
Yeah, I know.

250
00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:04,630
On a scale, usually like a smaller species have a higher metabolic rate just because of like he's lost like surface area ratio or surface area.

251
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,720
Is there like a specific reason why people it's off?

252
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:15,040
So is it just because, like, humans generally have a pretty standard one and your size just varies it?

253
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,850
Yeah. So I think if you look across species, you're absolutely right.

254
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:23,410
You know, a hummingbird, a mouse, they have incredibly high metabolisms compared to a blue whale or something.

255
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:29,590
So across that, you know, many orders of magnitude, signs of species, there are huge differences within people.

256
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,559
It's a much narrower range. So I see a higher resting rate.

257
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:38,650
But it's not as if a person who's larger is going to be closer to a blue whale and a person who is smaller is going to be closer to a hummingbird.

258
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:44,049
So it's all relative. That's a good point. Yeah. Okay.

259
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:50,620
So we talked about heat creation or heat generation. Now we'll dive a little bit more into these mechanisms of heat exchange.

260
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:56,379
So evaporation, again, is it's kind of our primary tool for heat management, for the human body.

261
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:02,050
And evaporation is just the transfer of heat by the shift of the liquid sweat, in our case, to a gas.

262
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:11,530
And so sweating is really, again, kind of our primary mechanism for reducing heat load in the body is I hinted at earlier,

263
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:17,360
the closer and closer we get to 100% relative humidity, the less and less effective sweating is.

264
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:22,630
So if you imagine being in a desert environment where I spent much of my childhood, actually,

265
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:27,580
you know, the second heat and the second sweat forms on your skin, it's going to tend to evaporate.

266
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:34,930
So you have very effective, very immediate cooling, whereas if you grew up in a swamp where it's very hot and very humid,

267
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:39,190
sweating doesn't really accomplish as much because the air is so filled with water,

268
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:44,350
the sweat doesn't have as much of a motivation, let's say, to to evaporate.

269
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,180
It's going to tend to stay in liquid form.

270
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:54,940
And I've already mentioned these level a chemical protective suits are one environment where you pretty rapidly reach 100% relative humidity.

271
00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:01,239
And no matter how much you sweat, it's not going to cool you. So this can be extremely effective under some conditions.

272
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,150
But the greater the humidity, the less effective it becomes.

273
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:11,440
You know, radiant heat is just interchange or exchange of heat without direct contact between two objects.

274
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,769
And so it turns out that if the radiant temperature around our bodies is greater than 95 degrees,

275
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:22,870
we're going to tend to absorb that radiant heat that's about our skin temperature.

276
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:29,980
And if the environment around us is less than a radiant temperature of 95 degrees, we are going to be radiating heat out into the environment.

277
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:39,100
Convective heat loss is again the transfer of heat by the flow of a gas or a liquid across our body.

278
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:44,919
So I already mentioned that actually as our blood is circulating throughout our bodies, we're getting convective heat exchange.

279
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:50,409
So as we pump blood from our core into our extremities, that's distributing that heat around our body.

280
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,330
So it's not concentrated in our core.

281
00:27:52,880 --> 00:28:01,420
And, you know, there's there's many examples you may not think of this, but jobs that involve you to be in the water may be partially submerged.

282
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:07,360
So think about a fisherman or a biologist who's out doing research in waders.

283
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:12,639
You know, they are getting convective heat loss typically to the water around them constantly.

284
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,570
And you might think, well, they're not they're not wet. How could they possibly be cold?

285
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:22,959
But in fact, there's cases of people getting hypothermia who were only immersed for part of their body in cold water.

286
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,510
And that convection just constantly sat there heat away. And then lastly, we come to convection.

287
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:32,590
So again, this is transferred through direct contact to surfaces.

288
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:39,790
And so that can be an issue. So this is an image here of road workers like I alluded to earlier.

289
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:47,080
So this is some thermal imaging done there. And you can see the background here is blue, which is the cooler temperatures in the photo.

290
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:52,510
The patch of asphalt that they've just put down is bright red. This is very hot material being applied.

291
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:57,040
And you can see that the worker's lower torso is getting a lot more heat load.

292
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:05,169
It's got brighter colors than their upper torso. So we've got radiant heat exchange going on is that asphalt radiates heat out and we

293
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:10,000
also have conductive heat exchange going on as they're standing on very hot material.

294
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:17,640
Okay. I think this is the only equation that will go through today, and it's a pretty simple one.

295
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:25,410
So let's dive into it. So what we're interested here in understanding for people is the so called heat storage rate.

296
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:32,640
So Delta S is basically an AI taking in heat, meaning a heating up that would be a delta s that's positive.

297
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:38,460
If I'm losing heat, I have a heat storage rate that's negative, meaning I'm losing heat to the environment.

298
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:45,000
And ideally what our body wants is I have a delta s of zero, meaning I'm in collaboration with my environment.

299
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:50,250
So what is that a function of? Well, we consider our metabolism and we consider work.

300
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:53,820
Those are sort of our heat generation efforts.

301
00:29:54,330 --> 00:30:02,040
And then I can have either an gain or a loss due to conductive heat exchange.

302
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:08,190
I can have a gain or loss of heat due to radiant heat exchange and for evaporation.

303
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:12,989
I only ever have a loss or a zero, so we never gain by sweating.

304
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:17,190
We can only lose heat or have sweating be ineffective basically.

305
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:22,259
And so, you know, considering these primary factors I'll highlight here,

306
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:28,589
we tend to exclude conduction from heat storage rate because unless we're focused on our heat,

307
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,850
it's typically our excuse me,

308
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:37,290
unless we're focused on our feet and conduction tends to have a very small contribution compared to the other types of heat exchange.

309
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:43,680
And so again, just, just keeping in mind conductive heat exchange could be a scaling he conducted.

310
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:49,620
We were losing heat, radiant is gain or loss and evaporation is only ever a loss or zero.

311
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:58,530
Okay, so with the equation behind us, we can shift gears now and start to talk a little bit about what might make us at higher risk,

312
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:03,209
for instance, of a heat related illness. And so all of us, of course, are unique.

313
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:10,770
We have different physical attributes we have to consider. But before we talk about those, we could just consider the general environment here.

314
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:15,209
So what sorts of things might put me at risk of a heat related illness?

315
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:21,240
Well, one is going to be I need to be working in a hot environment and I need to consider the level of humidity.

316
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:29,639
Something else would be direct sun exposure. So Jordan mentioned agricultural workers, Sweat mentioned construction workers.

317
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,980
These are both types of workers who generally are out exposed to the elements, including the sun.

318
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,810
We can also think about folks who are indoors but have radiant heat exposure, like the folks that was seeing who might work in kitchens.

319
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,310
We might think about a physical environment that has very limited air movement.

320
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,490
So think about, you know, a hot day with a fan blowing across you.

321
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:55,350
That fan feels good, right where we're taking away heat with convection.

322
00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:00,930
If air movement is limited, we've lost that ability to cool ourselves through convection.

323
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,000
So those are sort of some environmental factors we might consider.

324
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,670
There's also some personal factors that we should consider.

325
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:17,069
So one is, if you've ever had a previous heat related illness, you are considered at increased risk of having another illness.

326
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:25,350
And it's a little unclear here. So you may think, well, gosh, if I had a previous heat, heat exhaustion incidents,

327
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:31,230
maybe my systems had been damaged and less resilient to another exposure.

328
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:39,270
That's one possibility. The other is simply you might be a more vulnerable individual, you know, regardless of having that prior incident.

329
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:43,530
It's just the prior incident sort of identified you as someone who might be more vulnerable.

330
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:49,050
And therefore, for an even condition, you might be more likely to experience that health effect again.

331
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:59,760
Another one that I can attest to is advanced age. So the older you get, the less effective you are at thermoregulation lack of recent exposure.

332
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:05,910
So we're going to talk in a minute about acclimatization the process of sort of getting our body adapted to a hot environment.

333
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,459
Pregnancy is another condition that we need to be accounting for.

334
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:17,760
Pregnant women have different blood flow. They have different demands on their body than a non-pregnant individual does.

335
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:25,170
We need to account for medications. There's some types of medications that make people more vulnerable to a heat related illness.

336
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:32,459
We also have to think not just about medical conditions, but about maybe more acute circumstances.

337
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:38,970
Like if I had enough fluids, if I'm already dehydrated, that's definitely going to put me at greater risk of heat related illness.

338
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:42,629
You know, how hard is this job or this activity making me work?

339
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:50,660
What's my physical effort? And then a couple of final factors would be, am I wearing personal protective equipment like that level,

340
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:56,010
a suit that I talked about, what sort of clothing am I wearing? Is it appropriate for this environment?

341
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:05,399
And lastly, we think about just general physical condition and sort of preexisting health problems that folks might have that might make them,

342
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,580
again, a little less resilient to a given heat exposure.

343
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,680
So I'm an explorer, a couple. Of risk factors in particular.

344
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:17,090
All of them are important, but these are the ones that we'll focus on today.

345
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:23,799
So there's things that are relatively within our control as occupational and environmental health professionals.

346
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,960
So especially in a workplace, you know, we can set standards as to what type of clothing people wear.

347
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:33,909
We can talk about giving people time to get acclimatized to heat.

348
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:39,340
We can talk about physical fitness requirements, hydration, electrolytes and medications.

349
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,910
And then we have some uncontrollable things that we can't alter, but they are factors we have to consider.

350
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,210
So one of them is body size, which is not, to a large degree, controllable.

351
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:55,270
We've got the age of the worker and then a worker or an individual's just general health condition.

352
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:00,640
So for this first controllable factor, we'll talk about clothing.

353
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,510
And I don't know what scientists thought. They were being hilarious when they came up with this,

354
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:11,550
but they decided that the units of clothing shall be described as a clue or a clothing insulation value.

355
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,820
So one clue is the insulation that a man made.

356
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:21,160
You would need to be comfortable sitting in a typical office at 70 degrees Fahrenheit.

357
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:32,830
I make the point of man because a lot of the data on sort of human factors in temperature, comfort conditions were done primarily on males.

358
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:37,930
And so you might, if any of you have worked in an office environment, have made the observation,

359
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:42,759
gosh, it seems like women in my office are often less comfortable in a given temperature.

360
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:48,670
They're more likely to be cold. And that's because of the way we heat and cool our buildings really didn't consider women.

361
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:58,540
So this is another huge oversight in terms of just our understanding of attempt to deal with thermal environments so we can think about zero clothes.

362
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:03,940
Imagine them coming up with that unit for a person that doesn't have any clothing on,

363
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:08,620
you know, sort of 1.0 clothes here being comfortable office wear.

364
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:14,889
And then the higher the number of clothes, the more layer and the more insulation you have for clothing.

365
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:19,690
So I will say these these clothing installation values are not really exact values.

366
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:26,110
They're just intended to show, you know, a relative spectrum from no clothing all the way up to as many clothes as you can possibly wear.

367
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,040
If any of you have ever seen that friend's episode eating myself, never mind.

368
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,710
We can also think about acclimatization. And so this is a key thing that we can control.

369
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:42,310
It turns out that the vast majority of working fatalities due to heat happen to

370
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:46,150
people who are in their first couple of days actually working in that environment.

371
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:55,809
So acclimatization is this, you know, relatively rapid but still gradual adaptation physiologically that our bodies make to respond to heat stress.

372
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:59,470
And there's really three primary things that our bodies learn to do differently.

373
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:04,480
The first is we sweat earlier as we're getting hot and we sweat more.

374
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,129
The second is if we look at a person who's acclimatized versus one who's not,

375
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:14,110
if they're doing the same amount of work, the person who is acclimatized is going to have heart rate that's lower.

376
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:20,520
Their heart is basically performing more efficiently, and we're going to have more blood flow to the skin.

377
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,780
That's an adaptation that our our body will make.

378
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,800
And so it turns out that sort of rule of thumb to consider a person acclimatized is they need to have been

379
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:38,830
working or physically exerting themselves for at least two continuous hours per day for eight consecutive days.

380
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,980
So this is not something where we're like, oh, in a couple of months you might be acclimatized.

381
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:47,020
It's just a little bit more than a week to where we get to this point of acclimatization.

382
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:54,580
So it does take a little bit of time to accumulate. The bad news is once you're out of heat, we lose those adaptations in about four days.

383
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:59,530
So it takes you longer to become acclimatized than it does to lose that acclimatization.

384
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:04,930
Now, you might ask, and it's a totally reasonable question, well, where does this eight days come from?

385
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:11,080
And so what I'm showing you here is, is kind of a synthesis of a bunch of different studies that have been done here.

386
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,149
And so we're looking at a couple of different things.

387
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:19,030
On the x axis, this is number of days, zero being your first day of heat exposure all the way up to day nine.

388
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,030
On the left y axis, we're talking about everybody's favorite form of body temperature measurement,

389
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:30,700
the rectal temperature, which ranges here from 37 and a half to 39 and a half.

390
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,410
On the right y axis, we're looking at how much or how fast you sweat.

391
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:42,700
So this is your sweat loss kg of sweat loss per 70 kilogram body weight per hour.

392
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:48,009
So a rate at which you're sweating. And then we've got a couple of different curves on here, as you can see.

393
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:52,270
So we're looking at rectal temperatures. Those are the dark circles here.

394
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,530
We've got pulse rate here. That's the open circles.

395
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:01,870
And then in triangles we've got sweat loss.

396
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:05,440
So this is basically how much you're sweating your sweat rate.

397
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:11,470
And so when we look across people, when we put them into hot work on day zero, you can.

398
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:21,360
See that their their rectal temperature is quite high, their sweat loss rate is quite low, and their pulse rate is quite high as well.

399
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:25,450
So their body is working really hard to adapt to this hot environment.

400
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,690
And as we go forward in time, on subsequent days,

401
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:35,770
you see the heart rate and the rectal temperature decline pretty precipitously and the sweat rate goes up at almost an equal rate.

402
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:41,990
And you can see we get a plateau basically where you're not sweating any harder and your blood pressure,

403
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:46,230
your heart rate and your rectal temperature are not declining anymore.

404
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:52,479
So we've basically plateaued and that happens around date eight so that eight days a useful guideline,

405
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:59,230
but it is actually based on some empirical data. Now I will say when I was at the University of Washington,

406
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:07,450
we had a research team there that was trying to do some heat stress research on agricultural workers, which are quite common in eastern Washington.

407
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:12,219
And these folks had gotten like a $300,000 grant to do this.

408
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:19,810
And they wanted to do the the best type of measurement you possibly can for heat stress, which is a rectal temperature taken over the course of a day.

409
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:27,580
And so they struggled for months to get people to essentially wear a rectal thermometer for an eight hour day.

410
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,120
And I think after eight months, they had two participants.

411
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,569
So this is like $150,000 per participant study.

412
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:38,610
And then they had to call it after that because they were just like, we know people don't want to participate.

413
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,089
Go figure. I don't know what they were paying,

414
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:47,410
but clearly it was not enough of the subject incentive to overcome that obvious point of discouragement and great discomfort.

415
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,130
We'll talk a little bit later about other types of technology we can use instead of that that good old rectal thermometer.

416
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:01,810
So we can also think about physical fitness and hydration. As I said, you probably know this intuitively.

417
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:07,120
You know, people who are more physically fit tend to have better cardiovascular capabilities.

418
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:12,610
Their heart and their cardiovascular system are going to respond better to the stress that he provides.

419
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:17,469
They're going to be better able to to circulate that blood and actually their tissues

420
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:22,330
and move that blood around the body and to the skin where it can radiate its heat out.

421
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:27,140
And then hydration may be the easiest thing to to think about here.

422
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:31,299
So any time we've got workers in heat who are taking in liquids, you know,

423
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:35,860
as long as they're not drinking hot coffee or a heated fluid, those liquids are doing two things.

424
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:41,499
One, when you drink cold liquid, you get convective and conductive heat exchange.

425
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,620
Basically, that's going to cool the part of your body that it touches.

426
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:53,110
The other thing is, as you sweat, you're losing water volume and that's going to reduce your blood volume and make your heart work harder so those

427
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:59,050
fluids you take in will increase your blood volume and reduce the strain a little bit more on your cardiac system.

428
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:05,680
And then the last two controllable factors I'll mention are electrolytes and medic medications.

429
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:11,110
So electrolytes, you know, we can think about things like salt and other minerals.

430
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:15,700
So sodium, potassium, calcium, these things are critical for bodily function.

431
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:19,960
They are things that we tend to lose through sweat.

432
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:24,430
You know, you can think about let me just pop an energy drink here.

433
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:28,040
It talks about rebalancing my electrolytes. That's not a bad idea.

434
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:31,600
We do want balance here. So if we have too many electrolytes in our system,

435
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:36,910
that's going to actually reduce the amount of fluid that we actually absorb into our body when we drink.

436
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:46,050
And if we have a lack of electrolytes or too much water, on the other hand, we can get a condition called water intoxication or hyponatremia,

437
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:52,840
or basically we just don't have enough electrolytes to run all of the cellular processes we need to stay alive.

438
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:57,710
In terms of getting electrolytes, you know, there's many ways to do this.

439
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:05,200
Obviously, diet is the primary one we're going to focus on. So there's lots of foods and energy drinks out there that are high in electrolytes.

440
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:09,490
Historically, workers would be getting salt tablets.

441
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:16,840
So this is an electrolyte and it certainly can help maintain your electrolyte balance.

442
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:22,270
But of course, as we've learned over the years, that high salt is not actually good for your cardiovascular system.

443
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:26,140
We've kind of backed off on that unless you have a really good medical monitoring going on.

444
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,979
And then the last thing I'll mention is just medications and alcohol.

445
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:37,960
So medications, again, there are medications that simply make you, for instance, unable to elevate your heart rate sufficiently to cool yourself.

446
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:45,309
And alcohol, in addition to being a source of dehydration, also impairs your judgment,

447
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:48,370
which you don't want to have happen if you're working in a high heat environment.

448
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,600
Okay, so let's shift a little bit here and we'll start talking more about the health effects.

449
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:00,670
You know, as I've done throughout class, I've tried to find the best comics that I could to lighten things up.

450
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:04,059
There's there's just pretty slim pickings out there. But I think these are pretty funny.

451
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:09,130
I don't know about you guys. I just love this pic bacon here.

452
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,679
Okay, so there are. Lots of things that he can do. You can get heat, syncope or fainting from heat.

453
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:21,470
You can get heat cramps, you can get heat rash. Those are all pretty mild and innocuous.

454
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:26,660
The two most concerning disorders that we're going to focus on are heat exhaustion first.

455
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,680
And that's a precursor basically to heat stroke, which is the one that can kill you.

456
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,330
And so if we dive into these and a little bit more detail, so heat exhaustion,

457
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:40,819
this essentially is a situation where a worker is working or a person is working as hard

458
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:44,900
as they possibly can and their body is right at its limit of being able to cool itself.

459
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:50,000
So here we've got symptoms like fatigue. The person is generally going to feel weak.

460
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:56,120
They may start to have some central nervous system impacts, dizziness, headache signs here.

461
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:00,740
They're going to have a really high pulse rate. Their heart is working as hard as it can to cool them off.

462
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:05,389
They're going to be sweating profusely. They'll tend to have a low blood pressure.

463
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:12,680
They will tend to be pale again. The body is pumped basically as much of its blood as it can to the extremities.

464
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:17,150
Your core is is a little bit light on blood. They may, in fact, collapse.

465
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:24,350
The cause here typically is dehydration. You know, poor physical fitness can certainly tie into that.

466
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:28,610
You know, really the blood is in our periphery, not in our core, not in our brain where we need it.

467
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:37,250
And generally, it's workers who are not acclimatized, who are experiencing this, you know, in terms of first aid, this is something we can stop.

468
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:40,040
And it's, you know, relatively simple prescription here.

469
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:45,500
We want to lay the person down so their heart doesn't have to work as hard vertically against gravity to pump blood.

470
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,870
We want to get them in cool conditions.

471
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:54,200
We want to get them hydrated and we want to loosen clothing, which is going to allow more convective exchange of heat.

472
00:45:54,890 --> 00:46:01,910
And then in terms of prevention here, you know, having a regular regimen where a person is drinking water or some other fluids

473
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:06,770
frequently and it's not stopping every hour to guzzle a gallon of water at a time.

474
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:10,490
It's more smaller intake and more regular intervals.

475
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,370
You know, we can think about adding electrolytes to food.

476
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:20,660
And again, some kind of acclimatization routine here is is really one of the best ways we can prevent this from happening.

477
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:29,810
Now, if a worker or person sort of edges past heat exhaustion, the next region, the one that's really of concern here is heat stroke.

478
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:37,430
And so at this point, the body has exceeded its ability to cool itself and systems are basically starting to break down.

479
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:45,320
So you can start to get some fairly bizarre symptoms. So although this person is incredibly hot, they may in fact be experiencing chills.

480
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:49,370
They are certain to have some kinds of CNS symptoms.

481
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:53,330
Often they're very irritable. They may be acting euphoric.

482
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,870
So again, their their central nervous system is is short circuited.

483
00:46:56,870 --> 00:47:01,219
Basically. They will certainly have a red face and hot red skin.

484
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:04,370
They're not going to be sweating anymore because they've sweated all they can.

485
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,130
So, again, that that system is no longer functioning. They'll be disoriented, they might be shivering.

486
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:13,700
They will very often collapse and go into convulsions.

487
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:20,329
And the body temperature here, which, you know, typically for an oral temperature, we're looking at 98.6 Fahrenheit.

488
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:24,140
Right. It's typically going to be above 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

489
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:29,600
The cause here is just too much heat and insufficient tolerance or ability to adapt.

490
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:34,579
The first aid here is not let's just lay this person down and get them something cold to drink.

491
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:40,790
This is a life threatening condition. So we need to do immediate cooling and we need to immediately get them to a health care facility.

492
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:45,169
And oftentimes the treatment here is to put an I.V. in them and put them in an ice bath.

493
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:49,280
So we're looking for sort of crash course in the prevention here.

494
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,790
You know, it's just going to be let's reduce the risk of heat stress, period.

495
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:58,760
Let's promote healthy lifestyles wherever we can. And again, let's acclimatize people wherever that's a possibility.

496
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:08,360
So just to review here our bodies, abilities and mechanisms for responding to thermal challenges here.

497
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,820
So I started this section of the lecture talking about the heat storage rate.

498
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:16,370
Again, if that's positive, we're taking in heat. If it's negative, we're losing.

499
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:23,690
So if we've got a heat storage rate that's greater than zero, we are taking in heat, our body temperature is increasing.

500
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:28,069
So you see our core temperature goes up. That's typically going to trigger sweating.

501
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:35,090
That's a good thing. So that has the possibility of reducing our heat storage rate through evaporation.

502
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:38,480
We're also going to get increased skin blood flow.

503
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:46,940
And if that blood flow to the skin is excessive over a long period of time, we can get heat, syncope if we also have a static posture.

504
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:52,130
So that's basically fainting just because your blood is not in your central nervous system where it needs to be.

505
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,150
And as our skin blood flow increases, our skin temperature increases.

506
00:48:56,150 --> 00:49:05,270
And that further triggered just sweating here. So if we sweat for sustained periods of time in the sweat doesn't have an opportunity to evaporate.

507
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:11,150
That can lead to heat rash. Again, that's a mild annoyance. Nothing more as we sweat.

508
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:16,930
We are going to start losing water. So if we sweat too much, we're going to end up in a dehydrated condition.

509
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:20,740
And that can lead us to heat exhaustion as we sweat.

510
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:24,850
We're also going to start to lose salts and electrolytes, and that can lead to cramping.

511
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:30,400
Again, that's an annoyance, I would say, but not something we're especially concerned about.

512
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:35,110
And if we sweat too much again, we're going to potentially run out of water to sweat,

513
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,380
in which case we are no longer able to cool ourselves through sweating.

514
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:44,530
And that's really the mechanism that leads to further kind of uncontrolled heat gain and maybe even heat stroke.

515
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:48,490
So it's a somewhat complicated system I haven't highlighted in them here,

516
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:53,950
but we do have some kind of feedback loops that allow our body to respond and correct the situation.

517
00:49:56,310 --> 00:50:00,960
All right. So let's talk now about how we actually evaluate heat stress.

518
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:10,860
So what we're trying to do when we have workers working in heat is we want to keep their core temperature less than 100.3 degrees.

519
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:17,310
So that's about a half a degree Fahrenheit above sort of normal internal body temperature.

520
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,500
And that's the core temperature will permit in on acclimatize workers.

521
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:26,820
So we actually allow workers who are acclimatized a little bit higher exposure, as we'll talk about in a moment.

522
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:34,080
And we also so it's one thing to monitor their internal temperature, and we should be doing that, but we also want to keep an eye on their heart.

523
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,729
So ideally, we want to keep people's average heart rate at a reasonable level here.

524
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:43,670
And so an average of less than 110 beats per minute is is one thing to aim for.

525
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:50,339
So we can do that with a rectal thermometer. But I've already talked to you about how challenging that can be.

526
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:56,760
A much more sort of acceptable way to monitor internal body temperature is with a unit like this.

527
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,480
So this is one example of a personal heat dosimeter.

528
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:08,489
And so it's essentially some circuitry inside here that's connected by a wire to an earplug with a thermometer in it.

529
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:15,510
So you wear this earplug all day. The thermometer is essentially measuring the body temperature, actual tympanic membrane,

530
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:20,339
your eardrum, which is a pretty good approximation of your internal body temperature.

531
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:26,340
And so you can wear this all day long and get real time feedback on what your estimated core body temperature is.

532
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:29,549
That's way better to wear it in your ear than elsewhere.

533
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:35,670
We'll just leave that there if even that is a little too uncomfortable.

534
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:43,800
There's also opportunities for telemetry here. So there are actually thermometer pills that you can have a worker or someone else swallow.

535
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:48,870
That pill is going to work their way through the system over the course of, say, 12 to 18 hours.

536
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:56,190
And as it's passing through your system, it can talk to a reader device nearby and tell the reader, what's my internal body temperature?

537
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,120
Now, of course, eventually the pill is going to come out the other end. These are disposable.

538
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,090
There's no one looking to recover these pills once they've been used.

539
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:08,160
So this can be fairly expensive and maybe not so sustainable way to measure temperature,

540
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:11,430
but it really is kind of as close as we can get to the gold standard of a

541
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:17,580
measure inside you that is more palatable to workers than a rectal thermometer.

542
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:25,079
So there's actually a lot of different ways we can characterize the environment around us in terms of heat.

543
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:30,989
So I'm going to walk you through each of these in the next few minutes so we can measure a dry bulb temperature,

544
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:35,160
which is basically considering the air temperature, plus any radiant heat.

545
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:41,250
We can talk about the natural wet bulb temperature, which also accounts for humidity and air movement.

546
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:48,930
We can look at just air movement all by itself. We can take a globe temperature which measures radiant heat only.

547
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:55,950
And then there's a metric called the wet bulb globe temperature w BGP that takes all of the above into the account.

548
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:59,640
So this is really what we're always trying to get to when we measure heat.

549
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:08,370
So walking through each of these one by one, the dry bulb temperature or what we call TB is just a direct measurement of air temperature.

550
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:17,130
So probably all of you have had a liquid in glass thermometer, you know, shoved under your tongue at some point to measure your own body temperature.

551
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:24,660
We can take that same thermometer. It just put it out in the air and measure will how hot or how cold is the air

552
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:29,760
with the caveat that we also make sure that it's exposed to any radiant heat.

553
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:34,860
So if it's sitting in direct sunlight, it's going to pick up the air temperature, plus the radiant heat.

554
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:38,160
And if it's sitting in a shadow, it's just going to be measuring the air temperature.

555
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:45,330
And so this is a measurement that we may or may not want to shield from radiant heat.

556
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:51,690
So if we want to know, well, how hot is it considering the air and, for instance, the energy from the sun?

557
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:57,840
And we wouldn't shield it or we could put it in some sort of shielding device to just measure the air temperature.

558
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:03,570
Regardless, when we measure a dry bulb temperature, we want to shield this thermometer from moisture.

559
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:07,860
So we don't want to account with this measure for evaporation that might occur.

560
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:14,009
But of course, we do want to understand what's happening from an evaporative perspective because,

561
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:24,059
again, that's our our bodies primary cooling mechanism. So this natural wet bulb temperature or T and B actually also incorporates relative humidity.

562
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:29,549
And essentially the way that this is done is you take a dry bulb thermometer and you dip it

563
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:35,520
into a reservoir of liquid that's connected to the thermometer with some sort of material.

564
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:45,599
Muslin is often used here where as the water wakes up into that material, it will then evaporate and that's going to cool the thermometer off.

565
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:54,480
So here we can sort of approximate, well, how much heat do we think would be lost by a person's skin due to evaporation using this?

566
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:58,740
Experimental setup or instrument, basically.

567
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:04,709
We can also measure airspeed directly is an estimate of how much air is moving.

568
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:11,970
So that's really important for both convective heat, you know, the movement of the air across the skin, but also for evaporation.

569
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:16,710
The more the air is moving across the skin, the more likely that sweat is to evaporate.

570
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:24,900
And there are instruments like thermal or vane anemometers that we can use to measure the movement of air over time in space,

571
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,559
we can also measure global temperature.

572
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:36,000
And so the idea here is I only want to measure radiant heat, so I'm not interested in humidity or air temperature.

573
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,450
It's just radiant heat. And so the way this has been done is you take a sphere and you paint it matte black.

574
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:47,430
So it basically absorbs as much solar energy as possible and you put a thermometer in there.

575
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:55,140
And so if you have this globe thermometer and you have a dry bulb thermometer next to it and they're showing you the same temperature,

576
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:58,860
that must mean that basically you don't have any radiant load.

577
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:01,560
There's no energy. It's just the air temperature that you're measuring.

578
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:08,249
And the bigger the difference between the dry bulb thermometer and the globe thermometer, the more radiant heat you have.

579
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:11,219
So you can start to see we can compare the measurements from these various

580
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:16,200
thermometers and figure out what is this gold standard that we're trying to get to,

581
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:22,020
the wet bulb globe thermometer. And so there's a bunch of different types of these devices.

582
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,950
The idea here is for the most comprehensive of them,

583
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:33,330
this device here actually has a drive old thermometer inside this little housing that looks kind of like a pagoda.

584
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:37,710
So that's measuring air temperature and it's shielded from radiant heat.

585
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:42,000
The little white structure here actually spins around.

586
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:45,900
So it's an anemometer, so it directly measures wind speed as well.

587
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:49,770
This is a globe thermometer just measuring radiant temperature.

588
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:54,690
And then this little unit here in the center, which is pretty washed out in the slides here,

589
00:56:54,690 --> 00:57:01,110
but you should be able to see in your slides is actually a little water reservoir with a muslin covered thermometer in the middle.

590
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:09,660
So that measures the wet bulb temperature. And so when we combine all those things together, we get the wet bulb, the globe temperature.

591
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:15,150
That's our best understanding and estimation of how heat relates to human health risk.

592
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:19,230
So I lied earlier. There's three equations in the lecture.

593
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:22,559
I apologize, but this one's just as simple as the earlier one.

594
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:27,299
So we've got basically two different equations we can use.

595
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:32,250
One is if we've got workers who are outdoors working in the sun, they've got a lot of radiant heat.

596
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:38,030
And so here, if we want to compute the T, we would take the natural wet bulb temperature.

597
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:44,610
We wait that by point seven. We take the globe thermometer and we do that by 0.2.

598
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:47,910
And then we take the drive of thermometer and we do that by point one.

599
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:53,190
And so as an example here, if I've got a worker on a construction site, it's a sunny day.

600
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:57,960
You know, here's the natural wet ball temperature, the globe temperature and the tribal temperature.

601
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,590
What would the wet bulb globe temperature BGP be?

602
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:10,170
And again, it's just simple plug in showed here. And this would tell me the WBC would be 86 degrees for this particular example.

603
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:15,569
And then the other equation we have is for workers who aren't working in direct sunlight.

604
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:20,700
So they're either indoors or they're outdoors, but it's cloudy, there's no direct solar load.

605
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:25,319
And so in this case, we take out the drivable temperature because we assume the dry build and the

606
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:29,010
globe thermometer are going to be the same since there's no radiant heating.

607
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:35,940
So it's 0.7 times the natural wall, wet bulb temperature plus point three times the globe temperature.

608
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:41,040
And again, I've got a a worked example for you there that's fairly straightforward.

609
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:53,670
So I'll just give you an example here of another device that just untangled these last verse here.

610
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:59,950
So bear with me for a moment while I try to extricate these things.

611
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:07,960
So these little units here are designed to be worn or taken with an individual in there.

612
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:15,940
And it's essentially not a personal dosimeter because it's not data logging or anything that can be used to basically play with,

613
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,490
as you can, popping out of their little covers here.

614
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:28,150
And so this is a device that's relatively inexpensive and really has been marketed primarily for people like wildland firefighters.

615
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:37,220
So if you imagine a group that has potentially really high heat exposures and is probably not going to have a record anemometer for 8 hours a day,

616
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:41,680
you know, we want to give them a tool where they can estimate what their own exposures are.

617
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:49,210
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm so hung up on the record for monitor. It's just sounds so, so awful to do that for 8 hours.

618
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:56,230
So as you take a look at this device, this is much simpler than that big, complex unit that I showed you on the previous slide.

619
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:01,969
And this does not do a wet bulb, temperatures in a water reservoir, but it'll do everything else.

620
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:06,340
So you see there's a little vein anemometer there. So if you blow through that, you see it spins.

621
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:12,280
So that'll measure airspeed. And then if you turn the unit on with the power button in the middle there,

622
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:18,760
you'll see you can just sort of scroll left to right through a bunch of different measurements that this thing will make.

623
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:24,580
So this will measure the current wind speed, the maximum wind speed.

624
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:28,630
Again, I'm just kind of scrolling through here that the average wind speed,

625
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:33,940
if you keep scrolling after that, it'll tell you the current temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

626
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:42,430
So it's 72.4 in here right now. It will tell you the relative humidity as an estimation.

627
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:52,720
So this is not quite as accurate as the natural wet ball, but this is telling us about 31% humidity, which is probably a pretty realistic estimate.

628
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,840
It will also give us a heat index measurement here.

629
01:00:55,840 --> 01:01:03,280
That's the HPI. It'll tell us the dew point, the point at which we would achieve 100% relative humidity.

630
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:12,220
It tells us the time as well. So, again, a pretty simple unit, I want to say these cost about $50 each so they're not outrageously expensive.

631
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:17,900
The unit that I showed you in the past that went around just in case anyone hasn't gotten one yet.

632
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:24,040
The unit I showed you a couple of slides ago is more in the order of several thousand dollars.

633
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:32,530
And this, if you put it on, a firefighter would break in about 30 seconds, whereas the units you guys are holding are much more tough, let's say.

634
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:38,469
And so this, I think, is a great example of an instrument that's not like the be all,

635
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:45,430
end all scientific instrument for heat evaluation, but it's way better than nothing and it's something people can carry out with them.

636
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:49,510
So if you imagine agricultural workers, construction workers, logging workers,

637
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:55,360
they don't have an industrial hygienist over their shoulder all day long. They probably don't have an industrial hygienist at all.

638
01:01:55,870 --> 01:02:01,960
But if you can tell them, hey, take this unit out and if the heat index ever gets over a certain number, I want you to stop working.

639
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:10,180
That's a pretty easy guideline for them to implement, so I'll let you guys play around with those.

640
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:13,959
Now, I'd love to try something different.

641
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:21,640
Here is where we're playing with those instruments. So I built in a bit of time here to do a quick experiment with you all.

642
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:32,890
I was thinking, if this sounds okay and to divide you up into maybe four groups in here and have each of the groups look at a different case plan,

643
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:39,340
heat stress for a worker, throw together some slides and then we'll do a quick little presentation to the class.

644
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:44,680
So this is sort of Shark Tank style. I guess we'll we'll put you under a pressure situation.

645
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:51,069
I'm not looking for anything fancy, but I'll give you some options here to look at in terms of cases.

646
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:56,379
And then if you guys want to come up with just one or two slides, kind of summarizing the key things here.

647
01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:00,910
So again, I just want us to recognize that the goal here is to recognize there's lots of

648
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:05,230
different circumstances that can lead to heat stress or even a heat fatality.

649
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:10,240
And there's some things that tend to happen in common. So we think about the work situation.

650
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:17,500
What do we know about the heat they were exposed to? What are the health outcomes and maybe any recommendations you might have?

651
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:23,380
So my suggestion here would be let's have maybe the front row of you.

652
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:32,020
Just go to this website here and there's going to be a very short write up of a heat related either fatality or a serious case.

653
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:37,210
And again, put together maybe one or two slides that you can just email to me will display them up here.

654
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:42,429
Let's have Christine and Jordan and Swati. You guys can do the second case here.

655
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:47,950
We'll have the third row do case number three and then you three in the back can do case number four.

656
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:54,090
Yeah. So let's let's just take 10 minutes here. You guys can read through the case.

657
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:59,690
The study together again, put together some totally rudimentary slides, nothing fancy required.

658
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:04,660
And then maybe we'll get a two minute presentation from each group just about what they found.

659
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:08,959
So does that make sense to everybody? Okay, so let's let's do it.

660
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:14,420
I'll start the timer here. It's a bit of a trial, so I'd love feedback on it after we're done.

661
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:18,650
But in the meantime, I'll start the timer here and you guys can get to it.

662
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,120
Yeah, yeah. Sure. To Google.

663
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:32,910
Should be. It's.

664
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:45,510
So talking about. Oh, thank you for bringing it back.

665
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:56,252
Sure. I got hear.

666
01:04:58,184 --> 01:05:01,804
I can do the health outcome. Yeah.

667
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:06,433
And I suppose I should say if you want to split it up between multiple people you're welcome to,

668
01:05:06,434 --> 01:05:09,763
but probably be more expedient just to have one person come out.

669
01:05:09,764 --> 01:05:17,784
So please, Emily, take it away. Yeah, for sure. So the capacity that we were given was a 31 year old male construction worker who

670
01:05:17,784 --> 01:05:22,934
was working in 80 degree weather and six degrees higher than what it usually was.

671
01:05:23,564 --> 01:05:29,503
He was working for about 9 hours that day and started like complaining that he wasn't feeling well.

672
01:05:29,504 --> 01:05:38,894
So his supervisor told him to go and rest in the shade where he rested for about 10 minutes and then got up and was staggering and incoherent.

673
01:05:39,434 --> 01:05:46,964
They took him to the hospital, I believe. Right. They put some ice on his neck and he died at the hospital, heatstroke.

674
01:05:47,804 --> 01:05:52,574
So that was the overall gist of what happened.

675
01:05:53,744 --> 01:05:59,593
Some of the recommendations that we would give were just to put more brakes or put more brakes

676
01:05:59,594 --> 01:06:05,084
and have the workers working in shifts so that they're not staying in heat for so long.

677
01:06:05,654 --> 01:06:08,414
Provide a shaded area with some snacks and water.

678
01:06:08,414 --> 01:06:16,034
In the article, they did say that they provided water, but they didn't mention if they had like lunch breaks or how often they were eating.

679
01:06:16,604 --> 01:06:20,503
So we think even just like giving the construction workers some chips,

680
01:06:20,504 --> 01:06:24,944
it's just the easy way to get salt in so that, you know, more of that water can be absorbed.

681
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:29,654
And then another suggestion that's not necessarily up here is working during cooler periods of the day.

682
01:06:30,404 --> 01:06:36,344
So starting early in the morning and then like later in the evening when there's more shade and it's not as hot outside.

683
01:06:37,784 --> 01:06:41,324
Awesome. That's exactly what I was hoping for. So thank you very much, Emily.

684
01:06:43,454 --> 01:06:48,254
So let's see. We've got next. Looks like squaddies grew.

685
01:06:57,314 --> 01:07:00,104
Pretty much I'm just going to read the slide.

686
01:07:01,714 --> 01:07:09,164
So our case study was based off of a factory worker in Kentucky who it was apparently his first day of work.

687
01:07:10,274 --> 01:07:19,454
And he was involved in a he worked at a factory to avoid sewing boards and making concrete forms.

688
01:07:19,454 --> 01:07:27,134
And so he worked until 5 p.m. that day and was in the parking lot, apparently collapsed behind his vehicle.

689
01:07:27,134 --> 01:07:34,154
And another factory worker found him doing like when he was starting his second shift.

690
01:07:34,154 --> 01:07:41,173
He didn't know what to do. So he informed his supervisor, who immediately called the emergency medical services.

691
01:07:41,174 --> 01:07:45,014
And that day later that on the day of the incident,

692
01:07:45,014 --> 01:07:54,164
they took his temperature and he was at 107 degrees Fahrenheit and he was admitted to hospital the next day.

693
01:07:54,164 --> 01:08:02,354
He died of a heat stroke and his internal temperature that was recorded on the day of his death was 108 degrees Fahrenheit.

694
01:08:03,404 --> 01:08:07,214
And we also have the outdoor weather conditions that are mentioned here.

695
01:08:09,314 --> 01:08:13,693
It was his first day of work. He apparently did not have lunch.

696
01:08:13,694 --> 01:08:25,124
He only drank water even though the factory said that they did provide they had water stations at multiple places and that they provided food all day.

697
01:08:25,154 --> 01:08:29,024
But he only had lunch and he wore really heavy clothing that day.

698
01:08:30,194 --> 01:08:37,124
And they these were the recommendations that were provided in the article that says that employees

699
01:08:37,124 --> 01:08:44,144
should train their supervisors to recognize some symptoms of heat and shot exhaustion and to,

700
01:08:44,174 --> 01:08:47,084
again, to avoid dehydration and heat exhaustion,

701
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:56,083
that it's advised that employees take frequent breaks and are provided drinking water every now and then while working in hot conditions.

702
01:08:56,084 --> 01:09:01,604
And the third recommendation was that workers should be adjusted accordingly to accommodate

703
01:09:01,694 --> 01:09:08,114
such work conditions for people who work at situations with high heat and high heat.

704
01:09:09,194 --> 01:09:14,074
Great. Thank you, sir. All right.

705
01:09:16,774 --> 01:09:26,624
Who have Nicole's group up next. Okay.

706
01:09:26,864 --> 01:09:34,034
So our case was a lawnmower passed away after working like it was the end of a shift.

707
01:09:37,314 --> 01:09:43,934
So think that he was using a push mower on his hand, push mower here throughout the day.

708
01:09:44,384 --> 01:09:49,924
At one point, near the end of the day, complained of having like like had no source of breath.

709
01:09:49,934 --> 01:09:53,684
His coworker came, offered him water, offered him a break. He refused help.

710
01:09:54,224 --> 01:09:57,494
Eventually collapsed. They immediately called 911.

711
01:09:57,824 --> 01:10:01,843
He was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead. And his temperature was internal.

712
01:10:01,844 --> 01:10:14,684
Temperature at the time was 107.6. So he was declared declared dead because of heat stroke and recommendations for preventing this in the future.

713
01:10:15,014 --> 01:10:18,134
Good, good.

714
01:10:18,134 --> 01:10:22,904
I'm understanding my personal medication regimen played a role in this because

715
01:10:22,904 --> 01:10:27,584
he was on an antipsychotic that is known to cause issues with body regulation.

716
01:10:28,094 --> 01:10:31,934
So just in the future, understanding your employees and their what they're taking.

717
01:10:32,774 --> 01:10:36,434
Also, task rotation, taking more frequent breaks, hydration.

718
01:10:36,734 --> 01:10:40,274
He was wearing multiple layers of clothing when he was brought to the hospital.

719
01:10:40,544 --> 01:10:47,353
So reducing the layers and then just recognizing the signs and symptoms like more than likely the person can come to you and say,

720
01:10:47,354 --> 01:10:53,024
I'm in, I'm having heatstroke and is being more aware. But yeah, that was our situation.

721
01:10:53,444 --> 01:10:57,254
Perfect. Thanks, Nicole. All right.

722
01:10:57,614 --> 01:11:01,574
And last but not least, we've got Andrew's group here.

723
01:11:02,384 --> 01:11:11,114
I like a military portrait from my grandma. Prince Mohammed is a 44 year old.

724
01:11:11,534 --> 01:11:16,864
Margaret died as a farmer and he was from Mexico.

725
01:11:16,874 --> 01:11:20,564
He worked for about 6 hours before he walked for three days.

726
01:11:20,564 --> 01:11:25,513
And for that day he worked for about 6 hours. And during the morning he had a small break.

727
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:32,084
We had crackers, soda, and then a small lunch. Before he felt a well before he felt a well.

728
01:11:32,624 --> 01:11:40,363
It was very hot and humid with a period of about 100 210 which and what the heat

729
01:11:40,364 --> 01:11:45,554
in the spring was kind of what I would consider 110 considered high risk level.

730
01:11:46,334 --> 01:11:50,774
And he worked for 2 hours before he felt a well and complained to his leader.

731
01:11:51,224 --> 01:12:00,704
And so he was transported back where his house, where the workhouse, where they were not provided fence or any sort of air conditioning.

732
01:12:01,244 --> 01:12:10,874
And by three or 4 to 5, he died of a body of 1 to 8 degrees with an indication of heatstroke, which was about 104.

733
01:12:11,384 --> 01:12:16,124
So four times a day by heatstroke. And the worker was apparently had no farm experience.

734
01:12:17,594 --> 01:12:20,624
I'm just going to call out, not only did he die,

735
01:12:20,624 --> 01:12:30,613
he straight up died alone because we did not read the recommendations before we wrote that was that they should have more water stations available,

736
01:12:30,614 --> 01:12:33,554
better health information, have employees that provide food,

737
01:12:33,554 --> 01:12:39,674
because apparently the workers had to make their own food and provide own food and of course, a more everyday routine.

738
01:12:40,274 --> 01:12:52,574
What the CDC recommended is, of course, to do is for employers to develop a more stringent routine and comprehensive safety and health program,

739
01:12:52,574 --> 01:12:57,644
which includes safety standard operating procedures for prevention of heat related illnesses,

740
01:12:58,004 --> 01:13:06,104
and also to have supervisors in place to be trained in prevention of such evidence of occurring, recognizing what the symptoms are.

741
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:10,664
And I think that's our right. They're perfect.

742
01:13:10,664 --> 01:13:16,183
All right. Thank you, Major. Okay.

743
01:13:16,184 --> 01:13:22,774
So let me just pause for a second to ask, what did you guys think of that little exercise?

744
01:13:22,784 --> 01:13:27,254
Again, I'm always interested in getting you talking to each other rather than just listening to me drone on and on.

745
01:13:28,034 --> 01:13:34,304
Thumbs up, thumbs down. Because I could think about doing these for other physical hazards, too, if it was enjoyable.

746
01:13:34,304 --> 01:13:38,353
Okay. All right. I see some generally favorable responses.

747
01:13:38,354 --> 01:13:44,204
Thanks for being my guinea pigs. That did take a couple minutes longer than anticipated.

748
01:13:44,204 --> 01:13:47,414
So I think we're going to have to just blow through the break today.

749
01:13:47,414 --> 01:13:51,253
I apologize. It's terrible form on the day that I ask you to fill out your evaluations.

750
01:13:51,254 --> 01:14:00,583
So please let us know. But just to make sure we get through this, I want to steer you, as I always try to, to the guidelines that are out there.

751
01:14:00,584 --> 01:14:07,424
OSHA has no standard on heat stress, so there's no limit, no quantitative limit.

752
01:14:07,424 --> 01:14:11,444
There's no permissible exposure limit. What they do had is something called the general duty clause.

753
01:14:11,834 --> 01:14:17,594
And the general clause means that if an ocean inspector goes to a workplace and they see hazards,

754
01:14:17,594 --> 01:14:22,844
that would be obvious to any layperson as potentially leading to harm to life.

755
01:14:23,234 --> 01:14:26,443
They can essentially say, I'm sending you into the general duty clause.

756
01:14:26,444 --> 01:14:34,454
They can shut down the work operation altogether. So basically the general duty clause says that employers in the United States have the requirement

757
01:14:34,454 --> 01:14:40,003
to provide to furnish a place of employment that's free of recognized health and safety hazards.

758
01:14:40,004 --> 01:14:44,684
Heat is obviously bad, and so there are occasionally citations there.

759
01:14:44,684 --> 01:14:46,184
But again, no hard standard.

760
01:14:46,724 --> 01:14:56,833
HGH does have a threshold limit value for heat, so they express their TLT in terms of an effective CGT, which we'll talk about in a few minutes.

761
01:14:56,834 --> 01:15:02,354
That's on the Y axis. And then they consider metabolic rate basically a measure of how hard you're working.

762
01:15:03,284 --> 01:15:08,954
And they've got a curve here basically, which defines the twelves of workers being up in this upper right quadrant.

763
01:15:08,954 --> 01:15:16,183
Not okay. They're overexposed people who are down below the action limit we're not worried about and people who are between that area.

764
01:15:16,184 --> 01:15:21,104
We need to do some sort of measures for surveillance and control.

765
01:15:22,454 --> 01:15:27,494
So this clearly was actually just revised last year, greatly simplified from what it was before.

766
01:15:27,854 --> 01:15:35,904
And it's essentially designed to allow healthy workers who are acclimatized in the case of the 12 or under climatologist in the case,

767
01:15:35,924 --> 01:15:40,364
the action limit to work and still be able to achieve thermal equilibrium.

768
01:15:41,504 --> 01:15:46,724
Now the TLB says and we've already talked about if workers can't keep thermal equilibrium,

769
01:15:46,724 --> 01:15:53,894
there's an increasing likelihood of heat exhaustion or heat stroke like you guys just looked over in your case studies there.

770
01:15:55,034 --> 01:16:01,214
And I think we can see some commonalities in your case studies, you know, workers were wearing inappropriate clothing,

771
01:16:01,214 --> 01:16:08,114
weren't sufficiently hydrated, didn't have sufficient electrolytes, weren't in some cases given breaks.

772
01:16:08,444 --> 01:16:13,394
So, you know, this is what we would find if we surveyed all the heat related illnesses in the US,

773
01:16:13,394 --> 01:16:18,674
as there are always some very common factors across these cases.

774
01:16:19,724 --> 01:16:25,994
Something else to consider which a couple of you touched on, is the hotter you get and the more you're edging towards heat stroke,

775
01:16:26,234 --> 01:16:30,644
the more likely you are to have errors in judgment and central nervous system dysfunction.

776
01:16:32,144 --> 01:16:37,693
The TV also assumes that you are able to recover between days.

777
01:16:37,694 --> 01:16:42,854
So it's assuming that you're not having, you know, day after day after day of coming right up to the edge of heatstroke.

778
01:16:44,204 --> 01:16:49,394
So one important question here is when should I even start thinking about heat stress?

779
01:16:49,394 --> 01:16:51,433
And so they give us some useful guidance here.

780
01:16:51,434 --> 01:16:57,974
So anytime you've got workers who are saying, you know, I'm uncomfortable or showing otherwise signs of distress from heat,

781
01:16:58,784 --> 01:17:02,534
any time your professional judgment is an occupational environmental health

782
01:17:02,534 --> 01:17:06,284
professional would suggest it's probably hot enough for us to get concerned.

783
01:17:06,674 --> 01:17:12,314
And then the absence of those two things, any time we've got an air temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit or more,

784
01:17:12,554 --> 01:17:16,424
that's a good guideline to to trigger a heat monitoring program.

785
01:17:18,314 --> 01:17:21,943
And the TLB here is broken into a couple of steps.

786
01:17:21,944 --> 01:17:25,634
This, again, was greatly simplified from what it was even just two years ago.

787
01:17:26,054 --> 01:17:30,253
So the first question we have is, well, how hard are people actually working?

788
01:17:30,254 --> 01:17:35,624
And they give us a table here that allows us to estimate their approximate metabolic rate.

789
01:17:35,624 --> 01:17:42,193
And so there's a bunch of different activities here. They might be resting, just sitting around, you know, I'd love to get paid to do that.

790
01:17:42,194 --> 01:17:50,984
Actually, that is what I get paid to do sometimes. Sitting on my computer, 115 watts of energy or heat emitted, they might be doing light work.

791
01:17:50,984 --> 01:17:56,773
So maybe sitting and just doing light work at their hands, they might be doing a more moderate type of work.

792
01:17:56,774 --> 01:18:01,904
So maybe they are lightly pushing and pulling things or doing just sort of normal walking.

793
01:18:02,654 --> 01:18:09,314
Maybe they're doing heavy work like they're intensely lifting loads or shoveling or doing other manual labor.

794
01:18:09,884 --> 01:18:14,644
And you can see the metabolic rate is going up pretty substantially each time here until we get to.

795
01:18:14,724 --> 01:18:20,214
A very heavy, which would be basically working as hard and fast as you possibly can.

796
01:18:21,594 --> 01:18:25,604
Just to come back to the question and it's unfortunate that Jordan is gone now.

797
01:18:25,614 --> 01:18:33,204
She had the question about her body size. And you can see they actually give an accommodation here to account for body size.

798
01:18:33,204 --> 01:18:41,033
So you can multiply the ratio of a worker's actual body weight to 70 kilograms and that

799
01:18:41,034 --> 01:18:46,104
gives you an approximation to then apply to this metabolic rate to account for body size.

800
01:18:46,974 --> 01:18:52,343
So the next thing we have to think about is what is the worker actually wearing for their work?

801
01:18:52,344 --> 01:18:58,884
Again, that was a key thing and in several of your case studies and we use that to estimate the effective.

802
01:18:59,694 --> 01:19:04,284
So if a person is just wearing, you know, sort of one kilo unit, that's work clothes,

803
01:19:04,284 --> 01:19:10,524
long sleeved shirt and pants, we just treat the object effective as the actual object.

804
01:19:10,674 --> 01:19:18,954
So there's no modification. If a person sort of dressed for hot weather, they've got short sleeves and maybe pants that are of a light woven material.

805
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:25,344
Then we actually reduce the object by one degree to account for the fact that this clothes are are optimal for working in heat.

806
01:19:26,004 --> 01:19:30,054
And then the more and more clothes they have on, the more we adjust the object.

807
01:19:30,264 --> 01:19:38,904
So if someone's got double layers of woven clothing as one of your workers did in your case study, we add three degrees Celsius to the BGT.

808
01:19:39,384 --> 01:19:45,564
Worst case scenario, if they've got that level a fully encapsulated chemical protective suit on,

809
01:19:45,834 --> 01:19:50,574
we add 11 degrees to the BGT to account for that clothing.

810
01:19:51,084 --> 01:19:56,394
And so this gives us this BGT effective value that the TV is based on.

811
01:19:58,074 --> 01:20:03,383
Then we apply the object effective to consider their actual work conditions.

812
01:20:03,384 --> 01:20:09,354
So I've already walk you through table one where we talked about sort of how intensively are they working?

813
01:20:10,254 --> 01:20:15,174
And then we can also talk about something we haven't really talked about, which is the work rest cycle.

814
01:20:15,174 --> 01:20:19,254
So in any, for instance, 60 minute period in a work shift,

815
01:20:19,704 --> 01:20:23,634
how much of that work are they actually working and how much time are they given this a break?

816
01:20:24,714 --> 01:20:33,504
And so you can see for some people, they might be working 75% of the time or up to 100% of that 60 minutes on the other end.

817
01:20:33,804 --> 01:20:37,644
If their work is extremely hard, they might only be working 25% of an hour.

818
01:20:37,644 --> 01:20:40,544
And the other 45 minutes there, they're resting and recovering.

819
01:20:41,274 --> 01:20:46,824
And then we can start to see the detail be presented here and you'll see that the values differ.

820
01:20:46,824 --> 01:20:50,484
So if you're doing late work, not creating a lot of internal heat,

821
01:20:51,084 --> 01:20:56,424
the values are higher than if you're doing moderate work or heavy work or very heavy work.

822
01:20:56,424 --> 01:21:04,404
And you can see up here, if you're doing heavy work 75 to 100% of the time, they say actually you're probably already over the telly.

823
01:21:04,404 --> 01:21:11,664
There's no limit here. Likewise, if you're doing very heavy work, they're saying you should never be working more than 50% of any work period.

824
01:21:11,664 --> 01:21:17,993
You should be resting at least half of the time. So these are the two values for acclimatized workers.

825
01:21:17,994 --> 01:21:23,603
And then we've got the action limit values for other acclimatized workers and you'll see the UN acclimatize.

826
01:21:23,604 --> 01:21:27,054
Workers generally are a degree to a couple degrees lower,

827
01:21:27,054 --> 01:21:32,754
just accounting for the fact that we don't want to expose them to as high heat because they are kind of climate sized.

828
01:21:34,074 --> 01:21:38,964
HGH also gives us some guidance here so you can monitor the work site.

829
01:21:39,444 --> 01:21:42,144
You could also monitor the worker, which we talked about already.

830
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:47,543
And so we could do things like measure their heart rate and make sure that it's not too high.

831
01:21:47,544 --> 01:21:50,994
Over the course of a day, we could measure their core temperature.

832
01:21:50,994 --> 01:21:55,044
And we talked about a couple of different ways to do that, some more preferred than others.

833
01:21:55,494 --> 01:22:01,194
And we could look at their recovery heart rate. So after they've been working as hard as they're going to on this job,

834
01:22:01,464 --> 01:22:05,964
let's measure them one minute later and make sure that their heart rate declined to a safe level.

835
01:22:06,834 --> 01:22:14,664
Or we can just monitor their for symptoms. And that could be that I as a supervisor notice a worker is displaying symptoms and I stop them.

836
01:22:15,054 --> 01:22:20,244
But critically for heat, people always need to be able to self remove, so they need to be able to say, look, I don't feel right.

837
01:22:20,244 --> 01:22:22,554
I need to stop working, no questions asked.

838
01:22:24,264 --> 01:22:33,654
So if we've got workers who are above the action limit but not above the TLB, then we come in to this so-called General Controls section of the TLB.

839
01:22:33,684 --> 01:22:38,244
So we want to do some things that are very similar to what we've talked about for other physical hazards.

840
01:22:38,244 --> 01:22:45,054
We want to train workers. Let's make sure they understand what the risks are, what we're doing to to kind of manage those risks.

841
01:22:45,684 --> 01:22:50,694
They need to follow good hygiene practices. They need to be drinking fluids regularly.

842
01:22:50,694 --> 01:22:55,194
They need to self-monitor themselves for symptoms, but also watch their coworkers.

843
01:22:55,854 --> 01:23:01,554
We need to have policies in place that require an acclimatization period for new workers and again,

844
01:23:01,554 --> 01:23:04,584
encourage all of us to be keeping an eye on everybody.

845
01:23:05,244 --> 01:23:09,083
Because, again, by the time you get to a heat stress, you may be euphoric. You're not thinking clearly.

846
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:14,574
You're not going to say, Hey, I think I have a heat stress. Of course, we want to continue to monitor the fire.

847
01:23:15,344 --> 01:23:19,084
We want to maybe for some people actually have medical clearance.

848
01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:24,554
So it could be that you say if you're on a particular kind of medication on this whole list, and I as the employer,

849
01:23:24,554 --> 01:23:30,134
don't want to know which one it is, but if it's any of these, I'd like for you to meet with our physician so they can give you the go ahead.

850
01:23:31,814 --> 01:23:33,853
And of course, we want to have an emergency response plan.

851
01:23:33,854 --> 01:23:39,344
If somebody does start to show signs, what are we going to do to get them to the care that they need?

852
01:23:40,184 --> 01:23:50,384
And then if someone is above the action limits and also potentially above the TLB, then we want to implement these job specific controls.

853
01:23:50,384 --> 01:23:54,884
And so here's where we can start to think about engineering and administrative controls.

854
01:23:55,454 --> 01:24:02,564
So from an engineering perspective, you know, can we shield these people from radiant heat and block that that type of heat exposure?

855
01:24:02,864 --> 01:24:07,964
Can we minimize the humidity in the workplace? Can we give them shade when they need it?

856
01:24:08,774 --> 01:24:10,574
Can we adjust the clothing requirements?

857
01:24:10,574 --> 01:24:17,354
Can we change the task so it's not so physically intensive to then move them maybe from a very heavy to a heavy category,

858
01:24:18,164 --> 01:24:22,513
you know, administrative controls, just like we talked about. Can we limit the exposure duration?

859
01:24:22,514 --> 01:24:30,164
Can we rotate workers, which one of you suggested? And then for personal cooling, we could also think about some other options here.

860
01:24:30,704 --> 01:24:34,424
And these have evolved, I would say, over the past 20 years or so.

861
01:24:35,144 --> 01:24:41,054
So, you know, several of you mentioned metal manufacturing, and that is just a classic high heat environment.

862
01:24:41,414 --> 01:24:47,204
Lots of times those folks are wearing reflective clothing here, so it's shielding them from that radiant heat.

863
01:24:47,654 --> 01:24:54,074
The downside is, while it's blocking that radiant heat, it can also cause internal heat build up as the worker, it's working.

864
01:24:54,074 --> 01:25:02,083
So that's a tradeoff. There's so-called phase change vests, which are basically vest that you put a block of ice in at the start of the shift.

865
01:25:02,084 --> 01:25:06,194
And as the ice evaporates, it provides cooling over the course of a shift.

866
01:25:07,124 --> 01:25:12,794
And there's different types of clothing you can wear, including clothing that you basically plug a compressed air line into,

867
01:25:12,794 --> 01:25:19,154
and it blows high speed, cold air through the vest around your torso all day long and provides immediate cooling that way.

868
01:25:19,154 --> 01:25:24,313
So as you might imagine, these things are going to interfere with your ability to do the job potentially.

869
01:25:24,314 --> 01:25:29,054
But it may be the only thing that actually allows you to do the job without getting a heat stroke.

870
01:25:30,654 --> 01:25:34,943
So I've been focusing mostly here on the workplace, but I want to acknowledge,

871
01:25:34,944 --> 01:25:39,714
of course, that people, all of us are exposed outside of work in the community.

872
01:25:40,194 --> 01:25:44,753
And so we focus on the object here in the workplace, in the community.

873
01:25:44,754 --> 01:25:50,874
The heat index is more common. So this is a number that's created by the National Weather Service.

874
01:25:51,624 --> 01:25:54,654
You saw this very picture in Andrew's presentation.

875
01:25:55,104 --> 01:26:01,944
And so this is basically just showing us a range of air temperatures on the x axis and then relative humidity on the Y.

876
01:26:02,304 --> 01:26:09,023
And then we've got different zones here, different combinations of temperature and humidity that might lead to sort of

877
01:26:09,024 --> 01:26:14,124
we should be cautious or we've got danger or we've got extreme danger here.

878
01:26:14,604 --> 01:26:22,374
So you can see as the temperature goes up and as the relative humidity increases, we move more and more into this red zone of extreme danger,

879
01:26:23,874 --> 01:26:29,003
this like yellow zone down at the lower left and would be sort of, you know,

880
01:26:29,004 --> 01:26:34,134
you might get tired or fatigued at working in these temperatures in the bright yellow.

881
01:26:34,134 --> 01:26:37,674
And these aren't displaying properly on the screen. But there's actually two different colors here.

882
01:26:37,744 --> 01:26:43,644
The bright yellow is you might have some risk of heatstroke, but more likely that you'd have heat cramps or something like that.

883
01:26:44,604 --> 01:26:49,914
The orange danger zone here, it's likely that you're going to have some heat related effects.

884
01:26:50,184 --> 01:26:56,034
And in the red zone, it's very likely or even probable that you would have effects up to and including heat stroke.

885
01:26:58,344 --> 01:27:04,074
If that graph isn't enough for you, there's actually an expanded heat index that gives you even more temperature range.

886
01:27:04,864 --> 01:27:11,154
And, you know, as we have a warming climate, this high end is going to become more and more relevant.

887
01:27:11,154 --> 01:27:14,754
Maybe cutting off at 110 degrees as the simplified chart is,

888
01:27:15,024 --> 01:27:22,524
might not be enough in some areas and we go down below 40% relative humidity here just for completeness.

889
01:27:24,144 --> 01:27:30,234
So just in case you're wondering how these two things compare, again, the BGT is the more specific measure.

890
01:27:30,234 --> 01:27:33,984
It's what we prefer in a workplace where we can get more detailed data.

891
01:27:34,434 --> 01:27:38,604
The distinctions between the two, the BGT accounts for solar load.

892
01:27:38,904 --> 01:27:45,384
The heat index is measured in the shade. So immediately you can think, well, in a very sunny environment, those things might be fairly different.

893
01:27:46,524 --> 01:27:49,794
They both use air temperature, they both consider relative humidity.

894
01:27:50,094 --> 01:27:54,794
The BGT also considers air movement and cloud cover and the sun angle.

895
01:27:54,804 --> 01:28:02,394
The heat index accounts for nine of those. So the bottom line is, if you look at a comparison of estimates over an area,

896
01:28:02,394 --> 01:28:07,853
this is Oklahoma and surrounding states compared to the heat index, you'll see.

897
01:28:07,854 --> 01:28:16,494
Well, okay. The BGP seems to show the lowest temperatures in the upper right quadrant and that's consistent with the heat index here.

898
01:28:16,494 --> 01:28:26,784
So so they agree for lower temperatures, but the BGT is flagging this area around Interstate 44 as the very highest risk in this whole quadrant,

899
01:28:27,204 --> 01:28:30,414
whereas the heat index is actually saying it's down here in the lower right.

900
01:28:30,834 --> 01:28:38,214
So presumably there's differences for this particular day and time in how much solar radiation there was for these two.

901
01:28:38,214 --> 01:28:42,154
That's where these the two indices tend to differ most.

902
01:28:42,744 --> 01:28:46,404
So again, the BGT is like the better, more informative number,

903
01:28:46,854 --> 01:28:54,294
but it requires measurements that we don't typically make over a wide area and the heat index is more easily applied and communicated to the public.

904
01:28:56,154 --> 01:29:00,444
All right. So in our last 8 minutes here, I'm just going to run us through cold stress.

905
01:29:00,774 --> 01:29:08,824
I think this joke is hilarious. I'm starting to think there's something wrong with my sense of humor, but I think that's really funny.

906
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:18,384
So take take it with a grain of salt. So thinking about cold stress rather than ask you, I'll just run you through some examples here.

907
01:29:18,864 --> 01:29:26,034
In the interest of time. So places where people might encounter cold weather, we can certainly think about resource extraction workers.

908
01:29:26,034 --> 01:29:34,794
So mining, logging, natural gas exploration and extraction here we can think about construction work.

909
01:29:35,844 --> 01:29:43,404
We've got logging down in the lower right corner here, but we've also got people who might work in a walk in freezer for part of their job,

910
01:29:43,404 --> 01:29:50,904
which is not uncommon for labs and also very uncommon, very common, I should say, in restaurant settings.

911
01:29:51,984 --> 01:29:59,544
And I'll highlight here, we've got this really unique opportunity for heat and cold stress almost back to back.

912
01:30:00,414 --> 01:30:06,504
So if you think about people out shoveling snow and there's a whole army of snow shovels here in Michigan in the winter,

913
01:30:07,074 --> 01:30:10,643
these folks are out doing incredibly strenuous physical labor.

914
01:30:10,644 --> 01:30:14,244
When they're shoveling snow, they typically have multiple layers on. So they're going to heat up.

915
01:30:14,244 --> 01:30:21,233
They're going to start sweating dramatically. And then the second they stop working, they're out in the in the elements,

916
01:30:21,234 --> 01:30:25,734
basically in that sweat is going to start to freeze and they can transition from being on the

917
01:30:25,734 --> 01:30:30,414
verge of heatstroke to being on the verge of hypothermia in a very short period of time.

918
01:30:30,684 --> 01:30:34,284
This is why I refuse to shovel snow and my neighbors hate me.

919
01:30:34,284 --> 01:30:38,964
But it's for public health, dammit. They don't buy that argument at all.

920
01:30:40,014 --> 01:30:43,524
So in terms of cold stress, again, OSHA's got no guidance for us here,

921
01:30:43,524 --> 01:30:51,144
but ACG does have a TLT and their goal is that we want to keep the body temperature above 36 degrees Celsius.

922
01:30:51,144 --> 01:30:58,253
So the heat stress to yield kicks in at 38 degrees and that the cold stress kicks in at 36.

923
01:30:58,254 --> 01:31:01,164
So that's the narrow temperature range we're trying to maintain.

924
01:31:02,034 --> 01:31:07,494
You all probably know the first sort of noticeable effect from cold is you tend to have impacts in your manual dexterity,

925
01:31:07,494 --> 01:31:13,674
your fingers get stiff, your hands get painful, or maybe just not as nimble as they usually are.

926
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:19,164
More serious effects beyond just dexterity are things like hypothermia and frostbite.

927
01:31:19,314 --> 01:31:22,223
And just like with heat, clothing is critical here.

928
01:31:22,224 --> 01:31:26,873
So to prevent cold stress, of course, we want to have clothes that are going to provide insulation,

929
01:31:26,874 --> 01:31:29,544
but we also want them to have ventilation or permeability.

930
01:31:29,544 --> 01:31:34,764
So if I am sweating inside my clothing, I want that sweat to wake away instead of freezing on my body.

931
01:31:35,664 --> 01:31:42,084
And as you all know or we'll learn this winter, layering is also key to keeping keeping warm in the cold.

932
01:31:42,774 --> 01:31:45,654
Now, I will say we're not going to go over this entire table,

933
01:31:45,654 --> 01:31:52,853
but there are different health effects expected at different core temperatures that I'll highlight here.

934
01:31:52,854 --> 01:31:57,024
You know, our core temperature in Fahrenheit, we want it to be about 98.6 degrees.

935
01:31:57,504 --> 01:32:02,664
If we drop down to a core of 95 degrees, that's where you shiver as hard as you possibly can.

936
01:32:03,114 --> 01:32:07,674
So once it drops below that, shivering becomes much, much less effective.

937
01:32:08,664 --> 01:32:12,293
But of course, there are reasons that we might get below there.

938
01:32:12,294 --> 01:32:18,263
You can start to see that if we have a core body temperature that's about ten degrees below, then we stop shivering.

939
01:32:18,264 --> 01:32:21,444
The body's like, This isn't working. I'm going to stop wasting energy on this.

940
01:32:21,984 --> 01:32:30,234
If we drop down to close to 20 degrees Fahrenheit below our core body temperature, then we're looking at loss of voluntary motion.

941
01:32:31,734 --> 01:32:34,763
We drop down another, say, 30 degrees.

942
01:32:34,764 --> 01:32:41,004
Now we start to lose corneal reflex. We start to have EEGs that aren't showing any brain activity.

943
01:32:41,484 --> 01:32:48,563
But keep in mind, you know, we quite purposely freeze people below these levels for open heart surgery,

944
01:32:48,564 --> 01:32:52,974
for instance, where you want to essentially stop all body motion that you can stop.

945
01:32:54,324 --> 01:33:00,713
So the lowest survivor of accidental hypothermia got a core temperature down of about 57 degrees.

946
01:33:00,714 --> 01:33:06,564
But for surgical purposes, they will freeze people down to 38 degrees for short periods, again,

947
01:33:06,564 --> 01:33:16,704
just to get the body moving as slowly as possible for these very intricate surgeries in terms of injuries from cold,

948
01:33:17,034 --> 01:33:20,034
there's really the two that we're primarily worried about that are serious.

949
01:33:20,034 --> 01:33:26,333
So there's hypothermia where your core temperature is dropped below 90 feet, 95 degrees Fahrenheit.

950
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:30,324
So that's a systemic effect. And there's also more localized injuries.

951
01:33:30,324 --> 01:33:35,933
So if you have skin tissue that drops below freezing below 32 Fahrenheit, you're going to get frostbite.

952
01:33:35,934 --> 01:33:37,794
That's physical damage to your skin.

953
01:33:38,724 --> 01:33:46,613
Even if it's above freezing, if it's very cold and wet, you can also get conditions like trench foot or chill blades,

954
01:33:46,614 --> 01:33:54,264
which I think are just as horrible as they look but are recoverable, you know, with with heating applied, basically.

955
01:33:55,684 --> 01:34:01,744
So the TLB gives us some guidance here on how to implement a cold stress monitoring program.

956
01:34:01,754 --> 01:34:05,884
You know, the first question we ask is, well, how cold is it? What are the climatic conditions?

957
01:34:06,574 --> 01:34:10,893
The second is we need to think about other factors that might lead to a cold stress injury.

958
01:34:10,894 --> 01:34:15,064
How hard are people working? Do they have shelter where they can warm up?

959
01:34:15,064 --> 01:34:19,234
How thinner they how fatigued are they their nutritional status?

960
01:34:19,864 --> 01:34:26,464
Then we can think about controls which are absolutely going to be contingent on the weather and us providing appropriate clothing,

961
01:34:27,304 --> 01:34:31,174
giving people a place to warm up, giving them access to warm food and drink.

962
01:34:32,554 --> 01:34:38,283
We can think about more specific controls, like maybe we actually have routine self checks.

963
01:34:38,284 --> 01:34:47,074
Like I stop and I ask, how am I doing? Okay, we have buddy checks for coworkers to one another and we have supervisor check ins routinely as well.

964
01:34:48,304 --> 01:34:55,474
And of course, any program we always want to have the supervision staff where we make sure that these things are actually occurring as they should.

965
01:34:57,244 --> 01:35:01,623
So the TLB for Cold is structured very similar to the one for Heat.

966
01:35:01,624 --> 01:35:06,154
It's based on how hard you're working, you know, sleeping all the way up to very hard work.

967
01:35:06,544 --> 01:35:10,684
And the analogous how many watts of heat are we generating?

968
01:35:11,794 --> 01:35:14,523
We can also think about how much clothing is needed.

969
01:35:14,524 --> 01:35:22,263
And again, we come back to these close units and that's going to be a function of what's the temperature and how hard are you working from?

970
01:35:22,264 --> 01:35:26,194
Not very hard, all the way down to really hard. And then how much clothing do you need?

971
01:35:26,194 --> 01:35:32,014
And so, you know, looking at this this graph thinking like, what if I'm trying to sleep and it's very cold?

972
01:35:32,344 --> 01:35:39,334
Well, I'm not doing very much work at all. And if it's very cold, I'm going to need a lot of clothing on versus if I'm working very, very hard,

973
01:35:39,814 --> 01:35:44,314
even if it's very cold, I'm not going to need that much clothing because I'm creating a lot of internal heat.

974
01:35:46,174 --> 01:35:51,034
One other factor just to consider here and then I'll wind down is wind chill, of course.

975
01:35:51,034 --> 01:35:59,074
So, you know, we think about heat and humidity as being bad combinations and we think about cold and wind as being bad combinations.

976
01:35:59,074 --> 01:36:05,974
So the colder it gets in the winter it gets, the shorter the duration before you're expected to get frostbite on your skin.

977
01:36:06,454 --> 01:36:13,923
We'll learn all about wind chill later this winter. And then in terms of controlling exposures here, again, we want to control the work cycle.

978
01:36:13,924 --> 01:36:17,014
We want to keep wind off people as much as we can.

979
01:36:17,404 --> 01:36:22,594
Like this snow shoveling example, we don't want to follow really intense work with just sitting around doing nothing.

980
01:36:23,524 --> 01:36:25,444
And we can think about micro environmental heating.

981
01:36:25,444 --> 01:36:30,844
So we can we make a small space where people can go and get warm and can we put more clothing on them?

982
01:36:31,444 --> 01:36:33,964
I will say there are limits to how much clothing you could wear.

983
01:36:34,444 --> 01:36:42,304
You know, these are sort of the estimated club sizes for being able to be an infinity temperature when you're at rest.

984
01:36:42,514 --> 01:36:44,614
That actually comes from the U.S. government, believe it or not.

985
01:36:46,084 --> 01:36:52,864
And again, just like the heat index chart, we have a wind chill chart that the National Weather Service comes comes out with to let us know,

986
01:36:52,864 --> 01:36:56,794
you know, how long can I be outside before I'm at risk of life and limb?

987
01:36:57,604 --> 01:37:00,604
So with that, I am done with the class.

988
01:37:00,604 --> 01:37:03,933
So are you, except for the final exam in your thermal exposure assessment.

989
01:37:03,934 --> 01:37:10,924
So just just to recap all you're packing up here, you know, you can take the exam any time, but it needs to be done by December 15th.

990
01:37:11,224 --> 01:37:15,303
I will say if I can't release grades until everybody's done with the exam.

991
01:37:15,304 --> 01:37:19,354
But if all of you do it early, I will release the grades as soon as I possibly can.

992
01:37:20,014 --> 01:37:25,114
Again, don't forget about your thermal exposure assessment for next the eighth, I guess next Monday.

993
01:37:25,744 --> 01:37:30,543
And again, please fill out your course evaluations. I really do take that information so seriously.

994
01:37:30,544 --> 01:37:37,084
So thank you all. I've had great fun this semester. I hope you have too and let me know if you have any questions otherwise.

995
01:37:37,094 --> 01:37:42,274
Have a great holiday break, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all.
