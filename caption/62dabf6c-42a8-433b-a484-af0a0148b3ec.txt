1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:08,550
You might say that's just the answer.

2
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:21,120
I don't want to look like I have the rock because I believe you lecture again.

3
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,190
So I was very careful to recommend that.

4
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:34,280
I just think this would frankly not really be the PowerPoint slides discussion section right now.

5
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:46,010
That should be okay. So it should be released.

6
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:53,180
Now, let us know if there's a new discussion section.

7
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,540
It's quite genuine for later today and the vaccine.

8
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,660
I'm sure that the questions about the flu.

9
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,780
Yeah, that sounds great. Okay.

10
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:28,410
Okay. So I have few announcements and so next week there'll be a guest lecture on Monday.

11
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:36,170
So I won't be I won't be there, but will be.

12
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:43,399
Lafarge, who's going to be talking about pavilions in a lot of details that give you a

13
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:49,520
sense for those of you who haven't had exposure to the properties of pathogens,

14
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,649
fires and bacteria and fungi, we'll be giving you an overview.

15
00:01:54,650 --> 00:02:10,400
Again, it's an overview of of course, it is a whole semester course of events in one lecture, and then the exam is on Wednesday of next week.

16
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:17,059
And once I talk to some of you, I think I've mentioned it a little bit also in class.

17
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:23,930
So this exam is a mixture of true, false, multiple choice, some short answer.

18
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:33,530
It's all material that we've covered in lecture through either discussion or through my presentations,

19
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,540
and some have asked about the readings I mentioned.

20
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:46,470
The readings are relevant only to the extent that it covers the material that we've covered, so it gives you more depth and insights.

21
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,679
And I think that's the part of the reading you have to you should follow,

22
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,810
not give it any of the reading of the covered topics that we haven't covered, won't be covered in exam.

23
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:08,469
That cleared the exam is in going to happen here in this classroom.

24
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:16,660
But and it will be administered through the quiz function and on campus.

25
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,899
We're going to give you a pass code that day so they don't have to pass codes making start the exam.

26
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:29,580
So if anybody. Can't make the exam has any kind of accommodations.

27
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:37,980
I know some ways you contact me this week so we can make arrangements for you.

28
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,800
I think that covers everything about the exam that I want to talk about. Is any any other questions?

29
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:59,340
Okay. So homework is due Monday.

30
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:08,910
There is one question I had through email and one through the questions of valuation

31
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:18,149
about the denominator in calculating cumulative incidence and such in the class.

32
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:23,220
So the idea is that number is basically the population of the United States.

33
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,530
If you know, technically it's between 2020 and 2021,

34
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:40,950
technically you would take the average of the two to get an approximation of the of that baseline.

35
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,310
Technically, again, it's the population at risk, right?

36
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:56,810
So you got to always subtract the number that has been sick since then, practically speaking,

37
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:03,480
to try to make a big difference for a submerged and relative few people are.

38
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,809
Protected during that first during that period.

39
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:20,700
But just technically, as you learned into the denominator of any incidents, is the population at risk, not just subtract those that are not at risk.

40
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,990
Those would be ones you'd assume in assumption.

41
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,040
But if you had a baby, then you're not at risk.

42
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,780
And we know that that's not completely true. So there's a lot of assumptions.

43
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:42,540
And then any time you a destination like this, as long as you're clear about your assumptions, then basically.

44
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:51,150
That's fine. That's. Any other questions about the homework?

45
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,660
So my job is ours again.

46
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,700
I'm going to be in a conference later this week.

47
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:15,770
Thursday hasn't been a great time for my office hours so far, but I'm going to be available most to, you know, most days.

48
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,630
And you'll reading again, email me.

49
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:26,490
I can do them. I could even do the office hours on Thursday via Zoom.

50
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:34,790
It's not in person. So again, just please email me and also available any other not any other time.

51
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:40,580
But I can make it. I can make arrangements to be here. And so any kind of questions or talk to you about.

52
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:48,930
Anything you want to talk about for the exam material or any other topic that you want to talk about?

53
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:59,370
Just e-mail me and we that so.

54
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,200
That at the immunity questions you had were all great questions and you all

55
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:17,030
illustrated how community is a complex topic and it's also an ever evolving topic.

56
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,280
So what we know about immunity is changing over time.

57
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:29,219
And so like, like your question provides, you know, I would say classified is kind of more advanced than what we're what I'm expecting,

58
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:37,230
you know, for this this class, which is what we presented and talked about.

59
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:47,220
So, again, if you want to talk in more detail about any of these questions, I'm happy to talk to you about that range of time to talk.

60
00:07:49,850 --> 00:08:01,409
Okay. So. Today we're going to talk about vaccines so related to the immunity lecture.

61
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,600
But now in talking about it, specifically about the intervention and.

62
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:13,400
What I want to cover in this period is three goals and principles of the vaccination.

63
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,300
The differences between live attenuated and inactivated vaccine.

64
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,070
A little bit about adjuvant and what and what they are.

65
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,920
A little bit about vaccine safety, difference in efficacy and effectiveness.

66
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,370
And then back to herd immunity. We've talked about immunity already.

67
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:41,690
We'll talk about herd immunity in other lectures, like in study design and in the modeling lecture section.

68
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:47,300
It's an important concept. So we revisiting some of those concepts in this lecture.

69
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:57,070
So they should be better have to make doing.

70
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:23,370
Okay. So you've probably seen this before in other other presentations, other classes,

71
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:30,690
this idea that during the 19th century, we saw this dramatic increase in life expectancy.

72
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:39,300
And here the 1848 is this Public Health Act is really about sanitary reform.

73
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:49,339
And so a lot of. This improvement in life expectancy was happened before development of vaccines.

74
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:59,960
And a lot has to do with improved sanitation, improved nutrition, and just improved living conditions in a lot of urban areas.

75
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:09,639
So. But at the same time, we've also saw increased frequency and magnitudes of epidemics.

76
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:16,900
So though people were not dying of these infectious diseases, we still saw increases in these epidemics.

77
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,200
A lot of that had to do with changing social patterns.

78
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:28,840
We've got, you know, urban in-city and increased density in housing and large these large population centers.

79
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:40,960
And so in this graph, we see, you know, we if we just if we plot the number of reported measles cases, we see this very regular recurring.

80
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:49,630
It's actually every in every other year, recurring epidemics of measles up until the onset.

81
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:57,460
You know, the vaccine is introduced and then you see this huge decrease in reported measles so that the effectiveness.

82
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:09,570
And what vaccines really did for diseases like measles was to reverse this trend of increasing cases and not make patterns.

83
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,100
So how do vaccines work? We've talked about this also a bit in class.

84
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:24,480
So we've got both this direct protection that one gets when you receive a vaccine.

85
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:29,790
The vaccine can decrease susceptibility to infection.

86
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:40,800
It moves from a transmission modeling perspective. It moves individuals directly into this immune state so that people are protected.

87
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:48,059
The important thing to remember about this direct protection is that it could be could be complete.

88
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,810
But most, most often it's what we call a leaky vaccine.

89
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,489
It doesn't give you complete protection.

90
00:11:53,490 --> 00:12:01,320
We see this even for COVID 19 vaccine, which is considered a pretty amazing vaccine with respect to how well it works.

91
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,720
It's a leaky vaccine and it doesn't give complete protection.

92
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:15,600
Also, most vaccines are not lifelong, though they can sustain protection for quite a while.

93
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,860
And so there's this temporary immunity or waning immunity.

94
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,810
So for both of those because of that.

95
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,930
You don't get complete direct protection, even if you've got the vaccine.

96
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,420
And so we talk a lot about this indirect protection, which protects the unprotected.

97
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:41,000
The idea is that indirect protection can protect those that are not vaccinated,

98
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,110
but also can help protect those that are vaccinated but not completely protected.

99
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,930
And so. The idea of indirect protection is that.

100
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,370
An intervention and it doesn't happen. We'll talk more about this later in the course.

101
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,690
But it doesn't have to be just through vaccines.

102
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:10,120
It could be through a lot of other kinds of interventions like bednets for malaria, chemotherapy, for different kinds of ailments.

103
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:17,559
All of those can actually provide indirect protection in addition in different ways.

104
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:24,250
And we'll talk about this with respect to. A vaccine.

105
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:31,870
This indirect protection means that there it comes about because there's less transmission going on in the community.

106
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,660
And we'll see this more in detail later.

107
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:43,600
And specifically, this is Bill, where we talk about mass action, provides a simple, logical explanation for this indirect protection.

108
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,540
We haven't talked a lot about specifically what I mean by mass action, because we haven't had the transmission modeling lecture.

109
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:58,630
But it's this theory that transmission occurs when an infectious person comes into contact with a susceptible person.

110
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,360
And if you think about it,

111
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:09,280
in ideal situation where everybody is everything is homogeneous to people's movement and contact here, you know, homogeneous,

112
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:19,329
you can have this mass action idea is developed from chemistry where, you know,

113
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:24,130
the probability that chemical A contacts chemical B and creates this reaction.

114
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,409
Is the product of the density of chemicals eight times.

115
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:39,550
The density cannot be. And so we we have that same we use that same principle to think about transmission in for infectious diseases.

116
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,339
It's simplified. It has a lot of assumption. But the amazing thing is that it works.

117
00:14:45,340 --> 00:15:00,729
It's very useful and helpful. And that's this mass action phenomenon is what we use to model and project disease and epidemic patterns over

118
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:10,330
time and as a function of social structure as well as as a function of different kinds of intervention.

119
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:17,110
So this indirect protection is really the power of vaccines, even though it's really not.

120
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:25,560
Often talked about as much as the direct protection people are more concerned about whether or not the vaccine is going to help them.

121
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:31,649
But the power of vaccines is really a power of any intervention.

122
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:36,139
Is this herd immunity concept. We'll talk about later.

123
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:43,430
So there's different modes of action that we can talk about with respect to vaccines.

124
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,600
And the first is the susceptibility based protection.

125
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,870
And this is what we think about a lot, that it protects a person from getting infected.

126
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:00,110
And this, as we just talked about, conveys both direct and indirect effects.

127
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:07,370
Right. To provide the direct effect, because if the person getting the vaccine has that level of protection.

128
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:16,370
Indirect effects. Because if you can vaccinated enough people, you attenuate the transmission in the community.

129
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:22,490
And therefore, people that are not completely protected or not protected at all get benefits.

130
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,800
But there's also this contagious based mode of action.

131
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,390
So infected, even though you're infected, you're less infectious.

132
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:39,860
And so with COVID, that means there's less virus in your saliva, for instance.

133
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:46,270
So when you cough, when you talk, even though you're infected, there's less virus there.

134
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,980
So you're actually basically less contagious.

135
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:58,500
So this contagious phase protection is really doesn't provide any direct effects to you as an individual that got the vaccine,

136
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,180
but does convey indirect effects because you're protecting those that are around you.

137
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:18,000
And the last is improving prognostic outcome there that that is making it so you're less likely to have severe outcomes to the disease.

138
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:26,870
And so we talked about that a lot in COVID with respect to the importance of vaccinating the elderly.

139
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:35,090
We vaccinate the elderly because we want to protect them from this severe diseases and they're the most highest.

140
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:40,370
Every so often when we think about especially at the beginning of a vaccine implementation,

141
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:45,590
our biggest concern is protecting those that are most at risk.

142
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,420
And so this pathologic mode of action doesn't convey direct or indirect effects on transmission.

143
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,230
Simply diagnostic and clinical outcomes.

144
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:09,020
So in the vaccines, as we talked about in Kobe, you can operate through a combination of all these three different modes.

145
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,440
So a little history here.

146
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:24,220
Edward Jenner, as most of you know, as a pioneer in vaccination, was the first to scientifically prove vaccines actually work.

147
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:34,479
He did that by inoculating a cow pox that he isolated from a cow and then injected

148
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:41,680
it into another person and saw that that person was then protected from smallpox.

149
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:52,300
And the key thing here, as we will talk about more later, when we talk about different mechanism, modes or designs for vaccines,

150
00:18:52,660 --> 00:19:03,850
is that the assumption that he had was that this animal had a that had a a pox virus that was attenuated,

151
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:11,710
that it wasn't going to cause disease in the individual, but it was going to protect the person that was vaccinated.

152
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,250
And that's a key concept in the vaccine.

153
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,350
He wasn't going to isolate a smallpox virus from an individual and give it to another individual.

154
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:30,310
That was going to be much too risky by using this cowpox to through a lot of his research, surmised that this was giving protection.

155
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,629
So just bring into context all the controversy,

156
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:42,740
because we'll be talking a lot about the controversy of vaccines that we're seeing now that was that's not unique to this era.

157
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:52,580
And that in the early 1800s, there is huge controversy to this idea that you were going to inject.

158
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,380
Something coming from a cow into a person.

159
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,959
They thought it was dangerous, unsanitary. It was.

160
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,260
And this is a cartoon.

161
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:18,820
There is an anti-vaccine society. So this kind of resistance to public health efforts, in this case, vaccines seems to and masking is not new to LA.

162
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:25,660
It takes on different forms now. But these controversies are have been ongoing historically.

163
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:37,600
So principles of vaccination. A lot of this kind of builds off of what we talked about last week.

164
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:43,210
So premise one is that the immune system can distinguish between self and non-South.

165
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,590
So the non-South being an antigen that's a foreign substance.

166
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,030
And in the case that we're most concerned about is pathogens.

167
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:59,169
And so there's a molecule from a pathogen that can then produce an immune response.

168
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:09,760
So that's the kind of that's the first premise. The second is that the immune system can produce this specific and long lasting protection.

169
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:19,780
And here we talked about the globulin to the beat in importance of B cells that can

170
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:32,020
preferentially attach to antigens and have specific motifs with respect to certain proteins.

171
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:41,859
And the third and most important with respect to vaccinations, and is that this immune response can be artificially induced,

172
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:49,900
which is what Jenner showed when he actually took this cowpox, isolated his cowpox and injected into it.

173
00:21:49,910 --> 00:22:01,379
He. And and the key here with the vaccination is that the risk of disease and I'd say here without risk of disease,

174
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,810
but there is no such thing as zero risk, which I continue to repeat to the media.

175
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:11,880
And they want to know something safe or not safe. It's really about a level of risk.

176
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:20,040
And same thing with vaccines. The idea we'll talk about this later is we're minimizing the risk and certainly the benefits outweigh the risk.

177
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:25,290
But it's not like we're talking about the zero risk with respect to vaccines.

178
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:33,630
But in general, as we'll see, the benefits are way, way, much, much higher.

179
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,240
And the costs and the risk municipal compared to the benefits.

180
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:53,510
So we'll talk more about the dynamics of the transmission process and immune process more later.

181
00:22:54,050 --> 00:23:01,130
This kind of gives you a schematic of how the data, what the dynamics are with respect to immunity.

182
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:10,210
So people a child is born with maternal antibodies and that's that.

183
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:18,270
We talked about that last week. Those are passive antibodies that are not long lasting.

184
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:25,970
It doesn't evoke an immune response. So this is really a period of time where the child doesn't have a strong adaptive immunity.

185
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:36,290
And so this provides protection, but that over time will wane maybe six months, depending on how long a child is breastfed.

186
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:43,130
And that waning means that that individual becomes susceptible to infection.

187
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:50,650
And so what if exposed that person becomes latently, latently infected.

188
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:57,680
And then there's a certain time that passes before that latent infection turns into a full blown infection,

189
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:07,120
and the person's infectious person then will recover and become immune or they will die of the disease.

190
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:14,410
And this immune process is once again highly dynamic.

191
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:21,759
The infection process here is we talked about is highly dynamic, but so is this immune process.

192
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:29,200
So immunity can wane one if one susceptible.

193
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:37,840
At some point somebody's going to be susceptible, but not necessarily the same susceptibility as somebody that's never been exposed to the pathogen.

194
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:53,080
And an exposure can actually boost that immunity potentially, but also can result in further infection and can infect other susceptibles.

195
00:24:54,070 --> 00:25:00,550
And then and here, most importantly for this lecture, if one is vaccinated, one moves to this immune state.

196
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:06,220
Again, this one assuming that for a period of time that immunity is complete,

197
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:17,980
we can make all sorts of assumptions with respect to that specific situation about how to complete and how long term immunity is.

198
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:26,559
But this is gives you a basic schematic of the process in that process, navic infection process,

199
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:36,219
as well as the dynamic immune process that's important to keep track when we're considering the impact of both natural immunity,

200
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:41,350
but also in this case, vaccine induced. It's.

201
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,300
So there's two types of our two classes of vaccines.

202
00:25:50,420 --> 00:26:01,399
The first is a live attenuated vaccine. So what's happening here is in the lab, we take out a pathogen.

203
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,840
In this case, let's say a virus, and the virus is attenuated.

204
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:15,650
And so it's here. It's illustrated this attenuation is illustrated by the fact that there are less receptors on this, on this.

205
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:26,360
On it's virus, but it's attenuated to the point that it is not going to cause disease.

206
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:33,010
And that's the theory. There's also inactivated vaccine where you actually.

207
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:45,590
Don't you take a virus, for instance, and totally inactivated so it actually can't replicate in the.

208
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:55,960
In a human or in a host. And so these two flavors and this one the that the packaging can.

209
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:04,190
In fact the host and can replicate and that's actually the power of this live

210
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:10,219
attenuated because it can actually induce an act of an actual immune response,

211
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:19,430
just as if you were infected with an attenuated pathogen that's less likely to disease as both is inactivated.

212
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:28,970
Where the pathogen is not really is not actually not viable, but there's still antibody production that occurs.

213
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:40,660
So these two classes of vaccines were to talk a little bit about the properties of each of these as live attenuated vaccine.

214
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:46,660
Again, living microbes model modified for lack of pathogenicity.

215
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:59,610
And so. The idea with a live attenuated vaccine is that the immune response should be similar, if not identical, to a natural infection.

216
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:04,050
I think there was actually some questions about whether or not we know.

217
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:13,990
The difference in if one is stronger than the other and certainly with in the early stages of vaccine with COVID.

218
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:20,350
What we were taught. We didn't know how strong the natural immunity would be.

219
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,890
And so the emphasis was to get get vaccinated.

220
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:33,190
But a natural immunity should be usually pretty strong as well as a well designed.

221
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:46,820
Live attenuated vaccine. Not all vaccines are as good as this COVID vaccine was, and a lot of them are much less effective,

222
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:54,440
specifically those that are targeting bacteria and other more complicated organisms.

223
00:28:54,470 --> 00:29:04,280
The ability for a vaccine to operate as well as a vaccine against the virus is much more complicated, of course.

224
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:10,880
Yeah. Similar to what your just stated with the BCG vaccine.

225
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:16,120
Do you know what that why the efficacy is not good.

226
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:23,390
What's up with that? It's it's again, this issue where it's just very challenging.

227
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,090
To develop really good vaccines for bacteria in general.

228
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,840
I think you can get theories, a good vaccine, the theory is, is focused on a toxin.

229
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:43,580
And so that is a lot easier. I don't know the details of like the mechanistic details why this is so challenging,

230
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:49,580
but again, it's just a lot of efforts and to produce a vaccine for TB,

231
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:56,659
to produce vaccines for malaria, that you have not necessarily developed anything really super strong,

232
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:01,370
the ones for vaccines, for cholera, for typhoid and also less effective.

233
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:08,419
They're getting better, less effective than those for viruses, because these are you know,

234
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:15,530
once you get a more sophisticated organism, like a bacteria and a protozoa, you have a lot of ways to evade the immune system.

235
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,550
And so a simple vaccine becomes that much more challenging.

236
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:24,550
More than a virus. More than a virus. Yes, yeah.

237
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,190
Yeah. And for viruses, it can be challenging for HIV.

238
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:38,030
I mean, and for influenza, we can only do you know, we only get a vaccine that works for a year and we have to get a vaccine every year.

239
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:47,030
They're working on this and they've been working on it for many years, a universal vaccine for influenza, but they haven't come up with that yet.

240
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,850
So a lot less a lot fewer genetics, a lot like it.

241
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:58,730
Just a much, much simpler organism than bacteria and sounds.

242
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:08,670
The question, what's the difference in definition between prophylactic and vaccine prophylactic?

243
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:14,380
It's something you take continuously and periodically.

244
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:21,310
So as you talk about prophylactic, just needing chemotherapy like the malaria,

245
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,470
you're just taking a you're basically taking what you would treat malaria with the

246
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,430
chemotherapy or you're taking it at a lower dose and you take it periodically.

247
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:39,610
So you do get infected. Hopefully that chemotherapy will address that, that it's not eliciting an immune response in a way that.

248
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:50,700
In a way that the vaccine is. So.

249
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:59,620
This is just a schematic of a way to kind of. Illustrate how you start with a wildtype virus.

250
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:05,260
That's. Can cause. Disease and pathology.

251
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:12,430
You attenuate that virus and you get this weakened vaccine genome,

252
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:20,440
but it's still a virus that can actually infect and cause and elicit immune response.

253
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:34,530
So what are some of the challenges or limitations to a live attenuated as severe reaction as possible?

254
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:44,440
Both. Because it is still a live pathogen, even though it's attenuated, also because it's possible.

255
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:53,620
And this happens with all oral polio virus vaccine OPV mutations are possible.

256
00:32:54,250 --> 00:33:03,820
And so you can it can mutate and then become more pathogenic than it was before or as pathogenic potentially as the original wild.

257
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:15,950
There's possible interference from circulating antibodies that prevents this prevents you from actually getting a full blown immune response.

258
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:22,160
And it's logistically more difficult to administer.

259
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:33,620
Requires you know, requires a cold chain. You've got to keep it refrigerated over the for, you know, while you're storing it inside.

260
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:37,370
So it's just a much more challenging vaccine to implement.

261
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:41,120
And again, we're trying to get very high coverage.

262
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,749
We'll see later in lecture. But, you know, 80 or 90%.

263
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:48,170
So you you really the logistics become critical.

264
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:55,870
And you're just sent some examples of live attenuated virus vaccines.

265
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:08,200
So inactive vaccines, much less expensive, easy, much more easily, easy to produce,

266
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:12,930
but they're generally less effective than a live attenuated vaccine.

267
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:19,720
It doesn't elicit the same full blown adaptive immune response as a live attenuated one.

268
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,490
It doesn't have the same interference from circulating antibodies and live attenuated.

269
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:34,450
It does generally require more doses, 3 to 5 booster doses to to to elicit a strong enough response.

270
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:48,290
The immune response is mostly humoral less not cell activated as we talked about and so it and that T cell activation as

271
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:59,750
we talked about it has it's really the power of the immune response to have long memory with respect to and specificity.

272
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:08,809
And so the fact that this is mostly humoral is a limitation of the COVID vaccines.

273
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:16,070
There are exceptions to the rule being like less effective or is that just a difference in because of RNA technology, or is it.

274
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:25,609
You're saying he's a COVID vaccine like the exception to the rule of like inactive attenuated vaccine as being less effective?

275
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:29,540
Or is it? In many ways.

276
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:37,219
And in many ways it is. We don't I guess the verdict is out with respect to how long lasting it is.

277
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:41,150
So that's the big issue we're seeing.

278
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,350
You know, we've already you know,

279
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:48,079
people are getting their fourth booster right now that a lot of that has to do with the fact that is a novel pathogen.

280
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:55,550
But also a lot of it has to do with the fact that these mini viruses are working pretty amazingly well in the short run,

281
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,059
but they're not as long lasting.

282
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:07,860
And this idea of a universal cold vaccine like we're looking at with influenza is something that we're looking forward to.

283
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,920
So certain aspects of it with respect to the effectiveness.

284
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:18,169
But but it seems like it's working advancing well.

285
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:26,090
But as we will talk about more in the discussion when we can discussion question, one of the questions about comparing OPV IPV.

286
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:33,770
So the live attenuated polio vaccine versus the inactivated polio vaccine.

287
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:43,670
We only use the inactive polio vaccine right now, and it's actually very effective to in preventing serious disease.

288
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,420
So preventing paralysis, but not so effective in preventing transmission.

289
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:57,150
So there is this there is still a tradeoff, even though we talk about the OPC is the idea of being effective.

290
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:03,000
So I think the short answer is the verdict is out with respect to that long term.

291
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:09,030
Yeah. Protection that we would want to get with vaccines.

292
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,310
So antibody titers may diminish with time.

293
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:24,660
And so this is just again, a schematic that kind of illustrates how inactivated, inactivated vaccine is working.

294
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:32,220
So different ways to inactivated vaccines can vary.

295
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:41,940
The whole pathogen can be an act inactivated, so certain subunits of the vaccine can be administered.

296
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:51,780
So we easily only we're only using a target path to a part of a target pathogen to provoke an immune response.

297
00:37:54,860 --> 00:38:00,020
We could be focusing on the toxin. I mentioned diphtheria, but also tetanus.

298
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:06,410
Since that pathology happens with the toxin, that's what would put the focuses.

299
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:21,390
And then we can have viral like particles such as the the virus envelope itself, which again is again noninfectious,

300
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:30,980
since it doesn't include any of the viral material that is needed, the viral genome that's needed to replicate the virus.

301
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:42,320
And then there's Aminata Technology, which is the newest technology that COVID is an example of where we're actually just inserting the.

302
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,670
In fact, the genetic information about.

303
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:57,520
This pathogen into a cell, into the into into a cell, which then generates.

304
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:04,010
Pretty much generates the vaccine. So your cell is actually generating vaccine.

305
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:11,270
We're just administrating the RNA. So that's the latest technology with respect to inactivated vaccines.

306
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:23,120
And then here are some examples of vaccines of these different types that are being that are in use right now.

307
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:33,959
So just a little bit of that adjuvants, just so you know that they basically exist,

308
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:41,430
that we can use different substances that can help make a vaccine more efficient.

309
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:50,880
They can enhance the activity by either through making accelerated, they can prolong the reaction.

310
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:58,500
And so these adjuncts become very important with respect to making a vaccine more efficient.

311
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:07,260
And you can do things like help stimulate local secretion of cytokines and such.

312
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:15,870
So a big example with COVID is the this lipid nanoparticle that's surrounding the MRA is actually

313
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:22,260
allowing it's essential because that m RNA which is to centigrade without it so that that membrane,

314
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:34,500
nanoparticle membrane that is used to deliver the vaccine into somebody is an example of an active body

315
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:45,180
making the this just gives as kind of a scan table showing how vaccines have been released over the years,

316
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:52,950
how, you know, smallpox we stopped in 1970, the example of rotavirus here,

317
00:40:52,950 --> 00:41:01,799
where we discontinued it for a year because it because it was felt that the costs some

318
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:10,740
of the adverse events due to the vaccine were too high for it to be a viable vaccine.

319
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:19,590
So it was recalled they worked more on addressing that the adverse events and then it was re

320
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:25,740
administered later so but that the theme of this table is basically showing that by 2010,

321
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,900
you know, we've got a lot of vaccines that we're administering into.

322
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:39,300
Into a lot of these children, but also adults compared to 1940, where we only had two vaccines, smallpox.

323
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:47,820
We had a period tenuous pertussis vaccine. So a little bit on safety.

324
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:53,010
So there's a committee we would probably all seen this in the news.

325
00:41:53,010 --> 00:42:00,360
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices a.S.A.P helps ensure vaccines are safe, are long term.

326
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:03,150
He's an emeritus professor here and chairs that committee.

327
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:11,099
And so they're basically making they're reviewing all the literature, all the data, all the experiments,

328
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:19,200
everything that in this case, you know, Moderna and Pfizer, they're they're basically doing these these studies.

329
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,260
They're giving it to this committee. The committee is evaluating those studies and then making recommendations.

330
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:32,250
Gay Who who makes the final decision on whether or not to a vaccine is safe?

331
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:39,780
There's 15 voting members. There's eight ex-officio members that represents faith.

332
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:46,680
Federal agencies, 30 non-voting representatives, representing a lot of different organizations like the AMA.

333
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,670
There's a lot of people involved in this whole process.

334
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:56,820
In this process, they have a slide coming out showing that this process usually takes quite a while because.

335
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:07,389
And this and because of this, this structure and because we want to ensure that a vaccine is as is as low risk as possible,

336
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:13,120
the benefits are highest as high as possible before we administer it.

337
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:29,220
Before we license it. This just highlight that Thomas Francis, who was the first chair of our Department of Epidemiology here at Michigan.

338
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:41,340
Led and guided the first large scale vaccination study on the HPV polio vaccine in 1955.

339
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:45,390
He and on the steps of Iraq moratorium he basically.

340
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,880
Said and announced the results of the study.

341
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:54,800
Here he mentions the vaccine works. It's safe and effective and potent.

342
00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:00,600
And this was a huge had a huge impact. And everybody was really waiting.

343
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,910
And again, this is a time where very few vaccines were available.

344
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:10,320
And polio was a very scary disease.

345
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:17,729
And that time, people would not let their children swim in in any kind of recreational swimming lakes,

346
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:22,800
ponds, swimming pools during the summer because it was scared of polio.

347
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:31,559
And so this was a huge undertaking to actually administer this large scale study,

348
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:43,340
which now we do for every vaccine that gets released and approved by, you know, 1955, much, much rarer activity.

349
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:50,250
So vaccine safety has many different.

350
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:56,060
Facets. You know, we look at vaccines.

351
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,350
We know that all vaccines can be associated with some adverse events.

352
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:04,820
Some of them are going to be, you know, mild and self-limiting.

353
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:11,600
We get our arms sore after we get injected and some are going to be much more severe.

354
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:16,950
The vaccine associated poliomyelitis is an example of that.

355
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:25,109
So the key piece of this is to make sure the benefits outweigh the risks, not just by a little bit,

356
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:33,630
but by quite a bit before before a vaccine gets approved, vaccine is assessed at all stages of vaccine development.

357
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,740
It's said every step is subject to regulatory approval.

358
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:47,400
And most importantly, even after it's been licensed, there's a lot of oversight with respect to adverse events because.

359
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:55,280
There's only so much. So we can we can make sure that the risks are very low and we want to make sure the risks stay low.

360
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,260
And we want more data to ensure that that those risks are extremely low.

361
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:06,200
And so there's a lot of post licensure monitoring in addition to this intense

362
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:11,990
regulatory oversight during the development which we saw in action during COVID.

363
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:31,670
So we've got a lot of vaccines. And here's just that illustration about it comes from the CDC website that CDC is recommending childhood

364
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:37,370
vaccines careful to ensure that there's protection at different stages of growth and development,

365
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:47,510
because, as this quote emphasizes, children are exposed to a huge number of antigens just naturally.

366
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,260
And that natural exposure is going to be. Is is.

367
00:46:52,370 --> 00:47:01,070
It's going to provide natural protection, but to ensure that there's less adverse events, vaccine schedules, introducing even more,

368
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:09,440
that more antigens and hopefully in an earlier time step to prevent severe outcomes of a lot of these diseases.

369
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,820
So a little bit on vaccine hesitancy.

370
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,359
I mentioned this a little bit before,

371
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:28,110
but I think it's very important to think about how heterogeneous this both this concept of hesitancy is and the population is.

372
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:34,600
And it's really only this tip here that are those that are, you know,

373
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:42,540
what we call vaccine refusal to vaccine deniers don't believe that vaccines actually work are ones that maybe we can convince.

374
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:50,550
But even with COVID, we were we are in this yellow zone here where there's a lot of people.

375
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,380
That if the vaccine is there, they would take it.

376
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,070
They're not actually going out of their way to get the vaccine.

377
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:07,820
There's a lot of delayed use and this is a population group that's worth focusing on and works worth spending a lot of resources and I.

378
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:18,190
I showed you that article that came out earlier this last month showing that at know.

379
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:28,760
At the same time, they were moving toward improving the vaccines and getting more effective vaccines or removing the resources to address vaccination.

380
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:37,730
And that's that's a mistake in the sense that we do really need to vaccinate as much many of these people

381
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:44,180
in this yellow zone of vaccine hesitancy in order to gain the power of vaccines at a population level.

382
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:51,829
This is just, you know, briefly just recounting what happened.

383
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:59,810
I don't know if you're aware of this report in Lancet about the link between autism and the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine.

384
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:11,279
It was. Retracted because of lots of issues from financial conflicts, ethical violations, and most importantly,

385
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:24,180
falsification of data by and many of the anti-vaccine groups use this as an example of this potential connection with autism.

386
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:30,270
But studies that have since tried to identify a link between vaccination autism have not shown any link,

387
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:35,460
including this huge study of 500,000 children over seven years.

388
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:42,240
So no real evidence that there is that link between measles, mumps, rubella and autism.

389
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:51,060
Not to say again that there's no risk in getting any of these vaccines, including a measles vaccine, with respect to adverse events.

390
00:49:54,290 --> 00:50:02,810
This shows the impact of this vaccine hesitancy that we're seeing and you're seeing continuously in the press over different years.

391
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,950
This increase in the number of measles cases, measles is incredibly infectious.

392
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:12,980
Once you bring down that coverage a little bit, you're going to start seeing sporadic hits to the measles.

393
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:20,240
Measles still is a major killer of people in the world today and mostly in Africa.

394
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:36,030
So quickly, a distinction between efficacy estimates that are vaccine efficacy estimates are estimates that are under optimal conditions.

395
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,680
Vaccine effectiveness estimates are under real world conditions.

396
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:49,210
You get an efficacy estimate through a randomized trial and learned about randomized trials,

397
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:55,950
101 minus the relative risk is going to give you the vaccine efficacy.

398
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:01,300
So the results are that the results are null.

399
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:04,600
The relative risk is one that the vaccine efficacy is going to be zero.

400
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,450
Randomized trials, as you know, has strong internal validity.

401
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:13,209
We're pretty certain that, you know,

402
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:19,840
we're confident that that's potentially in the result of that rankings of that trial for those individuals in the trial.

403
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:25,450
It has limited generalizability, and that's why we consider this an efficacy estimate.

404
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:34,310
Effectiveness estimates are estimates that are estimates and reducing incidence in the real world.

405
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:45,070
These you get from observational studies. And so again that's based on studies have this internal validity problem, bias, confounding and such.

406
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,800
But their ability to be generalizable and much stronger.

407
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:56,690
So it's important to keep. I understand the difference between those two issues.

408
00:51:56,870 --> 00:52:00,290
The question. Or measures.

409
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:11,810
All right. So this just shows how how powerful vaccines have, what kind of dramatic effect vaccines have had on reducing cases,

410
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:17,000
reducing deaths, comparing pre and post vaccine, period.

411
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:30,710
This also shows that coverage has actually increased dramatically for a lot of different diseases from 1980 to 90 to 2015 for different vaccines.

412
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:37,820
Polio, hepatitis B and diphtheria, tetanus.

413
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:47,240
So we've seen this increase in coverage. This is one thing and it's an important point that is often.

414
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,989
Most when it comes to investing in prevention.

415
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:58,710
So vaccines, the return to invest investment on vaccines is huge and that's what this column is showing.

416
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:10,960
So for measles, for every dollar we invest in a measles vaccine, we get a return of $58 from economic benefits.

417
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:17,920
And so you can see for these different vaccines, the estimate from this article here varies,

418
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:27,490
but overall, showing that for an investment of 5 billion year, there's a return of 410 billion.

419
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:36,790
So the economics of vaccines and really in prevention in general is very clear even.

420
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:48,100
And when you think about the investments in clinical treatment, often the benefits are you wind up spending more money in developing that.

421
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:54,990
Clinical intervention or clinical treatment. And you do getting benefits.

422
00:53:55,260 --> 00:54:00,270
And so nonetheless, even with these strong arguments,

423
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:07,160
public health is not funded in the same way that medicine is trying to create treat somebody

424
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:12,330
who already has the disease of health or trying to prevent them from getting them treatment.

425
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:21,060
I think that's an important point that needs to be made with respect to the power of value of vaccines.

426
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:33,930
And there continue to be challenges with vaccines and global vaccination and issues of disparities and availability, vaccine availability.

427
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:39,420
And that has been talked a lot about not just with vaccines but other interventions.

428
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:46,770
This is just to show that success of decreasing mortality is it's only partially due to vaccines.

429
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:51,660
So even though these previous slide showed the power of vaccines,

430
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:59,220
what this slide shows is that a lot of the benefits we've seen, just like I showed in the very beginning,

431
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:05,400
first slide has to do with other factors, such as increase in nutrition,

432
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:10,890
probably increase in certain socioeconomic status, decreasing exposure to sanitation.

433
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,240
Not to do with the vaccine.

434
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:20,610
So this kind of puts it in perspective of where vaccine, you know, the importance of vaccines versus other public health activities.

435
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:30,020
Your question? Yeah. About two slides ago, how do they calculate the like how do they even know the economic benefits or in terms of investment for,

436
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:34,680
I guess, like something that hasn't happened, I guess.

437
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:42,420
Well, they you you can basically and these are very standard cost effectiveness studies that economists do.

438
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:50,130
And so you just you do know what if somebody does get, you know, full blown measles case?

439
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:53,870
What are the costs? Well, some of the costs are the parents.

440
00:55:53,880 --> 00:56:02,400
They don't they lose. They can't work. Some of the costs, if it becomes a complicated case, is the hospitalization costs.

441
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:15,920
So they kind of. They they go through all the different costs of what happens when you don't treat the disease with the vaccine.

442
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,820
And then all those are considered economic, those are dollar benefits.

443
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:23,960
And then the cost of developing a vaccine is a little more straightforward,

444
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:29,780
but it's not as if they do an empirical study catch all of these, but they're actually just,

445
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:40,730
you know, from past understanding of these diseases, then they can tally all the benefits that are accrued because the disease hasn't occurred.

446
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:47,030
And you can do the same thing with COVID, like calculate all the cost of takes to have ventilators and such.

447
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:51,110
And if you have a vaccine, you don't need those ventilators, those benefits.

448
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:55,630
So that's how all these cost effective studies are done.

449
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:07,470
And so the last thing that I want to talk about quickly in a lot of this interview is this idea of herd immunity.

450
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:16,710
We've talked about the definition of herd immunity. And how it provides direct and indirect protection.

451
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,720
Talked about the indirect effects. Indirect effects.

452
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:27,160
This these schematics kind of just show you, you know, illustrates visually the power of vaccination.

453
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,660
So if you don't have a vaccination, a, you know, no vaccination, nobody is vaccinated.

454
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:34,900
You see this exponential growth occurring in cases.

455
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:41,860
Once you start vaccinating, all of a sudden it becomes very difficult for the pathogen to spread the con.

456
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:54,430
The probability that an infectious person contacts is secularism becomes very low and you get many, many fewer cases that are able to propagate.

457
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:04,650
This is a big issue and why you get these clusters of cases occurring that you can get these pockets of susceptible people.

458
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:11,220
And so that's why we would expect that we're going to see, even though we might have, quote unquote,

459
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:15,260
herd immunity or high coverage, there's going to be pockets where there's low coverage.

460
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:23,730
We see that with polio right now. And why we're concerned about polio spread potentially in New York where average has dropped down as low as 30%.

461
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:37,260
This is just empirical evidence showing that you vaccinate kids for pneumococcus vaccine and you actually see a decrease in adults.

462
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:42,750
So that's empirical evidence. Girls aren't getting the vaccine, but they're seeing some benefit.

463
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:48,510
And this is just an estimate from this article about the drug to that effect.

464
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:56,760
This is an example where if the kids are the transmission engine of the disease,

465
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:04,710
you vaccinate the kids, you actually get a lot of drug benefits where all the people are less exposed.

466
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,660
This shows again, we talked about this. We'll talk about this more.

467
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:17,080
One minus one over two are not one minus one over are not as an estimate for that the vaccine coverage to attain herd immunity.

468
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:22,990
This shows, as you know if the higher the are not the the higher the coverage we need.

469
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,100
We also have to understand that vaccines aren't perfect.

470
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:35,890
So we have to actually add this vaccine effectiveness. So now all of a sudden, this are not but only needed 50 to 75% coverage.

471
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:39,780
For this disease of, let's say, apart between two and four.

472
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:48,050
If you only have 85% efficacy and that's actually not considered a bad vaccine, you need 59 to 90% coverage.

473
00:59:48,060 --> 01:00:02,670
So, yeah, herd immunity is is hard to attain and much harder to go from 95 to 98% than it is to go from 53 to 50 to 53%.

474
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:11,819
So the effort to make the investment and we're seeing this with them trying to eradicate polio, this endgame becomes incredibly expensive.

475
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:17,640
But we're spending billions and billions and billions of dollars to eradicate polio,

476
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:21,600
given that polio is not causing any public health issue right now.

477
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:27,060
So those billions of dollars is just trying to get that last case.

478
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:33,320
Some caveats with respect to what we've talked about with respect to this.

479
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:40,490
So I think kind of great to maybe just talk about correlates of protection.

480
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:52,430
We talked about this before that. What is it in the immune system that we can use as an indicator that there is protection?

481
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,700
So the antibodies are one way, simple way.

482
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,490
However, we talked about how even if the antibodies wane, we still have T-cell immunity.

483
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:12,709
So specific antibodies aren't necessarily the gold standard we identify by comparing immune response to those

484
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:21,860
protected by the vaccine where they you still get a clinical disease even though there was prior vaccine.

485
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:32,419
And the last is they talk about how the spike protein, that sort of civic protein on COVID has shown to be a good correlate of protection,

486
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:38,540
a good indicator that you are protected if you got an antibody specific for that spike protein.

487
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:47,040
So I think I'm going to stop there. This is just talking a little bit about how Kofi Annan works this.

488
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:52,480
You know, we're just talking about one illustrate, huge process involved.

489
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:58,170
I already talked about this. And this is give you the details of what it takes to get something licensed and approved.

490
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:06,570
And this just highlights how fast Kobe, Cyrus, Kobe was able,

491
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:15,870
how fast we were able to actually go through that whole process with this and our technology compared to prior vaccines at all.

492
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:26,240
So. With that. You want to jump to the discussion questions, any questions on that?

493
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:32,690
And I was just curious what your thoughts are on the malaria vaccine.

494
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:40,360
I'm sorry. That's so open ended, right? I mean, I think it's just like everybody, you know.

495
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:49,050
The longer you're doing this kind of work, the more skeptical you are about breakthroughs because they never pan out.

496
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:49,620
You know,

497
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:58,140
when it comes to actually testing it and actually going through this whole process of actually doing a large scale evaluation of how well it works,

498
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:03,450
we actually we were in Ghana. We met some of the people who piloted the malaria vaccine.

499
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,750
Oh, really? And things they were they were very excited about it.

500
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:11,700
Well, there was like some it was there were some really weird discrepancies that they couldn't even explain.

501
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:16,690
And they're just like, we just need more research. But it was, you know. But they've been saying that for decades and decades.

502
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:25,310
Yeah. So I think that the point of this is and I think it's both the point that there's a discussion question that's relevant to this.

503
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:29,190
So vaccines aren't like even though they're amazing, we got it.

504
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:35,760
We have other public health interventions like bednets and mosquito control that we can't ignore.

505
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:44,740
Well, it's like herd immunity doesn't exactly fit in, you know, with that, because malaria is also a vector, viral vector and.

506
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:48,070
Right. And you can get hurt. You can get what I call it. We'll talk about later.

507
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:51,830
Herd protection. We've seen we could show that empirically that if you bet,

508
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:55,740
if enough people are using bednets, people that aren't using bednets are actually protected.

509
01:03:56,220 --> 01:04:06,300
That's interesting. And so you do. Can you. You don't have to only focus on we only we don't we have more than vaccine as a tool to control pathogens.

510
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:15,450
This idea of eradicating pathogens, which we'll talk about Wednesday, is, you know, not necessarily the right thing to be focused on.

511
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:18,870
And it's not bad for malaria.

512
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:23,579
In the fifties and sixties, we were like, we can't eradicate. We should just control.

513
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:29,110
And then. You know, all of a sudden there's an influx of a lot of money from the Gates Foundation that says,

514
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:33,159
well, you know, and the Gates Foundation would love to eradicate a barrier.

515
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:37,210
They love to have that kind of. But they weren't.

516
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:41,980
And so all of a sudden, they all this hope is that we can get malaria.

517
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:48,760
I think there's an amount of resources that go into that person's basic public health needs.

518
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:54,850
It is a zero sum game because you are investing in eradicating a disease and you're not investing in something else.

519
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:07,750
Okay. So there's like three questions here. Not as much time as last time, but maybe we can just go through these quickly.

520
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:13,910
So first is there's two polio vaccines that we talk about oral and inactivated.

521
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:19,970
Like you in groups, compare and contrast these two vaccines discussing why you administer one or the other.

522
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:31,730
And the specific interesting question that's open ended is Israel had what we call a silent outbreak of polio in 2014.

523
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:41,750
They identified polio in a sewage administered OPV and they got rid of that, continued the wild polio in the sewage.

524
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:51,740
We now in the U.S. have the polio vaccine variety, pathogenic vaccine variety of polio in the sewage.

525
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:56,120
We're talking about continued use of IPV, but not OPV.

526
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,400
And IPV, as I mentioned,

527
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:09,770
doesn't do a very good job of preventing transmission or so in the second is three modes of action we talked about slide five set the ability,

528
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:15,800
contagion and pathologic have been taught that extensively during COVID.

529
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:21,380
So discuss conditions in which we may be interested in one mode or over another.

530
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:25,800
And we talked a little about that. Talked about an Election Day.

531
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,279
And then vaccines are cost is relevant to your question.

532
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:35,190
Gas vaccines are cost effective, important, but they are not the complete picture where the indication as well as their strengths.

533
01:06:37,440 --> 01:07:06,550
Okay. So. So Handel thought maybe maybe we'll have a little bit of a break on the set and the work that resulted in the choice.

534
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:19,800
Hannah, I love your shirt. I think I was just saying that as soon as the.

535
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:30,520
I have to take you out.

536
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:39,010
All right. I love that you saw Minister, so I don't think we don't know who is in there.

537
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:55,380
He's out of the distribution, so we should have a look.

538
01:07:55,630 --> 01:08:01,630
What about your arms around the side of the box?

539
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:13,240
No, you don't need to either. I have no idea for when I was a child.

540
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:21,160
I was trying to minister as far as much of the work that I did.

541
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:39,180
And I was like, Yeah, you know, we do.

542
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:45,410
Okay. Yeah. I hope this is cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

543
01:08:45,790 --> 01:09:05,930
It is not terrifying. I think it's incredible how it was standing in the way that he didn't stop getting out of bed.

544
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:11,819
I was partially Mexican. So some of that that hurt you.

545
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:43,110
Are you asking to you like doing what she was just like, feel like, you know, I have no idea what's happening.

546
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:51,590
You. I don't know what you know about.

547
01:09:51,670 --> 01:09:57,390
So it was like, how much are you kidding me?

548
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:03,390
Do you feel like you're keeping secrets? Oh, I was like.

549
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:10,400
I do it make?

550
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:20,530
Yeah. Why do you think it's not too one big question? Are we going to camp outside of the clouds and beyond?

551
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:28,210
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

552
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:38,830
What I doing? I was just trying to ask you about democracy, boy.

553
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:47,140
Every time I saw, I was looking like. And I saw you with Kerry.

554
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:51,010
So the next two or two together, I'm like, I'm assuming I don't care.

555
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:56,470
I don't want you to think.

556
01:10:56,470 --> 01:11:00,110
I don't know.

557
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:04,060
But I wanted to see what I was going to buy.

558
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:19,810
And I was like, I don't even really like shower right now, but they happen to be like, Yeah, absolutely.

559
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:31,590
Okay. So that's really I know we're not talking about oh yeah, I remember this.

560
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:48,220
I was a milk that I guess I do not know how it works up there for like an hour and a half.

561
01:11:50,740 --> 01:12:02,970
That would never happen in the U.S. That's so funny because I think we should be like, I would never stop doing this because,

562
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:09,780
you know, I want to run my own house forever and everything else.

563
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,080
And now there's things, you know.

564
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,550
Oh, no, I'm sorry for that.

565
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:22,030
Yeah, I'm like, I turn around like, I don't like, I don't know, reason.

566
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:23,260
I think that's my problem.

567
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:57,030
I don't think anybody who won the World Series that's part of the process is identifying with someone just for that, just what you want to do to you.

568
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:05,020
And you're a combination, I don't think.

569
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:11,150
Yeah, yeah.

570
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:16,260
Maybe after waiting, which I don't see.

571
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:23,340
Is that where they are. But I'm not sure I, I don't know.

572
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:28,480
Okay. Okay. I don't know.

573
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:47,710
Was like, that's why I told you first thing I know that you would maybe not be helpful to have people, you know, like a few friends.

574
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:55,300
I think that was a dream.

575
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:05,890
Just a have to sit back and do something totally documented,

576
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:13,610
something you want to see like in Michigan because that is different and then you kick it off again.

577
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:23,310
You're going to be so much like, you know, you have this I have different because it really was trying to name I got an idea.

578
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:28,120
I don't why don't we do things like this and then you can put your name on

579
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:34,410
it but we didn't really do much about that transition was really getting it.

580
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:42,309
Yes, I did, because I like really good information.

581
01:14:42,310 --> 01:15:00,820
So it's just Bradley 25 because I tell you, I was thinking, well, it's something that's more likely to you talked about and everything.

582
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:04,210
I've no idea because if they're all reported to the state.

583
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:08,310
You don't have to be ordering things like that combined.

584
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:12,900
I don't like it online or something like that.

585
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:19,600
No, no. So I would prefer not to be that place in the family unit.

586
01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:23,510
Like we had three kids come from Vietnam.

587
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:32,190
We're trying to serve with vaccines. Yeah, it's great to be back.

588
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:37,890
It's kind of nice. Yeah. Oh, you do?

589
01:15:42,530 --> 01:15:46,170
Oh, since you've been, like, 2%. You know what I thought was right?

590
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:53,550
First words she said, why does it have to be dosed in the hospital?

591
01:15:54,290 --> 01:16:22,130
Yeah. Yeah, that comes back to an you, because it sounds like a really crappy world that we have a similarity between out here and, you know.

592
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:31,310
Yeah, I think it's like, oh, oh, I guess I think I know.

593
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,770
But I was like, I don't care what people say.

594
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:37,950
I was like, I got it. I got it.

595
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:45,380
Normally for something, I was like, or in the basement, like, they hadn't done anything because they didn't want to talk about me.

596
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:54,380
I don't want you to but start working towards public and there's no way they're just giving you that vaccine.

597
01:16:54,990 --> 01:17:01,880
It's like I have had to get my husband, so I had to have like the titers and work vaccine involved.

598
01:17:03,330 --> 01:17:05,660
Okay, I guess we only have a few more minutes.

599
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:15,120
I just wanted to quickly you have one minute for each of these questions, maybe starting with group one on the first question.

600
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:22,960
You know. Okay. So we said.

601
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:34,059
Yeah. Well, obviously for the contract part one of them is live attenuated and the other is inactivated, which,

602
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:43,180
you know, we said that the inactivated vaccine is really good at preventing just like severe outcomes,

603
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:52,120
like cases of paralytic polio, but doesn't do a great job of preventing transmission and that it's also not as long lasting.

604
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:59,200
And we would choose the inactivated vaccine because it's better at lowering the risk of severe symptoms.

605
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:07,600
And there's also no risk of causing the polio and the oral polio vaccine can do when it mutate like reverts to the pathogenic.

606
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:12,820
So you were saying in the US right now you're advocating the inactive.

607
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:23,290
So what the concern though is that if we start seeing what if we start seeing polio virus in sewage in Michigan?

608
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:28,090
And in other states. What is that suggesting?

609
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:33,530
So far we've only seen it in New York.

610
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:40,870
But what if we start seeing in other states and other states are starting to like Michigan is starting to look for polio like community spread.

611
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:46,480
So then now that and then there's spread. And we're concerned that IPV doesn't won't stop that.

612
01:18:47,660 --> 01:19:01,870
So at some point, you've got to make a political decision to go to OPV to knock that spread down, even though it may result in.

613
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:05,140
It's risky because you might have the vaccine.

614
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:15,210
I would assume that the want to stop the spread, though, is to protect those who aren't vaccinated already.

615
01:19:16,450 --> 01:19:20,890
Right. So then how would we expect those people to start getting vaccinated?

616
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:23,200
Okay, you need to let me say it again.

617
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:34,870
You're assuming that your concern is stopping the spread among the general populations, most likely most vaccinated with severe outcomes.

618
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:42,550
So I would like switching to the other vaccine, of course, that if there are vaccinated, if they're already hesitant of getting vaccinated.

619
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:48,010
That's a good question. So the nice thing about oral polio is that it's it's an oral.

620
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:52,930
It's much easier to administer. You give somebody a shot.

621
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:56,379
So maybe there's different ways in which that could help.

622
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:58,860
You could have a vaccine campaign, which actually helps.
