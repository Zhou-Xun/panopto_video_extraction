00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:09,085
Welcome to Part Two of the first session on Case Control Studies, which focuses on analytic concepts and case control studies.

2
00:00:09,085 --> 00:00:15,085
So in this session, we are mostly going to talk about the case control odds ratio.

3
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:20,085
I will show you proof that the exposure odds ratio equals the disease odds ratio.

4
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:26,085
Which also equals the multiplication of A times D over B times.

5
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:33,085
C in a two by two table. We will go over what happens when we change the ratio of cases to controls.

6
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:40,085
So we've been sort of assuming that we have a one to one ratio of cases to controls so far, but we can actually change this ratio.

7
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:45,085
The investigator has control over this and we'll look like we'll look at what happens when we do this.

8
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:52,085
And then we will introduce the rare disease assumption and the relationship between the odds ratio and the risk ratio.

9
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:59,085
So recall from the session on measures of association that from a two by two table and I've shown an example for

10
00:00:59,085 --> 00:01:08,085
reference in the upper right hand corner of the slide that we can calculate both exposure odds and disease odds.

11
00:01:08,085 --> 00:01:18,085
So we can calculate the odds of the exposure among the people who have the disease by going down the columns in this to buy to table.

12
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:27,085
And from that, we can calculate the exposure odds ratio. So this would be the odds of exposure among those with the disease.

13
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:34,085
The vertical bar that is shown in this fraction here is read as conditional on.

14
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:40,085
Sometimes, I also read this as among those. So this would be the odds of exposure conditional on disease.

15
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:47,085
You can also read it as odds of exposure given disease or odds of exposure among those with disease.

16
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:51,085
And so that would be calculated as A over C.

17
00:01:51,085 --> 00:01:55,085
And again, recalling that odds does not include the numerator in the denominator.

18
00:01:55,085 --> 00:02:02,085
It is not a proportion. In odds, the numerator is just not included in the denominator.

19
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:12,085
We then can calculate the odds of exposure among those with no disease, which would be calculated as B over D.

20
00:02:12,085 --> 00:02:21,085
And so we can simplify this to A over C, divided by B over D when we want to calculate the exposure odds ratio.

21
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:33,085
And this simplifies to AD over BC. We can also calculate the disease odds ratio conditional on levels of the exposure.

22
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:40,085
So we can calculate the odds of disease among those who are exposed by going now across the rows in the table.

23
00:02:40,085 --> 00:02:50,085
And this gives us a Overbey. We can also calculate the odds of disease among those with no exposure, which is calculated as C over D.

24
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:55,085
And mathematically, this simplifies to AD over BC.

25
00:02:55,085 --> 00:03:05,085
This means that the exposure odds ratio is equal to the disease odds ratio, which is equal to AD over BC.

26
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:08,085
So if you want to be very technical and formal,

27
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:15,085
you can talk about the exposure odds ratio or the disease odds ratio, depending on how you've calculated it.

28
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:17,085
But they are actually the same thing.

29
00:03:17,085 --> 00:03:26,085
And so in a case control study, it doesn't matter how we lay it out or what order we calculate the odds in, we just say the odds ratio.

30
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:32,085
And we know that the ratio for the odds of exposure among the disease is equal to

31
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:39,085
the ratio for the odds of disease among those with different levels of the exposure.

32
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:45,085
So from here on in, I'm really just going to be talking about the odds ratio.

33
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:51,085
Why can't we calculate incidents or relative risk? In most case, control study designs.

34
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:56,085
Recall from the session on measures of association that the relative risk is the proportion with the disease.

35
00:03:56,085 --> 00:04:00,085
Among those who are exposed, divided by the proportion with disease.

36
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:05,085
Among those who are unexposed. Now, in a case control study,

37
00:04:05,085 --> 00:04:14,085
we know from the introductory part to this lecture session that the proportion of cases that is people with the disease to controls,

38
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:23,085
that is the people without the disease, is a feature of the study design because we sample on the basis of the outcome in the case control study.

39
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:27,085
This means that if the exposure is related to the disease,

40
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:35,085
then the proportion of exposed and non exposed individuals in relation to whether they have or do not have the

41
00:04:35,085 --> 00:04:42,085
disease outcome of interest is a feature of the design itself and therefore provides no useful information.

42
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:47,085
So we can look at this formula here for the risk ratio and readily see that we,

43
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:53,085
the investigator, can manipulate these proportions that are used to calculate the risk ratio.

44
00:04:53,085 --> 00:05:03,085
And therefore it is meaningless. Let's go back to this example from the Doll and Hill study about smoking and lung cancer.

45
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:08,085
This is the same two by two table that I showed you in part one of this lecture session.

46
00:05:08,085 --> 00:05:16,085
So in this two by two table, we have an odds ratio of nine point one and a risk ratio of five point zero.

47
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:22,085
And you'll also note that we have a one to one ratio of cases and controls,

48
00:05:22,085 --> 00:05:26,085
and that is evident from the column totals where we have 1357

49
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:32,085
people with lung cancer and 1357 without lung cancer.

50
00:05:32,085 --> 00:05:39,085
But let's see what happens when we manipulate the ratio of cases to controls.

51
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:43,085
Most case control studies that you'll see use a one to one ratio.

52
00:05:43,085 --> 00:05:49,085
But we can also add additional controls per case to gain statistical power if we have a small study.

53
00:05:49,085 --> 00:05:55,085
So in this case, we might have one case for every four controls.

54
00:05:55,085 --> 00:06:01,085
So let's manipulate that two by two table that I just showed you with varying numbers of controls.

55
00:06:01,085 --> 00:06:05,085
Which leads us to varying ratios of cases to controls.

56
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:11,085
So now let's say there are two controls per case and assume the same proportion of controls are exposed.

57
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:17,085
So if you look at the column totals, we still have 1357 people with lung cancer.

58
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:22,085
But now we've doubled the number of people with no lung cancer to 2714.

59
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:33,085
This is a one to two ratio of cases to controls. If you go through the same odds ratio and risk ratio formulas, we end up with the same odds ratio

60
00:06:33,085 --> 00:06:38,085
when we multiply out AD over BC.

61
00:06:38,085 --> 00:06:44,085
However, the risk ratio changes. We now have six point three for the risk ratio.

62
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:55,085
And also note here that the risk ratio is closer to the odds ratio than it was when we had a one to one case to control ratio.

63
00:06:55,085 --> 00:07:02,085
So I would say here in this instance that the risk ratio begins to more closely approximate the odds ratio.

64
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:08,085
Even though I would say that six point three does not approximate nine point one, but it is getting closer.

65
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:14,085
And you'll note here that we have fewer controls relative to cases.

66
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:24,085
So we have manipulated the proportion of individuals who have the disease to be smaller in our overall study sample.

67
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:29,085
Let's do this the other way around. Now, let's say we have one control for every two cases.

68
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:34,085
So we still again have 1357 cases of lung cancer.

69
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:38,085
But now we have half the number of controls as cases.

70
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:42,085
So there are 679 controls without lung cancer.

71
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:48,085
Let's run through the odds ratio and risk ratio calculations again. The odds ratio stays the same.

72
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:54,085
It's nine point one. It's the same as it was, regardless of the ratio of cases to controls.

73
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:58,085
But what happens to the risk ratio here? It's smaller.

74
00:07:58,085 --> 00:08:07,085
It's three point six. So it's gone in the opposite direction, and there is a bigger difference between the risk ratio and the odds ratio.

75
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:16,085
So now when we have inflated the proportion of our total study sample who are cases, we have a smaller risk ratio.

76
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:20,085
So what's going on here? Well,

77
00:08:20,085 --> 00:08:29,085
one thing that we note from running through these three examples is that the risk ratio is extremely sensitive to the ratio of cases to controls.

78
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:33,085
But the odds ratio stays the exact same. That's really interesting.

79
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:41,085
Another way of putting this would be that the risk ratio is extremely sensitive to the overall proportion of the study sample.

80
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:48,085
(that would be this cell in the bottom right of the two by two table, showing A+B+C+D).

81
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:55,085
So the risk ratio is sensitive to the overall proportion of cases that make up the study sample.

82
00:08:55,085 --> 00:09:04,085
And you might see where I'm going with this here, when we look at this slide, which compares the odds ratio and the risk ratio.

83
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:15,085
So we have the odds ratio on the Y axis. We have the incidence of the outcome or disease among the non exposed expressed as a proportion.

84
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:19,085
So this would be the proportion of cases in a way, on the x axis.

85
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:25,085
And then we have various examples of risk ratio magnitudes shown in each of the curves.

86
00:09:25,085 --> 00:09:34,085
And so if you look at these, we can see that the risk ratio and odds ratio are very similar.

87
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:45,085
In other words, the risk ratio approximates the odds ratio as long as the incidence among the non exposed is about 10 percent or lower.

88
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:51,085
And you can see that, as you can see that from the side where the lines are relatively flat to the left

89
00:09:51,085 --> 00:09:57,085
hand side of the red dash line that I've indicated at about 10 percent incidence.

90
00:09:57,085 --> 00:10:07,085
And you can see as the incidence among the non exposed increases, the more the risk ratio and the odds ratio begin to diverge from one another.

91
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:16,085
And you will see that in most cases, the odds ratio is inflated relative to the risk ratio.

92
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:23,085
So the risk ratio will be smaller than the odds ratio in magnitude in most cases.

93
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:33,085
And that was really evident from the previous example where we saw that as cases made up an increasing proportion of the overall study sample.

94
00:10:33,085 --> 00:10:41,085
So there was a higher percentage of cases in the sample that the risk ratio got smaller relative to the odds ratio.

95
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:46,085
And as the proportion of cases in the overall study sample got smaller.

96
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:54,085
So starting to get closer to that 10 percent cutoff. We saw that the odds ratio and risk ratio became closer to another.

97
00:10:54,085 --> 00:11:02,085
And the risk ratio gets larger as it approximated the odds ratio. And so that's the relationship between the odds ratio and the risk ratio.

98
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:06,085
And what I'm really getting at here is what we call the rare disease assumption.

99
00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:14,085
And what this is, is that we are relatively comfortable with assuming that the relative risk approximates the odds ratio.

100
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:21,085
One instance among the non exposed is less than 10 percent. And that's the end of Part Two.

101
00:11:21,085 --> 00:11:29,085
The next is Part Three, in which we will get into more detail on the principles of case control studies in the Live Zoom session on Tuesday,

102
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:33,262
September 29th from 10:30 to 12:00 Eastern Time.
