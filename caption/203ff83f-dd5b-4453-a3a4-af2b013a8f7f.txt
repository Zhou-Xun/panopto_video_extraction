1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,100
According. All right, everybody.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,420
So today is October.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:14,259
Something is the 11th. I apologize again.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:23,170
The last time I for some reason there's something wrong with the flow of that lecture was an hour hopefully to do much smoother.

5
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:31,180
So a little reminder where we are here. The problem set is due next Thursday.

6
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:39,310
Next Tuesday is the fall break. So today we're going to move from gases and vapors to talk about aerosols.

7
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:44,080
And again, a couple of questions on the problems that align with what we'll talk about today.

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:52,659
So again, I would recommend chipping away at that as we go through these various topics that same day.

9
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,630
The problem, so too will be a sign. And again, I'll give you two weeks for that.

10
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:02,230
And then if you recall on Tuesday, we talked about that health hazard evaluation critique assignment.

11
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:08,530
So let me know if there's questions about that. Nothing do for that until after the second quiz.

12
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:19,150
But again I just wanted to get it on your list of to do is to be able to narrow down a topic and find one that you think would be interesting to you.

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,500
Any questions on the schedule so far? It's been like that.

14
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,920
There's no question about the problems. Do you want answers as like note for a bulleted format or do you like?

15
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,600
It doesn't have to be full sentences. We'll save that for the A.G. problem.

16
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,640
It can be just the answers. It's more about you guys learning the material now.

17
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,730
It's not about the writing. Good question. Any others?

18
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,710
So changing topics a bit. So last time we talked about.

19
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,430
Gases and vapors. Today we're moving to Aerosoles.

20
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,549
So think back earlier this month, we talked about those three,

21
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:15,220
the two primary categories of what we think about a lot with regards to airborne exposures, inhalation exposures.

22
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,980
They do have relevance for other adults as well.

23
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:26,680
But the reason we're going through some of these fundamentals is it kind of dictates what we think the hazard potential might be in a scenario.

24
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,680
You know, we talked, for example, on Tuesday, things like vapor pressure, the relationship with temperature,

25
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,480
you know, getting to know those those aspects can really help you to determine,

26
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,880
you know, what phase that chemical might be in a given environment,

27
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:48,400
which that leads to think about what the risk might be and how to go about measuring the exposure itself.

28
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,940
Similarly, today, we're going to talk about aerosols, which relates to, you know,

29
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:59,530
what we talked about early in the semester with regards to interaction with the respiratory system in the airways,

30
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,290
but also how they behave in the environment is important for anticipating where they're

31
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,390
going to be and then how we also have a sample to measure the actual exposure.

32
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,309
So today we're going to talk about a review of definitions.

33
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,240
We've already been on that earlier in the semester. Just a reminder, we'll talk about measures.

34
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:25,719
How do we talk about aerosol size? How is that done? Then we're going to go and a bit about particle size distribution.

35
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:35,260
So this is a lot of this is going to be, again, background reminders and coverage of the long, normal distribution.

36
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:43,450
But it's important to to to know that because that's how a lot of these things are denoted,

37
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,739
how things are found out about it, distribution, we do these things.

38
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:56,889
So we're going to do a little bit of review there and then we're going to end with some factors affecting aerosol behavior.

39
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:03,100
You know, how it's going to behave in the environment, which can tell us a lot about what the hazard might be and how we can measure it.

40
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,660
So we've seen this one before. And again, as a reminder, we have aerosol could be a solid or liquid.

41
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:19,150
Usually we're talking about an air and then you have dust fibers, smoke you and mist.

42
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,600
So hopefully you all remember this from before.

43
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,880
Just a couple points.

44
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:35,380
You know, dust is usually thought of as the same makeup, as the source of fiber, again, is the long, skinny things like asbestos,

45
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:43,780
but also, you know, insulation, fiberglass, insulation, other things that might be in a fiber realm.

46
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,790
We're seeing it also more recently potentially with microplastics in Nanoplastics.

47
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,500
That's another concern of smoke you.

48
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,240
GM tends to be quite small. So that's something that people might think of, you know, well, you see it rising.

49
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,860
That's because of the heat and also because it's very small particles and the mist.

50
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,510
So just to get a sense of what we're talking about here, I'm trying to get some sense of scale.

51
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:23,030
So here's a push pin you might have on your bulletin board with, you know, whatever you have on your bulletin board.

52
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:31,640
Think of that as maybe a raindrop. And then here, that little kind of thing is a 100 micrometer diameter particle.

53
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:38,390
Zoom in on that here. And then we talk a lot about ten micrometers.

54
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:48,320
Four or five is what we usually talk about with purple. So, you know, 100 here on a push pin, there's ten and then there's one.

55
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,130
So we're talking about very, very small particles that you can't see.

56
00:05:53,330 --> 00:06:00,050
You might be able to see, you know, in the midst of the rest of the aerosol.

57
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,790
But the a lot of the particles we're actually most concerned about, you can't see with the naked eye.

58
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:10,040
There's another example with a human hair, usually about 50 to 74 meters in diameter.

59
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,930
The blue dots here are ten micrometer particles, what they would look like in comparison.

60
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:23,690
And these red ones are the 2.5 that's we talk about in the air pollution as the fine particulate matter on those.

61
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:33,050
And there's a lot of cool pictures out there with scanning electron microscopes and other microscopy techniques looking at these.

62
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,080
Crystal and silica is one that we talk about a lot. I thought this was interesting.

63
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,409
Facial hair is the main subject here.

64
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:49,690
And then around that facial hair, you have little specks of silica dust.

65
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:58,480
So, you know, and that's of particular concern, again, because it's a matter of fraction that can get lost in the alveoli.

66
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:08,290
And here's another microscope picture, different types of sizes, what Christine saw coming in the quick zoomed way.

67
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:14,290
What do you notice about how might you describe what it looks like in our microscope?

68
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,520
Anything come to mind and we're going to talk about this. So if you don't have anything come to mind, it's okay to look sharp.

69
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,879
Yeah. So, you know, crystal and think, you know,

70
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:37,090
sand in the bigger chunks of sand where a large piece of silicone would have sort of that same property fractures, which you call these round.

71
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:47,050
Not usually. Not particularly. Right. And what about, you know, look like they're the same size.

72
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,780
So they would all behave the same. Right.

73
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:58,960
So that's a few observations just by looking at some of these off the bat that are going to come into play as we talk about how aerosols behave.

74
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:07,660
Another example that I talk a lot about as well. Again, here is a few that's been generated by this activity.

75
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,400
So it's not it's going to take on a different form than than the base materials sometimes.

76
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:21,310
For example, if you're if this is just a regular carbon steel or mild steel, lot of times we're interested in iron manganese exposure.

77
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:32,260
If this is a stainless steel, stainless steel has a lot of chromium in it for that rust resistance, and it's usually in chromium three.

78
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:41,920
But once you heat up super high temperatures, it oxidizes it and you can get hexavalent chromium six in that field, which is carcinogenic.

79
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:52,620
There's also types of steel, like something called In-Canal, which is a much higher nickel composition, also a carcinogen.

80
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,440
So the type of welding makes a big difference as well. What's being woven?

81
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:02,980
And also there's different technologies for doing the well itself that can determine how much fuel might be present.

82
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,640
But anyway, so these are very, very small as we talk about.

83
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:13,980
We've just got a few. So here we're talking 200 nanometers sort of point to micrometers.

84
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:21,820
So these are very, very small. Sometimes they climb on to another operation to form a somewhat bigger.

85
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,240
Particle size, but still usually quite small.

86
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:35,180
Again, that's going to make a big difference with regards to how it behaves in the environment and in the person.

87
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:44,960
So some factors affecting aerosol behavior. So the particle size is the most important determinant of aerosol behavior.

88
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:49,430
And we talked about earlier with lung deposition, but also how we go about sampling the.

89
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,600
Density that is is second is very important, but not quite as important this size.

90
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,940
And we'll see that play out in some of the equations we'll show later.

91
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:08,420
We also have sheep who we looked. You know, we talk about fibers, looked at silica,

92
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:17,690
kind of not sort of the shape of the particle and its electrostatic charge also play a role, but not as important as size, the density.

93
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,139
And, you know, this is a chemical hazards course,

94
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:28,190
but this is all physical properties we're talking about because it's a very important facet to the toxicity,

95
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,170
because the physical factors themselves can be part of that toxicity or what is

96
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,800
contained in the particle and able to be delivered to certain parts of the body.

97
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:42,150
More important thing with regards to health risk. Okay.

98
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:51,430
So because size is the most important, then we describe that using diameter, not radius of diameter is all the way across the particle.

99
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,459
And we're usually talking in terms of micrometers is the Siberian size range.

100
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,250
We're talking sometimes we dip down in nanometers,

101
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:07,900
but do you think about about 100 micrometers isn't really considered an aerosol type because it's not going to be in there for very long.

102
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,300
So to define or to determine the diameter, you do that microscopically.

103
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,650
Like some of the photos I showed earlier. You can do that through sampling.

104
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:31,290
And that's been through a lot of engineering, design, trial and error in comparison with microscopy to get that right.

105
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:37,530
And we'll talk about how that plays out. And then finally, it can be determined aerodynamically.

106
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:44,790
And we'll talk about this later today as well. What does aerodynamic diameter mean will define that show why it's important.

107
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:53,250
You said anything over 100 something micrometer I here some people say microns at

108
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,050
some point in my training somebody said it's not proper to use the word micron.

109
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,320
We'll look at that. I don't know. Anyway, that always stuck with me.

110
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,040
So I always say micrometer. But a lot of people do use the word micron, which is the same.

111
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:16,070
So this is going way back in history, back when microscopy was the most used.

112
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:25,270
It's still used for some things. Asbestos and for other specialized applications.

113
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:33,300
But when this was the primary method for determining the diameter of a particle distribution, there are three ways to do it.

114
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,550
There is something called various diameter, extreme boundaries of the particle.

115
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,890
Martin's diameter separated antiquarians.

116
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,780
And then something that's I think most useful is the projected area.

117
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:53,080
So if it's a irregular size kind of projecting what a size would be if it was a sphere.

118
00:12:53,770 --> 00:13:00,540
So this is. Pretend you're looking through a microscope or a picture from a microscope.

119
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:08,490
Here's that Martin Stoner. Bisecting it, very slender, is taking the longest point between any two ends.

120
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,030
And then the projector diverts kind of in-between, trying to get a sense of the average for what it would be if it were around.

121
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,420
And that's what ended up being mostly used.

122
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:36,250
So from those previous definitions of different types of aerosols here is to give us a sense of what range we're talking about and see.

123
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:41,980
Last on Tuesday night, there's like you say, Tuesday, there's two there on Thursday.

124
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,640
So I guess as a layperson, you know, how how much smaller those are.

125
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:51,520
That's why they have they follow their own different rules of behavior because they are so,

126
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,850
so much smaller than what we're talking about here with aerosols.

127
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:02,290
So you get metal fumes around, point on one. And these are going to usually have a distribution about the small dust.

128
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,480
We're usually talking about four and a half to 55, 5 to 50.

129
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:13,630
And this usually larger because it's that liquid and it has those and those molecules didn't want to stick together.

130
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:21,030
And the reference wavelength of visible light and resolution of the human eye.

131
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,950
So that previous slide show, the human hair was around that same 70 micrometer.

132
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,930
So if you thought about a human hair that wasn't, you just cut like a cross section.

133
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:36,720
Would you be able to see? It depends on maybe the background lighting and other things.

134
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,950
So again, we're talking about very, very small things typically.

135
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:55,400
Distributions. So one of the thing we noticed with my old school picture of the silica dust was there are different sizes, right?

136
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,450
If everything was the same size, it would be called mono disperse.

137
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,730
Every every particle is the same size this usually isn't ever seen.

138
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:13,460
And a process that we are interested in, unless it's being done on purpose, like manufactured nanoparticles,

139
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,580
carbon nanotubes, things like that, where it's on purpose to have everything the same.

140
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,330
Other than that, you're usually not going to see it. But it does occur also naturally.

141
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:32,390
And we talked about some biological agents. Pollens and spores might be more dispersed, particularly in our setting.

142
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:38,720
When we talk about chemicals, it's usually only if it's done on purpose and engineered to be that way.

143
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,349
Typically what we're talking about is that it's poorly dispersed,

144
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:48,620
so you have a range of sizes and it follows its own distribution and might look like this.

145
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:58,850
You have all kinds of different shapes and sizes, so with that we need to be able to describe the distribution in ways that are effective.

146
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,370
So again, it usually spans quite a range of different diameters for any given industrial process.

147
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:16,100
And with that it gives its own size distribution for a particular process, a particular aerosol related to a process.

148
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:25,040
They'll have its own particle size distribution. And when we describe distributions, we usually like to talk about central tendency in dispersion.

149
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:33,830
And that's no different here. But because we are dealing usually with skewed distributions, a lot of times we use graphical methods.

150
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:39,290
Obviously this relates to computational methods you can use as well to describe these.

151
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:45,500
So some things we're going to talk about now are various approaches to describing these visually.

152
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:53,030
We have a frequency histogram where we plot the count of particles versus the diameter.

153
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:00,440
We can also do for the frequency histogram of count versus the log of the diameter or the cumulative distributions.

154
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:09,569
And we'll cover these. So a reminder, you know, you know, we harp on this a lot in this class.

155
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:15,960
The you know, this the shape of the distribution is important because it makes a difference in how we describe it.

156
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:27,260
In release information that's useful. So we have our normal distribution, our bell curve and your mean and you have a standard deviation each.

157
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:37,970
So that mean makes up 68% of that distribution and then ten standard deviations away, plus or minus is 95.4%.

158
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,200
Three is standard deviations on this 99.7%.

159
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,720
So you probably remember that.

160
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:59,399
And as a reminder, you know, we have probably density function that we can describe the distribution with and it becomes useful for estimating,

161
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,940
you know, how likely is something to be above or below or in this case a certain size and particle size.

162
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,870
What percentage of particles are are in that range?

163
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:15,020
Again, that might be related to what we're expecting for health effects or sampling approach.

164
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:24,400
And I think we touched on this before, but in these processes, we're not usually seeing a normal distribution either.

165
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:30,640
So we're not usually seeing a model disperse aerosol and we're usually not seeing a normal distribution.

166
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:37,810
They're typically skewed, as you can see that this frequency histogram.

167
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:44,020
So when we talk about particle size distributions, these histograms tend to be weird looking for the bins.

168
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:52,060
Sizes are not equal and that's related to how it's collected usually, usually the way the aerosols are collected.

169
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,780
The equipment doesn't have equally sized bins.

170
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:03,880
That's why you see this. So this is the type of data you'd see for particle size distribution.

171
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:10,930
You collect it with specialized equipment onto a filter, and that filter can be utilized in our microscope.

172
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,879
You can also do this by mass,

173
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:21,820
but now we're going to talk about particle counts and each bin again that might be related to the sampling equipment has it you can

174
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:29,860
count of how many particles are collected at each of these bins when you plot those to plot them by the frequency which they occur,

175
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,610
be a percentage as well.

176
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:42,460
But the important point here that people sometimes make this mistake again, remembering that our bin widths are not equal.

177
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,219
Like you get an Excel spreadsheet naturally, which is a whole different story of trying to plot this.

178
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,120
And Excel is impossible because Excel is not flexible like that.

179
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,150
But you need to divide by the width of the bin to try to come up with a figure like that.

180
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:03,880
Otherwise it's going to be it's not going to be accurate because what we're really interested in is the area for each of these rectangles.

181
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,490
That area tells us how much of that distribution is in that range.

182
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,940
So what do you use to generate your bracket? Well, you can do it by hand.

183
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:19,330
I've always used a program called Sigma Pot.

184
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,920
I don't know. It's kind of a specialized thing. I mean, I haven't tried an Excel for a while.

185
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:31,960
Maybe. I'm sure somebody can figure it out. I'm not that I'm not that good at Microsoft.

186
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,760
So this is like I said, you can do it by count.

187
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:48,040
This is just a fraction, again, dividing that bandwidth by that bandwidth to get the proper distribution here.

188
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:57,010
And when you do it this way by fraction, then if you were to add up the areas, all these areas, you should come up with one for unity.

189
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:02,030
So again, just remember to divide by that that bandwidth.

190
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,810
What happens if you don't? Here's an example and I'm taking this.

191
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,870
This is from Professor Zellers. He passed on this one.

192
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,250
So I think he really enjoyed pointing this out.

193
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:22,540
But so you have your size when do over here you note that these bins are not equal to 02442668829.

194
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,840
So they're all just kind of all over the place as far as how wide those bins are.

195
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:34,330
And then it's plotted here. But you see this 20 to 35 has 103.

196
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:41,980
The first one is 104. So as the same number of particles and and the smallest one in this one.

197
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:48,130
But there's been this way wider, however they plotted it just as it is in the table.

198
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,240
Instead, this should be divided by 15, should should be much lower.

199
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,660
So if you were just to visualize this, you wouldn't say, oh, this is a.

200
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:02,220
For sure a skewed distribution are following a lot of normal distribution because it was providing critical.

201
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:13,200
So they didn't abide by that. And that's just showing again.

202
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,470
That was beans. This is hand-drawn but.

203
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:25,620
So this is the incorrect when you just showed if you're dividing by that then with and it looks

204
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:30,810
like this again you get that nice skewed distribution that you could smooth out for this.

205
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:37,350
So again, this is just illustrating what happens if you don't remember to divide by that bandwidth.

206
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:43,800
So what not to do? And that's just description.

207
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:49,860
So again, on the promise that when you do that one, it might be good to revisit this, just to remind yourself.

208
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:57,000
So with that, if plotted correctly, a lot of times what you see is this skewed right distribution,

209
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:04,950
which then if you smoothed it out by taking the midpoint of each bin, you get what looks like that that log normal distribution.

210
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:17,489
So remind me, why is it called log normal characteristic of log?

211
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:27,270
It shifts into a normal distribution, right? You can take the log of your diameters or plotted on the log scale will do the trick as well.

212
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,500
So in this example, it's changing the x axis to a lot of scale.

213
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,930
Or you could log transform those values, then plotted it.

214
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:41,010
Both would give you the same shape here following the normal distribution.

215
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:51,120
So again, once you get to that normal distribution, you can make a lot of inferences based on that distribution for center tenancy spread and then for

216
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:57,090
statistical analysis as well for a lot of parametric techniques to require going down for that.

217
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:07,540
The question. Right.

218
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:11,480
So just kind of. There's a lot of slides on this.

219
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:16,840
I'm sorry. I'm just trying to make sure everyone understands kind of presenting it in a couple of different ways.

220
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:23,140
But again, like we showed before here, after with a lot of normal distribution, but we've again plotted on that long scale.

221
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:32,170
So now are our mean of those long transform values is in that center will be a good measure of central tendency.

222
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:36,370
And then you have your standard deviation on each side and.

223
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,680
Pulitzer Prize wants to know attribution is going to give you that same area that you have with the national distribution.

224
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:54,300
So you're saying this is just showing the deal here is just taking the mean after you like transform all your values

225
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:02,100
that gives you that same with the standard deviation and again it's equivalent to the the normal distribution that.

226
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,479
I'm not going to spend much time on this. This can come in handy elsewhere.

227
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,330
And it's good reference for you, for you to have. But I'm not going to go too much into this.

228
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:19,110
It's just a reminder on how you can actually logarithms.

229
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:24,840
In this case, we were talking about natural law, so that's 2.718.

230
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:31,140
So, you know, to go back and forth, you take the natural log or you can take the exponential function to back transform it.

231
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,660
So it's not we're not talking about log base term, but the same rules apply.

232
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:47,940
It's just log base ten and step one, this. 2.7 so long of eight times B you can sum them.

233
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:57,060
We do some of the equations I show, you know, we come back to some of these, but this is just more for reference.

234
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:05,410
And this is just explaining the difference between the natural log and log this term.

235
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:12,250
Again, when you're calculating, say, a geometric mean, it shouldn't matter which one you use as long as you stay consistent.

236
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:18,640
So they follow the same rules based on the previous slide.

237
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,570
And this one, I think, is just showing off.

238
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:36,090
This. And then also again, what some of these equations might be used for reference to have water powers.

239
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:43,200
So you multiply the two power with some out of division, things like that.

240
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,450
So going way back in your mathematical training again, just a reminder and reference.

241
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:58,649
Okay. So back to the normal distribution again, we're talking about, you can define it by the mean plus or minus one,

242
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:04,710
two or three standard deviations will get you what percentage of that distribution is within that range.

243
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,240
Here it is again.

244
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:20,030
You can also do you know, when you talk about statistical tests, you know, scale T tests, things like that, a lot of times we want rounded numbers.

245
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,510
So that's where you get the 1.645 if you think about the C.

246
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,330
Z scale 1.96 metal familiar. That's from 95.

247
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:33,069
Think about the most tests you can do. One tale as well, one sided.

248
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:38,590
They come into play in a couple of weeks when we talk about compliance and do that one tailed test.

249
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:43,210
But this is all all of it. So the 1 to 1 side test is just equivalent to this.

250
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:47,200
And then taking out one the tail on one side and putting it back in.

251
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:56,780
So we'll come back to that. All right. This is just graphically showing that where it's the weapon, the round numbers, the different.

252
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,320
You multiply the standard deviation by 1.6 or 1.96.

253
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,460
This is just showing that one one sided test.

254
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:09,800
And again, we'll come back to this. We don't really use it as much in terms of size distribution.

255
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:18,980
But but you might if you're interested in what's the 90 percentile of that distribution for health reasons or things like that.

256
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:25,980
Okay. So once you have that. The mean.

257
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:34,530
So you've taken the log of all your diameters, in this case particle diameters, and you took the mean of all those.

258
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,350
If you take the exponential function of that calculated mean, that gives you the geometric mean.

259
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:45,660
So you're going to have really small numbers when you take the logs of each of these diameters,

260
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,960
this can be really small numbers and you take the average of that, it's going to have a really small number.

261
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:52,680
Then you take the exponential function of that to get you your geometric mean.

262
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:59,729
Same thing with the geometric standard deviation. It's the same calculation as a regular television.

263
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:04,770
You're just doing it up the log transform values and then at the end of the exponential function that.

264
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,400
Okay. So back to how they go about plotting this.

265
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:23,200
Here's the table we had before. So instead of doing our count distribution plot, we're going to do a cumulative percent plot.

266
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:29,340
So this is the cumulative distribution. So that's where you take the cumulative percent.

267
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,680
So the first one would be just what, percent of the total?

268
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:38,760
So we luckily have exactly 2000 participants in this particular example.

269
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:47,090
So 104 divided by 1000, 10.4% of your particles are in that first bin of 0 to 4 micrometers.

270
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:53,520
You're adding 160 in that second one. So that's 16% are that 16%.

271
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:58,320
So it accumulates as you go down this table all the way to 100%.

272
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:03,630
So what you can do with this is you plot the upper end of the range.

273
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:12,750
So our first point would be at four micrometers if our X-axis is our particle diameter and then you plot the cumulative percent.

274
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,360
But because we have that skewed distribution, we don't use regular graph paper.

275
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:22,370
We're going to use logarithm paper.

276
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:34,280
So with that especially, we had a graph that will show, you know, give you a straight line if it is in fact, abnormally distributed.

277
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,300
So it's called one probability point plot. Okay.

278
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:44,630
So again, this is our y axis that's here. We're going to plot the upper end of that for each one.

279
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:50,480
And then our killer percent on the other axis, on the x axis.

280
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:55,910
So we're flipping it. So before we had our count histogram, this was the x axis.

281
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:01,760
Now this is going to be our y axis because we're going to use this specialized paper here.

282
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,680
So you can see.

283
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:16,379
You have wider, you know, your goals to start this and get tighter and tighter as you get to the next level and there's time in each one.

284
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,740
So sometimes you'll you'll see a graph.

285
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:24,710
People want two levels. This one has three levels to go for.

286
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:34,140
There is no zero. So it starts off and goes to ten, then 11 to 100, 100 and thousand, whatever.

287
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:39,420
Okay. So here we have 1040 range. Again, it's on a multiplicative scale.

288
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,969
And then on the x axis on this particular one, it prohibits.

289
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:51,870
But we're not going to pay attention to problems right now, a period of percentage percentile in the middle of 50.

290
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:56,700
And you'll see how even those percentile, you might not be able see it very well, but they're stretched out on the tables.

291
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:03,480
So here it's, you know, 40 and 60 right here. But then it gets stretched out in the further away you get.

292
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:08,490
And again, that's because it's at a comedy scale.

293
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:14,520
So with this, we plotted from the left the table from the last slide.

294
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:22,670
Here's our 4.0 diameter at 10.6% or whatever, and all the way up.

295
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:29,790
And you'll notice it's a straight line, right? That tells you that, in fact, a lot of normal distribution.

296
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:38,210
Okay. When they point out 84 and 16 at the top there.

297
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:52,320
Sorry. I'm always telling you. Try to read my mind. Right. What's 84 -16?

298
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:05,190
Yeah. So if women in 62, 68, like we talked about, that's 68% of what you get with plus or minus one steering action.

299
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,440
So just by plotting this, we can visually see for estimate what that standard deviation is going to be.

300
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:20,440
So here it is, zoomed in 34% above 34% below that median on this paper.

301
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:30,360
That's going to be that 60%. Which tells us that that's minus one standard deviation, which happens to be what a problem it is.

302
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:37,830
But that gets confused. I don't think you need to talk about here's a really badly drawn, normal curve.

303
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:44,360
On top of this, it's to help you visualize. Looks like it can go.

304
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:51,900
But you get the idea, right? Just bring it back to the original pictures of the normal curve.

305
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:59,610
Okay. So what then? What we can do? So this is a cleaned up version of what we had.

306
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,790
This is our percentile. They're stretched out on the tails.

307
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:12,240
Is there a particle diameter again on the log scale and plotted this line, you can find your median.

308
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:17,640
So again, we're talking about count simply as your count, median diameter.

309
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:27,540
You find that 50th percentile followed up to your your line and it points you to what the median diameter is for your particle size distribution.

310
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:33,980
In this case, it's somewhere between 89. So that's the 50%.

311
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:42,590
You can also find the 84th or the 16th percentile and follow it over to estimate.

312
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:48,440
So I'll give you the count me in diameter. And if it is a straight line,

313
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:56,420
that'll be also a really good estimate of your geometric mean diameter because it is that follows the rules of the law and the distribution.

314
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:03,620
So that medium diameter tells you half the particles are larger in size than that and half the particles are smaller.

315
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,670
So that that specific particle size distribution.

316
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:14,310
And that center count median diameter seemed is your. Central tendency may.

317
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,770
Okay. For a dispersion measure, measure of dispersion, we have a geometric standard deviation and we showed you how to calculate it,

318
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:27,070
but you can estimate it visually again by taking that 84.

319
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,970
And instead of with the normal distribution, you could take it for minus 50th.

320
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:35,860
Here we're taking the 84th divided by the 50th again because it's that multiplicative scale.

321
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,290
So any fourth over 50 gives you your geometric standard deviation.

322
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,790
Alternatively, you could do the 50th percentile over 60%.

323
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:51,260
That would give you the same answer. So it's a straight line. Okay.

324
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,630
Now, I'll give you your estimate of. Dispersion.

325
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:12,100
Every following the questions. So if that slope was steeper, would that mean it's more dispersed or less disperse?

326
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:16,570
More variability or less variable distribution? Less.

327
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,530
Right because the ratio of 84 to 50th would be smaller.

328
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,520
Okay. So this is just summarizing what we just talked about.

329
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,320
Best measure of central tendency of our long normal distribution is going to be the medium.

330
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:43,970
So count medium diameter for size distribution and then the geometric derivation.

331
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:58,650
So we've been talking about count up until now. Like I said, you could also do this with mass of particles.

332
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:07,200
So here's what we've just done with the company in diameter. There is also a separate curve that you can out called the mass media diameter.

333
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:13,320
So that's going to give you a different sort of measure.

334
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:18,930
But it's it's something another way to do it. And that might differ based on how it's measured.

335
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,320
So if you're using microscopy, you're going to go with the count.

336
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,680
But if you're using another technology, something called a cascade impactor, we'll talk about next week.

337
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:34,470
You can you catch it on filters that you weigh. So we actually measuring the mass.

338
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:41,350
You'd be able to plot this and you can go back and forth.

339
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:44,400
Once you have one, you can calculate the other because it's based on the.

340
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:51,420
Density of the particles, if you know about. And that's what this slide is telling us.

341
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:55,980
So I think you might need this in the process as well.

342
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:59,490
It's kind of buried here, so just make note of that.

343
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,320
So assuming spherical particles, the number of particles is related to the volume of the particles for a given size range,

344
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:13,080
and that's based on the volume of the sphere. So you have pi over six times diameter cubed.

345
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,360
And since volume is proportional to mass through density.

346
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:26,560
The cuts in mass are also related. But the diameter cubed.

347
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:31,090
So again, you can go back and forth if you have one, you can calculate the other.

348
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,460
So what that means in practice that that plot we had.

349
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:45,610
You're always going to have slopes that are parallel when you're going between mass working medium diameter distributions.

350
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,820
So your mass distribution is usually about three fold higher than your current distribution.

351
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,640
Depending on that, your metrics, their definition.

352
00:38:54,780 --> 00:39:01,530
So you can calculate how to go from one to the other through something called the hash chill equation.

353
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,429
So it's calculated by mass.

354
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:13,560
Medium diameter is equal to your count mean in diameter and the exponential function of three times the natural log squared of your.

355
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:22,430
Geometric standard deviation. So it's kind of a confusing equation to look at.

356
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:27,920
I did a couple practice ones myself last night just to make sure I still had it checked out.

357
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:34,560
So. So it does. It does work. Everyone is still following.

358
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:40,190
All right. So to summarize.

359
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:46,250
So this is a lot of probability properties, accumulative distribution, distribution, plot.

360
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:49,950
Um. We're going to rank order them.

361
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,950
Do those beans, calculate that cumulative percent and plot it?

362
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,130
If you have a line in a straight line,

363
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:04,440
it tells you that it's approximating the log normal distribution and that lets you do some of the stuff we've been talking about.

364
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:09,060
The 50 percentile is the median above and below that is half.

365
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:13,290
And then how to calculate your geometric standard deviation as your mark.

366
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:17,430
A measure of the particle size disputed distribution dispersion.

367
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,940
This is elementary level reminder.

368
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:29,460
But again, I'm not trying to insult anyone. These are our options when it comes to measures of central tendency.

369
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:34,300
Your mean media, the mode again with a skewed distribution.

370
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:38,560
The median is the safest way to go. Almost it is.

371
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:47,889
So if you have a normal distribution, these are all three equal right. And in a perfectly a perfectly normal distribution.

372
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:55,120
In a lot of normal distribution. Like we mentioned before, if you take the geometric mean or the arithmetic mean,

373
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:59,350
the regular average, it's going to be overestimated because this is tale.

374
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:07,540
Right? So here again, we typically go with the median or the geometric, but the median is usually more commonly used.

375
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:16,149
In this case. In this case. So if you plot this again, this would be relevant to, you know, if you ever do this in practice.

376
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,450
I've actually done it for projects before or for the problem.

377
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:24,430
So, for example, where if you don't get a straight line. It could mean a number of things.

378
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:28,450
Maybe the data collected was censored based on how it was collected.

379
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,240
Maybe it truly is a bimodal distribution.

380
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:40,050
Maybe there's two things going on where you're getting two different types of particles that happened on a project where we're trying to find welding,

381
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,660
we're trying to measure the welding field, but we also had some sweeping was being done in another part of the work site.

382
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:51,459
And it was it was contributing a different type of particle distribution into the future.

383
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:56,800
So so that can happen. You may truly not have a lot of distribution that can happen.

384
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,590
So it may not happen for the process.

385
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,090
So you might want to think about this one if you don't have a straight line. This last point.

386
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:11,770
Just all tip. Okay.

387
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,440
So why are these distributions log normal?

388
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:24,190
We talked a little bit about this regarding exposure in general in an earlier lecture because that also tends to follow a normal distribution.

389
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:30,040
But for one, those larger particles so quickly, I'm still hanging around.

390
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:37,450
So you don't get many of them at the tail, but you do get some. You can't go below zero, you know, negatively size particle.

391
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:44,320
And then, you know, just the way nature works with with how industrial process works as well,

392
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:50,170
you tend to get low numbers below a certain range depending on the process.

393
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:53,830
If you're well, then you get everything shifted, but you get the idea.

394
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:57,340
So time and again, this has been shown empirically that.

395
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:02,450
You do tend to get the particle size distribution that approximates the normal distribution.

396
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:09,920
Okay. So that's that piece. Everyone's good. Everyone's good.

397
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:13,640
All right. We're good on time.

398
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:20,540
Everything's good. All right. So this is a slide we showed early on in the semester as well.

399
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:23,540
So as a reminder of the factors governing aerosol behavior,

400
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:29,990
you have aerodynamics and then you have the other forces acting on the aerosols within aerodynamics.

401
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:37,420
That's going to impact how it deposits in the respiratory system as well as how we can design our samplers.

402
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:46,450
And the forces that we can work with either that are occurring in the body or we can manipulate to help us collect these particles,

403
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:52,960
our gravitational forces. Now, I don't know if sedimentation was a word.

404
00:43:54,670 --> 00:44:04,210
I'm not sure, but I'm going to go with it. So gravitation, inertia or inertial forces, diffusion of electrostatic and thermal.

405
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:11,170
So for big particles, a lot of times we're going to be focusing on those gravitational inertial forces.

406
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:17,200
So gravity increases with increasing diameter as we talk about the particle size is important.

407
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:23,830
And there's. Some sampling technologies referred to as creators that we'll touch on now.

408
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:29,890
We'll talk with you next week and then show again with increase in diameter and increases.

409
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:34,570
This is using another range of different sampling strategies that we'll talk about later.

410
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:43,210
Call them actors and painters in sequence. When you get to the smaller particles, we're dealing more with diffusion of forces.

411
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:47,530
So the diffusion increases as the particle size decreases.

412
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:53,290
Same with electrostatic forces that increase with as the particle size decreases.

413
00:44:54,070 --> 00:45:00,400
And seeing what they're. So we talked about these in the context of lung deposition or airway deposition.

414
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:05,770
But now we're going to kind of shift focus to talk about them with regards to sampling strategies.

415
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,120
Some important factors affecting particle behavior again.

416
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:19,390
Getting to know how it behaves in the environment, how we can collect it, and then how it behaves in the body.

417
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:25,690
One is one concept is aerodynamic, the diameter, it's obviously the length of the diameter.

418
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:29,320
We'll come back to that in a few slides. Segmentation.

419
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:35,560
There's something we can calculate called the terminal 17 quasi that can be useful for a number of applications.

420
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:43,080
Inertia, something called stopping distance and then a diffusion coefficient for this that's really smaller because.

421
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:52,460
So think back to the silica slide with the microscope.

422
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:59,630
You have a lot of different sizes and shapes. So we've talked about size a bit.

423
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:05,650
But what happens when they all have different shapes? How do you. I talk about them in a uniform.

424
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:11,320
That can be a problem. So that's where this concept of aerodynamic diameter comes into play.

425
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:17,710
We can talk about them sort of on the same level, even if they're shaped differently by how they behave and aerodynamically.

426
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:23,950
And that gives us a common way to think about them and to predict what they're going to do.

427
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:30,940
So that's where the term aerodynamic diameter comes into play. So it disobeys your aerodynamic diameter.

428
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:41,380
It's equal to the diameter of the true diameter of the particle times the particles density divided by the density of water, which is one.

429
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:47,740
So basically it's the. It's just the density and that's the square root of that brings in part of one half.

430
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:54,850
So aerodynamic diameter is particle diameter, times the square root of your density.

431
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:58,780
And here's the units from this particular equation.

432
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:08,020
So aerodynamic equivalent diameter centimeters are micrometers and density of grams per cubic centimeter.

433
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:14,350
And the units to cancel. And as a reminder, you know, you do always want to pay attention to units.

434
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:22,140
One centimeter is 10,000 micrometer, so a centimeters like that, sort of 10,000 micrometers in reference.

435
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:25,720
That's that's crazy. So we're talking about get really small particles.

436
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:34,690
All right. So that's aerodynamic data, terminal setting, setting velocity.

437
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:40,240
So this can be denoted as these of TSA terminal selling quasi or sometimes just be sub t

438
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:46,690
and this is defined as the velocity regional gravity forces and buoyancy forces are equal.

439
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,830
So if you think about something falling, obviously gravity's pulling it down.

440
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:51,070
Right?

441
00:47:51,080 --> 00:48:02,950
But at some point, the air, the viscosity of the air is going to it's going to max out how fast that gravity acceleration can can take that velocity.

442
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:10,990
So this is for any particle we can calculate what that philosophy is, where those two forces balance out.

443
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:14,620
And that's related to density.

444
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:25,210
Once again, our particle diameter squared gravity C is the Cunningham factor, which we'll address in a little bit divided by 18.

445
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:34,270
Again, maybe an empirically derived three times this viscosity of air which.

446
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,490
This is for a given temperature and pressure.

447
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,640
It's usually given to you in a problem or you can look it up.

448
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:52,770
So that can simplify it to if you just have a aerodynamic timer to be that squared times gravity times that look factor over 18 times for gas and.

449
00:48:56,570 --> 00:49:01,910
And that's again it's the density makes a big difference here in addition to the particle size.

450
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:08,359
So, you know, density of water is one word for comparison is 1.4 grams per kilo.

451
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:13,840
So. So it is going to behave quite differently. Based on the importance of density.

452
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:25,310
All right. So back to aerodynamic behavior so this defined as.

453
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:37,840
Diameter of a unit density sphere. So something with the density of water with the same terminals so glossy as the particle of interest,

454
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:41,860
a particle of a substance that has a density different than the water.

455
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:46,630
So again, that's how you can kind of normalize everything you can say to the same thing,

456
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:52,780
and it's familiar to you, to the behavior and not the actual particle shape itself.

457
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:59,020
So, again, aerodynamic diameter is how it would behave like.

458
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:03,980
Don't see above water. And that's the equation again.

459
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,430
So the particles diameter doubled by how much with its terminal settling in velocity increase.

460
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,820
Four. Yeah. So back on this slide.

461
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,200
Square. So double to square in space. So.

462
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:32,280
Yes, that is correct. Okay.

463
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:36,280
So we don't get a lot into Reynolds Reynolds numbers right now.

464
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:41,340
That's the whole that's in the chapter that's posted if you're interested in reading more about that.

465
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:50,190
But a plaque will accelerate until that resistant force equivalent to that gravitational force, as we talked about.

466
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:58,710
And again, that if you're talking about a ventilation system where there's a lot of people here, they're breathing,

467
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:05,370
that's probably not going to be laminar flow, that's going to be more turbulent flow, that's going to be something around somewhere.

468
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:11,400
Things are going to behave differently. Same in like a windstorm. But for laminar flow, we have pretty settled here.

469
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:20,430
You can follow. So this is getting more into derivation of the terminal velocity equation.

470
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:33,930
So your buoyancy forces you to find is three times pi times viscosity of air times V are relative particle velocity and times that part of lambda.

471
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:39,390
So these are all important factors that go into what that potency or resistant force is going to be.

472
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,389
And then, as we've all learned in physics,

473
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:52,680
class gravitational forces is our mass times that gravitational acceleration about 900 8081 centimeters the second squared.

474
00:51:54,390 --> 00:52:01,110
So those equal out. The reason you could just equal these two sides of the equation.

475
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:08,009
And that's what this slide is depicting. So it's it's kind of messy, but it's basically just taking your gravitational forces,

476
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:17,040
putting it into common units and making that equivalent to your existing forces and settling and solving that out for the velocity factor in there.

477
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:22,140
And that gives you the terminal also velocity, which is, again, when those two forces are equal.

478
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:29,040
So that's where this comes from. And, you know, this this equation is good.

479
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:37,830
Again, another sign that it is empirically calculated, good from about one micrometer to 70 micrometers.

480
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:47,590
You'll notice this one doesn't show the correction factor. See, and that's where we will come in with the very small particles.

481
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:54,780
But. But in any event. This is how it's derived that terminal seven was.

482
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:05,150
And you know, if you really want to get short shortcut about it, you can solve that further for normal temperature and pressure.

483
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:14,280
You can solve it out and assume that if you assume that split correction factor is one and you know,

484
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:20,480
you can solve it out to be three times ten to the fifth times your aerodynamic diameter squared.

485
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:29,600
One thing you do have to know here is the units, because, you know, if you read the chapter, you'll note that it shows you a different one.

486
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:33,500
It says 0.003. Times Square.

487
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:39,860
That's because in the book chapter, they're talking about micrometers. Here we're talking this is in centimeters.

488
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:43,910
So that's the difference of 10,000 difference. But anyway,

489
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:51,350
this is the shortcut if you can assume the pair viscosity at normal temperature and pressure and that slip

490
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:58,250
correction factor of one and it's based on the air doesn't have to enter which takes into account the density.

491
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:02,830
Right. So again, that's a short conversion. If you want.

492
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:10,479
So the take home message general selling velocity varies in portion of particle

493
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,420
density and as the square of the particle diameter or the drone aircraft.

494
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:24,970
And you can plot it like this. So this is showing the terminal so will see that the increase in particle size.

495
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:36,310
And just from reference to you know aa1 hundred micrometer particle drops to 2.2 miles per hour,

496
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:42,100
whereas a 1.8 micrometer particle drops at 12 feet per hour.

497
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,780
So there's just a huge difference in selling glossy,

498
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:52,000
which makes a difference for a lot of things like what's in the air around you and

499
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,320
also how it's how you could best capture some of these particles based on their size.

500
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:04,840
And then also what's what's happening when you breathe them in. Then again, this is assuming a certain density.

501
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,480
So I just related this.

502
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:13,930
You know, we talk about chemical hazards, but this is also highly relevant to a lot of the arguments early in the pandemic about,

503
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:17,650
you know, is it is it on surfaces, is it an air?

504
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:25,540
And a lot of questions about the effectiveness of masks, but also is it in the air?

505
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:33,730
And a lot of this stuff this is in Science magazine, you know, the top, top scientific journal out there.

506
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,760
You know what exactly what we're talking about.

507
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:43,630
And we're talking about it in the context, of course, the chemicals, but it's can't be related to viruses as well.

508
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,270
And this one they're talking about, you know, how that transmission can occur.

509
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:54,510
Um, inhalation deposition in a space based on.

510
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:58,610
Article by editor. This is more for you reference.

511
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:05,270
Again, this isn't technically a chemical hazard, but kind of like that slide it just showed.

512
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:09,680
They're talking in this in this article about, you know, if you have a virus, one particle,

513
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:16,400
that's one micrometer, it's going to take 12 hours to drop one and a half meters.

514
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:22,459
So by based on average breathing, so it's going to take 12 hours.

515
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:31,820
So, you know, that's why mask mandates were extremely important and ventilation, which was also given sort of.

516
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:38,630
Not as much importance as it should have. Through the whole thing.

517
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:43,380
Currently, if you go to a hunter, it's 5 seconds, you know, drugs.

518
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:51,140
So again, that's going to be very different depending on where in this case where the virus likes to live in that purpose size distribution.

519
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:57,170
Okay. Back to particles.

520
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:07,550
So I mentioned the Cunningham factor. I think you should be measuring particles at all.

521
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:16,910
Velocity, the stopping distance. We'll get to stopping that. So anything less than about four micrometers.

522
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:22,910
You're getting to a part of the size so small that it's actually slipping between air

523
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:27,950
molecules and those buoyancy forces aren't going to be quite as predictable to hold that up.

524
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:31,490
So that's why this is called a slip correction factor.

525
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:38,240
So the smaller the particle, the more difference that's going to make in your in your equation or your calculations.

526
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:47,140
So you're actually going to see an increase relative to the base equation in your SO velocity below that.

527
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:57,800
And it's less just simply once you can once you find that slip correction factor, you can just add it to the to the equation here.

528
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:04,360
And you find it in different locations.

529
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:12,820
This you guys are missing out because when I was in grad school, I had to take a whole class based on this entire textbook.

530
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:19,270
HINES That's sort of our real bill. It was named William Owens, who's at UCLA.

531
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:23,649
It's a whole textbook on aerosol technology. All kinds of great stuff.

532
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:30,160
But we've kind of condensed it down for you guys. But anyway, so that's one type of source you can find it.

533
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:34,270
Hopefully we will have some ideas as well somewhere.

534
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:36,850
So this is kind of hard to read.

535
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:45,400
So I thought we'd take a minute and see if you guys can figure out what the slip correction factor would be for a particle that's 1.5 micrometer.

536
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:57,680
You guys look for more. Back in my days.

537
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:09,230
The. Anyone want to make a guess?

538
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:21,010
Yeah. It's like 1.3. Yeah.

539
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:28,040
Yeah. So the way he fell on that is you have three scales here that correspond three curves.

540
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:33,290
1.5 is going to be larger than the largest of the scales here.

541
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:37,730
So we're going to go over here between the one and the two. So here and it's going to be on this curve.

542
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:45,860
The one through two sits here. The one thing that always confuses me about this particular figure is there's 11 tick marks between one and two.

543
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:50,690
So I actually don't know what the difference is.

544
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:56,360
Which one? I'm assuming this one might be extreme, you know, I don't know.

545
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:04,160
I don't know. So, yeah, it's it's right around the 1.1 or 1.2 or 1.3.

546
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:08,090
I don't know, uh, depending on what the mark fits.

547
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:16,280
So it's in that range, what about four, 0.5, would you estimate that?

548
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,730
And again, we're kind of eyeballing it here on this type of figure.

549
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:26,200
You may have a guess for 0.5 micrometer, 1.41.4.

550
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:31,940
Okay. So we're here because we're going with the second scale 0.5 and then the second curve here.

551
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:40,790
So one point dip, 1.4, 1.5, depending on how those tick marks on the Y axis.

552
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,410
So I think you guys got it above 500 nanometers.

553
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:49,880
You shouldn't have to look at it. Why? September 25?

554
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:54,770
Yep. Trick question. 500 millimeters is the same as 0.5 micrometers.

555
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,480
Okay, so I won't be late for that. And then 4.06 EPA up here somewhere.

556
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:04,400
But you get the idea the smaller the particle, the higher the slight correction factor.

557
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,970
So we get really small. It can make a pretty big difference.

558
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:14,090
But when you're in the, you know, around one or between one and four, it's not not really a very big difference.

559
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:21,320
Okay. So this I'm not going to really go into depth.

560
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:27,209
It's just kind of bringing all that back together to see how they came up with this

561
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:32,460
derivation of this equation between aerodynamic diameter and particle diameter and density.

562
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,350
With that slip correction factor.

563
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:48,460
Again, here you have an example that to, you know, an example of relative density is led oxide has a density of 8.6 grams per cubic centimeter.

564
01:01:49,030 --> 01:02:02,110
So. So if you had a diameter particle or a particle that had the same density as or density of one and it was five micrometers,

565
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:05,799
it would behave the same way as a lead oxide particle.

566
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:13,209
That's truly 1.7 micrometers. So it's true particle diameter is 1.7, but its aerodynamic diameter,

567
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:19,780
how it's going to behave like a high density particle, one is going to be that five as well.

568
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:28,930
That makes sense. So more density. So the smaller the true particle size to behave similarly to something with density.

569
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:40,120
All right. Just a couple of examples and they'll kind of lead us into what we'll talk about next Thursday after fall break,

570
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:46,389
because this Thursday we're in talk about sampling for guests of vapors. Then we're going to come back to sample for Aerosoles next week.

571
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:52,210
Next week, something called loop creation. This is just to illustrate how you might use some of these.

572
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,700
Principles. You know,

573
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:04,920
you have particles coming through this thing and you can design it such that the large particles will settle out based off that gravitational force,

574
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:12,430
the segmentation force of that part. Another concept is inertia.

575
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:22,479
So if we have an interest of initial velocity, like a sneeze or, you know, say a grinding wheel,

576
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:28,750
something that has an initial velocity or in a sampler is how it's mostly used.

577
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:37,270
If you're pulling air through a sampler, you can calculate something called the stopping distance, which can be used for a variety of purposes.

578
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:45,340
And you'll note that the equation for stopping distance is very similar to terminal velocity.

579
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:51,190
We're just switching out that gravitational force with that initial velocity of the particle,

580
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,870
and then those viscosity of air is going to catch up to it based on its.

581
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,280
That's density and ultimately it will stop and that can be used.

582
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:07,210
And again, design of samplers and things like that.

583
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:12,820
Here's an example called the B.

584
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:24,950
This one is a virtual impactor or a real impactor where you have air coming through and small particles can travel this curve,

585
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:30,490
whereas larger particles can't because they're going to. So. So again, we'll come back to this.

586
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:36,879
But the pingers after cyclones are all ways technologies that take advantage

587
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,990
of knowing these aerodynamic behaviors to collect certain types of particles.

588
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:48,170
We'll come back to that. I imagine, cascading back and forth.

589
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:53,840
That's how we might plot that part size distribution based on mass,

590
01:04:53,840 --> 01:05:02,220
since that account just uses this technology in different stages to get different fractions of that distribution that you can then plot.

591
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:09,740
The final thing is the fusion again, as the particle size gets smaller and smaller.

592
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,080
The fusion is going to play a more important role.

593
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:19,550
Don't have a whole lot here to talk about except the main displacement and random Brownian motion, they call it.

594
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:22,670
So on average is going to be no motion at all.

595
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:29,660
But if you take the square of that, it's related to the fusion coefficient in time, and that's actually the Einstein equation.

596
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:34,309
So your diffusion rate is there.

597
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:37,790
The diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to your particle diameter.

598
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:41,750
But we don't try to think if we use that a lot here.

599
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:45,200
I don't think we talk about that a whole lot when we talk about sampling.

600
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,569
We tend to focus on some of the other mechanisms. Okay.

601
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:56,060
So hopefully you were introduced to different types of aerosols,

602
01:05:57,140 --> 01:06:04,760
talked about the size distributions and how to plot those and how to get the information

603
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:12,170
from those and then hopefully know more about the factors influencing particle behavior.

604
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:19,390
Questions. Comments concerns. I actually post record.

605
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:24,520
I was thinking that way, too. You did? Okay. You don't have to start over.

606
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:29,260
Just be patient and start over. Just kidding. Yeah.

607
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:32,500
And there's some of us have some sample questions if you want, so.

608
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:36,190
All right, that's all I have. The rest of your day.

609
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:43,370
But can you quickly say that? You know, but I don't have them.

610
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:49,420
But yeah, sure. Student actors used to sample dust from the specs to see.

611
01:06:49,460 --> 01:07:03,360
What do you guys think? You guess you wanted me to tell you, right?

612
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:07,680
So I would say probably gay, right?

613
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:11,760
Because it's quite a lot of trouble here. And we're expecting.

614
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:14,930
Local distribution sites realign.

615
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:24,380
Dust generated from grinding and sanding or color dispersion on the principle of extrusion midsize on a long probability plot.

616
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,530
What? So it's part of the Spurs.

617
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:33,220
Lot of normal keyword here. Median.

618
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:43,170
It's going to be. As opposed to the number of parties in the two equivalent groups.

619
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:53,570
Oh, boy. Hang on my calculator. If series particles had the dangerous density of loss below, which would have the highest terminal selling velocity.

620
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:09,550
But we think. I'm guessing it's not this one.

621
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:15,300
Right. Without calculating and.

622
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:19,190
But have a guess. I certainly would have to calculate myself.

623
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:30,220
I would guess. EG because we talk about diameter squared, right. Versus.

624
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:36,120
Density is extremely important.

625
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:40,140
So I'm guessing you can double check that with the calculation.

626
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:46,000
All right. Any other questions? All right.

627
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:50,530
So if you actually go back to Slide 53. Yes, I can.

628
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:57,440
Oh, yeah. The derivation. Yeah, the confusing one. Both.

629
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:07,840
Thank you. I will make you.

630
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:18,660
The most important piece is that I'm just trying to be more familiar with how that was derived from stripping down these two forces.

631
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:23,920
The gravitational forces can show you how that is.

632
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:27,800
So something you don't need to know this. Okay.

633
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:34,390
Okay. I'm almost done. Thank you. Yeah, it wasn't meant to confuse.

634
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:38,290
Yeah, it's just. I wasn't. I didn't think it was confusing.

635
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:41,320
I just. Yeah, well, a a lot of symbolism on.

636
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:44,470
Yeah, yeah. Converting under certain things from.
