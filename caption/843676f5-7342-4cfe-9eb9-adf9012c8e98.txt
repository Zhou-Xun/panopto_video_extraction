1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,294
Today, we're going to provide an empirical basis for

2
00:00:13,294 --> 00:00:18,160
why we use SDT as the underlying theory for motivational interviewing.

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,840
And we're going to do so by presenting a very powerful meta analysis.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,198
Now, for those of you who may not recall, a meta analysis is a study of studies,

5
00:00:28,198 --> 00:00:31,410
rather than each individual patient contributing data.

6
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,564
Each study contributes a data point, and

7
00:00:33,564 --> 00:00:37,740
the outcomes are weighted by the sample size of each study.

8
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,542
We're going to specifically focus on this meta analysis.

9
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:45,123
Now, as you might recall, SDT, including this paper,

10
00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:48,941
is not specifically driven by motivational interviewing.

11
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:52,231
And it's not necessarily why they did this meta analysis.

12
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:56,943
We're using this, a sort of indirect proof that the associations I will

13
00:00:56,943 --> 00:01:00,266
show you today of SDT concepts and mental health and

14
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:05,211
behavioral outcomes we fail provides a very strong basis that justifies our

15
00:01:05,211 --> 00:01:08,168
inclusion of SDT as the defacto theory of MI.

16
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:11,073
Let's begin by the three types of motivation,

17
00:01:11,073 --> 00:01:13,490
autonomous control and a motivation.

18
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,640
What you see here are select items from the TSRQ.

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,370
Let's start with the autonomous sub scale.

20
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,723
I want to take responsibility, it's very important to me.

21
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:24,880
This captures the essence of autonomous motivation.

22
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,740
Alternatively, you see the two items for controlled motivation, guilt and others.

23
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,759
We're not going to focus today on the remote scale amotivation, but

24
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,610
just keep in mind.

25
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:38,218
Amotivation means I am not willing to put any energy into this going back to

26
00:01:38,218 --> 00:01:41,810
our definition of an SDT motivation equals energy will.

27
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,840
Amotivation is the absence of energy to even think about it.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,425
Let's move on and look at the full TSRQ.

29
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:52,140
Sub scale one is the autonomous items.

30
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,953
You can see both the volitional aspect of those items,

31
00:01:54,953 --> 00:01:59,840
as well as sort of the integration of the behavior change motive with other values.

32
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,037
Now take a look at sub scale two items, and that's the control,

33
00:02:04,037 --> 00:02:09,440
motivation, others pressure and guilt external drive.

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,992
So we're going to look at how those two sub skills are related to mental health

35
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:15,340
and behavioral outcomes.

36
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,309
The second construct that's measured in the meta analysis is from the HCCQ

37
00:02:19,309 --> 00:02:20,290
questionnaire.

38
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,811
Now the TSRQ that we showed you last set of slides.

39
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,390
That's patient reporting their own motivation.

40
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,540
This is different.

41
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,230
This is patients reporting the counseling style of their practitioner in this case

42
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,049
physician and what it is trying to capture are things like whether or

43
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:39,198
not you perceive your clinician as accepting whether or

44
00:02:39,198 --> 00:02:42,760
not you perceive your physician as supporting your autonomy.

45
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,140
Now, what's interesting about this questionnaire?

46
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,371
It was not developed by MI experts.

47
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:49,840
It was developed by SDT experts.

48
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,840
It was not developed to code MI skill.

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,168
But I hope you can see that virtually everything in this questionnaire

50
00:02:58,168 --> 00:03:00,600
aligns with our definition of good MI.

51
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,426
So this is why we like to say that SDT is the de facto theory to explain MI but

52
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:08,291
it was developed initially outside of MI.

53
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,140
And we have tried to synthesize the two.

54
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,445
This is a complicated table, but it's going to present the findings of those two

55
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:19,780
questionnaires as they relate to mental health and behavior change outcomes.

56
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,210
So let's walk through it.

57
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,321
Let's start on the left.

58
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:24,156
The columnist says AS.

59
00:03:24,156 --> 00:03:29,150
What that is autonomy support our scores on the HTCQ.

60
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,140
Remember, correlations can range from -1 to +1.

61
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,065
The values in these columns are all correlations.

62
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:40,660
A positive correlation means higher autonomy support more of that variable.

63
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,771
A negative correlation means more autonomy.

64
00:03:42,771 --> 00:03:47,100
Support less of that variable, higher autonomy support.

65
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,668
That is, when the patient reported their clinician's skill,

66
00:03:50,668 --> 00:03:55,441
they had lower self reported depression on the part of the patient and lower anxiety.

67
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:59,954
Higher quality of life, higher vitality and higher positive effect and finally,

68
00:03:59,954 --> 00:04:01,260
less negative affect.

69
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,595
So autonomy support, as reported by the patient,

70
00:04:03,595 --> 00:04:07,740
is associated with better mental health outcomes for every variable measure.

71
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,649
Now, let's look at the behavior change on algorithm.

72
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:14,385
When patients reported higher autonomy support by their providers,

73
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:18,183
they had higher rates of smoking cessation, more physical activity,

74
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:21,411
greater way change, greater control of their blood sugar,

75
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:25,370
better adherence to their meds, better diet and better dental hygiene.

76
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,462
So in every case when patients report stronger autonomy support from

77
00:04:28,462 --> 00:04:31,840
their provider, they have better behavior change algorithm.

78
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,273
Now let's move to the two columns on the right autonomous regulation and

79
00:04:35,273 --> 00:04:36,670
controlled regulation.

80
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,240
Let's start with the autonomous regulation findings beginning again with mental

81
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,070
health outcomes.

82
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,141
What we see is lower rates of depression and anxiety and

83
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:46,761
higher rates of quality of life and vitality.

84
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:50,205
So again, autonomous regulation is associated with better mental health

85
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:51,340
outcomes.

86
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,024
What about behavior change?

87
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:57,422
In every case other than dental hygiene, higher autonomous regulation,

88
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,191
better rates of smoking cessation, better rates of exercise,

89
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:06,440
weight loss by seeming control, medication adherence and dietary change.

90
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,270
Now let's look at the far right controlled motivation.

91
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,186
My dear colleague Jeff Williams, who knows both SDT and MI, has said for

92
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:19,101
years that yeah, guilt and shame work, controlled motivation works,

93
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:23,440
but at a very high price and for very little benefit.

94
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,160
This column is the basis for that statement.

95
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,044
Look at the mental health outcomes associated control regulations,

96
00:05:30,044 --> 00:05:32,300
higher rates of depression, anxiety.

97
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,071
Think about that.

98
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,255
So when you feel pressure to make a behavioral change,

99
00:05:35,255 --> 00:05:38,108
if you're only quitting smoking because someone guilted you into it.

100
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:40,780
If you're only trying to change your diet because you're ashamed those

101
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,040
are associated with bad mental health outcomes, worse mental outcomes.

102
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,072
Now let's look at the Association of Controlled Regulation with behavior

103
00:05:47,072 --> 00:05:48,340
change outcomes.

104
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,707
Now each case is slightly higher than zero, but

105
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:53,785
it being not statistically significant and so close to zero,

106
00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:58,140
that's probably not worth the price of depression and anxiety.

107
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:04,540
For the most part, the results are completely consistent with SDT theory.

108
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,801
When patients report higher autonomy support from their provider.

109
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:12,540
They have better outcomes, both psychologically and behaviorally.

110
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,047
When they report autonomous motivation,

111
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:18,536
they have better outcomes emotionally and behaviorally.

112
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:21,299
And when they have high control motivation,

113
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:25,952
they have worse mental health outcomes and only moderately better behavior

114
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:30,940
change outcomes compared to the absence of control motivation.

115
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:38,865
So that sets the stage for how we're going to present MI within the context of SDT?
