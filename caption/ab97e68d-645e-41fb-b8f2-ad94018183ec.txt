1
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:13,890
In the next few slides, I'm going to present some examples of health disparities in the United States today.

2
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:26,320
Specifically, I want to return to some of the measures of population health you learned about in a previous lecture focused on population health.

3
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,800
As you may recall, infant mortality is one of the key measures of population health.

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:46,360
It is one of the indicators we look to across time, across countries and across communities are groups to measure the health of our population.

5
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:57,350
Infant mortality is defined as the number of deaths among children, one and younger per one thousand life births.

6
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,270
You saw a slide that looks something like this, looking at the x axis,

7
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:10,580
which captures the years from nineteen fifteen to twenty fourteen and the Y axis showing the infant mortality rate,

8
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:22,280
we see that over the past century, the infant mortality rate in the United States has dropped about ninety five percent, a dramatic improvement.

9
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:33,920
But let's complicate that figure, that population rate just a bit by looking for differences in infant mortality, by race.

10
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,820
When we look at the same measure, infant mortality during the same period of time,

11
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:49,070
the last one hundred years or so, but break down the data by race, we see something troubling.

12
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:54,770
The yellow line represents the infant mortality rate for white infants,

13
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:02,190
and the orange line represents the infant mortality rate for African American children.

14
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:10,310
Over the past century, black infants have been twice as likely to die compared to white infants.

15
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:22,700
In 19, 15, 20 percent of black children died before reaching their first birthday, compared to just 10 percent among whites today.

16
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:33,640
Eleven black children and five white children out of every thousand live births will die in their first year of life.

17
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,800
So while infant mortality rates have fallen for both groups,

18
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:47,530
we see persistent disparities in the rate of infant deaths between white and African-American children,

19
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:55,140
with African-American children dying at almost twice the rate as their white counterparts.

20
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,170
As you will learn about later in the semester,

21
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:06,570
this disparity in infant mortality has nothing to do with innate biological differences but can be linked

22
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:15,790
to differences in the lived experiences and health care experiences of white versus black mothers.

23
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:22,910
Eliminating racial disparities in infant mortality is a key goal of public health.

24
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:29,450
OK, let's look at another key measure of population health, life expectancy.

25
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:36,410
We provided a couple of different perspectives on life expectancy in an earlier online lesson.

26
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:42,160
Life expectancy at birth and life expectancy at age sixty five.

27
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,200
The definitions given are listed here on the slide.

28
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:57,930
In a previous video, we provided population averages for life expectancy at birth and at age sixty five, showing this data for both men and women.

29
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:06,260
This slide shows a different measure, life expectancy at age twenty five, but the idea is the same.

30
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:15,860
This slide shows how long someone is expected to live at age twenty five if current mortality rates remain constant in the future.

31
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:26,480
But instead of showing only the population average, this graph shows the disparities in life expectancy based on educational attainment.

32
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:44,080
Take a minute to look at the graph. What do you notice? High school graduates are expected to live about six years less than college graduates.

33
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:54,600
Well, white men who have some college are expected to live for years less than this highest attainable standard set by white male college graduates.

34
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,800
So overall,

35
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:10,260
this graph shows the impact of education on life expectancy and the disparity in life expectancy for those who have less versus more formal education.

36
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,230
This next slide shows the effect of race on life expectancy.

37
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:25,920
This graph looks at life expectancy at birth over the past one hundred and fifteen years for white Americans versus African-Americans.

38
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:34,470
And on one hand, some looking at this graph would focus on the tremendous progress that has been made in the past one hundred and fifteen years,

39
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,120
reducing disparities in life expectancy based on race.

40
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:51,480
And that's true. But on the other hand, we see that on average, African-Americans still die almost three years younger than white Americans.

41
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,420
That's a significant disparity.

42
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:05,470
And eliminating the social conditions that lead to a lower life expectancy for African-Americans is an important public health aim.

43
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:11,960
So we've looked at the role of education and the impact of race on life expectancy.

44
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,030
What about geography for those of you who aren't from Michigan?

45
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:27,770
This map is a corner of southeast Michigan and it shows how life expectancy differs by area code on one extreme.

46
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:34,060
People in North will live to an average age 80.

47
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:45,510
In contrast, in parts of Detroit, people are only expected to live to age sixty nine or seventy a 15 year difference.

48
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:54,300
Indeed, geography, your zip code where you live can dramatically affect life expectancy.

49
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:02,010
The other key indicator or indicators we've talked about in the population health lecture was death rates.

50
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:07,260
I'm not going to go through each disease or condition mentioned in that lecture

51
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:13,350
and show disparities based on race or income or education or geography.

52
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:21,930
But for many health conditions, there are disparities in disease rates based on these factors.

53
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:30,330
Tackling these disparities and working to eliminate them is a chief focus of our work in public health.

54
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:38,600
We understand that population health is fundamentally linked to our ability to improve health.

55
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:47,970
We simply will not make meaningful improvements at a population level until we can eliminate health disparities.

56
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:54,930
There is a name for this school or this outcome where disparities in health outcomes no longer exist.

57
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:02,160
The name, according to the Braverman article assigned in this lesson, is health equity.

58
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:11,310
A health equity approach to improving health doesn't mean giving everyone the same amount or type of care or resources,

59
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,020
but instead allocating resources according to need,

60
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:25,240
giving special attention to the needs of those at greatest risk of poor health based on social conditions.

61
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:34,360
I began this segment by stating that in public health, we believe health is a fundamental right that all people should have,

62
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:42,070
as the World Health Organization states, the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health.

63
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:53,840
It's one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.

64
00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:03,080
If we believe that all people deserve healthy, full lives, then we must seek to eliminate health disparities,

65
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:10,550
pursuing health equity by striving for the highest standards of health for all people.
