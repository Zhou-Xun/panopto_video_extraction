1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,139
Here we go. Because the Alvin come on, the others and come on and start recording.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,410
So just so I forget, remind me. Okay.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,490
So before we get started, a couple of new students, can you just introduce yourself?

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,600
Um, hi, I'm Nora and Major MPH.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:26,880
Um, yeah, there is. I know this classes because I was taking your choice of six.

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,810
Is it six three. Yeah. 639.

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,270
Oh, yeah. So yeah. Okay. So nutrition student, right.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,640
Yeah. And you know everybody or many other people here and then I'm Tatyana.

9
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,570
Tatiana. Yes, I'm a second year MPH dietetics.

10
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:53,970
Okay. And then so everybody else, I'm going to be learning your names as we go through and remind me if I if I just point and just say,

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,410
oh, thanks also I'm because I forget and I've got to learn 15 new names this year.

12
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,299
Okay. So how do you do this?

13
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:12,120
How do you when you you are presented with a C of information, how do you make sense of it all?

14
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,040
And how do you interpret the information in a way that, um.

15
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,950
Provide some insight into whether or not it's useful.

16
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:33,860
This isn't easy. It's complicated. So today we're going to talk about developing strategies you can use to read research articles to help you

17
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:40,700
get through them more quickly and to find out what the hypothesis may be and what the main findings are.

18
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,400
I'm also going to talk about the peer review process,

19
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:56,370
the process by which manuscripts are submitted for publication in scientific journals and how that works.

20
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:07,740
And I'm going to hopefully help you develop some insight into some common flaws that are found in research studies and how they're interpreted.

21
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:18,150
And then there are there are ways that you can kind of reconcile discrepancies between different studies.

22
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:26,970
And but you have to always remember, in order to make appropriate interpretations of research,

23
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,720
you've got to go back to that original paper and you've got to look at the data.

24
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,620
Okay. Looking at the abstract provides an overview.

25
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,110
But in terms of the soundness of the study, you need to really critically evaluate it.

26
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:55,660
So with that in mind, you need to also understand how the lay public or of the general public might interpret a particular research article,

27
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,010
whether or not they appropriately interpret the information or whether it's distorted or whether the entire

28
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:09,610
study was distorted because there was a conflict of interest or an inappropriate subject population and so on.

29
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,500
So there's a lot of words here.

30
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:28,120
And what I want you to do is just to read this right now and then write down your interpretation of this study to give you a five, five or 10 minutes.

31
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:35,590
Just tell me if you need more time. Just read this really carefully and write down a one bullet point of how you interpret this study.

32
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:32,450
Anybody need more time? Remember, just one bullet point. She had a swing vote from 1 to 1.

33
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:41,370
Take home message with this. Okay.

34
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,610
But he had enough time. Just one bullet point, one take home message.

35
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:46,860
Okay.

36
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:58,910
So this is the graphical abstract for this particular study, and this is kind of another example that you can refer to for that particular assignment.

37
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:05,210
So here's the title of this paper.

38
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:11,450
Vitamin D and Luminescence Strong novel metabolites can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication machinery enzymes.

39
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:20,930
Okay, so the study started out with a bioinformatics approach, a virtual approach,

40
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:27,830
where they screened a bunch of different analogs and they were looking to see how well those analogs

41
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:35,450
would bind to a certain enzyme that's important for viral replication in the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

42
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:47,720
And after this, in Silico analysis or this virtual analysis, they came up with two different ten different compounds.

43
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:54,920
And they wanted to assess the ability of those compounds to inhibit the activity of these two key enzymes.

44
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:02,660
Once a protease one is for RNA replication. And so how did they do this?

45
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:10,969
Well, they looked at the critical binding sites within these particular enzymes,

46
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,920
and they tried to see which of these metabolites would fit into these binding sites.

47
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:24,589
And they came up with ten, and then they did some in vitro access where they took just the enzyme and those ten different analogs.

48
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:35,750
And we looked at the activity of the enzyme and they looked at inhibition of the enzymes with certain concentrations of these these analogs.

49
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,740
Okay. So that's the short that's the synopsis of this whole story.

50
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:48,670
All right. So. The question that I have based on this is,

51
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:57,819
does this mean if you take vitamin D supplements or expose yourself to UVB radiation where you could get UVB light,

52
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:07,000
where you would get naturally producing vitamin D within your body, could that prevent or treat COVID 19?

53
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:18,110
Okay. Why? Because we don't know.

54
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:30,690
If it's effective for. You can go, for know, regular access to this right here.

55
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,410
And if you're over seven. Yeah.

56
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:44,740
So you bring up some important issues, and it tells me you have a good grasp of micronutrients.

57
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:55,660
Does anybody here, has anybody here done any kind of in silico analysis for, um, substrate binding to enzymes based on kind of this?

58
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:03,730
No. So that's kind of got gobbledygook for many of us in terms of they say, but I'm going to walk you through this process.

59
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:09,050
So that's, you know, that's you're cautious and you're thinking critically about this.

60
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,090
That's great. Okay.

61
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:23,170
So anybody else have a take on this just from what we discussed in terms of does this mean that taking vitamin D supplements can have this effect?

62
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,080
Yeah. So general assumption would be if everybody has a normal vitamin.

63
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:38,580
When he say so, their levels of vitamin C will be adequate and the virus there is foolproof enough on that.

64
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,040
So that will be only a problem when someone is vitamin D deficiency.

65
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,740
Yeah. That's how they started with the. Okay. That that's that's another way to think about this.

66
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,600
Okay. So, yeah, it also is specific.

67
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,340
Terminology derivatives.

68
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:10,340
What do you mean? You don't know that just in general is going to have the effects that are explained or found in this study.

69
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,680
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Very good. So you're thinking about this critically.

70
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,720
That's really important. So let's walk through the rest of this and then we're going to come back to the study.

71
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:26,560
Okay. All right. So let's just start with the basics.

72
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,860
So there are many different types of publications.

73
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:40,870
There are publications from social media where you have somebody post a blog on a particular social media website.

74
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,200
These are really experts. They're self-proclaimed experts.

75
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:53,260
And you would be surprised at how many people rely on this kind of information to inform their decisions about what is important for health.

76
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,019
And then there are articles. There are newspapers that are printed online, posted online nowadays,

77
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:09,730
and other types of publications where you actually have a journalist who publishes this information.

78
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:18,040
They're not really experts either. And then you have other types of non peer reviewed reports from books.

79
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,250
Some are reputable, some aren't websites.

80
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:30,340
We have some editorials in some reputable publications, and then there's a more trusted source of information.

81
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:39,010
Because most of the time, evidence that's presented in a peer reviewed article has been carefully peer reviewed,

82
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,930
and we'll see that that's true here in a moment. So there are different types of publications.

83
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,750
There are review articles, which is a collection of papers.

84
00:13:50,200 --> 00:14:00,640
And based on that evidence, you could come up with some conclusions about recommendations for nutrition and immune response.

85
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:07,740
And in the case of this class, and there's a more critical analysis of these this type of information,

86
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:15,760
this would be the systematic review where you would take evidence from different papers and then you would weigh that evidence both for and against,

87
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:20,620
and then you would do an analysis to see if your collection of material was biased or not.

88
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:31,510
And then you would, in the conclusion, come up with a way to address the hypothesis of that particular systematic review.

89
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:39,640
But that could be a good one. An edited book chapter. You have an expert who's got a lot of experience in a particular area of research.

90
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:48,430
They put out a book chapter. And that's another type of a peer reviewed publication.

91
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:58,209
There are meta analyzes, which are a collection of studies that show a benefit or a no benefit in the case

92
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:04,270
of a dietary supplement or a dietary innovation other than the health outcome.

93
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:13,060
And in those types of publications, it's assumed that they're similar enough that where you can compare them and

94
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:20,050
look at the overall statistical differences and to weigh that type of evidence.

95
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:28,120
And then there are the original research articles where somebody actually does work

96
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:34,810
with a group of people and epidemiologic study a clinical study where there's a bunch

97
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:40,000
of patients that have a common illness and they're looking at whether or not different

98
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,460
treatments had a better as whether or not the patients had a better outcome or not.

99
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,750
And then there are studies done in animals and cell culture where you can get very,

100
00:15:52,750 --> 00:16:02,920
very specific and isolate a particular mechanism that test the hypothesis or that's part of the hypothesis processes or strengthens the hypothesis.

101
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:14,110
So peer review doesn't guarantee good science, however, for a number of reasons that we're going to go through.

102
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:23,500
So how would you think if this is supposed to be a systematic approach to doing research in terms of the peer reviewed publications?

103
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:32,260
How might someone's personal interest or biases affect some of these results in these types of articles?

104
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,980
How about a review paper, a collection of articles? You're going to be doing a mini review.

105
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:46,520
How would your biases affect that? Yeah, there are really, really big verticals that actually help your.

106
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,520
Yeah. That's right.

107
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,940
Yeah. How would you mediate that?

108
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:05,120
I work with a group of people, so they are going through different things.

109
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,760
And yeah, you could,

110
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:17,969
you could also in the initial part of the paper say you did a search on a

111
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,090
search engine and you put it in the following terms and this is what you got.

112
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:28,920
And you included a certain number of studies for a number of reasons, and you excluded others for, you know, whether or that reason may have been.

113
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,070
That's another way to kind of sift through that information.

114
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,900
Then there's the systematic review where you look to see if you're you're biased about this.

115
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,690
And in book chapters, you know, there can be some bias in that as well.

116
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,620
Meta analysis. You can be very selective on what you put in your meta analysis and what your exclusion and inclusion criteria are.

117
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:58,799
So that's another problematic issue. So how about original research articles?

118
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:07,040
How can they be biased? Yeah.

119
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:11,780
I feel like I'm one of the authors are going to prove their point.

120
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:20,680
Maybe I'd met some of like the like invalid results or don't they're going to try and.

121
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,340
I'm going to avoid talking about conflicts of interest and. So.

122
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:35,320
Right, we'll get to conflict of interest here in a minute, which needs to be declared every time, every time you give a paper or you give a talk.

123
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:42,200
So that's that's certainly an issue. But how would you how would you prevent that from happening?

124
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,540
What would you need to build into your studies to prevent that bias in an original research article?

125
00:18:49,400 --> 00:19:05,540
Like, build. Like, what do you mean, gold? So if you were let's say you were testing whether or not in this case, vitamin D and some of these luminal,

126
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:13,090
these other derivatives prevented or if you could treat SARS-CoV-2 with.

127
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:21,860
How would you how would you create a group of experiments to objectively test that hypothesis?

128
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,350
Um, and the sky's the limit here. Think of, you know, whatever you want.

129
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:35,810
What would you do? Like I would create do like, a series of experiments that, like whatever alternative idea that I can come up with,

130
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:43,700
which actually do my thoughts are being tested and include that in the experiment or like create a series of experiments.

131
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:52,610
So what would you do exactly? What would you do? Let's say you have a bunch of let's say you could you could ethically do this, right?

132
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,690
You could ethically expose people to SARS-CoV-2.

133
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,230
Right. How would you set up an experiment to see if vitamin D was doing anything like

134
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,960
give them supplements before or during and after they've been exposed to COVID?

135
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:17,870
Okay. Um, what would you use as a so that's your testing that the vitamin D now, what would you use as a negative control for that?

136
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:23,750
And people who are not being exposed as well and not taking the supplement.

137
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:28,690
Yeah. Like a series of people who haven't done nothing, spoke with them about.

138
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,260
Okay. And then there was a comment and I was just going to say a control group.

139
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:41,570
Yeah. Control group. So what else would you have in that experiment?

140
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:47,060
So you have you have people who are getting vitamin D, maybe different doses and people who aren't.

141
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:52,690
Who else would you put in that group? In a study.

142
00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:02,290
Abby. I feel like you could make that like. According to studies, how you would want to remove bias certain?

143
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:10,140
Certainly you would he would do these experiments and you would give everybody either a placebo or a vitamin D,

144
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:17,160
and then you wouldn't know who was getting the supplement or who was vitamin D deficient.

145
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,760
Um, that's a, that's a way to build this and to objectively test this hypothesis.

146
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:30,840
Um, but what else? Can I just you have a comment.

147
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,520
You can just going up there a minute.

148
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:47,370
So, yeah, I think I agree with, um, I was, I think I was mostly thinking of like, oh, where instead of maybe thinking of a trial,

149
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:52,280
but I don't know if you would be able to find like a pretty small group that thinks.

150
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,410
Supplements the. Yeah.

151
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:05,480
You can follow them for a long time to see which ones or the severity of the infection or if they get infected.

152
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:11,749
Yeah, that's more of a real world scenario where you you couldn't do what we're just talking about ethically,

153
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,960
but you could you could do that type of an approach. Okay.

154
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:22,040
So the important thing to look for, the point of all of this is when you look at original research, you want to look for controls.

155
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,880
Okay. Look to see if that process to test the hypothesis makes sense.

156
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:38,149
Um, so it'll take a bit of time for you to focus on what the hypothesis or find the hypothesis and then

157
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:43,940
see whether or not the methods or the approach that they're using is going to test that hypothesis.

158
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:54,900
Okay. So the point here is to actively read the research papers.

159
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:03,990
Yeah, you can. You can look at the main conclusions and look at the abstract, like actively read the paper.

160
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:14,640
So. So when you're reading research articles, your approach is going to depend on your knowledge of that particular area.

161
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,350
Now, the stuff that I showed you today was out of outside of everybody's area.

162
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:29,070
You know, what Vitamin D does. And some of you have a fairly strong background in, you know, issues related to vitamin D supplementation.

163
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:36,960
But this is going to affect your. Your knowledge is going to affect your interest and your level of engagement.

164
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,410
And then once people start, oh, vitamin D, that's really interesting.

165
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:46,500
You start really reading it and you think, and so I can take a virtual approach, and that's weird.

166
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:54,750
And then you look at, you know, substrate binding experiments and enzyme activity and people lose interest and they disengage.

167
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:04,920
And you've got to stay engaged and active and just look at this from a more of a strategic vantage.

168
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:12,839
What was the hypothesis and how was that tested and how was how were the results interpreted?

169
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:22,399
So keep that in mind. So yeah, the all of this relates to what I just said in terms of your your engagement,

170
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,240
your interest, your motivation for reading that particular paper.

171
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:37,970
So you're going to be when you read a paper that the methods can be daunting.

172
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:45,440
Okay. So it may be interested you might be interested in reading the methods critically,

173
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,360
but if it's something outside of your area, it's going to complicate things.

174
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:56,690
So using a systematic approach is going to be helpful. So here's here's a suggestion.

175
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:04,250
So as you're looking for papers and you're going to be doing this when you're going to be choosing a paper for your presentation.

176
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,120
Which reminds me, I need to circulate a Google doc for sign up.

177
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:22,840
For student presentations. With the calendar.

178
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:27,250
I was supposed to do that today. I will do that right after class.

179
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:35,590
So how many of you know how to use PubMed search engine to find articles who really know how to do that?

180
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:46,690
You can also use Google Scholar. Or you can just put a search term into Google and it will give you some references.

181
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:56,420
And sometimes you can get find things through pop band that you can't find through Google and vice versa.

182
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,420
So you had to have a broad search.

183
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:07,120
So you actively look at a title and see whether or not it grabs your interest and whether or not you're going to bother even to look at the abstract.

184
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:21,339
It depends on what you're interested in. So you read the abstract and this gives you some an overview of what the hypothesis, the methods,

185
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:29,080
the results and the conclusions were to that particular paper, which are discussed in the discussion part of the abstract.

186
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:37,990
Then if you're real interested, you'll read the introduction section which provides you some background.

187
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,230
What's known and why is what they're studying important?

188
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:51,100
And then you look for within the introduction, if it's something that you find very interesting.

189
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,270
Look for the purpose statement.

190
00:26:52,990 --> 00:27:02,080
Look for why they're doing this study, and look for maybe a hypothesis statement somewhere or a goal of the particular paper.

191
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:07,660
And this is going to serve as an anchor for the entire study.

192
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:13,810
The entire study will be built around the purpose statement that you can find within the introduction.

193
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:22,490
Sometimes it's so clear that it seems redundant after reading the abstract, you find it again in the introduction.

194
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,460
Oh yeah, I knew that. And then look at the results.

195
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:36,430
Look at the data. Look at the tables. And then. And many times you have to look at this really carefully and with a critical eye.

196
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:45,550
I find terribly, terribly distracting and confusing, especially epi papers.

197
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:49,690
United can attest to this, right? What are we looking at now?

198
00:27:49,720 --> 00:28:01,540
I mean, you have to go back and forth maybe to the methods and the description of the tables and figures to really decide what the data is.

199
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:07,300
So and again, if it's something you're not familiar with, you might just blow it up.

200
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:11,020
It's like, I don't want to read this paper. This is just not my thing.

201
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,210
But if it's something you're interested in, it might drive you to learn something new.

202
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,799
Look at the methods section. See if you understand them. See if they're appropriate.

203
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:29,660
Methods to test the hypothesis are used to test hypotheses and then the discussion section if you get there.

204
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:36,920
And again, it depends on your level of engagement. This will we'll talk about the conclusions of the paper.

205
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,880
It'll give you the author's interpretation of the results,

206
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:53,330
and it'll also provide you with some rationale for their interpretation as they discuss the results.

207
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,310
And then they'll give you some references throughout the paper.

208
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:06,320
And the references basically kind of draw you back to the introduction and hypothesis, what's known.

209
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:11,750
Here's, here's our experiment. We tested this idea and here's what we found.

210
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:17,180
And this is how it relates to other papers in the area of whether there was agreement, disagreement,

211
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:33,560
and sometimes within a paper near the introduction, you'll see a little like a plaque or a shortened bullet group of bullet statements.

212
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:42,490
What's known in this area and how does this paper address what's not knowing what it is it brings to the table?

213
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,830
How is this paper relevant in terms of the big scheme of things?

214
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:53,090
Not all journals do this, the better ones do so.

215
00:29:53,150 --> 00:30:04,400
And right now you're going to see a lot more papers asking the authors to provide a graphical abstract because that's engaging pictures tell a story,

216
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,530
and that's why I wanted you to do that.

217
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:18,200
As part of your assignments, it grabs your interest that the more appealing, the greater the level of engagement.

218
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:27,200
Okay. And then finally in at the end of the paper,

219
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:36,500
you look for some kind of a conclusion statement and you want to know if that connects back to the purpose statement.

220
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:40,130
So you're essentially forming a loop here.

221
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:46,849
You've you've had a lot of time devoted to if you've gotten that far in the

222
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:52,010
paper and you're hoping to see that it connects with the purpose statement.

223
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,230
All right. Okay.

224
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,420
So outside, if you're looking at if you're going through a journal,

225
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:08,680
let's say you're looking at the Journal of the Academy and Nutrition and Dietetics and you're just kind of flipping through.

226
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:14,110
And you might have a very different approach where you're looking for titles that might pull you in,

227
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:18,820
you might read the abstract to kind of get an overall view of the paper.

228
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,750
You might look more closely to find a purpose statement,

229
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,760
and then you might jump right away to the conclusion or discussion section to see if

230
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,020
there's a connection between that purpose statement and the very end of the paper.

231
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:41,350
Okay. And that might be a strategy that you could use when you're looking for papers for presentation in this class.

232
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:50,800
Okay. To look look at the titles. Look at journals that you normally read and look at the purpose statement.

233
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,360
And the methods might seem overwhelming or not clear to you at present,

234
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:02,350
but if you find the conclusion and discussion are really interesting, that might drive your interest to learning more about the methods.

235
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,659
Okay, it's going to stretch you, but it's a way to learn.

236
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,810
And it gives you. All right.

237
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,910
And then in terms of looking at the figures and tables, again,

238
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:21,880
if this is a if this is thing outside of your area of interest, this can be really confusing.

239
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:25,540
And you might not even spend a whole lot of time studying this.

240
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:33,640
And less and less that that conclusion statement, that discussion of that particular paper, that interpretation is so compelling.

241
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,280
You want to learn how they reached that conclusion. Okay.

242
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,630
And then you've got to ask yourself at the very end, what are the take home points?

243
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,300
Why is this paper new? Why did they bother doing these these studies?

244
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:56,390
Okay. So before we get into the review process processes, anybody have any questions?

245
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:02,060
Is this something you've already discussed in other classes or is this all new to you?

246
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:09,460
Yeah. What's that? It's a mixed bag. Okay.

247
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,230
You've heard it. You've heard this version in different ways. Yeah.

248
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:19,930
Okay. All right. So how many of you are familiar with the peer review process?

249
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:25,870
Okay. A couple of hands and think maybe I've had experience with that peer review process.

250
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:32,800
So you have a scientist and she's been working for a number of years to get her data.

251
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:41,710
Or she has access to the data set. And she and her colleagues complete the study.

252
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,820
They write it up together. They bounce ideas off one another.

253
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:54,880
And they format their particular manuscript and they choose a journal to publish it in.

254
00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:00,340
Now, the journal says you choose to publish. It is a it's not a trivial decision.

255
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:11,590
You want your manuscript to reach a certain audience, and that audience would be a colleague in a similar department.

256
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:18,549
Or it could be you're doing some more basic research and you'd like on people who are on the

257
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:23,740
clinical end of things to read your paper to see if there's any application in the real world.

258
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:32,530
So those are all different reasons why you would submit your manuscript to a particular journal.

259
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:44,770
So when you send your manuscript to a journal and every journal has an editor, an editor could review every single paper themself,

260
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:53,380
or they can have some administrative assistance with some scientific training and background.

261
00:34:54,160 --> 00:35:03,069
Who can help with this decision process to see whether or not that particular manuscript goes

262
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:10,390
to the next step or it goes right back to the scientists in the form of a rejection letter.

263
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:17,470
Okay. The harder, the more impactful the journal, the more frequently this happens.

264
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:28,960
So some of the high end journals in health sciences, the New England Journal of Medicine for Basic Science excel in Science and Nature.

265
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:32,790
This happens most of the time, like 95% of the time.

266
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:40,860
This is what happens. Okay. So you submit to another journal.

267
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:45,660
Perhaps it's not as difficult to get a paper accepted in that particular journal,

268
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:50,280
and it gets past the the journal editor and it goes to the associate editor.

269
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,569
Okay. Now,

270
00:35:51,570 --> 00:36:02,730
the associate editor is the Journal editor might have experienced strong a strong background in one particular area and have some broad knowledge.

271
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:08,730
But it's the associate editors that are many of them, that cover particular areas of interest.

272
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:21,030
So if it were a nutrition journal, you'd have one editor and you'd have a bunch of associate editors that are some have experienced in immunology,

273
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:26,430
some had experience in vitamin D and so on. So those are the types of people who would be associate editors.

274
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,150
And in many times the paper gets rejected.

275
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:40,919
It's either not appropriate for that particular journal or the associate editor

276
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,060
doesn't think it's going to survive the review process when it gets to the next step.

277
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:56,169
Okay. So the scientists reformat the manuscript to fit the format for another journal, and they submit it again.

278
00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:02,230
And this time it gets past the editor and the associate and it goes to three reviewers.

279
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:11,530
So the three reviewers are experts in a particular area that have a greater level of expertize than just the associate editor.

280
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:18,250
And they're at different institutions, then the principal author on the paper.

281
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,740
So there's no conflict of interest there.

282
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:31,990
So if anybody sends me a review papers all the time, if anybody sends me a paper from a colleague at the University of Michigan,

283
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:35,770
I send it back and right away and say, no, I can't review this.

284
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:44,169
There's a conflict of interest. Okay. So you want these reviewers to be people that you probably don't know.

285
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:49,900
And the actually that the scientists can recommend reviewers to do the review for them.

286
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:57,970
And they would recommend people not based on friends and colleagues who might give them a more favorable review,

287
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:06,640
but people who have expertize and knowledge in that area and the reviewers review the paper.

288
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,219
And what the associate editor does is he reads the overall comments,

289
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:19,930
and then there are specific comments that can be major or minor, and then you can have that paper rejected at that level.

290
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:25,149
So this is see, there is one rejection. There are two rejections here and now three rejections.

291
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:34,030
And this is not unusual for people to have a paper rejected three times before they find a journal that will accept their paper.

292
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,469
Okay. And this takes. Yeah, sure. I'm going very particular question.

293
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:42,910
Are you able to tell apart which point your paper was rejected?

294
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:48,910
Like if it was like right off the bat, like with a journal editor or if you went to the reviewers?

295
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:53,860
Yes, it depends on how quickly it comes back to you and what the comments are.

296
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:59,800
If the comments come from three different people and they say a reviewer, one reviewer or two reviewer three.

297
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,630
Then it got to this level.

298
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:11,680
But if it comes back right away, they will they should probably mention that, you know, our editorial board looked at it or ah, I'm sure I'm sorry.

299
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:18,640
I heard our editor and our associate editor decided that it wasn't appropriate for this particular journal or not of interest.

300
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:24,080
Okay. Many times.

301
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:34,650
Most of the time, if you pick the right journal and you pick the right reviewers and your science is strong, you'll get a revise and resubmit.

302
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,080
And this happens most of the time.

303
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:50,490
I think I published 70% something papers and once or twice did I submit it once and it was accepted after that without revision.

304
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:54,720
That happened to me once, every other time.

305
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,960
It was revise and resubmit. Okay.

306
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:07,440
So you look at the comments from the reviewers and you might add additional experiments which can take a time.

307
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,370
It can take up to a year. Some journals put a time limit on that.

308
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:19,860
They say, okay, reviewers, if you're going to suggest additional experiments, can it be something that can be completed within six months?

309
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:29,310
And sometimes it can't. So those are some of the limitations put on the reviewers in terms of how critical they are.

310
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:39,810
And so you go back and you revise and resubmit that manuscript, and there's a revised manuscript that goes through the same process.

311
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:49,590
The reviewers now should be looking at what they stated specifically with what they wanted to see revised or changed.

312
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:54,270
They should not introduce new things that would cause the paper to be rejected.

313
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:02,399
Sometimes a reviewer will look at somebody else's criticism and say, You know, I should have mentioned that too.

314
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,670
And I completely forgot. And I reviewed if I'm a reviewer.

315
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:13,590
Three Yeah, I agree with a reviewer, number one. And if that issue wasn't corrected, I would not be inclined to accept this paper as well.

316
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,260
And the reviewer has to explain that to the editor.

317
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:26,939
And so they get their comments answered and the reviewers review again and they send it to the associate editor.

318
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:38,730
And there's more questions that have to be addressed. And the authors revise and resubmit again and the paper gets published.

319
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:47,820
And who do you think pays for the publication, The Journal or the authors?

320
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,600
You know, and you have some experience with this and so on.

321
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:02,200
It's open access. Usually it's the research group or the PR people who pay for it.

322
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:07,180
If not, then the figures that you're going to publish it in the.

323
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:15,370
The research group doesn't have any charge, but they relinquish their rights to using the paper without differentiation.

324
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:21,730
So yeah. So it's most of the time the author pays for the publication fees.

325
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:32,620
So a paper to get it published to get through this process can cost, you know, $500, $2,000, 1500 dollars.

326
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:38,860
And for some of the higher end journals like Nature Itself, it can be as much as $10,000.

327
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,290
So there's a lot at stake here when you go through this process.

328
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:48,910
Not only is your productivity, your reputation, but it's going to cost.

329
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:52,230
It's going to take time and money to get these things published. Okay.

330
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:59,379
And, yes, if you if you if you have an open access, if you go through these journals and you see,

331
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:04,300
oh, it's open access, that means that everybody can see that.

332
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:10,150
Right. Right now, the University of Michigan, we have subscriptions to thousands of different journals.

333
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:16,450
And we can see all of these papers. But people who don't have that access, they just get the abstract.

334
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,780
Okay. And then you would have to pay extra to download that paper.

335
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:29,320
And the way you would know this is if you tried to download a paper at home from your computer without logging into the university site.

336
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:35,170
Okay. So the open access fee can be 2 to $3000.

337
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:43,440
That's not unusual. The point here is that, you know, there's a lot at stake here as this process goes on now.

338
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:48,469
All right. So where do you and I mentioned some of these,

339
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:56,660
but where do you see potential cracks in the system that can compromise this objectivity of this review process?

340
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:03,340
Yeah. I've seen the one would be.

341
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,330
Oh, I know this associate editor.

342
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:14,149
So even though they're not on the same location, on the same university,

343
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:17,479
but they know each other, they send the papers like, oh, yeah, that's my friend.

344
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,830
Sure. Yeah, I'll send that along. Yes. One way. Yeah. How about anybody?

345
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:27,840
Anybody else? Yeah. And also, you mentioned about the bias of interest.

346
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:33,320
So maybe you like the idea. If it's not interesting to them, it's true.

347
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:39,719
Yeah, exactly. If they're not interested in that subject matter, they don't think it's appropriate for their journal.

348
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,530
They may reject it outright, regardless of how good the science is.

349
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:53,400
Anybody else? Yeah. Kind of relate to that. You just didn't pick the right journal to have your research published.

350
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,990
Yeah. And then you can say, oh, I guess if they don't want it, that must not be a good research.

351
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:05,680
Yeah, that could be. That could be an interpretation. Could have a negative view of your own work as a consequence of that response.

352
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:15,460
Yeah, I have another one. Yeah. So I wonder if the reviewer also sees that paper as like a competition and has some interest because.

353
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:21,340
Yeah. Yes. That that that that does happen.

354
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:30,129
And worse yet. So if your your associated or your your editor works in the same area and you

355
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:35,800
publish something that they would like to have published a very similar paper,

356
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:43,210
but maybe it has a different twist to it. And if your paper gets published, it would diminish their work.

357
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:55,989
And that happens all the time as well. And sometimes the editor or the associate editor can steal your ideas and use them for their research and say,

358
00:45:55,990 --> 00:46:01,090
Oh, you know, we just read their paper, we didn't steal your your research.

359
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:03,640
And that that kind of thing can happen as well.

360
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:10,630
So this is what's always going on when you're opening these papers and you're thinking, oh, here's a paper, this is interesting.

361
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:17,300
This is all going on in the background. Okay. All right.

362
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:22,950
So we talked about some common floss, floss research articles.

363
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:31,200
Here are some points that I want to make. The conclusions aren't well supported by the data presented, and this can be brought up by the reviewers.

364
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:41,820
And this is this is fairly common. So you might have a claim, cause or effect based on a correlational data.

365
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:47,100
Okay. You make a broad health claim based on one particular outcome.

366
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:54,960
And here's an example of this. You have some kind of an intervention in a group of subjects or an animal model,

367
00:46:55,350 --> 00:47:06,840
and you find that your intervention lowered down low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and you conclude that your intervention prevents heart disease.

368
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:15,110
Can you make that conclusion based on that kind of information? Okay.

369
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:20,980
That's a stretch. You would have to then if you wanted to make that conclusion.

370
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:30,160
You'd have to try the intervention in either an animal model or a human subjects and follow them over a period of time.

371
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:35,200
And to see whether or not that intervention actually prevented heart disease.

372
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:40,600
Or in a mouse model, prevented some kind of endpoint that you can measure that's relevant to human heart disease.

373
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:47,560
Okay. So your follow up times for these types of studies, intervention studies can be a very long time.

374
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:55,000
Generally, are you familiar with anybody who does these long term interventions that would test something like this?

375
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,180
Prospective studies interventions. Yeah.

376
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:03,910
With interventions usually, I think.

377
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:11,560
Yeah. Yes. Because you could be waiting decades before you see this kind of an outcome.

378
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:23,440
So you get a data set and you rely on people that came before you who have collected all of this information to do this kind of research.

379
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:31,040
Right. Okay. So you can overinterpret the results.

380
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:38,930
You could in the case of vitamin D, right. This is a perfect example if you could overinterpret those results.

381
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:44,240
The study design doesn't really test the hypothesis.

382
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:49,970
There are methods that were weak and that didn't test the primary outcomes.

383
00:48:50,730 --> 00:49:00,200
You didn't have appropriate statistical power. So the point I want to make here is that with human studies, there's a lot of variability.

384
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:07,150
There's a huge amount of variability. So you need two large numbers at various events with animal studies,

385
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:18,650
a lot of times you're just looking at one variable and you get genetically identical mice born within a week's period of time,

386
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:29,000
but that they're the same age and they're housed under exactly the same conditions and they're fed the same type of food their entire lives.

387
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,060
And you're testing one variable, okay,

388
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:41,930
in those cases you can get away with and then a five risk group with human studies where there's a lot more variability,

389
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:48,470
you're going to need a bigger sample size. And if the effect that you're looking at is subtle,

390
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:54,379
you're going to need an enormous number of participants in that study your numbers of subjects

391
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:58,940
in the study to be able to show whether or not there's a difference or a trend for a difference.

392
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:05,910
Okay. There's often discrepancies between studies.

393
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:14,730
This is very common. And how do you make conclusions with this kind of research?

394
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:22,830
In other words, you can find one study that says vitamin D prevents the severity of the common cold.

395
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,540
And then you find another study that says we didn't find a difference.

396
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,920
How do you account for this discrepancy?

397
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:50,120
What would you do? How would you how would you look to see if you were at the studies or actually testing the same thing?

398
00:50:56,010 --> 00:51:05,100
When we look at the sample because of this sample population is different than it problem like [INAUDIBLE] like this.

399
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:14,340
Yes it could. The sample population is very important, but how would you describe a difference that's relevant?

400
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:23,080
Kind of what we've what we've already talked about when we talking about vitamin D.

401
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:37,770
So let me put this in. Describe this in a way that may be more relatable to everybody.

402
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:45,270
How many of you take what's that vitamin C supplement that everybody takes nowadays?

403
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:49,620
Emergency. Emergency. How many of you take emergency?

404
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:54,780
There's no shaming here. It's just. It's just me. I take it I can take it up.

405
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,930
A multivitamin. See? You know, buddy boy, we get a bunch of people.

406
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:02,220
So you can take different doses.

407
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:10,110
You can take the supplement on a daily basis or just when you start to feel sick.

408
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:16,110
Your symptoms might be different than your symptoms.

409
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:21,600
Your runny nose might be. You have to blow your nose every 5 minutes.

410
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:32,880
Yours might be twice a day. Your you might have a completely genetic different genetic background, a different age, a different a different sex.

411
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:42,059
Your propensity to get the common cold is limited because you you're you're you're

412
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:46,950
stuck at home and you do all your work on your computer being in isolation.

413
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:51,960
Right? Whereas another person might be in a crowd of people all the time.

414
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:54,570
So they're more likely to get the common cold.

415
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:01,410
So these are the kinds of things that might explain some of the discrepancies between these types of studies.

416
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:18,930
Okay. So the other thing is the tools that are used to assess the particular nutritional exposure, let's say it's through your diet.

417
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:26,370
Let's say you're trying to measure an immune response or something in immune function or you're trying to look at a model system.

418
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:34,650
How how is dietary intake assessed and how accurate is it?

419
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:41,820
So I have here an example of a dietary assessment tool is called the Food Frequency Questionnaire.

420
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:51,660
And how many are you familiar with? How many of you have done this? Okay, Hyla, so I'm going to I'm going to read this really quick.

421
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:57,120
And you can you can kind of fill in the blanks that I don't cover here. So this is an example.

422
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:03,750
You had a group of people and you wanted to find if a particular dietary exposure was relevant, you would walk through this.

423
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:09,870
You would give people this food frequency questionnaire, and this can be done on their own.

424
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:21,690
Or you can have an interviewer walk them through this process and you have foods and amounts of meat, fish, beef, beef burgers.

425
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:28,740
Average use last year, never one or three per month.

426
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:33,900
Once a week, 2 to 4 times per week, 5 to 6 times per week.

427
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:41,370
Once a day. 2 to 3 times a day. 4 to 5 times a day or more than six times a day.

428
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:50,040
How many of you remember how many times you consumed any kind of beef during the last year?

429
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:59,350
If don't know. Right. There are other ways to assess dietary intake and this is a common one that's used.

430
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:09,220
But okay, you can't remember. Could you also have problems in remembering the amount that you've consumed?

431
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:17,260
Yeah. So that's problematic. So that's a significant limitation when you look at these studies.

432
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:26,630
So it can lead to erroneous conclusion, like eating or drinking.

433
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:36,370
All of these things are linked to one's religion or dog ownership or smoking and energy drinks and potato chips and higher score in the S.A.T.

434
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:41,500
Wouldn't that be great? Eat more potato chips. You score higher on the standardized test.

435
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:49,420
So these are the kinds of conclusions that can be drawn erroneously from these kinds of studies.

436
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:58,590
Okay. So keep that in mind. So it's really hard to control for differences in eating.

437
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:09,420
It's really hard to find solid evidence for a particular consumption of a micronutrient unless you look at another kind of a thing,

438
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:16,350
which would be biomarkers which would say, oh, this person says they eat carrots every day.

439
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:22,920
We've we've got a sample of their blood. That's true. Their carotenoid levels would be at a certain level.

440
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:30,959
And you can verify that food frequency questionnaire or assessment tool to see if they've really you know,

441
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:36,720
there's evidence that that that might be very true. Okay. So that's a way to validate some of these methods.

442
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:40,830
But controlling for eating is really hard.

443
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:46,890
Okay. There are intrinsic differences between people and dietary exposures.

444
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:55,380
They might be eating the same thing, but their immune system may function very differently depending on all of the things you talked about already.

445
00:56:55,390 --> 00:57:04,650
So that's another variable that you've got to consider. So there are big differences within different groups,

446
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:09,360
even though you're trying to control for sex and racial background and other types of differences.

447
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:17,460
There are also inherent biases among the participants and the researchers that can skew the outcomes.

448
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:28,350
So, for example, if we if we all respond to antigens, in this case, it's a protein action that might be relevant to an allergy.

449
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:33,790
There's often some level of expertize associated with our past experiences.

450
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:43,110
So if you're looking at a group of people and you're trying to decide people's reactions to gluten,

451
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:50,970
let's say their diet, those negative experiences with people who have a sensitivity or celiac disease,

452
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:59,100
that exposure, that knowledge can skew this type of information that you're trying to get from this cohort of individuals.

453
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:07,820
All right. So coping with discrepancies, you just don't count studies.

454
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:16,340
These studies agree and these studies disagree in the case of vitamin C and whether or not it does anything for the common cold,

455
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:26,180
you have to look at the papers. But this can be overwhelming because you can have different methods and subjects and propose mechanisms.

456
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:33,170
You might want to double check how different authors interpret this data.

457
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:36,470
You might want to look at the quality of the journal. But be careful.

458
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:41,960
There are bad papers published in good journals and good papers published in bad journals.

459
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,300
So that's something you need to be aware of.

460
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:59,730
It helps to have an evidence based hypothesis to draw on using the example of an intervention that lowers LDL cholesterol.

461
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:10,170
If a if an approach is used so people consume a particular food item or engage in a particular lifestyle intervention,

462
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:14,460
and it has a robust effect on lowering that.

463
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:19,110
And then you follow up that group in five years and see who gets cardiovascular disease.

464
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:23,130
That is evidence to strengthen your hypothesis.

465
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:31,770
Don't be so quick to jump to your own biases. This happens all the time.

466
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:35,279
Be open minded and let the data tally.

467
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:43,140
Paint a picture for you and describe everything that you see, things that are significant, things that are aren't significant,

468
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:49,770
and things that where there are trends or significance, whether or not there are real differences between your groups.

469
00:59:52,260 --> 01:00:00,510
So you want to be open minded about your hypothesis. So I'm going to I'm going to give you an example here.

470
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:05,940
So what are some big, important, interesting research questions about nutrition and immune response?

471
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:16,349
Well, can a food or a nutrient or a supplement or a diet prevent infection from COVID 19 or

472
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:24,060
reduce cancer risk or improve symptoms associated with asthma or reduce inflammation?

473
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:30,840
Is there something to that anti-inflammatory diet or a diet that's pro-inflammatory?

474
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:35,160
The previous version of this I showed you a meta analysis,

475
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:42,000
and it depends on how you interpret the study, and it depends on what you consider inflammatory.

476
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:47,520
Okay. There's a lot of different ways to interpret that information, which is very confusing and complicated.

477
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:59,250
So what factors underlie why a specific diet would reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in some people, but not others?

478
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:04,290
And sometimes when you're doing population studies, this is really hard to determine.

479
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:15,419
But if you have some information on smaller groups of people and that your sample isn't big enough to show those differences,

480
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:23,130
or you've got a different group of people than some of the original research was conducted, that can be difficult to interpret.

481
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:39,050
So if you wanted to test whether a specific lifestyle program reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, what might be an ideal study design?

482
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:42,980
And don't worry about the characteristics.

483
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:50,770
How many subjects would you need? How do you figure that out?

484
01:01:50,770 --> 01:02:00,810
Even how many subjects you. In L.A., you know,

485
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:08,649
you'd have to go to all the studies that have found associations between like are there interventions of

486
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:18,280
a regular like a specific lifestyle and cardiovascular disease to see what the magnitude of the effects.

487
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:22,750
Yeah. Now, with your population, see what sample size you could at least study?

488
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:29,580
Yeah. And what else would you need to know? Yeah.

489
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:34,740
So if their populations are comparable, similar background or similarly.

490
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:37,120
Yeah. But in the power calculation,

491
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:46,059
you need to know the variability of that so that the standard deviation or the standard error mean between the different outcomes.

492
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:49,060
Right. The statistical differences, yes.

493
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:56,469
How big they are and how much variability there was. And you take all that information and you put it into a power analysis and you come

494
01:02:56,470 --> 01:03:01,300
up with a number and you tell that you have an equation and they'll tell you,

495
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:06,939
okay, I want a certain level of power where if I have a certain number of people or

496
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:09,820
how much for how many people are going to need to see this level of difference.

497
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:15,040
And that's a way to get an estimate of how many subjects you're going to need.

498
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:32,570
How long would it last? So you have a group of participants and they put in a different intervention.

499
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:42,410
And how far into the future are you going to do follow ups and how old are the individuals going to be?

500
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:45,270
Who are the individuals?

501
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:53,920
You certainly want to wait for a significant amount of time in terms of when people actually start getting into vascular disease.

502
01:03:54,010 --> 01:04:02,700
Like, don't just stop when a couple of people have it. There's a wide variety of age of ages where people can start vascular disease and also

503
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:08,580
prefer start as young as possible so that you can control for as many other variables.

504
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:12,990
Okay, so how long would you follow up?

505
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:19,620
Ideally, maybe five decades.

506
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:24,540
Yeah. So there are these cohorts of people that are in these different groups,

507
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:33,629
the Framingham Study, the study of women across the nation who are in these studies.

508
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:37,920
And they're they're being followed for decades, maybe some of them for their entire lives.

509
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:44,670
And they're asking these kinds of questions. Some of them are just observational, and some of them are they're looking at interventions.

510
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:48,989
And then you're going to have to assess adherence to the intervention.

511
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:54,990
Intervention, right. How well they're adhering to that intervention.

512
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:02,490
If it's a supplement, how would you how would you measure adherence or if it's a particular diet?

513
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:10,230
How would you measure adherence? They say I follow a mediterranean diet and that's why I'm healthy.

514
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:17,290
How would you how would you determine whether or not they're adhering to that? Yeah.

515
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:22,300
You're going to need a food log. And if it's a supplement, how else can you assess adherence?

516
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:29,760
But what's that? What's that? You could do the test.

517
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:35,069
You had to see how much vitamin D's in their blood. Or you can make them visit you to get that supplement.

518
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:42,300
You can watch them take it. It's another thing that can be done, and then you'd have to decide what measurements you're going to take.

519
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:47,220
They end up in the hospital with a heart attack. What else could you do?

520
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:58,820
The outcome is cardiovascular disease. What else could you do?

521
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:08,420
So you can have the follow up being so many years after the initiation of intervention,

522
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:13,170
having regular checkups and somebody might not have overt symptoms,

523
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:20,069
but they might have an abnormally CG, they might experience chest pains, but it's kind of mild.

524
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:28,770
They don't need to go to see their doctor. They may have had some symptoms that don't register as a cardiovascular disease issue.

525
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:36,690
And a way to screen for this is to have regular checkups and then you'd want to have an assessment, the measurements.

526
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:43,120
What kind of things would you measure? Just in general, not specifics in general.

527
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:50,090
Excess in this economic status, maybe where we live.

528
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:55,690
Yeah. So that those factors could influence the the intervention.

529
01:06:56,230 --> 01:07:00,400
What in terms of the measurements, what are you looking for?

530
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,280
You're looking for things that can affect the outcome.

531
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:13,470
So risk factors, right. All kinds of things related to the diagnosis of diabetes.

532
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:20,160
Yeah. Yes, exactly. Health conditions that can result in cardiovascular disease.

533
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:25,950
And there are a lot of other things, as you mentioned. Okay. So conflicts of interest.

534
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:32,520
So there are some there are many conflicts of interest depending on who has funding your study,

535
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:39,750
depending on the reviewers, the person's biases, who are conducting the study.

536
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:51,510
And they can be overt or they can be subtle. And how would you assess a conflict of interest or a scientific research and real articles?

537
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:03,910
Reading the paper and where would you find who funded the study?

538
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:10,580
Where did you find that information? In the acknowledgments section.

539
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:13,520
Look at the acknowledgments section. Who funded the study?

540
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:19,700
You might want to look to see if there's any declared conflicts many journals nowadays require.

541
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:22,100
When you submit the paper, you declare conflicts.

542
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:37,070
Do you have investments in a particular company that produces a good a service or dietary supplement in which you're studying?

543
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:44,600
And if you have more than 5% of your investment in that particular item, that could be a conflict.

544
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:53,990
If you hold the patent in that particular intervention idea or supplement, that's a conflict of interest that needs to be declared.

545
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:58,460
It doesn't mean you shouldn't do the research and you can't believe whatever that person says.

546
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:05,420
It means that you should be aware that there could be a conflict of interest for later articles.

547
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:10,730
How would you know if there was a conflict of interest? So.

548
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:15,890
So scientific papers has to be in the acknowledgments section has to be declared.

549
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:23,780
How about articles? Necessarily be there.

550
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:29,660
Yeah. We'd have to do some intelligence gathering.

551
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:35,360
Who is this person? I think a journalist. What might be their biases?

552
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:39,590
And the way to figure that out is to see what they've written in the past.

553
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:46,100
See, you can easily find information on their sources in regard to their social media engagement.

554
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:55,490
What do they support? What are they against? That kind of information can inform whether or not there's bias with a journalist in a particular layer.

555
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:04,430
Okay. And the way to keep conflicts in check is to declare them upfront.

556
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,880
Here are my biases I own. I've given talks for this farm suitable company.

557
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:17,070
I get a certain dollar amount from this particular company to do this research,

558
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:22,370
and those are the kinds of things that you can use to declare your conflicts.

559
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:34,370
All right. So you might see health claims and a particular item and what the the FDA tries to do if there's a health claim.

560
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:37,940
There's an attempt to regulate these claims.

561
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:47,960
And this is based on this in table here, where you have a scientific ranking level of scientific evidence and the FDA category.

562
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:55,310
So if there is the first level of evidence, which would be category A,

563
01:10:55,610 --> 01:11:02,030
the claims are category eight claims are unqualified claims supported by

564
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:05,810
evidence that meet the current standards for significant scientific agreement.

565
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:08,900
And then the claims get weaker from there.

566
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:16,340
And then although the scientific evidence supporting this claim, the evidence is not conclusive and then it gets weaker down there.

567
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:23,300
So in terms of the FDA regulating health claims, if there's a health claim,

568
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:29,810
it would fall in one of these categories and the highest level of evidence would be that high, that category.

569
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:37,550
And that's what you'd want to look for. This is not always declared okay, especially if it's a supplement.

570
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:48,110
Supplements aren't food. They're not regulated. Most of them make kind of fuzzy claims such that they don't fall under the purview of the FDA.

571
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:50,840
And here's a classic example.

572
01:11:50,850 --> 01:12:02,480
This is as I can you can still actually find this, but in this particular supplement, it's a nasal swab and it contain this zinc gluconate gel.

573
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:10,010
And you could also take zinc cam lozenges that contain zinc.

574
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:19,970
And the idea here is, as soon as you had symptoms, it could shorten the duration, their severity of the common cold.

575
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:24,440
And there have been a bunch of studies that have looked at this.

576
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:36,700
And if you look at a copper review or a systematic review, you might find studies that agree with this hypothesis and so said disagree.

577
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:38,900
So there's there's a lot of controversy here.

578
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:48,530
So it turns out that when people followed the directions on this particular diet, it wasn't a dietary supplement, a supplement.

579
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:54,560
It's a nasal swab. They had to withdraw the product in 2009.

580
01:12:55,310 --> 01:13:04,010
And that's because when people used the product as directed, they had a chronic loss of smell or olfaction.

581
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:08,030
Okay. And this happened to lots of people.

582
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:20,360
So there was a class action lawsuit and the manufacturer agreed to pay individuals who lost their sense of smell $60 million.

583
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:22,520
Lawyers probably got a pretty good cut of this.

584
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:34,520
But even after this, you can go to Kroger's right now and find some version of this on the shelf, believe it or not, even after all of this.

585
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:41,870
And I'm not exactly sure what hoops they had to jump through to continue selling their product, but they still are.

586
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:47,990
Even with this background check. All right.

587
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:55,760
So the other thing you should know is that FDA has a statement on homeopathic products.

588
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:58,860
There's no FDA approved products labeled as homeopathic.

589
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,030
What does that mean?

590
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:08,550
It means that any product labeled as homeopathic is being marketed in the U.S. without FDA evaluation for safety and effectiveness.

591
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:26,370
So you'll see claims and it's natural, it's safe, it's an alternative product, but it's not been tested for safety and efficacy.

592
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:30,480
But there's still a peer all over the place online retail stores and so on.

593
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,280
So we're running to the end of the class.

594
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:39,590
I wanted to have a discussion about the vitamin D story.

595
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:47,760
So in terms of of of translating science in the public setting,

596
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:59,549
these are some issues when you're reading a late in the late press does the that the journalists

597
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:04,800
have the scientific background to write the paper do they rely on people who have the background?

598
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:09,120
Are those people biased? Are they looking for a take home statements?

599
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:17,970
That's way oversimplified. Okay. But in order to address these questions, as students who are learning and trying to become scientists,

600
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:27,030
go back to the original article and see the data for yourself and see if the results support the hypothesis.

601
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,810
Okay. Getting back to our original question,

602
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:36,570
so I'm going to walk through this and I'm going to ask you very quickly what your what your take home message was.

603
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:47,570
So. First since vitamin D deficiency significantly correlates with the severity of SA's Kobe two infection.

604
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:56,720
Okay. Is vitamin D deficiency the only thing wrong with people who get SARS-CoV-2?

605
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:04,020
A lot of people who are elderly are inside a lot and they're not exposed to sunlight.

606
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:09,179
So they can have vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency.

607
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:23,399
But there's a lot of other things going on. Right. Molecular docking based studies tested these things using a machine learning approach or to

608
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:31,170
see how well these molecules might bind to these enzymes in terms of testing their activity.

609
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:46,470
Then they based on this information, they went back and took the enzymes that they're testing here and they cultured them.

610
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:53,910
They cultured those and found that. With those analogs.

611
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:59,340
And then I looked at the activity of the enzymes and this is what they found.

612
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:09,150
There was a 10 to 19% inhibition of the protease and a 50 to 60% inhibition with,

613
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:17,250
um, the, the, um, uh, this is the RNA polymerase enzyme I believe was.

614
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:23,159
And they concluded that thus the inhibition of these enzymes by vitamin D and

615
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:29,340
luminescent metabolites may provide a novel approach to hindering SARS-CoV-2 infection.

616
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:33,750
Okay. So the press release looked like this.

617
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:49,940
Promising new data from a recent study indicates that the active forms of vitamin D can inhibit the replication and expansion of COVID 19.

618
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:57,470
Is that the take home message consistent with what we just read?

619
01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:06,040
No, no. It grabbed it got lots of attention.

620
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,370
I saw this posted all over the place.

621
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:18,580
But when you went back and you looked at the original research, that's when you found that there was a huge disconnect here.

622
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:28,150
Okay. I'm sure that this made people go out and buy vitamin D supplements, too, thinking that they could protect themselves from COVID 19.

623
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:32,620
Right. But that's not what this study showed.

624
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:37,810
Right. So what were your what were your points? Real quickly, last couple of minutes here.

625
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:44,100
Anybody want to volunteer what their bullet point said? Yeah.

626
01:18:44,910 --> 01:18:51,600
But then you mentioned like Spain and heaven and France involving the replication and establishment of infection of SARS-CoV-2.

627
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:56,100
Okay, so straightforward. You didn't overinterpret the study.

628
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:04,220
Okay, good. Another example. Don't be shy.

629
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:07,910
Just. Just say what you said. How would you. What was your bullet point?

630
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:16,650
This time it's a little bit warmer. Vitamin D derivatives are people finding to be at the site of SARS-CoV-2 enzymes,

631
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:21,900
which potentially limits the enzymes prevent replication and establishment of the infection.

632
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:26,770
Generally serving as a novel approach to ingredient. And increasing severity.

633
01:19:27,730 --> 01:19:33,340
Okay. Potentially. So you framed it based on the evidence that they provided.

634
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:37,780
Okay. And you didn't jump into this type of language.

635
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:44,410
Good. So that's the way. Those are those are very good ways to frame this particular study.

636
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:55,230
So when you publish a paper, you might be asked by a journalist to give them what's the take home message, your study.

637
01:19:55,680 --> 01:20:02,130
And you have to be careful of how you frame your conclusions because they can misinterpret them.

638
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:10,860
And what you have to do is you have to insist that you have final editorial privileges for that, the study.

639
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:13,680
Sometimes they'll let you do that and sometimes they won't.

640
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:24,900
So with this background, we're going to start talking about research papers on nutrition and immune response.

641
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:30,480
And then when we meet next week, we're going to be talking about just innate immunity.

642
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:36,240
So we'll start with that as a foundational learning opportunity.

643
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:40,470
Okay. Any questions about what we talked about so far?

644
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:44,850
This is the way you would approach the research papers.

645
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:54,870
These are my suggestions, I should say. Okay. All right, everybody, have a good weekend and I'll see you on Tuesday and enjoy the long weekend.
