1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:09,450
Okay. So. So we're soon we'll get into the form part of this class.

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:21,060
We're going to talk a lot about our common problem and the process as that property, namely Markle and Markle processes.

3
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:31,680
But before that, there was a little one last one process, but I'll say illustrative example of what we have learned so far.

4
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,410
Just like golf, it was a process.

5
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:43,200
So this one we have seen before and that is a nice bridge, the gap between the previous lecture and then the next lecture,

6
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:52,830
because the process itself is also a mark on this non simple random walk.

7
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:10,890
But so the process is we have learned a lot of, you know, some of those can be seen as a special case of simple random walk.

8
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,430
The most famous one is Gambler's Rule, right?

9
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,180
So the simple random walk is so instrumental in stochastic processes.

10
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:33,210
So even your study, like the most complicated or most that you think of, it's most sophisticated stochastic processes like in the financial market.

11
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:41,670
Look at the stock market changes, some of the fundamental randomness and this rules it from the simple random one,

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,670
which is simply just consists of a series of coin toss, right?

13
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,850
And then decision making going forward and backwards.

14
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,540
Let's first look at the definition that we see.

15
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:04,050
So the simple random walk is a stochastic process, so it's a collection of infinite random variables.

16
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:21,800
So like you look at the individual random variable as seen here that's represented representative the fortunes of a gambler at the time.

17
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:28,290
And in general in this context, we need to put it into a context of, you know, a walk.

18
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,010
So the sun is simply the position on a real line.

19
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,060
So first the simple random walk usually not mentioned.

20
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:46,410
So if there is no additional context offered is refers to the one that mentioned the simple random walk.

21
00:02:46,890 --> 00:03:07,080
So what that means, it means as we think it can be written as the zero plus summation, I want to own the size of my right.

22
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:24,910
So each of these so I take them values either negative one or positive one depends on the people.

23
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:33,990
So they are ideal from this simple distribution.

24
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:50,190
So the basically saying sorry, I can go on with probability P and the next one is the probability one on Q one minus.

25
00:03:51,290 --> 00:04:00,930
Right. So various involvement of what do you do is exactly the gambler's rule, except that there is no boundary, at least for now.

26
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:10,940
So it's if you're trying to do this experiment or trying to simulate a simple, random walk, it's very simple.

27
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:17,730
Right. So you can just simulate from a Bernoulli random variable p q if you're getting a had, you move forward.

28
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:28,440
If you get a tail, you move backwards, and then every step you add up is your displacement.

29
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,850
So I know what you add up. You are reporting the current position.

30
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,090
You are in there one dimensional rail.

31
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:44,380
So it's a real line, but we only use that integer that is in this case, right?

32
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,660
So it's pretty simple.

33
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:56,910
But this is actually, as I said, if there's a lot of randomness, like complicated randomness can be explained by this type of the simple,

34
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:06,000
you know, simple randomness behavior, the random behavior after the single step.

35
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:23,950
So the example, as I said, we have a complex rule, right?

36
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:34,740
So the process is simple. The question induced by this stochastic process is not necessarily easy.

37
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:38,760
All right. Complex is a famous hard problem.

38
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:46,710
A lot of those question, a lot of the problem induced by the a simple random walk.

39
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:59,210
Actually, you need some. You know, an in-depth investigation is not like, for example, exam problems today can easily be solved.

40
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:14,280
So some conventions. And so those conventions are usually refers to the boundary conditions.

41
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,349
So S0 zero simple run the block is usually set up to zero.

42
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:24,650
So every simple random walks start with at the point zero.

43
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,620
So you have a left and then a right. Or if you can think of a up or down.

44
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,880
So as zero is right in the original point from zero people to zero and that's by default again,

45
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:48,959
if we're not talking about specify that that mentions we talk about one dimensional random walk so this thing can be extended to multiple dimensions,

46
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,930
right? So, so think about extend to the, to the dimension.

47
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:01,979
So you have left to right forward backwards, right?

48
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:10,110
So you just need to instead of flip a coin with two sides, you're just flip a coin with four sides, right?

49
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:14,400
So you can determine going forward, backwards, left or right.

50
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,790
So the same thing you could add to the third dimension by flip.

51
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,190
Well, it's not a coin any more. So like a dice or dice.

52
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:32,130
So you roll the dice on a determinate you could. Now you have to add directions to go up or down, right?

53
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,630
So you can send it this to multiple dimensions, interestingly.

54
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:44,849
So some some of the the rules you learn from a lower dimension doesn't apply to a higher dimension.

55
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,160
When we get there, we'll talk a little bit about that.

56
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:59,459
So this is a fascinating this is also kind of a B comma interesting like physical phenomenon we got there.

57
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,170
We'll talk about that. But this is a simple definition of simple random walk.

58
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:13,650
Right. So it's. If you were thinking about seemingly this simple run off, that's really, really easy, right?

59
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:21,030
Do to use a computer or even use you don't know programing.

60
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:27,270
You can simply think about it, you know, generate a realization of this by really just flip a coin.

61
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:33,180
But the problems we're going to solve is speed with this.

62
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:47,360
Is usually the difficult problem, I should say, associated with a simple random walk, usually associated with random time distribution.

63
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:56,990
All right. So let's see one of these examples.

64
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:11,840
And I see solving a simple solving one problem how solving a one type of the problem can help us solve a classic problem.

65
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,160
So the problem we're trying to solve. So that's the definition.

66
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:28,530
This is called a first the passage time distribution.

67
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:41,720
So what we've going to do is define a random time on top of this simple random walk, this stochastic process.

68
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,600
Specifically, we can find out how we're priming them.

69
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:52,940
So this time is a random variable. And then to find this, it's a random time.

70
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,820
So it's a random variable we support on the index set, which is integer.

71
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:11,660
In this case, I'm actually not negative indicator value, so that will be done the first time.

72
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:25,750
If. My random walk across the path the barrier as you hope to your right.

73
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,960
So that refers to. Let's talk about.

74
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,559
Right. So you have a barrier. So one dimensional.

75
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:45,330
We move up and down on the first time your random walk cross position that that is the call the first the passage time.

76
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:58,740
How can. Right. Again, this is defined as is instead of minimum, because there is a possibility you never get there.

77
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,220
So that means the plan can be infinity, right?

78
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,209
As for now, it's we know it's we still don't know.

79
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:14,500
That's always true. Ah, well, I mean, there is a situation home equal to zero because if your aim is greater than zero,

80
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:23,710
I will going always going down a random walk is always going on right by setting Q equal to one and then he goes to zero.

81
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,120
So he always going down. So maybe the town that I am is a positive.

82
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,239
So you would run the morgue always going down, but your target is of course they are solving the time.

83
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,480
Well, take the value infinity with non-zero probability.

84
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:44,800
So be aware that's a possibility. So why only find this things use the right mathematical notation.

85
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,969
So in this case, if. Right. All right.

86
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:55,480
So defined by this, the question is, can we know the distribution of how often?

87
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:05,290
So this is stochastic process problem, right. With dealing it's not again, you can not enumerate the possibilities.

88
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,379
So you have to use conditional probability.

89
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:15,970
You have to apply something we just learned from the previous weeks trying to solve this problem.

90
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,560
Okay. So let's tackle this problem and.

91
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:32,560
So first of all, we gonna. You know, we're going to decompose this problem into the simpler ones first.

92
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,320
I think is arbitrary. Right.

93
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:48,940
But you kind of realize you can break down this this divide and conquer, break this rather complex problem into simpler problem or.

94
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,550
Relative means in relative terms is not necessarily severe.

95
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:12,910
So one thing you can realize. We can write how all the time equals information.

96
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:23,040
I zero. Let me first write down this and now this is how I'm going to use a different notation.

97
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,130
I. To find us.

98
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:41,309
So this particular notation is the same definition as the first passage time,

99
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:50,100
but it's the first the passage time starting from position I and then the first across to a plus one.

100
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,140
Okay. So this is basically just crossing one barrier.

101
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,430
So you're just going on pause. Why?

102
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:06,759
This is true. So if you get trying to get to all of em, you kind of think about, you know,

103
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:17,590
this is let's say this is a position and then this is the time you starting.

104
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,649
You always start from zero zero position wise.

105
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:30,590
We start S0 equal to zero, right? So you kind think about any simulations going up.

106
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:38,320
I say something like this.

107
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,070
So if you're interested in how this is zero one, two, I say three.

108
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:55,750
All right. So look like pulse three is not a trivial problem, but so you can first check if this decomposition is correct.

109
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:04,150
So that basically means if you want to get from zero to M, you need to get to all of these intermediate step, right?

110
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:11,170
So the random walk doesn't allow you to jump two steps in, one step in, one move.

111
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,850
So you have to go through once and one step at a time.

112
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,950
And then this is basically saying, you know, this one step decomposition.

113
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:30,940
So if you have a m, then you have this random decomposition to those one step movement.

114
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,680
So first of all, you need to get to one. The first time you get one is right here.

115
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:41,440
So this one will be your realization of how 0 to 1, right?

116
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,990
And then from there you need to get it to two. So what is the time you get from two?

117
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:56,170
You just look at here and then you you get go down, down, down the first time you get to two.

118
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,650
So this is a title 0 to 1.

119
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:08,920
So this, this particular part is Tao 1 to 2, right?

120
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,690
So you don't really care what's in between.

121
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:18,700
It's going up and down, but this is the first time you get to two and then the next time you get is 2 to 3.

122
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,350
And then when you add up this and then they are all continuous, right?

123
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:29,020
So this is a kind of a decomposition of them. So that is not the proof for this is right.

124
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:38,020
But you can actually make a more rigorous argument and the power of AB can be decomposed into this.

125
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,030
It has to be true. Yeah.

126
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:51,140
So the reason is basically there is no two step movement.

127
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:58,880
You have to go. Every step is therefore the Tao of AB and can be decomposed into this.

128
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,890
Once that transitions over, all of these are single.

129
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:13,700
And you can also argue. So this is the thing you also find out from this process, from this decomposition.

130
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:23,239
How i2i plus one are ready.

131
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,480
I right.

132
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:36,530
There is no particular. So there's nothing special about the the origin the point in zero from 0 to 1 and then from 1 to 2.

133
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:41,810
From 2 to 3. This stochastic nature of the process doesn't change.

134
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,970
All right. So what's the difference from.

135
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:55,110
So if you are trying to argue from 2 to 3 is different from 0 to 1, you need to tell me what's the difference, right?

136
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:05,280
If I do a transformation like every coordinate minus two, that doesn't change anything, basically.

137
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:11,370
So those are I need and that same distribution.

138
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:18,180
That's how one. Let's just simply accept it as us and how we find this.

139
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,120
Actually, let's call this just how.

140
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,290
Okay. The.

141
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:42,170
So because of this decomposition, what do we do?

142
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,120
So that's how we've basically shown us.

143
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:55,130
It's simply just a convolution of call patterns of power together.

144
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,860
Right. So if we want to say, how am I?

145
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:11,560
She? Some people visit the decomposition week.

146
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:33,330
They say right now the other way to try this, Thailand is becoming its own version of town as up together.

147
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:40,840
Oh, I forgot what the the notation we have, but I can do town hall.

148
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:57,810
So this is representative convolution. So all those convoluted together so we know how to do convolution for i.e. random variables.

149
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:04,130
And these are not negative integer value because they are on the time scale.

150
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,819
So basically we can have a free done problem,

151
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:16,990
simplify the problem to say if we know the individual of how not we know and the distribution of the time.

152
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:27,150
Right. We know that because either you can use convolution or you can use just the probability generating function.

153
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:39,790
Okay. So, um. So let's just study the license.

154
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:49,210
Find the distribution of top.

155
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:06,170
All right. So not negative integer value, a random variable.

156
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:16,100
What we can do so now is to recall the tools we have now, because this particular random variable is not known to give integer value.

157
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:26,090
So the best way to summarize this distribution is probably the probability generating function is not the only way,

158
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:36,140
but is a convenient and so let's define gee, how has as the probability generating function.

159
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:53,390
So as this how again I'm going to write this is a probability I want to write something.

160
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,420
So I kind of already acknowledge so.

161
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,750
So this is equal this part. I kind of already acknowledge the.

162
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,690
How equal to zero is with probability zero, right?

163
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:12,120
You start from the point in zero, right? That's the time zero.

164
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:20,290
You cannot get to your target, which has to be one in this case or interestingly so.

165
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:34,870
But you could write a to zero. That's that's fine to say because the version I said zero zero.

166
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:42,070
All right. So now the problem is, how do we solve?

167
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,360
This expectation.

168
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:57,990
If they figure all of this expectation, we know the corresponding coefficient will be our probability of probability mass function for individual.

169
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:02,840
So how do we solve this? Right.

170
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:07,880
So. Natural thing to do.

171
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:14,690
It is going to be conditioned on something.

172
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,160
Divide and conquer. Yeah.

173
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:31,700
This in this type of the problem, again, the most natural thing to conditioning on is the first movement, the first the displacement.

174
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,200
So that's side one. Basically the first of all.

175
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:46,010
So this is always true by the total expectation, more than what we can figure out.

176
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:51,110
Is this conditioning conditional probability of the conditional expectation.

177
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:17,089
So this is actually pretty similar.

178
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:20,570
Like in the problem gamblers are all we have solved.

179
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:29,270
So I want only take two while it was either positive one or negative one.

180
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:34,220
If it does take positive one, take a simple thing first.

181
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:40,430
That means what is this? How to achieve your goal.

182
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:45,370
So the goal is get cross one unit, get out.

183
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:51,860
One is that if the PSI one is one. So that means you achieve your goal already in one step.

184
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:58,700
So I'm going to claim this one is just equals. The expected value of SC to the power Tao is just as.

185
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:11,280
Yes. If a CI one equals two positive one.

186
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,480
So this is a with probability p.

187
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,520
All right. So the difficult one is one about.

188
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,830
So Y equals the negative one. Right.

189
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,350
We didn't go up. We got to the wrong direction.

190
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:39,240
We did not achieve that in one. So why did you go to negative one?

191
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,850
So what happens here? So the problem itself.

192
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:49,890
So you are getting through the zero, but you're trying to get your goal.

193
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,490
You cross this line, but you get down from here.

194
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,530
Right. But remember, your goal is still cross.

195
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:11,660
The top bar here, which is positive one, you are in the negative one that you need to think about the overall regional decomposition.

196
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:18,060
So now you're realistic about your current position.

197
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:22,980
Now you need to go up one time and then up again.

198
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:28,440
So that time we have doesn't have the same decomposition of the Taliban.

199
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:34,320
So we're going to claim this one equals one plus.

200
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:39,480
How? Use.

201
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,290
How. Brian? Brian. All right.

202
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,120
So the first. You already move the one step by.

203
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,630
You ended up in the wrong position. Negative one.

204
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:01,550
And then what do you need to do to achieve your goal is first to return back to the original spot.

205
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,510
That is the first time you get back to.

206
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,590
From -1 to 0. Right. So this is actually.

207
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:16,530
So that's how prime is, how -1 to 0.

208
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,990
And then how double fine it'll be after you get back to one.

209
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:27,420
Then you think about from getting 0 to 1. So everything regenerate itself.

210
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:31,170
So it's one plus two how prime plus how double prime.

211
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:39,540
And now, you know, these two things are independent and they also have the same distribution as how.

212
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:50,520
So total number of stat you can look at their expected value of that conditional on site one is as to the one.

213
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,840
So this part is stacked.

214
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:03,030
So this one with probability Q or one minus B.

215
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:18,150
Any questions so far. So everything we do here, the key thing is the decomposition, right?

216
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,890
Thus the decomposition also runs run time.

217
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:31,959
But once you have this, you convince yourself with that that we can just put it together.

218
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:41,530
So this is a just a conditional expectation we need to take another expected to take another expectation to get the thing we want, which is the.

219
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,210
The probability generating function of. So that you ask how?

220
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:56,819
Which is? You tell us. Now we're going to take the expectation of that conditional expectation.

221
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:08,070
We said it with respect to the PSI. One is p times s if it's P and it take the value s and now we see probability.

222
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:14,010
Q What we get, we get we got to ask.

223
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:29,940
So, I mean, right this is maybe a one as one last time, a couple prime, and then we played that as high as a few times.

224
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:41,340
As multiply by she's half as square.

225
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,380
Right. So that as here is.

226
00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:00,700
So as to the one, it's just a number, so we can take that outside the expected value.

227
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:09,520
So that's the tall prime. Plus, to do a double prime, you realize this kind of convolution of two independent random variables.

228
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:23,120
And then by the rule. Once you have the probability generating functions is simply the power of the square and often the key points so well.

229
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:31,670
At the end of the day, again by conditioning, we set up a equation.

230
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,510
In this particular case, the equation is quadratic.

231
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:49,110
We're interested in how s how does the order in Times Square and we know how to solve the quadratic equation formula.

232
00:30:49,400 --> 00:31:06,690
And so the G how as. If you apply the formula, you get two solutions, which is a little bit lower.

233
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,730
You get to solutions.

234
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:20,620
She. To keep us.

235
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:30,120
One plus or minus. So this represents two solutions in one expression.

236
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,920
One minus 4qa square.

237
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:45,690
And so by solving this quadratic equation, I won't bore you with the details, but you get this two solutions.

238
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:56,370
So our post solutions are well, there are the solutions to this operating equation.

239
00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:04,910
The question is, are both satisfy the probability generating function requirement, right?

240
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:12,910
So that may not be the case channel where you don't have to function, no expression of a probability of generating function.

241
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,350
So usually you can tell there is only one solution.

242
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:20,270
This is valid. The question is which one?

243
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:29,870
Right. So in this case, how do we pick the the the valid, the probability generating function?

244
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,730
We need to use some very trivial boundary conditions.

245
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:48,710
So what the boundary conditions were. Now we know that S0 equal to zero indicate to how zero should be with probability zero.

246
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:59,720
So yeah. So this is what we know. And then this is sufficient for you for us to figure out which one is the correct answer.

247
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:07,130
So you can rule out one very easy which one to rule out first, plus or minus.

248
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,490
So how do you get the probability Collingwood's to zero from your generating function?

249
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:33,460
That's pretty easy, right? So you just evaluate that a generating function and its value as equals zero.

250
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:40,450
So that means the boundary condition requires g, how zero?

251
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:50,500
Remember, that's a that's a power extension expansion of that particular function.

252
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:59,100
But if you're a outside of the polynomial, all the values as equal to zero so zero of any polynomial terms,

253
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:03,640
this is only replacing us probability how we can do zero.

254
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,020
So this one has to be zero. Okay. So now you can try.

255
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:12,400
If you put zero there, the denominator is zero.

256
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:24,380
Right. That's not a disaster because we are all familiar with only indeterminate expression in calculus.

257
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:30,290
But that requires your numerator cannot be non-zero,

258
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:37,340
so your desire requires your if that's ever be something valid, you numerator there has to be another zero.

259
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,770
But if your have plus sign enumerate are going to be one.

260
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,320
Right. Sorry. Is that one is actually two. Right.

261
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,090
So you have a one plus one over is terrible.

262
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:57,420
Four plus if as equal to zero.

263
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,650
So this is an infinity that's not satisfying this.

264
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:07,160
So it is must be true. This is negative. So you have to take the negative.

265
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:12,020
So you've got one minus one. So you've got zero versus zero.

266
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:16,459
So you have all your rules to calculate that you can take the derivative,

267
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:24,170
but the numerator and denominator will figure out what this limit is right now going there.

268
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:31,100
But by the boundary condition, you should.

269
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,400
Well, we shall. Only one of these solution is correct.

270
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:51,530
So the details has to be. So this implies one minus one minus four, which you think adds.

271
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,010
There's other ways to to determine if it's a plus or minus.

272
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:14,460
But, you know, boundary condition is pretty straightforward.

273
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:21,300
So we basically got here everything else.

274
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:28,820
We can simplify it, make it more straightforward, make it more intuitive.

275
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:34,170
But once you get generating function, it's a probability generating function.

276
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:40,530
You can't recover arbitrary power equal to any integers by just taking.

277
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:48,350
The corresponding derivative right and the water derivative they were going to recover.

278
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,950
But in this case, we do have a way to simplify this a little bit.

279
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:58,810
So the lecture notes show you the extra oxygen.

280
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:03,290
So I think it's a bit interesting.

281
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:07,400
So let's just go through that a little bit.

282
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:16,010
So the thing we want to do is trying to so if you're ever trying to simplify something like this,

283
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:25,070
the goal is always write this into power expansion of this particular probability generating function, right?

284
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:34,210
So the tools you have, you could do Taylor expansion, you could do you could use the so called generalized binomial theorem.

285
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:40,760
So that's Newton's greatest discovery besides calculus.

286
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:53,960
So we can use, for example, something a X plus Y two power, and you can write this summation of X, you know,

287
00:37:54,140 --> 00:38:04,730
I don't want to write that and minus one Y and with corresponding coefficient let's a minus so you can.

288
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,440
So that is the sources.

289
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:16,729
So actually last time we show the Fibonacci, you could also use the, the general the binomial theorem that's pretty straightforward.

290
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:27,560
And we, I gave you the form of that. But anyway, so this one you kind of write the two Q as because as to the one over minus.

291
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:38,370
To kill us. So for this part, you already can apply the binomial theorem.

292
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:45,870
Right. So this is a one minus four Q as square to the power of a half.

293
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,870
So we call this generalized the binomial theorem so it doesn't really care.

294
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,650
You know, you don't really need to have an integer over here.

295
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:00,930
So this one is going to have this for summation.

296
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:09,020
J zero to Infinity. That's what we want to call the half truths.

297
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:13,650
J Negative four.

298
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:18,240
Q as square to the power of.

299
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:38,010
Okay. So the notion of an arbitrary number often true.

300
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:42,150
Okay. So we learn this in comedy common. This is untrue.

301
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:46,650
Okay. So you told me about the fact you are required to be a integer.

302
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:54,440
But so in in the generalize, the binomial theorem, so out of it can be anything.

303
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:09,900
So this is just after the times of the minus one all the way minus two after the minus one plus oh, right after the K and so on.

304
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:16,690
Okay, plus one. So from here to here, there are K terms you.

305
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:24,150
So you just sequentially reduce offer by one and then multiply by K terms divided.

306
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:27,630
So this one has to be integer, K has to be integer here.

307
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:55,620
Right. In that case, I. The important thing is this part becomes of a polynomial term, so the rest is simple.

308
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,020
So you get the two j as to the two j.

309
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:04,960
There is a to J minus one. You also have a11 over two Q as.

310
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:12,970
So you do some combination, put everything together and factor it all actually first.

311
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:18,450
So the details are in the lecture notes at the end of the day.

312
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:30,370
What you get is one over two to summation j to infinity a half true.

313
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:44,350
J Negative one. J Plus one for copy to J as to J minus one.

314
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,030
So let me put this thing into a box.

315
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:56,720
There's. Easy to do, not necessarily easy to see, but.

316
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:09,070
So from here you can actually. There's.

317
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:14,920
Well, if you're right into this term, this is a like the Fibonacci sequence.

318
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:25,910
Now, you could theoretically write more probability out of it.

319
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:32,740
It has added convenience, but not necessarily anything fancy about this.

320
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:40,870
This is a probability, which is how you post to J minus one.

321
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:48,760
First of all, the the poly, the the polynomial terms are only non-zero.

322
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:52,730
Add the alt number to j minus one.

323
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:56,530
Right. So if you move one up, your goal is move one up.

324
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,860
You cannot get there in even steps.

325
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:08,590
That's should be obvious. You move two steps you has to ended up in.

326
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,450
You have to end it up enough even for either zero or two or positive two.

327
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:22,960
You cannot ended up like. Even our position in this case is one.

328
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:31,180
So if you trying to get there, you must you must get there in almost all the steps.

329
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:36,250
So to J minus one, those things are non-zero.

330
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:48,050
The probability of that is what is one over to kill you just recover the terms and then you're going to have a half truths.

331
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:52,659
Okay. Right. So you don't need the summation anymore.

332
00:43:52,660 --> 00:44:00,940
You just need to. Why you have J is all number J plus one become even number so negative two.

333
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,540
That even number is always a positive one.

334
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,260
So guarantee of it's low probability is always positive.

335
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:14,230
And then you have 4pq for you.

336
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:27,920
Right. So that's the answer. It's. So you probably won't get this if you if you don't know all of these.

337
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:33,740
If I see Operation Namba Jan functions,

338
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:44,420
but you could potentially get those numerical results by just computed that the order or in

339
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:51,440
this case j order or to j minus one order derivative with respect to about generating function,

340
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,960
this one has a pretty straightforward solution.

341
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:12,010
I recall that. Yeah. So. So this part two path to the J recall that generalized interest K which was K function.

342
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,630
Okay. So we have this solution now.

343
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:22,640
Now we can think about a few general thing, right?

344
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,420
So this is a. So, first of all, it has to be correct.

345
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:33,660
So, like, even on this type of the checking, this cannot be achieved, but it even stops.

346
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:42,180
So all of this probability equal to j positive zero.

347
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:49,050
And so this is true. Come from the come from the solution.

348
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:56,580
And then we can ask the question, what is the probability? How is this finite?

349
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:07,460
Right. We kind of are saying there is a possibility that you will never get to the never across to the top.

350
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:11,090
Right. So there is a possibility of one.

351
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:14,550
Would that happen? The probability and infinity.

352
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:24,110
So this is a correct. So whenever you see this type of the problem, what you want to do is just stop over.

353
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:35,620
Oh, these are finite. The probability of how all the finite values which I so I see.

354
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:46,250
All right. So if you asked me this question, then that means time can be any integer and then there are mutually exclusive.

355
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:56,390
And I'm just gonna add up all these possible values, which is how one.

356
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:01,510
Right. You don't really need to evaluate individual house.

357
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:12,850
You have your generating function. And on this summation, just corresponding to the generating function, evaluated at the parameter as equal to one.

358
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:20,400
So which is what?

359
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:31,729
Which is to kill one minus square root of one -40.

360
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:43,750
Q And then this one can be if you realize P plus Q has to be one, and then the one can be written as P plus Q squared, right?

361
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:47,120
There is a constraint. Q has to add up to one.

362
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:53,719
And I can simplify this a bit. I don't think you get to.

363
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:58,310
Q one minus two minus Q.

364
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:05,130
Absolutely not. So the absolute line will comes from the square root of one -40.

365
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:21,800
Q. The details of algebra is not important, but this conclusion is very interesting as supposed to be.

366
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:27,560
Well, I think it should be intuitive as well. So you will notice.

367
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:36,290
So now you need to consider Peak Reserve Bank your lifetime queue.

368
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:42,530
Right. So if peak read her that Q then P minus Q is positive.

369
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:47,270
You ended up with that.

370
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:52,190
So what what does it mean P greater than. So you have a tendency going up, right?

371
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:57,380
So every step you have a higher probability to go up and go down.

372
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:08,850
Yup. The P greater than Q. So now in that case, one minus becomes the absolute value, one minus two divided by two.

373
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:12,319
Q And then this is a one minus P plus.

374
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:18,290
Q Divided by two. Q So now, surprisingly, Y minus P is.

375
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:28,520
Q. Q Q Over two. Q It's one. So with probability one, you will always cross the bar and upwards.

376
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:34,340
The story is different. Y You have.

377
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:38,330
P It's less like you. So this is a p greater than.

378
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:44,030
Q So if I have p less than a say where you put less.

379
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:49,219
Thank you. So now you have a different situation.

380
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:53,630
Is Q minus P because it's absolute value.

381
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:58,130
Q Rather than P than this one divided by two.

382
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,460
Q And then this one's P over.

383
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:13,640
Q Right. And do the same operation realize one minus Q is P, but you have a plus PS of two P over two Q that's P over.

384
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:18,469
Q And then this is about a probability because you have a few isolate.

385
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:23,480
Q So this number is the ratio is bounded in 0 to 1.

386
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:36,000
What does it mean? That means there are only a probability, non-zero probability that you could cross the upper bar.

387
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,500
At the same time, you have to also have a probability of one minus this one.

388
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,140
What? Never crossed that bar? Yeah. So not taking this in any.

389
00:50:49,580 --> 00:51:05,930
So let me ask you a follow up question. If he is less than keel without doing any calculation, what is the expected value of?

390
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:14,470
You know the answer. Okay, just hold on a second.

391
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:20,820
Anybody else? All right. Ali? Yes?

392
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:25,720
Why? Because there's nothing to draw on. Yes, because there is.

393
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:32,680
As we discussed here, there is a non-zero probability of an infinity.

394
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:41,540
So that will take forever to get back. So this type of situation, we cannot discuss again in in Markov chain.

395
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,200
So this type of argument is kind of fought.

396
00:51:45,310 --> 00:52:00,640
If you find something has non-zero probability of infinity, then immediately the reaction is the expected value of that is is not finite or good.

397
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:16,030
So a lot of properties we can't learn from just solving.

398
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:19,810
Well, this is overall a non-trivial problem.

399
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:27,819
But with we did a few important things to be able to solve this type of the problem.

400
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:31,060
First is that divide and conquer, we turn the top off.

401
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:43,570
Okay. By the way, what is the call and what the distribution of if we're trying to across the M barrier or position.

402
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:55,740
And so the argument here is the G how M as is simply the convolution of M called itself tao.

403
00:52:55,750 --> 00:53:05,500
So that is a G how we what we learn there based on the power of AB right I'm not going to

404
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:12,580
write the details of the idea is if you know the single step that you know this and that.

405
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:20,979
So if you're all trying to get team t m you go to I tao I am sorry to him you can do I you can use

406
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:27,790
either convolution or you can use the the probability generating function to figure that out.

407
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:41,320
But this is the decomposition of m general step into, you know, m single m to realize this is a convolution problem.

408
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:50,560
It's important that's the first thing. And then to solve how one we use probability generating function.

409
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:57,330
We also the most important thing we use is conditioning conditioning on the backside.

410
00:53:57,370 --> 00:54:01,630
What the first is that? The reason we can do that?

411
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:10,480
It's because this simple random walk. Is indeed a markov process.

412
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:21,600
So conditioning on the first stab, every other means is becomes independent of, you know, anything before that happens.

413
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:28,690
So that's how you could. One is really the critical. So the first of all is really the the critical step.

414
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:36,450
So there is a lot of implicit using of Markov property in this calculation.

415
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:41,840
We just need to point it out maybe. Later this week or next week.

416
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,970
Other than that, if you get the. Generalize.

417
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:53,339
So the other thing I think it's required to when you get two different solutions,

418
00:54:53,340 --> 00:55:03,180
you need to you should be able to use boundary solution, a boundary condition to determine which solution is the valid solution.

419
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:09,240
Right. Um, so we have shown that in Fibonacci.

420
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:12,930
Fibonacci as I have. Sorry.

421
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:16,110
No. So this is probably the only case we have seen that.

422
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:24,000
Okay. So if we can solve the first the passage time, we can use the same.

423
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:35,780
Okay. Maybe we could do this. All right, so we solve the how expiries value of how for.

424
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:44,360
So we said this is infinity if he is less than or equal to zero.

425
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:54,010
Okay. Um, so what is the P greater than Q?

426
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,570
How do we get he expected that we have the food distribution.

427
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:05,200
I think that's right over there. What is expected about it?

428
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:11,530
So this what we know is finite. Well, we don't we don't really know if it's a finite or not.

429
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:21,860
Actually, even you don't have. So the confidence of this condition doesn't guarantee you have a finite, uh, expectation.

430
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:27,070
You need a more mathematical condition to require that. But how do we calculate this?

431
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:31,600
You have to win it. Where there are equal to P is greater than Q.

432
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:38,870
Remember we did this in the Golden Wasson process.

433
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:45,770
Once you have a probability of generating function. G How one?

434
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:55,520
So you take the first, the derivative, and then evaluate the the right one.

435
00:56:55,850 --> 00:57:03,860
So this one actually equals it's a pretty straightforward one over P minus Q.

436
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:11,440
Right. So pupils queue inside. Interesting case.

437
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:21,670
So if you have a completely symmetric random walk day, you can ask the question.

438
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:27,520
So here, what is the probability that people across queue?

439
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:36,429
Well, sorry, say it again. So if while P equals Q is as is so interesting case because it is a completely symmetric right.

440
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:39,610
You're going up and down equally likely.

441
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:43,900
So what is the probability you will cross to one?

442
00:57:55,530 --> 00:58:00,480
Not supposed to be hard questions, so just plug in the P equals Q bear.

443
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,550
It's a half one over two. Q Is what?

444
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:09,230
What? Right. It is one. Right.

445
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:14,230
And I didn't do anything wrong. Okay?

446
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:23,580
It is one with probability. One. If you have a symmetric or simple random walk, you will eventually cross the upper one bounds.

447
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:32,630
What is the expected time to get there? Try this.

448
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:41,960
Either way, you're using this or this. Well, mean this to put this equal sign in where this is relatively arbitrary.

449
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:46,010
But either way, you got one over zero. That's infinity.

450
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:53,270
So that's maybe counterintuitive. Something is going to happen eventually, but may take forever to happen.

451
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:58,790
So the expected time of reading across the bar is actually infinity.

452
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,110
This is not saying if you do simulations, you're going to.

453
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:15,330
You're going to often see it never reach the bar. This is just saying they expected about it.

454
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,210
There is a possibility that, you know, I'm expecting.

455
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:25,870
So this, again, is important when we talk about transient stays in.

456
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:36,580
Mark, just keep in mind this is before for a lot of interesting thing or maybe think intuitively weird a thing can happen in a random walk,

457
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:43,150
which is fascinating because the the the the nature of randomness cannot be simpler.

458
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:48,070
Right. And then you get these seemingly paradox.

459
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:57,820
There is a sure probability you cannot return. But the expected value, the expected time to return, sorry to a cross is infinity.

460
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:06,790
Okay, so nothing is wrong, but the conclusion may be contrary to what you're saying.

461
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:18,640
I know you should be able to use the tools we have learned to reach this conclusion, no matter how positive you are.

462
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:23,500
Baffled is still, you know.

463
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:32,820
Generally speaking, human brain is not very good understanding in understanding uncertainty.

464
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:39,640
And this is one of the example. But if you feel this is all intuitive, then you are exceptional.

465
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:42,910
All right. I mean, a thought that still baffled me.

466
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:53,440
All right. Next, we talk about first rate in terms of distribution.

467
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,710
So this is a just slightly change of the problem.

468
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:07,420
So instead of thinking about crossing a bar, we think you set out from the original spot and then the time to return.

469
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:13,600
So I think it well is there is no bar for you anymore.

470
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:18,320
It's just when you go out and a one is the time.

471
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:26,200
So we are more interested in the random time. You actually the random walk take you back to your starting point.

472
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:39,910
So for this, we can define comma similarly as the end, and we're either equal to one as an equal to zero.

473
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:47,200
All right. So first of all, based on what we have studied about the cross time.

474
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:55,150
The first the passage time the game has to be can only take nuns kind of only take.

475
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,550
Non-zero probability with the even number. Right.

476
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:11,430
You only need if your goal arc number of steps and there is never a chance you get back to the original slot, start right back and go up and down.

477
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:20,400
Take you back. That's two steps and the off step will take you to a position.

478
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:25,950
Right. Comedies. This. So how do we calculate comedy?

479
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:35,170
Right. So this one. Or you could just be more direct.

480
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:46,160
Let's try to figure out the, uh, the probability generating function of comedies so that will be the expected value as to the column.

481
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:51,410
And again, we get into this point and now we're going to do conditioning.

482
01:02:51,710 --> 01:03:01,910
So that's only natural information as to the common economic side.

483
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:05,270
One. We do the same thing.

484
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,370
And then, you know, then this is.

485
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:20,440
It's almost the same procedure, kind of a routine.

486
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:38,650
We need to figure out this conditional source as to the common conditional alongside one, because Kaci won't take only two values.

487
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:44,430
This is easy to approach. And then think about the point of being let's say no.

488
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:52,299
Let's say first the side one. You go to negative one, side one a negative one with probability.

489
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:56,260
Q So what is the expected time to return?

490
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,610
So we need to turn the problem to something we have already solved.

491
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:09,010
So first of all, you need to account for here is one step already taken.

492
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:14,440
Take the random, walk down one unit, and then you look at the problem.

493
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:21,400
What are you looking for? It's the first. The passage time two from the -1 to 0.

494
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:26,120
That's exactly. That's how we just saw. Yeah.

495
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,830
Okay. Um.

496
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:43,040
All right, so what about the other one?

497
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:50,150
So this is if if, say, one week or two positive ones with this is always probability.

498
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:56,480
But this one is as one plus one.

499
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:05,530
So we're in the position of one. I know you were looking for the the first time to go down one unit.

500
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:09,720
So this is the problem we never solved. Right.

501
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:13,329
We only solved the going arc. But this problem.

502
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:17,139
So. So this is a let's call this a different thing. So we use that.

503
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:20,320
How we use that. Um, let's call this.

504
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:29,480
Trying to find the alumni say, so this is a one.

505
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:36,190
So this is a random time for going down. So realize going up and going down are completely different things.

506
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:45,690
But at the same time you realize going up and going down is only determined by probability P and Q Right?

507
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:58,180
So if it's the first, the passage of time is P and Q if you'll flip the Q on P, that's exactly the same probability generating function.

508
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:02,830
It's just you need to swap the position of. Right.

509
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:11,080
So if you don't in that sense, you don't need to solve you solve anything by using this symmetry type of argument.

510
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:18,640
Well, you can do that again all over again, but you will get the same answer.

511
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,880
Nevertheless, just swap the role of P on Q.

512
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:29,920
Okay, so, so I won't bore you with the details.

513
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:36,730
So this is as to the, as we said, the first, that is the swap.

514
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:42,540
Q So for the generating function of Tao, that is two P.

515
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:47,229
S one minus one -40.

516
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:51,370
Q Square plus for this one.

517
01:06:52,240 --> 01:07:04,820
What is Tao? This is a q times s items to k2's one minus one -42 as square.

518
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:10,450
And now if you combine these two realize P plus Q equals one,

519
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:20,620
what you're going to get in the original one -40 Q with a square and then you can simplify this.

520
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:23,390
It's not you don't you cannot separate.

521
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:34,570
So you can also use generalized binomial theorem to get the polynomial expression of the polynomial expansion of this function.

522
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:39,460
I'm not going to do here. I'm only interested in a few different things.

523
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:49,420
So this one is not. So again, I'm going to interest I'm interested in the average return of probability.

524
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:57,740
So if you were set out to do a random walk, what is the probability you will get back to being your starting point, right?

525
01:07:58,030 --> 01:08:02,870
So that is the probability. Skala Less than infinity, right?

526
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:10,809
You So you take the finite time, sorry, finite time to get back to your starting point.

527
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:15,400
Thus comma equal to, let's say infinity, which we set is simple, right?

528
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:19,300
So this one that's just a comma can go to one.

529
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:27,070
And if you have that is one minus E, minus Q.

530
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:36,810
Right. So this is an interesting. If P is not you.

531
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:41,960
Q So you don't have a symmetric, simple, random walk.

532
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:49,280
Then the gamma the last thing infinity is never one right if.

533
01:08:49,840 --> 01:09:08,940
So what I'm trying to say is. He's strictly less than one a player because one mind is something, right?

534
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:17,580
So the P minus Q cannot be greater than one. So you're safe to say this is the probability and then this p less than comma is less than is.

535
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:21,420
So there is no no certainty you will ever return.

536
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:27,479
Y you realize there is a drift going on if a p p is not equals.

537
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:31,020
Q I say p greater here is its tendency.

538
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:38,360
Every stop you tends to you expected the value is displacement is going up, so you make truth away.

539
01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:45,479
So it's pretty intuitive that it's a there is a non-zero probability you're going to drift

540
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:52,500
away and never get back the same thing for you have a tendency of going to be displacements,

541
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,979
of displacement going down towards so that's. Q greater than.

542
01:09:55,980 --> 01:10:04,379
P So in this case, so only in this case, again, the expected value of gonna be infinity, right?

543
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:10,530
That's pretty straightforward. If you know the last thing for any has non-zero probabilities.

544
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:14,939
What's interesting is one P equals Q.

545
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:30,600
No, this represents the is one that means the ever return probability is one.

546
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:35,549
Right. Can you calculate the expected value of this?

547
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:43,740
Of course you can. But if you do that, the expected value is also infinity, right?

548
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:51,600
So even P equals Q, you have a ever return probability being once always certainty.

549
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:59,760
If you interpret the probability this way, we certainly with not a probability what you can then return back to your original spot.

550
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:06,780
But the expected time to reach the original spot is going to be.

551
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:11,570
In the night, right? It's going to be infinity.

552
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,720
So that's an interesting phenomenon.

553
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:26,870
Well, the point of this lecture is, you know, you understand that all kinds of the tools when you should be able to answer this type of question.

554
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:33,840
So, you know, we have like 3 minutes. The the simple random walk.

555
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:39,030
You would think this is a simple place. The thing the simple, random phenomenon.

556
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:46,750
You think you would. You know, we should comprehend pretty well.

557
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:57,010
So this is just one dimensional, simple, random walk where you can puzzle with by a few factors, facts, I should say.

558
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:07,300
So in the two dimensions of this is a with I think we have a little lecture about bias in two dimensions while we study Markov chain.

559
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:14,500
Not completely sure. And you can check my notes, but in two dimensions we can ask the same question, right?

560
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:26,110
So the only thing here is we're going to make going the four directions with equal probability going up and down, left and right.

561
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:37,450
So in that case, we also have the conclusion that ever return probability will be one, right?

562
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:41,350
So you're going so you have a complete symmetric,

563
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:50,440
simple random walk into that matches and at least the probability is guaranteed that the random walk will get back to the.

564
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:59,420
The origin all original spot. What do you think will happen in three dimensional space?

565
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:07,540
Symmetric random walk going up and down forward back was left that right.

566
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,620
What is the probability of going back to the original spot?

567
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:21,480
Induction. Do you think it's going to be one? How many of you think it could be one?

568
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:27,680
This is not right or wrong. I'm just asking you what your intuition. Raise your hand if you think it's the one.

569
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:33,440
Yeah, my intuition is one, but the math says otherwise from one to the other.

570
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:40,190
So something happened in the wild way. You changing from a single dimension to two dimensions with three dimension.

571
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:51,810
And then so on a four dimensions. So what that means is, you know, the, you know, again, you can knock out the simpler random.

572
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:57,350
There's done this coin flip of simple random walk.

573
01:13:57,650 --> 01:14:04,250
But you know, where you have a complex setting like in the three dimensional or the four dimensional,

574
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:08,650
more like where we are in the four dimensional or.

575
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:15,930
These things are sometimes counterintuitive.

576
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:26,660
So that's why you don't you have to understand that our with with some math, I'm trying to make sense out of it.

577
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:31,550
Okay. So the rest of you know, these are comments and not important.

578
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:38,180
Um, okay, so we end here. So once they will start the discussion on article three,

579
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:50,480
don't forget to think about the the takes for the first meeting up with a few things for you to.
