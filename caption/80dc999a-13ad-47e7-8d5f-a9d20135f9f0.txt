00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,728
Hi, I'm Carrie Karvonen-Gutierrez, and

2
00:00:07,728 --> 00:00:11,303
I'm a faculty member here in
the Department of Epidemiology.

3
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:16,310
Right now, we're sitting in the research
clinic for the Center for Midlife Science.

4
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:19,490
In this room is where we visit
with our research participants,

5
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,380
we ask them questions, and
we collect their biological specimens.

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:29,120
That information helps us understand about
their health now, and in the future.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,500
I first entered the field of
epidemiology in public health, so

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,440
that I could work to understand the causes
and consequences of human diseases.

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,620
In doing so, much of my work has centered
on researching and understanding

10
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,870
the mechanistic and biological
underpinnings of disease processes.

11
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:53,080
Those samples that we collect from our
participants helps me do just that.

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,070
One of the areas of interest for
major health impact has been genetics.

13
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,100
This field has changed so
rapidly, it has and

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,310
continues to hold promise for
transforming health in medicine.

15
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,320
Since I began working in public health,

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,200
there have been major advances
in the field of genetics.

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,460
This includes advances in
laboratory capabilities,

18
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,650
analytical innovations in computing power.

19
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,905
Most notably, the mapping of the Human
Genome Project, which took 13 years

20
00:01:23,905 --> 00:01:29,495
to complete, was finished in April of
2003, before I reached public health.

21
00:01:29,495 --> 00:01:32,215
These innovations have
allowed us to ask more

22
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:38,726
complex questions about the role
of genetics in health outcomes.

23
00:01:38,726 --> 00:01:41,877
With the increasing interest
in personalized medicine,

24
00:01:41,877 --> 00:01:44,585
the field of genetics is
more relevant than ever.

25
00:01:44,585 --> 00:01:47,749
Epidemiologists are at
the front lines in this field.

26
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:52,728
Working to determine how individual
genetic information can increase or

27
00:01:52,728 --> 00:01:55,305
decrease the likelihood of disease.

28
00:01:55,305 --> 00:02:00,158
In this module, we will learn more
about the biology basics of genetics,

29
00:02:00,158 --> 00:02:04,650
and the role of public
health in this field.

30
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,488
With respect to health outcomes, our
interest is not in genetics solely, but

31
00:02:09,488 --> 00:02:12,670
more broadly in the field of genomics.

32
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,670
Genetics is the study of single genes and
their effects on health.

33
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:23,330
While there are definitely examples of
many diseases dictated by single genes,

34
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:29,160
most diseases are thought to have both
genetic and environmental etiologies.

35
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,770
Thus for public health,
it is more appropriate for

36
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,950
us to use the language of genomics,
rather than genetics.

37
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,530
Genomics is the study of all
of the genes in the genome,

38
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,580
including their interactions.

39
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,353
And thus includes both the genetic and
environmental contributions to disease,

40
00:02:47,353 --> 00:02:48,883
not just one or the other.

41
00:02:48,883 --> 00:02:52,132
The field of genetics is
particularly relevant for

42
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:57,054
many common chronic diseases,
such as cardiovascular disease and asthma.

43
00:02:57,054 --> 00:03:02,470
Which have known genetic risk factors,
as well as environmental risk factors.

44
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,254
And the understanding of their biologic
interaction is really critical to

45
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:07,641
understanding the field.

46
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:13,445
Thus, regardless of your area of research,
even if not explicitly in genetics.

47
00:03:13,445 --> 00:03:17,980
It is likely that you will be confronted
with important findings in your own field

48
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,391
that are related to genetic risk factors.

49
00:03:20,391 --> 00:03:24,807
This module provides the basic
overview of genetics, so

50
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:29,499
that you can be better versed
to understand those findings.

51
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:32,009
DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid,

52
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:37,880
is the chemical blueprint that
directs all of the cell's activities.

53
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:43,060
It provides the genetic information
needed to direct growth, development,

54
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,280
functioning, and
reproduction at the cellular level.

55
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,040
The genetic code is used to synthesize,
or make, RNA.

56
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,820
RNA then helps tell our
body how to make proteins,

57
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,480
this process is called translation.

58
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,340
DNA is organized as a double stranded
helix, as shown on this slide.

59
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,850
The backbone of that helix,

60
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,040
or the outer frame,
is made up by sugar phosphate groups.

61
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,410
Attached to each sugar is one of four
chemical bases, either adenine, thymine,

62
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:21,390
guanine or cytosine,
also known as A, T, G, C.

63
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:26,520
The organization and pattern of these
four bases provides the code needed for

64
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,850
protein synthesis.

65
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,995
Humans have approximately 3
billion base pairs in our DNA.

66
00:04:32,995 --> 00:04:39,092
However, most of our genetic information,
up to 98% of it, is actually non-coding,

67
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:44,495
meaning that no proteins are created based
upon the information in those areas.

68
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:49,010
We'll learn more about those areas later.

69
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,314
Humans store most of our DNA
inside the nucleus of our cells.

70
00:04:53,314 --> 00:04:59,280
And nearly all of our cells have the same
DNA, it's our identical signature.

71
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,570
Some genes contain genetic
information that will code for

72
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,980
proteins, these areas are called exons.

73
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,610
Other genes do not code for
proteins, these are called introns.

74
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,450
Based upon findings from
the Human Genome Project,

75
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:20,480
it is estimated that humans have
approximately 25,000 genes.

76
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,130
Within our cells,
DNA is organized into genes.

77
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,458
Long sections of DNA, including
both exons and introns, are coiled

78
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:33,024
tightly around a histone protein,
forming a unit called a nucleosome.

79
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:40,981
These nucleosomes then are organized
into a unit called a chromosome.

80
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:44,221
Genes are the organizational structure for
our DNA,

81
00:05:44,221 --> 00:05:48,114
they are the basic functional unit for
inherited information.

82
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:54,580
Genes contain our genetic code,
some genes, the exons, code for proteins.

83
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,866
Each person has two
copies of a given gene,

84
00:05:57,866 --> 00:06:03,010
one is received from each of
their biological parents.

85
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:07,300
Understanding the variation in genes
across individuals helps us understand

86
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,450
genetic risk factors for disease.

87
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:15,360
Alleles are forms of a gene with small
differences in the sequence of the DNA

88
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,140
bases, so small differences in those A,
G, T, and C bases.

89
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,910
These alleles can be related to individual
features, such as disease outcomes.

90
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,150
And this information will tell
us both about the mechanism, but

91
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,430
also about the heritability of disease.

92
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,330
Genes can be varying sizes, and so

93
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,666
it is important that the identification
of the gene's location can be found.

94
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:45,740
A gene's locus is its physical
location on a chromosome.

95
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,759
Chromosomes are the ways in which
our body organizes our genes,

96
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,750
it is the organizational structure for
our genes.

97
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,670
We have both autosomal chromosomes and
sex-linked chromosomes.

98
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:03,050
We have 23 pairs of chromosomes or
46 chromosomes total.

99
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,397
22 of those pairs are autosomal,

100
00:07:05,397 --> 00:07:09,083
meaning that they are similar
among males and females.

101
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:14,197
Sex-linked chromosomes are different
between males and females.

102
00:07:14,197 --> 00:07:21,440
Males have an X and a Y chromosome,
whereas females have two X chromosomes.

103
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,960
Regardless, total, in normal humans,

104
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:29,182
the number of chromosomes is 23 pairs,
or 46 chromosomes total.
