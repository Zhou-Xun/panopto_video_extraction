1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:08,760
Um, great. So today we're going to be going over effects modification or interaction.

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,490
So first, just a note on confounding. I talked about the same rule earlier.

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:23,429
Some people do a more complicated sign rule that's covered in this paper to predict the

4
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,970
direction of bias like what your or the direction of the confounding that you're going to have.

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,010
It tends to be helpful for people who have a little bit of trouble,

6
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,260
like kind of thinking through the logic of what the difference if something is is protective versus a risk factor.

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,430
So if you start to find that you're having a little bit of trouble figuring out the the direction of the bias, particularly for protective factors,

8
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:57,060
then I would suggest that you go to this paper and go over it and you'll see that it just kind of uses This is Dag.

9
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,540
And then you've got the signs of B two, one, and B two here, which is what we talked about last time.

10
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,600
Right. If this was like negative, negative, then it would be positive.

11
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:17,070
But then it also takes into account the sign of the relationship between the exposure and the outcome.

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,200
Just if you if you find yourself struggling with that.

13
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,269
Okay. Positive and negative. Actually.

14
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:42,419
Positive. Negative. Or is it like is it. And so the yeah, this may be I would have to look at how they're talking about.

15
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,170
I never I don't really use this paper. Some students find it really helpful, though.

16
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:05,230
Yeah. I think it's not switching, but I can look at it and and make a class announcement.

17
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:14,210
Or Katie can look at it in the class announcement and it should be in the in the papers.

18
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,720
You can just kind of think through this logically. So you don't necessarily need to kind of go through this.

19
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,510
But if you if you have some if you're having more difficulty with the logic, then it can be very helpful.

20
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,870
So for effect, modification and interaction, that's what we're going to be talking about today.

21
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:40,280
It's when two or more risk factors modify the effect of each other with regard to the occurrence or level of a given outcome.

22
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,840
The effect of the exposure on the outcome differs depending on whether another

23
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:51,079
variable the effect of a modifier is present and unlike confounding effect,

24
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,310
modification or interaction is a true effect. That's going to be something that we're going to report on.

25
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,340
It's also called effect measure modification.

26
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,229
I'll just add a little bit of confusion and there is some difference between effect modification interaction.

27
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:08,900
I'll go over that in a moment. But for the purposes of this class, I won't actually make you differentiate.

28
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:15,709
And to add further confusion, some people, although there is a formal difference between them,

29
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:26,300
mixed them up anyways in the textbooks and the in papers, quite often the interaction is more around causal inference.

30
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:34,400
So anyways, you don't have to differentiate between them in this class, but I think it's important for people to know that there there is a,

31
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,840
there is a bit of a difference between the two and that people mix them up all

32
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,590
the time and you will notice that they're mixed up in the different textbooks,

33
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,210
for instance, away and away, and that's okay.

34
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,400
So it is different from our positive negative self. Good. Okay.

35
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:58,100
So for this, this is a way in towards the null rather than positive and negative confounding with the terminology we had used.

36
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:06,600
Okay. So kind of effect modification or reaction in pictures?

37
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:19,290
Right. The effect of A plus B here is much stronger than we see when we just have a present and we'll go over this kind of in detail.

38
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,120
So effect modification or interaction, it's not a bias, right?

39
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,390
It's a true association that provides a more detailed description of the association between the exposure and the outcome.

40
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,680
So it's a finding that you're going to report.

41
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:41,490
It's not a bias to be removed or adjusted for the difference between effect modification and interaction.

42
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,389
Is that effect modification is a situation where we're interested in knowing whether

43
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:50,400
the effects of an intervention or factor varies across levels of another factor,

44
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,990
which may be an individual attribute, such as race or sex.

45
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:00,360
Whereas interaction is when you're actually talking about two different treatments, two different exposures.

46
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:10,080
Right. This really gets a kind of a causal effects because interaction is looking at the causal effects, i.e. the counterfactual.

47
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,360
But that doesn't really make sense to do things with like with like race and sex, etc.

48
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,070
Right. There's not really a counterfactual to that as we discussed earlier.

49
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:27,720
So that's why the difference. But I like I said, you don't have to worry about it too much for the purposes of Section one.

50
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:35,820
So there's also biological interaction, which is where two things actually interact on a biological level.

51
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:43,560
An example of that is smoking and asbestos exposure. So we know that both smoking and asbestos exposure lead to lung cancer.

52
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,299
Asbestos fibers kill cells by inducing a process called program,

53
00:05:48,300 --> 00:06:00,660
so necrosis that leads to the release of a molecule called High Mobility Group one protein H and beta gb1 HMG being one starts

54
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,900
a particular type of inflammatory reaction that causes the release of mutations and factors that promote tumor growth.

55
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:14,730
Right. So that's how asbestos promotes lung cancer carcinogens and cigaret smoke cause DNA damage.

56
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,800
DNA damage leads to tumor formation through a variety of molecular mechanisms.

57
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,200
So when you combine these two things together, it leads to more disease.

58
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:34,950
Right. So that's biological interaction. So we've known for a while, we knew for quite a while that there was like a statistical interaction,

59
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:40,320
that people would see this effect modification or or interaction in studies.

60
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,000
But then, of course, they went in and kind of actually figured out what the mechanism behind it was.

61
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:54,630
Why if you have asbestos in smoking, it's worse than you would expect just based on the risk of asbestos exposure alone or smoking alone.

62
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:04,920
So in a population for interaction, there are people who would have gotten lung cancer if they smoke.

63
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,650
Right. There are people who would have gotten lung cancer if they were exposed to asbestos.

64
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,540
And when there's interaction, there's people who would have gotten lung, or at least for this example,

65
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:20,250
there's people who would have got lung cancer only if they were exposed to asbestos and smoke.

66
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,370
So sufficient causes are kind of a representation of effect, modification or interaction.

67
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:39,730
Here's an example where we're looking at one cancer and saying that the causes in the population are smoking radon,

68
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:46,060
asbestos and, you know, unknown factor, some people who don't have any of the exposure or get it.

69
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,760
And so we see that there are, you know, some people who who will get lung cancer regardless of their exposure.

70
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,350
They don't have any. Right.

71
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,679
Some people with only radon, with only smoking or with only asbestos, but other individuals that actually need this interaction factors.

72
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,800
So both smoking and especially smoking and radon to to get disease.

73
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:18,460
And so another way of looking at that, here we have individuals that have no risk factors here, smoking and asbestos.

74
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:24,340
And we've estimated the effect. Right. So we've got the kind of baseline risk that everybody has for lung cancer.

75
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:33,160
This addition is the excess risk for smoking. Right here is the oh, you know, pointing with my pointer and you may not be able to see that.

76
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:38,560
Okay. Accessories for smoking in orange here. Excess risk for asbestos here in green.

77
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,229
So we've got the smoking risk, the asbestos risk.

78
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:50,590
But on top of that, people that are exposed to both have this additional excess risk right here of smoking that's due to both smoking and asbestos.

79
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:57,100
So it's due to the biological interaction that's occurring and we'll see it as a statistical interaction.

80
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,030
So interaction, whether statistical interaction, what we see in models reflects causal interaction depends on the scale of the measure

81
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:11,860
of the association as well as assumptions made about causal interaction types.

82
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:19,600
So for conceptualizing interaction, there really there are two approaches we're going to go over.

83
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:28,920
The first one is the effect of the exposure of interest. A is not the same across strata of a third variable Z.

84
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:36,400
Then we'll use that same nomenclature throughout. And the second one is the effect of two variables and Z on the outcome.

85
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,670
Y is greater than or less than expected given their individual effects on the outcome.

86
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,630
So the reason to kind of look at it with two different approaches, you'll get the same answer.

87
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,550
That's good news, right? The first one I would say is more intuitive.

88
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:59,830
Like it kind of makes sense about what interaction is. But the second one is really how we kind of model interaction.

89
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:07,390
So there you go. So for the direction of interaction, it can be antagonistic.

90
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:12,610
So the combination of the two exposures is less than the sum of the two exposures individually.

91
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:18,429
So it's less than we would expect from the two exposures or can be synergistic where the

92
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,180
combination of the two exposures is greater than the sum of the two exposures individually.

93
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:27,820
So with asbestos and smoking, was that antagonistic or synergistic in that example?

94
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,590
Synergistic, right, because we have that excess risk associated with it.

95
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,970
We also have interaction on the two different scales, right?

96
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:49,540
So we can have additive interactions. So that's when the absolute difference or the attributable risk model and multiplicative interaction,

97
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:58,300
which is the relative difference or the ratio model for the nomenclature we'll be using for thinking about interaction.

98
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:05,469
The risk of the outcome varies depending on the levels of the two variables and Z according to the following notation.

99
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:12,250
So we've got the probability right of the outcome given neither exposure, so absence of a absence of Z.

100
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,240
There are words that will be p00.

101
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:27,100
p10 is the probability of the outcome of disease given exposure to a in the absence of zp01 probability of disease,

102
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:34,540
given the absence of A and exposure to Z, and then the probability of p11.

103
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,170
Its probability of disease given exposure to both eight and Z.

104
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,920
Right? And then we could put those into our relative risk in the same thing.

105
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,370
The relative risk of those who are exposed to and Z is the probability of those

106
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,809
exposed to and Z over the probability of those that are exposed to neither.

107
00:11:52,810 --> 00:12:00,790
Right. So the reference group for each of these is going to be the individuals who are exposed to neither a Z.

108
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,069
You can do the same sorts of representations for the odds ratio and the risk difference.

109
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:14,049
But in the interest of time, we're talking that right now. Okay, so multiplicative interaction is present when the relative difference,

110
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:21,520
the ratio in the risk of the outcome Y between subjects exposed and those not exposed varies by a third very variable.

111
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:29,500
C by another variable. Right. It's evaluated by calculating the stratum specific relative risk or odds ratios.

112
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,600
Quick question really quick. I feel like I said something I did not mean last time.

113
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,319
Did I tell them that they didn't have to calculate beans or hands a little?

114
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,980
Or just the confidence intervals? Just the confidence intervals.

115
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,159
Okay. I was just making I got I got out of here and then I was like, wait,

116
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,000
did I tell them they didn't have to do the you know, here's what we definitely have to do that.

117
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:56,229
One other thing really quickly. So they just don't forget on the exam, it hasn't matching questions.

118
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,490
So we need the practice exam. We need to replace those matching questions.

119
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:08,290
I can help with that. But so don't do the practice exam yet because it has some material that will not be covered on this exam.

120
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:12,870
We'll split those off and give them to you to practice for the for the next exam as well.

121
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:22,680
A little bit of extra matching practice, but it's just because the where I had that in the course switched a little bit.

122
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:31,990
So the practice exam is actually the exam that I gave you the very first year that I taught.

123
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:38,049
601 Right. So the very first year we made a practice exam and then a real exam,

124
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:43,030
the real exam got beta tested and we got a lot of feedback and we kind of fixed it up a little bit and then made

125
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:48,310
that the practice exam going forward because there were some small wording issues and stuff on the other practices.

126
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,070
Answer All right, multiplicative interaction.

127
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,180
So we're looking at multiplicative interaction.

128
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:07,629
The relative risk of one zero describes the effect of a in the absence of Z, right, relative risk of zero one.

129
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:17,830
So absence of a presence of Z describes the effect of Z in the absence of A and then the relative risk one one describes the total effect of both ANZ,

130
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:24,219
NZ are not going to interact with multiplicative i.e. when the relative risk of those

131
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:30,549
that are exposed to both is equal to the relative risk of those exposed to just Z times,

132
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:36,790
the relative risk of those exposures to just hey, I guess I just wish that's the best version, right?

133
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:45,100
Okay. So we can multiply, we can kind of put this in the reason for that.

134
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,790
So we're substituting in now our terms, right, are probability terms.

135
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:56,079
If you multiply by both sides by the probability of this outcome on those unexposed divided by

136
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:03,489
the probability of those exposed only to Z to both sides here you end up with this right here,

137
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:13,870
which is the probability of those exposed to both and Z over the probability of those exposed to C is

138
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:23,260
equal to the probability of those just exposed to A over the probability of this not exposed to anything.

139
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:30,430
So basically saying in both of those strata, when we've split it out by Z, right, the probability is the same.

140
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:40,130
So the relative risk associated with A remains constant across straight or across different levels of c o.

141
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,330
R. But. Or.

142
00:15:47,770 --> 00:16:07,080
There is no association between exposure. This would be commissioned by the White House is in a war and there is no commanding or or there's no or.

143
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,660
I still think that yeah. It can still be a bit different.

144
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:16,790
Yeah. So can you do that with. I guess it would be approximately equal.

145
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,890
Yeah. You should still be able to substitute in. In.

146
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:27,250
I mean, for all of this, it's kind of approximately equal because it's not necessarily going to be kind of strictly collapsible.

147
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:33,370
Right. We'll go into that a little bit later.

148
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:47,650
Okay. So we're just noticing the left hand side over here is the relative risk of the of a in the presence of Z.

149
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,090
And over here, it's the relative risk of A in the absence of C.

150
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:56,370
And we're just saying those are equal. It just say equal is not always exactly equal.

151
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:01,810
Right. There's some random error that, of course, occurs. So if you still can't see your point or if you could really.

152
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:13,560
There it is. Oh, okay. All right.

153
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,550
So now I know you're all right. Over here.

154
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:23,819
Over here. Okay. So constant across the strata, right?

155
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:29,430
And it's never going to be exactly. Well, except in some classroom examples, it won't be exactly equal.

156
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:39,000
All right. Okay. So here's an example where it is exactly equal.

157
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:47,810
So the absence of multiplicative interaction, the relative risk of Y attributable to a do not differ here by Z.

158
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:54,600
So we split out into this strata. So these individuals are not exposed to Z, these individuals are exposed to Z.

159
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,040
Here's the incidence rates.

160
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:06,600
Notice that they are different across the street, but the incidence density ratio here is going to be the same for the two strata.

161
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:16,140
So that's the absence of multiplicative interaction. Here's an example with the presence of multiplicative interaction.

162
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,450
So once again, we split are split across the Z here.

163
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,320
So absence and presence, right? Incidence rates are different once again.

164
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,479
But when we calculate out the IDR, this is just a one because we're using it as a reference group.

165
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,799
You don't really have to calculate that out. Right? We've got two and five, right.

166
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,920
So those are obviously fairly different from one another.

167
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:47,370
So the relative risk for a is different between those that are exposed to Z or the relative risk of five and those not exposed to Z,

168
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:56,040
a relative risk of two. The ratio, the measures five divided by to 2.5 quantifies the amount of multiplicative interaction present.

169
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:04,700
So that's multiplicative interaction for adaptive interaction. It's when the risk difference.

170
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:13,520
Right. Also critical risk in those exposed to a factor a varies as a function of a third variable and other variables that you write.

171
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,540
So just know on the additive scale rather than the multiplicative scale.

172
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:24,950
So we'll look at that by evaluating is evaluated by calculating the risk difference for those exposed to the risk factor.

173
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:29,640
A For each stratum defined by the levels of the potential effect modifier.

174
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:36,380
So we're doing the same thing. So for additive interaction.

175
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:45,709
And so you do not interact additively if the relative risk in those exposed to A in Z minus one is equal to

176
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:53,180
the relative risk of those exposed to a minus one plus the relative risk of those exposed to Z minus one.

177
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:59,450
So you can substitute in our probabilities here and we get this,

178
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,169
which is the same as the risk difference in those exposed to and Z is equal to the risk

179
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:07,730
difference and those exposed to a plus the risk difference in those exposed to Z.

180
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,840
So you can kind of do a similar trick, right?

181
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:20,509
We're going to add the probability of those that are unexposed minus the probability of those just exposed to Z to both sides.

182
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,200
And we end up with this formula here. Right.

183
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:31,510
So the absence of additive interaction is that the risk difference associated with a in the stratum with

184
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:38,240
exposure to Z is the same as the risk difference associated with a in the stratum without exposure to Z.

185
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:51,790
Okay. So a hypothetical example of the absence of additive interaction, the risk differences of Y attributable to aid do not differ.

186
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,510
In this example, by the third factor Z once again, we've stratified by Z here.

187
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,649
Right. So ten minus kind of zero.

188
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:04,530
Right. At 21 as ten is ten, 40 -30 is ten again.

189
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:11,770
So we get the same risk difference. Hypothetical example of presence of additive interaction.

190
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,209
Right. Stratifying by Z. We've done this again.

191
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:26,650
But now in the absence of Z, the attributable risk or the risk differences is 5.0, whereas in the presence of Z it is 20.0.

192
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:35,140
So the attributable risk for A is larger for those exposed than this for for those not exposed to Z.

193
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:41,889
The difference in these two risk differences, 15 per thousand, which is 21, is five, right?

194
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:52,180
It quantifies the interaction on an additive scale. So this is one way of observing, examining interaction the other way.

195
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,710
Another way is comparing the observed to expected joint effects.

196
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:11,830
I think most would be this one, but why don't we go ahead and hand out the in-class activity and do just just A, an, A, B and G right now.

197
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,770
I have, like, a few more now.

198
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:38,740
I can put those up. If that helps, explain your confusion.

199
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:09,040
So be sure that. But people are still not strictly cops.

200
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:18,160
Right. So I think it's just sort of in certain situations where there's also other measures, you can do it.

201
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:26,130
The problem is not average because I can there are so many other instances of gun violence.

202
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,930
But just by the classic bowling definition. Yeah. Yeah.

203
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:22,360
Yeah. That's.

204
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:51,320
Yeah. I.

205
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:08,280
Every chance I could.

206
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,390
Yeah, I.

207
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:23,330
Yes. It's going to take.

208
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:32,250
All right. But people generally don't.

209
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,160
Yes. No, not yet. Okay. A little more time.

210
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:53,770
I don't answer. If you can't answer, go back and explain.

211
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:07,400
I think they do it in. The table is now.

212
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:15,490
Well, I mean, if you think about it, if you're like doing something and you're like, wasn't sure if you did a good job,

213
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:22,890
you know, because since it was over with you, you might forget to get back at it for a little later.

214
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:31,190
I at my mind cause it is like over a hundred papers together.

215
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:38,580
Everything. And that was. Certainly that wasn't the case.

216
00:31:39,430 --> 00:32:13,470
The case former pastor. You should start coordinating this picture, and I will not let you actually.

217
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:22,769
Oh. It's really funny.

218
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:27,990
Movies like Jerks. Oh, I know.

219
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:34,910
So Derek used to work with Colin's [INAUDIBLE], and they were, like, inseparable, essentially.

220
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:40,150
Yeah. I swear it was like. Coordinated.

221
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:45,250
Yeah, I have followed that. And I want to show you how to do this.

222
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,560
Yeah. No, it was really a but it was it was kind of glorious.

223
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,760
So funny. But then they had this big back together.

224
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:59,420
Oh. No, they don't at all.

225
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:03,260
Which is really weird. It is weird. Yeah. I want to know what's going on.

226
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:15,600
Yeah, somebody comes on that. We all continue to notice what's really over there anymore.

227
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:26,360
No, I don't think so. Knowing Derek, if you wait. Oh.

228
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:55,510
Oh, oh. Looks like people are still working on it, as if these workers don't have the same safety.

229
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:12,370
Yes. I think we're used to.

230
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:31,500
Now they can figure it out. All right.

231
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,230
We're going to get going on this. So I wouldn't as long as we don't run behind.

232
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,569
I'm going to try to go over these in class,

233
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:45,630
because I became convinced after the exam that a lot of people are working on the class activities, or at least some of them in class.

234
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,480
And then you feel good about it in class, and we don't go over it.

235
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:55,920
And then you never go back and look at the key and realize that, you know, you didn't get some of the exceptions or nuances or whatever.

236
00:34:55,950 --> 00:35:05,010
So some of you missed one of the exam questions was exactly from an in class activity, just a section of that.

237
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,969
So anyway, so as much as I can, rather than skipping them,

238
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:16,680
I will go over the keys just because I realize people get busy right in class and don't think about the class activity necessarily.

239
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,040
I'm going to really run behind that. I will ask you to look at the key.

240
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,750
So here we go. The the risk. So we're going to stratify by asbestos exposure.

241
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:35,700
Right. And then look at the risk difference in those that are exposed as exposed and the difference in those that are not exposed to asbestos.

242
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:41,430
So we have the risk in those that are exposed to asbestos and smoke,

243
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:49,860
minus the risk that those just exposed to asbestos and we get 17 per thousand over ten years.

244
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:54,360
Do you make sure we're telling the the time period there.

245
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,130
Right. And then in the unexposed strata.

246
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,380
Right we get ten minus one nine 4000 average over ten years.

247
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:14,819
And so for the. The risk ratio or relative risk de 20 divided by three,

248
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:27,300
which is 6.7 for those that are exposed to 7% over ten years and then ten over that ten year time period for those unexposed to asbestos.

249
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:41,970
So do you think we see effects modification on the absolute scale or we from alcoholism area for that additive.

250
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:45,360
We see additive interaction something that we.

251
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,390
Absolute scale is 17 the same as mine? Nope.

252
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:57,140
Right. So, yes, we see additive interaction because, you know,

253
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:06,940
17 is different from nine and you can quantify it if you want and say the difference is eight per thousand over a ten year time period.

254
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,640
That's due to the interaction is there.

255
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,540
So this is a perfect one, right? Is there a multiplicative interaction?

256
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:23,120
6.7 ten the same? Probably not, no.

257
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:31,570
Right. So, yes, we would say there's multiplicative interaction between asbestos and smoking as well.

258
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:35,560
Here.

259
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:45,470
We talk a little bit more about these differences later because one thing you'll notice probably right away, right, is that this is this is greater.

260
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:50,000
Right. We can quantify this. We actually get 0.67.

261
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:56,540
Right. So we're seeing synergism here. Antagonism here actually gets worse.

262
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:06,410
Look at the equations. Like where you have like are are 112 people are 105 are zero one.

263
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,040
Uh huh. I'm unclear what the rr11 is.

264
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:14,809
That's the. Sorry. This is the risk in the one.

265
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:22,010
One is. Oh, well, this is just the expenses of exposure.

266
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:27,950
Yeah. Because we didn't necessarily think of the slide. It's the risk ratio for one one.

267
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:33,470
Which slide. Sorry. If you go back where you had the equations to quantify.

268
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:39,200
Like this one or should I just be.

269
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:48,410
Ah, one one. Or is it our, it's the relative risk that's source of risk minus one because this is additive.

270
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:56,750
This is on the additive scale. So, so what the R one one quarter does that correspond.

271
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:04,040
Um, the r11 would be the this.

272
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:25,819
Okay. Usually you can use that equation if you've already figured out the if you're if if we're

273
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:30,070
like do multiplicative now do additive and you've already figured out the relative risks,

274
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:38,120
you could choose to do it that way. Okay. But it's easier to understand if you actually just kind of calculate out fully.

275
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:49,720
All right? Yeah. Okay.

276
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:55,509
So that's one way, right, that we're going to look and we'll do a second way.

277
00:39:55,510 --> 00:40:00,550
And then the rest of this worksheet actually goes on the second way and then just talks a little bit about interaction.

278
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,450
So we can also compare observed and expected joint effects.

279
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:10,750
Interaction is present when the observed joint effect of A and Z differ from the expected joint effect,

280
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,840
expected joint effects can be estimated by assuming that the effects of an Z or Independent.

281
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:25,060
Thus, to compare observed and expected joint effects, it's necessary to estimate their independent effects.

282
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:30,640
Okay, so just looking at this in a picture, right, we've got A and Z.

283
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:37,839
These are the expected and the observed joint effects is the same here.

284
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,850
Right. And so then we would say that there's no interaction here.

285
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:49,600
However, we've got the expected and observed joint effects are different.

286
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,990
Right. So we expect this amount and we see some greater amount of interaction.

287
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:59,440
Of course, it also could be lots more, but it doesn't always have to be synergistic.

288
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:08,170
And in fact, here, right here, there's negative interaction where it's less than the observed is less than the expected joint effects.

289
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,440
So for detector detection of additive interaction,

290
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:22,290
the presence of additive interaction is evaluated by comparing the observed and expected joint effects.

291
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:31,770
The joint effect of A and Z is estimated as the rhythmic sum of the independent effects measured by the attributable risks in exposed individuals.

292
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:34,500
So this is for additive right on the absolute scale.

293
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:45,240
So here, right, we've got our observed incidence rates, the observed attributable risks over here, right?

294
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:53,399
So our expected joint attributable risk is just going to you're going to get that by adding these two together, the risk and the individual groups.

295
00:41:53,400 --> 00:42:00,120
Right, which is 30. And that is indeed what we see when people are exposed to both and Z.

296
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,120
Right. So the risk individuals that are exposed to Z and not exposed to A plus,

297
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:16,050
the risk and individuals that are not exposed to Z and exposed to A is equal to the risk in the individuals that are exposed to both.

298
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:24,000
So here we would then conclude that there is no additive interaction.

299
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,059
Example two. Right. In this case, we're going to see additive interactions.

300
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:36,760
So we're just going to do the same thing. We're going to calculate the observed attributable risks.

301
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:49,569
Right here, though, we have a difference between the expected and the observed attributable risk for the expected joint.

302
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:55,930
Attributable risk would be ten plus 20, which is 30. But for the observed, we have 50, right?

303
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:01,360
So the conclusion is that additive interaction is present.

304
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:09,460
And you could say the observed effect of 50 per thousand is 20 per thousand greater than the expected joint effect of 30 per thousand.

305
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,510
Okay. So there's no additive interaction.

306
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:34,159
If the risk in those exposed to both minus the risk and those exposed to neither is equal to the risk in those exposed to a only

307
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:43,190
minus the risk in those not exposed to either plus the risk of those exposed to Z only minus the risk of those exposed to neither.

308
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:53,440
So therefore you end up with this equation, right, for when you have additive interaction or the additive interactions equal to.

309
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:58,970
And that's where just moving everything on one side. Right. Okay.

310
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:07,450
So that's additive interaction. So I put the equations and most people have an easier time just kind of thinking about it the way we did the tables.

311
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,280
Some people prefer the equations and so they were there.

312
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:20,510
So for detection of multiple interaction, the presence of multiplicative interaction is evaluated by comparing observed and expected joint effects.

313
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:28,160
The joint effective and Z is estimated as the product of the independent effects measured by the relative risk in the exposed individuals.

314
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,200
Right. So here we're doing the same thing, right?

315
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:38,840
We're going to look at the incidence and then use that to calculate the observed relative risk.

316
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:43,490
So the expected joint relative risk in this case will be three times two.

317
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:51,740
Right, which is six. And that is indeed what we see in the individuals that are exposed to both the Z and A.

318
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:56,390
So the conclusion would be there's no multiplicative interaction.

319
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,970
And this example we then we do have multiplicative interaction rate.

320
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:12,120
So our expected joint effect again is going to be 30 times 20, right.

321
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:17,550
Or sorry, three times to relative risk over here.

322
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:28,050
And then the observed relative risk is nine. So the conclusion would be that we have multiplicative interactions, the ratio of the observed expected.

323
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:33,330
Nine divided by six equals 1.5, which quantifies the multiplicative interaction.

324
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:48,230
Here are the formulas if you prefer to do things but do things by formula for if no multiplicative interaction here,

325
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:54,780
therefore this is going to quantify the amount of multiplicative interaction.

326
00:45:55,830 --> 00:46:00,690
All right. So for the expected joint effects, there's some pluses and minuses to this.

327
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:05,849
One of the big pluses is similar to how interaction is approached in regression modeling.

328
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:12,030
So it's good to understand conceptually it's easier to understand causal interactions.

329
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:20,010
The minuses are it's kind of less intuitive than the first approach and you have to do more calculations.

330
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,620
So if we don't specify what you need to do, you can choose either approach, right?

331
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:34,680
You will get the same answer. But we may also say tell you which approach to take.

332
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:41,459
So for additive and multiplicative interaction, for two separate risk factors.

333
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,660
So both things are a risk factor.

334
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:51,540
It's possible to have additive or multiplicative antagonism, no additive interaction and multiple flick of antagonism,

335
00:46:51,930 --> 00:47:03,420
additive synergism and multiplicative antagonism, additive synergism and no multiplicative interaction, both additive and multiplicative synergism.

336
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:11,940
So the presence and the direction will depend on the sizes of the relative risk for individuals exposed to both factors.

337
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,950
Compared to those exposed to only one,

338
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:23,100
an additive and multiplicative interaction refer only to patterns in the relative risk in the population subgroups and the risk in the

339
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:32,700
population subgroups experience various combinations of exposures and they don't have any necessarily have any biological meaning.

340
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:37,380
We should actually say just the risk for the relative risk there. So we should correct the slide.

341
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:47,520
So when two factors are a risk factor for disease, if there's no interaction on the additive scale,

342
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:50,940
there will be interaction on the multiplicative scale.

343
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:59,070
And if there's no interaction on the multiplicative scale, there will be interaction on the additive scale.

344
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:17,020
But that only applies when they're both risk factors for the disease. So for this is just kind of presenting additive and multiplicative interaction.

345
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:28,479
This is on the log scale down here. So over here we have just the absence of additive interaction notice on the units.

346
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:39,040
And unlike normal scale, we see the same slope here, right, with the presence of and this is the risk rate per per thousand for example.

347
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:49,510
But in the presence of additive interaction, then we see that those that have are exposed to Z have a different slope right here than

348
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:54,370
those that are not exposed to see or you see more difference right in the in the two

349
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:06,610
categories of either not exposed to a and so same thing down here multiplicative interaction

350
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:15,399
right now on the log scale right so 30 divided by 15 is true 20 divided by ten too.

351
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:29,380
So we're seeing the same relative risk here, whereas 90 divided by 15 is six and 20 divided by ten is is two.

352
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:56,300
There's always some form of. So you just it goes back to.

353
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:01,520
Prior knowledge. There is not enough action.

354
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,630
What you have is appropriate time and actionable.

355
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:19,850
But. So I mean, it's I guess by really you mean causal interaction because it's statistical interaction that you need to deal with regardless.

356
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:24,770
You're going to have to rely on prior knowledge, I think, for that.

357
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:29,270
So. All right.

358
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:37,820
So additive interaction in case control studies, there's an alternative formulation that can be used for as incidence data can not be calculated.

359
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,930
So here, here's that formula.

360
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:53,040
All right. And with that, we are going to take a ten minute break and finish the in class activity.

361
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:03,540
So using the second method to calculate out the interaction.

362
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:11,190
I this part. Yeah.

363
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:18,830
And then I'm gonna fix the restaurant, and we can actually put a note in the same place for the nightly news.

364
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:23,930
You know, I don't like that paper very much. I think there's an illness.

365
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,930
I mean, it's hopeful, but necessary because you should be able to digest it this way.

366
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:34,360
I know. And that's why we all came in. Like having like like you guys are doing it different ways.

367
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:40,030
We don't know what's happening, but I want to figure it out that, like, you're talking about different things, and it's fine.

368
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:10,760
I still think it makes I still prefer to just use the positive and negative and only multiply the two because it takes you in the right direction,

369
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:18,840
right to use the actual definitions we use and vice versa.

370
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:23,220
Yeah. So because that's how I think about it.

371
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:29,030
Like if it's like negatively impacting. Telling the.

372
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:40,080
But people struggle with the temptation there. So yeah, yeah, that's confusing once you're on the other side of the scale moving in.

373
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:43,740
So that's why I like the positive because you just it all goes in the same way. Yeah.

374
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:47,650
So you just have to say, oh, well, this is how it's going to.

375
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:54,790
Because positive bias is going to take it towards the north, whereas if it was a risk factor, it would take it away from the north.

376
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:58,630
Yeah, right. Because yeah, that would still be positive.

377
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:02,740
So I just feel like this makes it so. Yeah, it does.

378
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,460
But it's like. But, but some people think.

379
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:13,930
Yeah, because on the contrary they, they ask like tell us like in relation to the now and then we have to do it this way.

380
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:23,130
That's right. That's right. Depends on who writes the question.

381
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:32,060
So it's nice to know both because people ask. Oh.

382
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:46,630
People get confused fans and I don't think I'm sure they understand like that's what's happening.

383
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:58,350
Yeah, I know.

384
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:06,290
But then, like, I was like, I don't know, Stanley. That's how we got in this case.

385
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:35,590
Yeah. Can you?

386
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:44,660
Logistics as you can do it in cost.

387
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:52,610
Because it's the next classroom. Yeah, I'm not usually.

388
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:13,690
I know I probably could be here for. I think it's you know, they work on things like.

389
00:55:20,410 --> 00:59:18,910
Just for. So.

390
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:53,610
For. I.

391
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:29,510
So. You're right.

392
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:33,920
She just never knows. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

393
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:45,450
So I was just saying that and I fixed it on the slide, but it shouldn't have said relative risk here.

394
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:50,060
Come back to it. We'll fix the version.

395
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:54,070
That's up. Here it is.

396
01:00:54,070 --> 01:01:06,430
That's what I'm waiting for. But 46.

397
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:20,590
Yes, I know it's not 26 billion, but it is slide 25.

398
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:36,270
So there we go. Should read it said relative risk before it.

399
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:43,919
It should just say that the risk that you know, there's actually a way to do it with relative risk.

400
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,760
But that's not the right one. Right. Okay.

401
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:58,049
So just correct that if you're not like if you take notes on it and say your flights should look like this instead of saying the relative risk of one,

402
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:02,690
one minus one. Oh, sorry.

403
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:08,070
I think it's also in clarity on slide.

404
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:18,060
So that's. So 18 is multiplicative though.

405
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,920
Okay, so it should be a relative risk.

406
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:26,600
So yeah, the slide 18 is good. All right.

407
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:37,550
Thank you for catching that. What I'm waiting for now.

408
01:02:39,330 --> 01:03:12,970
Okay. Just like you told.

409
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:22,180
Okay. So I'm going.

410
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:39,280
You. We're just like now.

411
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:44,470
Okay. Okay. Okay.

412
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:14,700
Yes. You know, I fixed it, but let me take a look.

413
01:04:18,430 --> 01:06:06,280
Yes. I mean, are you. All right.

414
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:12,610
We're supposed to be taking a break to write, so you guys get a few more minutes.

415
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:24,780
7 minutes, but how many minutes? We will start back up in 5 minutes.

416
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:32,750
Do you think some. Oh, no.

417
01:06:34,520 --> 01:11:25,990
And. Right.

418
01:12:55,400 --> 01:13:00,890
Well, the pumpkin casserole comes immediately from your table.

419
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:05,780
Any problems? It doesn't cancel out enough. Its one.

420
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:17,270
All right. We're going to get started back up. So, right.

421
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:22,250
We're comparing the observed to the expected in this particular case.

422
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:27,349
So our observed was 90 are expected was nine plus two.

423
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:30,680
So that's 11. And we end up with with eight.

424
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:40,310
Right. And the same things over here are observed with 20 are expected with ten times three, which is 30.

425
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,220
Right. 20 is not equal to 30.

426
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:52,040
So we have multiplicative interaction and you can then quantify it 20 over 30 and you end up with that same 0.67 that we got before.

427
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:56,900
So just a different way of looking at it.

428
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:03,590
So the final question is, does the exposure to asbestos affect the association between smoking and cancer?

429
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:11,750
Well, short answer, yes, but that's not one of these moments where, like looking at the key is helpful.

430
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:16,370
Right, because we don't want to just see a yes there. So I would say on the absolute scale,

431
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:23,690
the effect of smoking on lung cancer is greater in asbestos exposed individuals than in individuals that are not exposed to lung cancer.

432
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:34,760
And if those exposed individuals and individuals that are not exposed to smoking, to asbestos, sorry, that should say it says lung cancer in the case.

433
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:40,070
Therefore, we see an additive interaction that is synergistic.

434
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:45,139
However, we see the opposite effect when we examine interaction on a multiplicative scale.

435
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:51,410
On the relative scale, the risk ratio for smoking in lung cancer is lower in asbestos exposed individuals than in asbestos

436
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:57,710
non exposed individuals there for we see a multiplicative interaction that is antagonistic.

437
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:03,409
Right. So you want to address it on both scale since we were looking at having you look at

438
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:08,390
it on those scales and then comment on whether it's synergistic or antagonistic.

439
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:16,840
Any questions about the two different methods? What is the interpretation?

440
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:23,559
So it's we don't really use it very much, but it's kind of quantifying it.

441
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:28,300
But the .67, since it's less than one, we know that it's antagonistic.

442
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:32,110
It is a way to quantify it. It's not really used very much.

443
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:35,200
Eight. You're right. It's synergistic.

444
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:39,490
It isn't negative, but.

445
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:48,219
I mean, it was interpreted on a few slides, but we're not going to ask you to interpret that that difference we're more looking for.

446
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:52,690
Is it antagonistic or synergistic? All right.

447
01:15:53,260 --> 01:16:00,640
So effect modification in an interaction and confounding both effect modification and confounding may be present at any at the same time.

448
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:04,990
By the way, you'll notice I switch back and forth between effect modification and interaction

449
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:09,070
other than the ones liberally specifically talking about the differences.

450
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:14,200
Don't worry about it and I'm okay with you switching back into with it as well.

451
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:24,339
Sometimes I do a slash, sometimes I just say one like here currently just one effect modification.

452
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:29,560
But this is back modification or interaction confounding so they can both be present.

453
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:35,410
So collapse ability is a property of some measures of association that can indicate,

454
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:40,540
if confounding or effect modification is impacting the association across strata.

455
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:49,920
Not all measures of association or collapsible only measures that are averages or proportions of the total population are going to be collapsible.

456
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:57,100
So we had already mentioned about the odds ratio. So that is we can do the risk difference, risk ratio, etc.

457
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:01,690
So when we talk about collapse ability, we have things that are strictly collapsible.

458
01:17:02,110 --> 01:17:08,230
The measure does not vary across strata and is equal to the marginal or crude value when confounding is not present.

459
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:15,640
And then you can have not strictly collapsible. The measure varies across strata and may not be equal to the marginal value.

460
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:22,240
There are summary stratified measures equal to the marginal value, so that is it's class or across for you.

461
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:26,110
So we also have non collapse ability of strata.

462
01:17:26,290 --> 01:17:31,569
So effect modification or interaction is one the association of the exposure and the disease is different

463
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:37,990
between the strata of a third variable identified as a confounder and the crude association non stratified.

464
01:17:38,290 --> 01:17:40,810
Then the data are not collapsible.

465
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:54,070
So here we have risk ratio is not is not collapsible because it varies across the the presence and absence of Z here.

466
01:17:56,170 --> 01:18:04,149
Don't worry too much about the collapse stability terminology for this class, which is maybe slightly beyond 601,

467
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:12,309
but it comes up again later and then people have a little bit of difficulty like sometimes associating collapse ability with effect,

468
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:16,690
more efficient or interaction and confounding.

469
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:20,530
And so we added it in just to kind of talk about it.

470
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:23,890
But you are not going to be tested on plausibility, so.

471
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:34,940
Well, not now. If you're a Ph.D. student at epidemiology, it is totally fair game and competency exam.

472
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:38,460
And in later classes, I will say. But but not in six months.

473
01:18:38,970 --> 01:18:47,730
All right. Okay. So we are going to go through assessing effects, modification and confounding.

474
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:50,850
So, like I said, they can both be present at the same time.

475
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:58,470
There's a series of steps that can be followed to assess the possibility of the joint presence of effects, modification and confounding.

476
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:06,090
When effect modification is present, the strata specific measures should be presented, right?

477
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:13,350
So the steps that we're going to go through are, is that you calculate the crude measure of association.

478
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:20,880
You then stratify the data by the potential effect modifier confounder if you're going to calculate the straightest specific measures of association.

479
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:25,230
Use the test for homogeneity to compare the stratified associations.

480
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:29,160
You ask the question Are the associations homogenous? If they are,

481
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:35,880
then you calculate the adjusted measure of association and then you compare the adjusted to with the crude to examine the direction of confounding.

482
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:44,460
If they are not, you know, they're different between the strata, then you will report the or present the straight specific measures of association.

483
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:56,010
There are several test for consistency across strata. Got the Wolfe method the personal day maximum likelihood as the meter.

484
01:19:58,230 --> 01:20:03,930
So this is the formula for the wolf test for a for homogeneity of effect.

485
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:12,060
And here we're basically calculating the weights which are based on the variance.

486
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:18,610
Right. The will test for homogeneity.

487
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:25,480
The null hypothesis is that the measure of association is homogeneous across homogeneous across the street.

488
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:31,690
And then we're looking at a chi square statistic, right, with k minus one degrees of freedom.

489
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:43,040
Where is the number of straight that we have? So this can also be applied to manual hands or estimates.

490
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:46,970
And here is here are the formulas for that.

491
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:52,700
So here the average would be the then the male hands all adjusted measure.

492
01:20:54,180 --> 01:21:00,900
All right. We'll go through an example. We've got coronary heart disease and biological sex.

493
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:05,640
So the first step is to calculate the crude measure of association.

494
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:12,510
We're doing an odds ratio here of 200 times 200, over 400 times 100.

495
01:21:15,130 --> 01:21:16,560
We get an odds ratio of one.

496
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:25,620
But let's say we're concerned about ferritin levels, which is a measure of iron in the blood, and we decide we want to stratify or look at ferritin.

497
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:33,090
So we'll stratify by ferritin. We're not sure if it's an effect modifier or potentially a factor modifier confounder.

498
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:43,170
So we stratify into high ferritin and low ferritin here, and then we'll calculate the street specific odds ratios.

499
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:52,280
So here the odds ratio in the High Group is 3.0, and in the low group we end up with 0.33.

500
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:59,050
Um, so, uh, I mean, in a way, you could almost stop there.

501
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:02,389
Do we think those are different? Probably.

502
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:05,450
Right. Like, but, but we're going to keep going.

503
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:17,360
So the first step, right. For for calculating the the test for homogeneity is to compare those stratified associations.

504
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:22,700
So we're going to calculate a mental handle odds ratio here.

505
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:28,490
And when we do that, we end up with 1.59.

506
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:36,880
And then we're going to use the test for homogeneity to compare the stratified associations.

507
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:40,660
So here, right, these are just the individual cells for the variance.

508
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:49,750
We end up with 40.29. So a P is less than 0.001.

509
01:22:53,440 --> 01:23:01,540
Step five is only the associations and in the same grade, P is less than 0.001.

510
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:09,310
So we're going to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the stratified estimates differ differ significantly from the mental handle estimate.

511
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:16,149
Not really surprised, right? You could have basically told that from the original numbers since one was quite protective and

512
01:23:16,150 --> 01:23:20,590
the other one was kind of noticeable a risk factor but could be due to a small sample size.

513
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:30,340
So ferritin is an effect modifier or in other words, the relationship between biological sex and CHP varies by ferritin level.

514
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:43,540
Question. And therefore, I guess generally if we were to measure or calculate the association between variation and stratified by sex,

515
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:48,430
would we see the same result or not?

516
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:53,620
It doesn't work that way. I think you should see the same.

517
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:57,760
You should see the same result. You. We're not as rigid.

518
01:23:57,990 --> 01:24:04,920
You definitely see the same result because when you think about like the logistic equation that you would have,

519
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:08,970
right, you're going to have the same the same term for the interaction term.

520
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:15,070
So. All right. So is confounding present. So the adjusted odds ratio is 1.5.

521
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:21,420
Crude odds ratio is 1.0. Confounding may be present.

522
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:30,040
Right, because they are different. Yes, we can we can debate about the purposes of 601.

523
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:36,250
We will say probably may be. Let's assume the ratio approximates.

524
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:42,130
If you're assuming the odds ratio approximates the the risk ratio that we are, we are good.

525
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:49,500
And you can worry about when it doesn't. And 824 if you're taking that class.

526
01:24:49,510 --> 01:25:05,050
So maybe I should put a little note here and tell people to assume that, okay, so these are these are risk ratios here just to make it easier.

527
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:12,790
All right. So we're going to go through and evaluate whether we think confounding and interaction are present.

528
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:17,709
You know what you do if there's interaction present, you're going to report this trade specific, right?

529
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:22,690
You're not going to report the I adjusted.

530
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:28,690
So in a way, it doesn't matter that much if compounding is present.

531
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:31,780
But, you know, it's still nice to know if there's if there's compounding.

532
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:37,240
All right. So we've got a crude relative estimate of a relative risk of 6.0.

533
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:43,420
First stratum is 3.0. The second straight on is 3.0 and the adjusted relative estimate is 3.0.

534
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:49,209
Do we have confounding present? What are we comparing?

535
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:52,750
We're comparing the adjusted to the crude.

536
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:59,050
Right. So there's definitely confounding. And is there an interaction?

537
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:04,440
Now have to put the answer up there. But yeah. So there we're going to compare it straight out.

538
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:07,899
One, two, 3 to 2. Okay. So what about this?

539
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:14,950
The crude estimate is 1.0 straight or 14.0 straight up two is 0.5.

540
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:19,000
And the adjusted relative estimate is 2.5. Do we have confounding?

541
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:24,330
Yeah. Do we have interaction? Yeah.

542
01:26:27,190 --> 01:26:30,520
All right. Here we have a relative risk of four.

543
01:26:30,670 --> 01:26:38,079
Straight on one is one, straight up two is one. And the adjusted relative estimate is one is confounding.

544
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,260
Present is interaction.

545
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:54,160
All right. The next one, we've got a crude relative estimate of five straight and one 5 to 5 adjusted relative estimate of five confounding present,

546
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:59,829
no interaction. Okay.

547
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:10,090
And last but not least, crude relative estimate of one straight M of four and then straight 14.0 straight M to 0.25.

548
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:14,350
Adjusted relative estimate of one is confounding.

549
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:18,270
Present. No. Is interaction present?

550
01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:28,530
Yes. Right. So, you know, a note, of course, like they're not always as pretty as this.

551
01:27:28,530 --> 01:27:33,430
And sometimes it could be a little bit of a judgment call.

552
01:27:33,450 --> 01:27:37,800
They won't usually be exactly the same if you work out. I got one more real example.

553
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:47,570
Okay. So you got plenty of time to do this.

554
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:58,920
All right. We're going to go over the logistic regression model using this same coronary heart disease and biological sex example.

555
01:28:00,890 --> 01:28:04,970
We do this in part because we realized years ago, although I think some of it has changed,

556
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:11,240
that bio stats wasn't covering a few things, at least for like the classes that a lot of the AP students were taking.

557
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:15,190
And it was very surprising that, like, if you ask somebody to do a fight, you know,

558
01:28:15,210 --> 01:28:21,170
if you gave them a one year estimate for an odds ratio and you asked them to calculate it off for five years or ten years,

559
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:27,110
they would just like multiply it by ten. We saw a lot of that happening, so we kind of covered a logistic model.

560
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:32,570
We'll go through how to actually get the coefficients on logistic models.

561
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:36,590
Unless you all tell me right now that you've all done it in bio stats class.

562
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:42,080
Have you all done that in bio stats class? Can you go from a table and calculate out the coefficients?

563
01:28:45,830 --> 01:28:50,170
Okay. Okay. We'll just go over it. We'll go over a 90% chance it's going to be on the comps.

564
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:57,290
Yeah. Yeah, there's a good chance. Yeah. Okay. So the logistic model can be written in several different ways.

565
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:06,800
Right. I think you're probably all familiar with that. And we're going to go over how to calculate our logistic model.

566
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:13,580
We're going to use this. I just pulled the slide in. Right. We're going to use this example.

567
01:29:14,030 --> 01:29:19,470
So these numbers. So we have it stratified out by a high ferritin and low ferritin.

568
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:24,979
And what we're going to do is populate out the the equation.

569
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:31,130
So we'll calculate out the intercept and then B1, B2 and B three here.

570
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:42,260
So we've got the log odds of disease is equal to the intercept, plus B one times sex plus B two times ferritin plus B three times six times ferritin.

571
01:29:42,770 --> 01:29:46,790
Right. Because we had decided there was interaction here.

572
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:57,470
So the first step is that we're going to solve for that intercept, and we do that by taking the natural log.

573
01:29:57,730 --> 01:30:01,590
We decided women are going to be the unexposed group here, right?

574
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:13,110
So they are exposed. So the natural log in women with low ferritin, that's our completely unexposed group and we end up with -0.69315.

575
01:30:13,890 --> 01:30:17,010
Right? So then now we have this formula.

576
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:25,020
So the log odds of disease is equal to -0.69315, the intercept plus B one sex plus B two sex plus three sex.

577
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:31,500
So we're solving for a right first by studying ferritin and sex to their base values.

578
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:37,050
And here we decided, like I said, that women was was a was unexposed.

579
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:46,530
So here it's women with with low ferritin. We're now going to solve for b one.

580
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:54,630
And the way that we do this is by setting sex to male and keeping it in the low ferritin group.

581
01:30:55,020 --> 01:31:03,960
So we've got the natural log of 50 divided by 300, which is equal to -1.79176.

582
01:31:04,950 --> 01:31:10,020
And that's going to be equal to our intercept plus b one.

583
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:15,270
So then we just solve for B one there.

584
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:19,890
All right. And then we'll plug that into our equation here.

585
01:31:20,310 --> 01:31:34,500
So it's just really just easy, kind of stepwise going through this next we want to solve for me two by setting we're going to set 6 to 0.

586
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:42,329
So back to the women and then we're going to go over here to our high ferritin levels, right?

587
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:54,990
So that's why this is zero down here and we end up with with B two equals zero.

588
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:05,610
And then we're going to solve by B three by setting 6 to 1 and then ferritin to one.

589
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:10,049
Right? So here we're using men with high ferritin. Natural.

590
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:17,130
Look at that. Once again, solve for B three and we end up with 2.197225.

591
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:24,950
And then you write out the full equation here. Okay.

592
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:32,250
So I can then ask you right to compare one person to another person.

593
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:38,070
So then I can ask you something like that. Let's compare the odds of a male with low ferritin to a female with low ferritin.

594
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:41,939
Right. She opted in. The male is one right here.

595
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:56,010
Female zero zero. Just plug it into this equation for each person and you can calculate an odds ratio and we end up with 0.33.

596
01:33:00,110 --> 01:33:06,200
Alternatively and a little bit faster, right? You can just compute the absolute difference in values between the comparison.

597
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:11,900
So you can always get rid of the intercept because it's always going to cancel out because both people have the intercept.

598
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:20,810
So this is still a little bit a little bit shorter. All right.

599
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:29,290
So for logistic regression, right, this equation is going to describe the data, whether it's stratified by ferritin or sex.

600
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:36,459
Obviously, we're looking at the relationships of multiple variables simultaneously being adjusted

601
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:41,920
for and then the coefficient estimates are derived using maximum likelihood techniques.

602
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:58,179
So we have another example of logistic regression and here we've calculated out the coefficient.

603
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:12,839
So you're not going from a table. And we're going to ask you to calculate the odds ratio of Alzheimer disease for a 76 year old of low X who

604
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:21,000
uses benzodiazepines compared to a 67 year old of low X who does not use benzodiazepines and interpret it.

605
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:27,150
So can you go ahead and do that? Calculate the log odds for each of those individuals and then the odds ratio.

606
01:34:30,440 --> 01:38:58,420
The answer is on the next slide. When in Serbia.

607
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:04,580
Okay. When us review under 24 hours.

608
01:39:04,910 --> 01:39:08,610
Well, I spent my entire 24 hours this morning.

609
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:17,900
You know, it's just disappointing that we had a whole discussion because there's now three other papers, by the way.

610
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:21,620
We only beat the other like the other. 15 by 24 hours.

611
01:39:22,430 --> 01:39:28,190
It's completely different looks. I think the question, you know, should they be working on things that will be contributing things 24 hours?

612
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:33,720
Uh. The other group.

613
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:38,150
Their study isn't actually as good as ours, in my opinion, although they do have to sell.

614
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:42,800
So there's some other pieces but their samples, so it doesn't set it up as that.

615
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:48,270
They don't know people's infection histories and stuff like that. So like, well, they just don't have any samples.

616
01:39:48,270 --> 01:39:56,710
So they kind of put together. He says, you know, they should have to sell.

617
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:11,310
43 stars. It's Dan Burrow where he.

618
01:40:17,050 --> 01:40:22,660
Up. All right.

619
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:29,850
So the answer is on the next slide.

620
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:34,180
Um, uh, and we interpret it down here.

621
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:41,620
So which is the odds of Alzheimer's disease among 76 year olds of low SES taking benzodiazepines residing in an independent living or

622
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:50,290
assisted living facilities in North Carolina is 3.39 times higher than the odds in 67 year olds of low SRS that did not use benzo.

623
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:56,440
Diazepam means anybody see any issue with this interpretation.

624
01:40:57,190 --> 01:41:04,140
There may be an issue with it. It's actually interpreted as a disease ODS rather than an exposure odds.

625
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:10,690
I don't think we said what the study design was, so there could be an issue with it depending on the study design.

626
01:41:11,590 --> 01:41:16,090
Um, yeah, I think, I think it was a case control.

627
01:41:16,090 --> 01:41:24,400
So it's, it's all right. Um, so last slide on converting units.

628
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:30,159
So let's say the investigators fit a second model with age as a continuous variable.

629
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:40,030
They found a one year increase in the agents model to be an R of 1.1 to calculate the odds ratio for a 15 year increase in age.

630
01:41:40,930 --> 01:41:50,620
So we can take that the natural log of that odds ratio and then we do the exponential rate, that natural log times 15 and we get 5.7.

631
01:41:51,070 --> 01:41:56,050
Or you can just do 1.12 to the 15. So that also give you 5.7.

632
01:41:56,350 --> 01:42:01,989
But I don't want to see you multiplying it by 15, the odds ratio and we do actually see a lot of that.

633
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:03,310
So make sure that's not what you're doing.

634
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:08,709
Another thing just kind of of note when you're presenting papers, particularly for infectious disease people,

635
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:15,310
but even in chronic diseases, people have trouble with odds ratios like this that are quite low on a continuous scale.

636
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:18,430
So it's often depending if it makes sense,

637
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:28,599
it's often good to present it at her ten years in the text rather than per year to really highlight the impact of that factor.

638
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:32,980
If something is on a continuous scale, it's kind of thinking about doing that.

639
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:40,240
You know, we get that a lot like or I've seen that a lot from other reviewers kind of complaining.

640
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:46,330
They're like, Oh yeah, but it's only, you know, a, a relative risk, say of, of 1.2.

641
01:42:46,330 --> 01:42:48,670
And I'm like, yeah, but it's per year.

642
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:51,922
So if there's a 30 year different, you know, in there, but this one's zero relative risk of two over the 30 years, that's a lot of time, right?
