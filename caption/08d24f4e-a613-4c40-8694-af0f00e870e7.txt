1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:28,160
I don't know, testing here like that, using Microsoft and Intel and clearly not micromanaging.

2
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:44,360
I want you to look.

3
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,040
Okay. I'm going to say so.

4
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,470
So table on hand.

5
00:00:53,570 --> 00:01:03,990
Our our case study is particularly possibly disturbing to a lot of kids, but we're also teaching one of the most important theories in politics.

6
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:11,870
Important explains a lot about the world, and in part because for some reason I can't quite fathom it is the political theory that people in health,

7
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:18,030
politics and policy specifically really, really like to use abuse, overuse, generally.

8
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:25,740
Things like the skeleton key for all this is. Put another way or I came here when they had no political scientists.

9
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:35,850
This was like a long time ago. They said, All right, well, master students, we just got out of politics class and there was an uprising.

10
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,120
And what they demanded was to be taught this theory because the executive master's

11
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,040
students had pointed out that this is not the theory that is known to everyone.

12
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,660
So even if you think it's posh, be prepared for a lot of people to regard it as Mary Queen of Scots understand the world.

13
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,130
That said, I've checked the downloads. You're all wonderful.

14
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,970
I'm just terrified that my success is always a podcaster and it's also very reasonable stuff.

15
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:08,350
So most of today is going to be exercise. And like I said, it's about the of all the shootings which happened by, you know,

16
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:13,769
we have a wide and diverse battery of mass shooting events in America, in the United States.

17
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,570
It's like one of the things we do in a sort of big way. So there's a lot of diversity for you to choose them.

18
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,059
But, well, there's probably for a number of reasons. One of the most horrific recent events,

19
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,790
it's certainly had more dramatic effect on the political system than your average run of the mill slaughter of innocent people.

20
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,190
Or going to do with this case study is a pliable history of this framework.

21
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,880
So you have some experience of using it and also, of course,

22
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,350
explore the extent to which you all that was a window of opportunity in a sense

23
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,190
were playing out kind of a slightly alternative version of what actually happened.

24
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,860
So multiple streams. You all know there's three streams, right?

25
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,520
This policy policy is where you have the debates.

26
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,600
The people who live in policy streams are policy entrepreneurs.

27
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,110
Ideas exist in policy debates to the extent that people are willing to promote them.

28
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,670
Meaning a good idea for policy does not produce a policy.

29
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,070
Having somebody who wants to advocate for an idea produces a policy idea.

30
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,790
I can't understand why this is enough, because there's two implications that really matter.

31
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,220
One of them is that if you don't have a policy entrepreneur, you might as well not have a policy idea at all.

32
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,920
And the second is that it's the availability of policy entrepreneurs that decides whether an idea is heard.

33
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,960
So there's a lot of policy entrepreneurs.

34
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,860
You're going to help the idea be put forth, even if it's an absolutely terrible idea that explains the recurrence.

35
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:48,780
A lot of really useless ideas in health care. So bear that in mind, right?

36
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,360
If you have an idea. Learn either find yourself an entrepreneur or make that your career.

37
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:59,690
Because simply having a good idea is the policy application sections of all these articles you read in all your

38
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:05,090
classes suggest to simply understanding the existence of a problem and recommending a solution doesn't do anything.

39
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,590
Well, the first thing you need is politicians. You need somebody who thinks they're going to make a mark.

40
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,730
Politicians have got to get elected. They have got to get reelected.

41
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,650
They almost never can achieve anything outside elected office.

42
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,990
We get very excited when a politician rationally decides that more power is to be had elsewhere.

43
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,420
And you know what? Frequently they're wrong.

44
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:30,700
You know, running the best funded advocacy organization in America is still less fun than being in the Senate.

45
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,040
And so if you're advocating for an idea, you've got to cater to that.

46
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:43,270
Politicians need to make the mark right. You need to cater to gretchen whitmer's need when she was elected to do something about the roads.

47
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:49,180
Right. Gretchen whitmer is going to be receptive to people who are going to help her solve the

48
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,450
roads because for those of you who were in Michigan back when she was first elected,

49
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:57,819
Fix the Damn Roads was basically her campaign slogan. And by the way, the roads have got somewhat better,

50
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,980
but the standard was so low that one time some news crew was reporting on after the blast, an hour and a half,

51
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:11,140
there was a really big pothole, pothole so famous that they television and while they were recording live,

52
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,489
a car hit the pothole and the hubcap came off and almost decapitated.

53
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,640
The anchor saw a guy who was sitting right over his head.

54
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,819
Hopefully it may happen this time and Gretchen Whitmer got elected on that basis,

55
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:28,750
but that meant that in order to make a mark, she had to do something about the roads.

56
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,790
But you will also notice that the roads are no longer the center of the Michigan political agenda.

57
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:39,009
We've been busy for the last few years. Which also tells you about the sense of the unexpectedness.

58
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:44,020
Which brings us to the problem. Right when you fix the damn roads was the basis of the gubernatorial election.

59
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:52,339
Nobody anticipated a global pandemic. You know, when we were debating whatever it was, we debated in the 2020 presidential election,

60
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,700
nobody was planning on Vladimir Putin launching a plan or Europe.

61
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,980
That's the problem with strength. Now, one hand, the problem stream is anybody has a problem, right?

62
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:09,310
The pilots in the doomed 730 sevens that crashed were part of the problem stream,

63
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:15,080
even though I don't think that was their intention when they got to work that day. George Floyd is part of the problem, a strain?

64
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:20,570
I really don't think he was planning on that at all. But on the other hand, what confronts the problem?

65
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:26,300
Australians, the media. Right. So a lot of the time the people on the problem stream are the media.

66
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,330
Is the deficit a problem? It depends on your media consumption.

67
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,550
Our health care costs cost the problem. It depends on your media consumption.

68
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,890
Is health uninsurance a problem again? Where do you get your information?

69
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,740
So those are the three strings. When they come together, we have an agenda, right?

70
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,910
We call that coupling and opens a window of opportunity.

71
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:58,340
So when there's a policy idea that we can discuss in relation to politicians who think they can make a mark and a problem that we all agree on.

72
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,740
Then you can do something so classically after school shootings in the United States.

73
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,760
The most common thing was what? Sorry.

74
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,870
Thoughts and prayers. Thoughts and prayers. No more action, work and new people.

75
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,080
We don't just thank you. What else do we do? Also, I work to liberalize gun laws.

76
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,700
Because if the problem is that the school shootings are going to be an excuse for Democrats to take away your guns,

77
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:33,339
that the solution is to adopt a policy that will increase the availability of guns and decrease the restrictiveness of gun ownership.

78
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,550
So there's going to be good guys with guns to stop the bad guys with guns.

79
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,129
Which is why if you just count the most common response to a high profile school shooting in the United

80
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:47,410
States is legislative proposals as it introduced legislation that would liberalize gun legislation.

81
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:56,320
And by a smaller margin. Those are also the most likely things to actually be passed because there's a lot of state legislatures where the

82
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:02,920
dominant political tendency sees the problem as Democrats taking away your guns and the policies is liberalization.

83
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,990
Okay. That's what gets on the agenda. Few things to remember.

84
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,030
First of all, the probabilities. Stuff happens.

85
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,750
Right. Land war in Europe. Not plan.

86
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,320
Okay. COVID 19 pandemic, not plan.

87
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,999
Things happen. You don't anticipate them. So all of this is probabilistic.

88
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,950
You can have the best policy idea in the world.

89
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:37,460
I have two articles that I'm very proud of, which just got published in British journals that I hope to help influence the policy debate.

90
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,000
They got published this week. Do you see any plan ahead once the British debate.

91
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:52,600
How can I possibly break through with essays about how to govern the National Health Service when they're busy running a six minute long segment?

92
00:08:52,600 --> 00:09:02,020
On how the Queens beekeeper broke the news to his bees. I'm not sure I actually read what he said.

93
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:07,410
The bees seem to be taking it well in while I'm out there with my policy idea.

94
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,600
Listen to me. You have a problem. Solve it. No bees.

95
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:18,600
Okay. Second thing. Setting the agenda is not the same thing as having a vote.

96
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,320
You've all been in meetings, right? What you're talking about doesn't necessarily pass.

97
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,970
Remember that? It's very common.

98
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:31,810
This is the mistake that most people make when they use this theory to say, once you've got a policy problem in politics, they all get together.

99
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:38,310
Legislation passes. Great. Ask the people who support universal health care in the United States how well that works.

100
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:46,490
Even better, ask all the people who want a cap and trade. We have cap and trade legislation passed by the House of Representatives for two years.

101
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:53,290
It is not the law of the land. We had anti-lynching law introduced basically every year for seven years now.

102
00:09:54,070 --> 00:10:01,030
That didn't make it all. Just got on the agenda. This vision of politics next.

103
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,309
And this is teeing up next year when there's going to be a wonderful core

104
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,060
curriculum from all of us to replace the one that I know you all love so much.

105
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:22,639
In which for the whole fall semester and half of winter, people will learn about how to identify a problem, quantify the problem, identify a solution.

106
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,610
And then starting around about March of the first year, the teams will start to learn how to advocate for a solution.

107
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,910
Can you tell I wasn't on the planning committee for this? You start with your solution and you find a problem.

108
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:42,360
Come on, people. This is politics one on one. And if there isn't a problem that needs your solution, you make one.

109
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:49,200
Because you believe in your solution. This is why I say put your hand up.

110
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,660
If you can think of any problem in health care or public health that you haven't been told will be solved by more expenditure on health like.

111
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,450
That's not because every single problem in the world will be solved by a larger I.T. budget.

112
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,530
It's because there's a lot of people who really believe in health I.T. plus many people who are capable in health I.T.

113
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,090
I'm toying with saying blockchain just to change it up a little bit. Okay.

114
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,440
Finally, if this sounds a lot like organizational life to you.

115
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:27,740
That's because the theory was applied to American politics after previously modeling decision making in larger organizations.

116
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,680
So even if you have successfully so far confirmed your belief that this is crazy talent

117
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,990
and you want nothing to do with American politics that don't work in the health sector.

118
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,740
But B, this is also how organizational politics runs everywhere.

119
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,770
Okay, here's the exercise. Take a second.

120
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:49,750
Groups of three or four, maximum 20 groups, so we end up with 21.

121
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:56,150
There's going to be a little bit of reshuffling. And you're going to help us to do this.

122
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:04,140
Come down and pick up paper and you'll you'll pick up the paper on the post-its later form the groups.

123
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,420
Quickly don't run around. Just grab people next to you.

124
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,100
I hope you like each other. I just feel like I'm right here.

125
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:42,090
I think that people like you are going to have a lot of fun.

126
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:52,500
Okay. Okay. Have you all got to use one more person?

127
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:58,530
Is there anybody here who doesn't look, I'm going. Okay, but we're going to have to count off.

128
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:02,820
This probably means we have one too many grown ups and then there might need to be a little bit of each other.

129
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,020
Okay, so we'll start over here. Kind of like this.

130
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,990
I just got 21. Right.

131
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:22,430
I'm here to look at. I had that.

132
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:33,640
Eight. Guys.

133
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:48,980
And we just stole that. And I. I teach management, dammit.

134
00:13:51,470 --> 00:14:05,220
We're not going again. Okay, with that.

135
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:14,270
Okay, great. I think we're going to be fine. Does anybody want to join a slightly below strike group?

136
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,510
Oh, that is for calendar grades, but they are all members.

137
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:32,770
Is there anybody, guys? A group of three people? What can one of you from these groups get over that way?

138
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:37,920
Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Yeah.

139
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,680
That's pretty hot water. Yeah.

140
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:53,300
Thank you. All right, so here's the fun bits.

141
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:58,790
As you can see, I didn't really care what numbers you are as long as you all had numbers.

142
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:05,330
Now we're going to allocate people and you're going to basically do any version of the exercise before.

143
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:24,140
So figure out who you are. Okay.

144
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:29,729
Just go. Just for fun, everybody.

145
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,260
We can all read it on the same order. Shout out who you are.

146
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:43,700
So we all know who's in the room. From Brian Schatz for Everytown for Gun Safety.

147
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,730
I like Lady Gaga.

148
00:15:45,950 --> 00:16:12,950
There are times I got one third of an ad in Republicans that said there were okay guys who said okay to the NRA, carry on, shout out who you are.

149
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:20,530
Fox News written by Greg Abbott.

150
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,700
I work with internal border police.

151
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,510
Said we found your cell phone.

152
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:39,160
Let's ask you to the end because there are some fox. Well, no, it's going to be down.

153
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,710
We'll get back to you about. They're all good.

154
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:46,890
Whenever. You okay. CNN. Yeah.

155
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,540
This is cool. Where is it?

156
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:56,310
Okay. Now.

157
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:02,660
Okay. I think. I think you get the part, Madeleine Lawrence.

158
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:09,040
You don't. You just get people. Okay.

159
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,720
You see, they have an asterisk. This is the color coding.

160
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,540
So if you want asterisks, you're part of the problem.

161
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:28,720
You make people aware of the problem, and you have almost as if you have to your politician and you have great idea how to make office.

162
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,810
And if you have three, that you're in policy process.

163
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:41,450
Here's what we're going to do. Now, you all are happy signing up with Fox, following in the Governor of Texas and all your other new jobs.

164
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:50,270
I hope the text makes it clear you do a sit down strategizing exercise.

165
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,020
This leads up to a soundbite reflecting your position, which you write on your paper.

166
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,900
These are the big sheets of paper for me to thinking about. We'll do that for 20 minutes.

167
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,470
You're framing as you've all that news has just broken. The first news is coming in.

168
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:12,810
What's going on? And over the next 24 hours, when we start to learn about the bulk of reform,

169
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:20,910
the police and all the other things about what we want, news cycle, you have to figure out what to do, what to say.

170
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,110
You want a soundbite?

171
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,530
And can I point out that complete silence is a position and one of the actors in this room frequently takes exactly that position.

172
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:35,100
Okay. So figure out what you're doing. Write your soundbite on your on your thought.

173
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:44,940
Your paper wants to get to the wall, and then you get to circulate your posters and sign up.

174
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:53,130
And the point of the exercise, what we're doing here is partly to think about how difficult it is to get folic acid even to do it,

175
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,760
and also to mimic the free for all that happens whenever there's an event.

176
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,070
Because while much of the country is glued to the television watching this astonishing, awful event,

177
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,680
it's your job to try to figure out how to make policy or get ratings or whatever else you do.

178
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,800
Question. Take it away.

179
00:19:13,920 --> 00:20:46,050
I'm really looking forward to finding out what's going to be on TV. I think one of the first time I was like, I to remember what I told you.

180
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:32,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

181
00:21:43,800 --> 00:22:04,140
That every time I look, I know how it is.

182
00:22:08,880 --> 00:23:12,540
And, you know, I have to say, I was like, oh, yeah, let's do something different.

183
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:49,450
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

184
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:56,340
I think the reason this is always test and I think they're going to answer some.

185
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:12,380
So it's not news. And so they're going to be like, okay, let's say there are words associated with soundbite.

186
00:24:13,340 --> 00:25:10,020
And they write their name on it. So whatever they are and what we do is we have to say, well, I guess, yes, this is what is great, right?

187
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:33,530
It's like, oh yeah, goodness.

188
00:25:49,780 --> 00:26:03,360
Yeah, know.

189
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:21,930
Yeah, yeah.

190
00:26:32,630 --> 00:27:08,030
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

191
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:42,540
Yes. I absolutely agree with you and I agree with you on that.

192
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:14,170
Yeah, I'm sure you are.

193
00:28:16,090 --> 00:29:57,810
Yes, I do. Is not going to be a one size fits all.

194
00:30:19,220 --> 00:31:33,500
I don't know what they want me to ask you the same question.

195
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:43,150
Just to recap, what you're trying to do is analysis to figure out how your organization's response to the events, even though they were to get there.

196
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:48,210
So you write the name of your organization on the top of the hour on your process.

197
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,700
Your analysis feeds into a big piece that takes your position, right?

198
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:57,800
Because this is about how we set the agenda. So your position is about all that now?

199
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:03,380
That's my point. I am organization X and I stay at home because you can.

200
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,760
But we then going to do it.

201
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:11,010
Once you've done that, it will go to a public phase where people are going to be circulating and saying, hey, we're the NRA.

202
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:15,200
We don't agree with that. Or Everytown for Gun Safety.

203
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,670
What do you see? Wants to very clearly express two things.

204
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:25,400
What is your name? And the other is what you're saying the afternoon after the shooting.

205
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:30,740
And in order to try shooting the agenda in a way you prefer.

206
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:38,930
So the discussion of sits down has better is to prepare your statement, which is your big agenda.

207
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,650
And so you get the free speech around something that you like.

208
00:32:44,730 --> 00:33:37,470
Okay. For example, if you want to use you.

209
00:33:53,330 --> 00:34:02,790
Yes, that's right.

210
00:34:03,860 --> 00:35:32,120
Because this is this is this is this is what I'm going to have to ask you literally right now.

211
00:35:37,310 --> 00:36:18,020
And I that there are things that we've broken down.

212
00:36:26,500 --> 00:37:41,800
I'd like to hear about something like this.

213
00:38:15,580 --> 00:39:15,080
What I find interesting, my oldest son and my son, I don't have any.

214
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:23,670
We had a lot of people gathered together to do some minutes and then we'll talk some more.

215
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:31,400
All right. Let's be honest.

216
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:58,270
I probably wouldn't recognize the.

217
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:44,970
You have to be ready to take care of everything.

218
00:40:48,300 --> 00:41:32,790
Yeah, that we are going to help you out.

219
00:41:41,780 --> 00:42:00,430
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

220
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:32,900
Like I said, I don't know.

221
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:55,000
I was looking for an excuse.

222
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:16,460
Yeah, I was like, okay, I didn't like that.

223
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:21,670
Okay, so here's what we're going to do.

224
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:30,100
You are going to see, based on everybody else's statement about what they want to be on the agenda when you find yourself aligned with.

225
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:40,780
Okay. So let's say you're in the policy stream like around this environment and you can write your name on it,

226
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:45,040
so you're going to get it right and then going to stick.

227
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:53,109
Your approving little sticker on the poster is where you think, Yeah, I can talk with these people, so I'm going to just take a wild guess.

228
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:58,240
The big difference Law Center is not going to sit there as opposed to stick it on the NRA table.

229
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:08,380
But you might go round to discover that, yeah, you think CNN's on the right track or you're disappointed to see on the right track a little bit.

230
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:13,450
So each of you will do it, right? So that's where the color coding comes in.

231
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:22,479
Orange, is it? You're in a problem screen. So media people basically get orange they tax policy you think and if you're a politician

232
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,719
use greens so that helps to you will write down how on a very positive signal what

233
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,100
we're going to be seeing here is which organizations seem to have the best shot in

234
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:37,510
the context of this particular event and generate this free speech to come together.

235
00:44:40,390 --> 00:45:03,360
So start circulating and look for something useful can happen here.

236
00:45:04,510 --> 00:46:26,280
Yeah. I just want to find out what you're really doing.

237
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:29,830
All right? Oh, yeah.

238
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:52,350
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

239
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:14,940
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

240
00:47:17,570 --> 00:49:21,530
You know, I mean, I know, but important to, you know, I am not happily married and I guess that's what I heard.

241
00:49:36,230 --> 00:50:05,970
Like I was, you know.

242
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:32,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

243
00:50:50,370 --> 00:51:16,780
Yeah. Well, that's how I say.

244
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:41,530
Now. I love you.

245
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:12,400
And I was right.

246
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:35,970
Okay. It is also historic.

247
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:39,790
You should have a look at it and see what you do see.

248
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:44,090
Highly recommended. Have a look at what they had in front of me.

249
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:50,920
So you're going to see how you do it in terms of influencing the agenda.

250
00:52:55,670 --> 00:54:10,090
Now, I know that this is what this is all about.

251
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:38,190
So I'm actually glad that you believe that to. And that's what actually will determine what the organizations in terms of the sort of accomplishments.

252
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:42,850
So I hope you just take a moment.

253
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,340
What do you think that you might have learned either from going around or from working on the project?

254
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:52,690
So I had a chat. What did you learn about your stance and its effects?

255
00:54:53,590 --> 00:55:41,800
Like did you make any friends? And what was hard about this Galaxy group first and rewarding experience for as I.

256
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:39,690
Right at the end of the section.

257
00:56:40,950 --> 00:58:29,400
And I will tell you how much I feel like I want to get out there, you know?

258
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:42,740
So, you know, you just the reporters will report back on the challenges for you.

259
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:53,150
What was that all about? Figuring out what to do in the aftermath of this problem and how do you think you did this exasperating

260
00:58:53,470 --> 00:59:00,270
organization and success to be to really be damaged successful community trying to 20 years.

261
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:08,630
So you're trying to figure out how to do that.

262
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:15,690
All right. Okay. So he doesn't see the difference.

263
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:27,840
We have a very firm stance against the deportation and we are tired of our kids and communities being affected by the violence.

264
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:32,790
And we think regulation needs to happen right now. We are strongly advocating for that to happen.

265
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:43,620
I think we are pretty happy with the amount of support, policy support or from both Gavin Newsom and Debbie Stabenow.

266
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:50,310
So we think we can do that. And I think this was a pretty good day for us.

267
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:59,040
We don't think we've lost support from anyone who didn't support us in the first place, and I think we've gained support in some places.

268
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,950
We didn't think we would like The View. I really go with that.

269
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:07,200
But, you know, getting our message out there is the most important thing.

270
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:16,530
And thank you. And I think I don't underestimate that view because the view is precisely people who aren't political,

271
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:19,980
obsessive, and therefore might think, oh, great, that is wonderful.

272
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:28,650
Okay, we like baseball and it's working.

273
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:42,310
And so we are critical and we are trying to be true to who we are and support our organization as opposed to really reflect the facts and the truth,

274
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:53,520
but also be cognizant of the impact that it's really had on our communities and how that impacts, particularly those who are reporting as well.

275
01:00:55,080 --> 01:01:02,819
So we were our savior essentially is talking about being truthful and really emphasizing the chaos and

276
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:09,750
the trauma that came from it and highlighting the key words and being able to get out the problem.

277
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:19,170
And we found it. In terms of how we can balance race and then try to gain some allies.

278
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:27,759
I think if we were introduced, that would have been allies from Fox News and CNN and other news outlets.

279
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:39,370
But I think otherwise, we did relatively well of getting some support that I think we probably had previously, but from other politicians as well.

280
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:45,580
All right, guys, thank you.

281
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:50,500
Let's consider the Houston Chronicle as one.

282
01:01:50,860 --> 01:02:03,700
Hi, my name's I work for Everytown for Gun Safety, which is a large gun violence prevention organization that supports moms, teachers, students.

283
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:13,170
And so what we found was tricky was it was pretty clear for us who would side with the big things and politicians about

284
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:19,690
for us to use this with the types of problems without parties to choose because we kind of looking at what they wrote,

285
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:24,790
a lot of them big like The New York Times, we weren't really sure they were saying much.

286
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:31,750
And then we were trying to line with, I don't know how you the the media,

287
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:35,800
but and then try to look at kind of who was aligning with the sources like the

288
01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:41,259
Chronicle and see a little bit more clear and the clear stance that is Chronicle.

289
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:45,570
We're looking at people that are pressing against us, that we're aligning with the powerful.

290
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:52,420
So we're trying to decide based on that as kind of who are we align ourselves with by putting our city on this.

291
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:56,110
So that was where we had the hardest time. We went back and forth a lot.

292
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:01,989
So that was kind of the biggest challenge, I'd say. So we'd be divided if we were all over the Chronicle.

293
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:05,050
Then you're skeptical it happen? Yeah, yeah.

294
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:10,870
I guess what it was like. I don't know what they would say about it necessarily.

295
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:17,440
Again, sorry. Are you okay?

296
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:19,030
Is there anybody find out about.

297
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:27,300
Just by labeling these things, I can see a number of people who might feel distinctly like they did to try this party.

298
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:40,890
I guess Fox News has. Hey, so we're Fox News, we're doing classical music reporting company.

299
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:49,899
And we were confused that I think we were we were happy for a moment in our chamber and a couple

300
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:55,910
of reporters get loose and there are some safety nets on the Houston Chronicle and wrote this.

301
01:03:56,950 --> 01:04:01,589
So we spent most of day reining them back in. Yeah.

302
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:13,659
I mean, we agreed that some of the people who already agreed with us and it was a classic for us to hear anyone else doing that,

303
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:17,970
like, you know, you deliver the box.

304
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:30,070
So for Governor Greg Abbott, I think we got a little bit of bad information in the beginning for our soundbites.

305
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:36,840
So the first thing we said was this terrible thing hurts children, yadda, yadda, yadda.

306
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:40,040
But that's getting a lot worse.

307
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:44,270
Law enforcement agents that worked under us hadn't done the job.

308
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,600
So I now we all know that took place, but now I know.

309
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,780
And I guess he didn't know that right up front.

310
01:04:52,350 --> 01:05:02,530
So he came out. These soundbites suffer quite a bit from other classes and enlisted, but most of the teachers acted in some schools and more.

311
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:08,100
We've seen the persecution and so forth, so we got a lot of support from folks you might expect.

312
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:15,570
Fraternal Order of Police obviously supports us. We support them because we are kind of the executive branch.

313
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:20,100
We kind of under our control and that's about it.

314
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:28,790
Did the police have a good make no mistake, Arsenal, okay.

315
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:40,200
As a military criminal or the police? But there was a lot of reports coming out of you on this line for hours.

316
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:46,110
There's a lot prior to lock. And good.

317
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:56,530
We have a very active course on Fox to love and view and interesting ally in this conflict.

318
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:02,650
And we have the Heritage Foundation as well. It's not a large theater.

319
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:06,580
It was just devastated by the mass shooting that took place that involved these rather elementary school.

320
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:15,220
Our thoughts and condolences go out to all involved. These changes. I recognize the difficulty of responding to police, a mass shooting by the police.

321
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:18,640
And we kind of commended the officers for their bravery.

322
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:25,240
But we also, because of the mixed reports early on about procedures were followed and all that,

323
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:35,889
we said that we employ the proper training procedures, continue to do that with our officers, which is just the position you don't want to be in.

324
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:39,640
The more we learn about what actually happened. Let's try it. Why did the movie?

325
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:45,700
I can see a number of groups that had absolutely fantastic day. I didn't feel like they had a good one.

326
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:57,700
I mean, you could basically just tell visually look for a poster that's got a ton of different Post-its in all three colors.

327
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:02,250
All right. Senator Stabenow, is that the floor?

328
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:12,870
Okay. So we had Senator Larry sat up this week like you're better than no Democrat.

329
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:16,170
So she probably likes to talk about gun reform.

330
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:26,070
So we already to do so our soundbite that we broke it, she said to the family of New Orleans advocates for gun reform.

331
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:33,170
And then she explicitly called out Republicans who are responsible for the legislation.

332
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:38,550
So we didn't get much support, and I think it's because we highlighted mental health.

333
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:42,420
So that's usually an area that Democrats, Republicans be on.

334
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:50,310
But whether we would get anything beyond what was passed is we were skeptical of just the kind of Republicans.

335
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:54,000
One point is that part of going on,

336
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,480
how those things are effective is she realized that she can get mental health and it's bipartisan agreement and nothing else works.

337
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:06,629
So there's a lot of mental health policy being made by Senator Stabenow because she's really,

338
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:09,650
really good at building these low key coalitions around mental health,

339
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:14,310
even when the surrounding issue is something like guns, where compromise is extremely positive.

340
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:19,910
Now, speaking of Senator Stabenow in front of the Foreign Office, it.

341
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:32,000
John Cornyn is, of course, a very thoughtful Senate Republican. And from Texas, he woke up to what I would like a bad day.

342
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:35,750
I would go so furious, Senator John Cornyn.

343
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:41,180
And we have to kind of we felt like he tries to appease both sides.

344
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:45,320
So he is like a Republican. He's got their political party backing.

345
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:49,459
He's also a big supporter of the Second Amendment.

346
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:57,590
One website has an A-plus rating. But he also does support some gun regulation measures.

347
01:08:58,610 --> 01:09:02,810
And he was booed at the GOP convention for supporting this legislation.

348
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:12,230
And that's where the Democrats have a hard time figuring out where that balance was and what he's trying to do and would support us.

349
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:18,910
He wants his support. But I think that's also why we got a lot of support, is he tries to straddle sides.

350
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:29,790
So I think we are stuck on like Brian Schatz, Debbie Stabenow, also, we have some Democrats in there as well, but then also Fox News.

351
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:36,090
And I was kind of surprised we had Everytown for Gun Safety supporting us on their position.

352
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:41,870
A pretty strong being on that as well. I'm not sure I support that.

353
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:50,730
I'm tempted to ask every chance. But I think we should ask Brian Schatz if he agrees about this characterization of his day.

354
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:55,370
Oh, sorry. He's a pacifist.

355
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:58,830
Is what's going. Come on.

356
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:12,960
All right. So we are asking the Democratic politicians why he tweeted after all these shootings in combination.

357
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,520
There is no time. Kids are being slaughtered and there's no time.

358
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:21,700
We can't have any tolerance is taking ten years to its way through our political system.

359
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:33,860
We have to fix this now for us. So just a year before the shooting happened, he was supporting legislation such as Bill US 5 to 9,

360
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:37,879
also known as Ireland's prevention research requirements,

361
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:44,420
where he authorized the conversion of the CBC to conduct research on fire safety and violence prevention.

362
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:55,430
So we know that in the future he will continue to fight as well as introduce legislation and better position and to emphasize agenda.

363
01:10:56,060 --> 01:11:00,800
And he's doing pretty well in terms of e-cigarettes, not like the Climate Champions League yet.

364
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:08,090
So we were surprised that we aligned with John with what was on that sheet.

365
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:16,610
Now that we know that he's very supported by the NRA, that might not be the case, but at least for its stance on the background checks specifically.

366
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:23,140
So I guess one question I wonder is a couple of groups that like to get preference ads.

367
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:26,690
Forget two of the most valuable media properties in America today.

368
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:30,470
Basically, we're looking for. I.

369
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:34,970
Nobody who watches Fox News because they find it undermines change.

370
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:39,180
Almost nobody reads The New York Times to get their minds changed on politics.

371
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:46,780
The view. T-Bone. These are really, really desirable properties.

372
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:50,710
You draw them in, president drops everything you do an interview with them. All of this a lot.

373
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:59,780
It has to be a device.

374
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:15,229
I think that certainly speaking for a team of three were pretty lonely just because our stance was to not take a stance while sort of taking a stance,

375
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:25,360
I guess, which is kind of hard to describe. But they they do elevate voices of of left leaning like all the type, he says,

376
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:30,950
but without the infrastructure of actually, like having people actionable things to do.

377
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,950
So taking action on that now,

378
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:44,570
which is somewhat and very desirable for them to have an idea to move people who really are opposed to the political campaigns team go.

379
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:50,610
But what happened was they were like militants and Trump was elected and they took this incredible swing to the left.

380
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:58,730
It became like nonstop hashtag resist. And that editorial line really well, like you're Donald Trump and suddenly you have your whiteness.

381
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:03,190
Finding their footing in that market is a little bit trickier for them. Okay.

382
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:06,860
I think I saw it really to their credit. First of all, congratulations.

383
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:11,870
The other to the wall did a great job is that I think if you did this as a portrayal of what actually happened in Washington,

384
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:18,290
people say that's what happens. Okay, both the mix of match and the initial stances.

385
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:22,750
There's a couple of people who just had their day destroyed on the back wall there.

386
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:30,860
Greg Abbott, Fraternal Order of Police. Fox None of this is what you want to talk and you're left looking incoherent and going to ground to try.

387
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,890
Likewise the people who are basically running in a boxer echo chamber.

388
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:40,040
It didn't make a lot of friends. But did you intend to write?

389
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:45,770
So Gavin Newsom over there, governor of California, is entirely irrelevant to Texas governor.

390
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:53,030
He's entirely irrelevant. The federal government is highly irrelevant to when you go primary to be the Democratic candidate after July.

391
01:13:54,050 --> 01:13:59,110
Everybody's got a lot of friends in the Democratic Party. The Heritage Foundation.

392
01:13:59,110 --> 01:14:02,410
Their goal is to empower world within the Republican Party. I agree with that.

393
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:11,980
But meanwhile, if you actually want legislation, look at the senators and the people who manage to converge around, you know, common sense stuff.

394
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:18,910
Right. That's the through line between Houston Chronicle and Brian Schatz, Debbie Stabenow and John Cornyn.

395
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:24,970
And that's why they got lots of stickers, in particular the politicians who are saying, this is the way I can advance myself.

396
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:30,190
And that's how every town ends up with not is because they willing to say,

397
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:35,030
we're going to back off on some of our policy goals in order to get anything at all.

398
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:39,530
And somehow we fight the NRA for people.

399
01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:42,920
But frankly, people have a lot to say and we do.

400
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:49,850
So there were four interesting political actors that the NRA would have just held on a bill that would have been left with two friends, maybe three.

401
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:56,950
So moral of the story. Perhaps some issues are just terrible and you might under the desk.

402
01:14:56,950 --> 01:15:02,560
Sorry, going at it like desperately trying to talk about something else, which he did.

403
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:10,990
He said he said he rounded up all the Texas law enforcement officers, set up the Rio Bravo in that bus for migrants from Chicago.

404
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:16,690
He's doing his best to stop. I'm going to specifically that.

405
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:24,910
But if you actually want to get something done, coming up with something that gets the most people at all, reinforces the message is the trick.

406
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:29,889
And if you're not even trying, if you're down to do stuff like the Heritage Foundation's because you're playing a different game,

407
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:34,299
which is to build your own power within a very specific group. And you always want to lash out.

408
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:37,780
In politics, we like to emphasize the people who are trying to make life for the whole country

409
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:42,849
stand in a corner but always pay attention to the people whose actual task is that?

410
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:47,110
They're trying to become a leader within a faction by being more extreme than compromisers.

411
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,200
And anyways, that's the problem, right?
