1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:13,620
I don't. Yeah.

2
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,720
Yeah, yeah. I mean, she's.

3
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:35,760
Hey. Good morning, everyone. He had a restful, relaxing break, maybe even a little bit of fun.

4
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,530
Who knows? Um, to see you all again Tuesday.

5
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,450
As a reminder, we don't have a lecture today.

6
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,250
That's good. We have a couple of, uh, kind of in class breakout activities going.

7
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:56,240
Uh, just coincidentally, today was our second opportunity of no lecture and maybe to have class outdoors.

8
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,160
I don't think we want to do that today, although it looks like it's going to warm up again for the weekend.

9
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,790
Looks like it's going to be really nice. So maybe starting later tomorrow.

10
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,540
But unfortunately for us, the timing has worked out for that.

11
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:19,280
Uh, yeah. So our two agenda items for the class period today are and they're kind of in reverse order here on the schedule.

12
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,900
We'll start with our, our exposure science and the news topic.

13
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,970
I'll spend a little bit of time on that.

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:34,130
I kind of reconvene and have each group report out maybe your most noteworthy or interesting article that was discussed.

15
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:43,190
And then we'll shift into our third kind of, uh, assessment for the class period or for the class.

16
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,810
The course is our group debates.

17
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:53,719
So we'll allocate a little bit of time today for each of the debate groups to meet, kind of get to know each other,

18
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,350
maybe get yourselves organized for how you're going to work together going forward.

19
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,700
And not to confuse things,

20
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:10,240
but I'm actually going to suggest when we break out into our S and the news groups to actually break out into the big groups that sound too confusing.

21
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,530
But maybe then then when we shift to the second part of meeting with your debate groups,

22
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,740
nobody has to reshuffle again who already already be together.

23
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,090
Uh, there's one other announcement that I wanted to make for our next class period.

24
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,720
On Tuesday, we're going to have Professor Julia, uh, talk about, uh,

25
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:40,570
the expose on some aspects of the chemicals and exposures that are not well regulated or completely unregulated.

26
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:50,320
I have some really cool approaches to estimating exposure, using intake practices and so forth, and you all are in a little bit of a unique position.

27
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:58,080
This, I'm pretty sure, is going to be Professor Julia's last guest lecture as a professor at the University of Michigan.

28
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,390
He actually retires at the end of November. And it's a little bit of a weird thing.

29
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,969
He's retired from Michigan. He's originally Swiss.

30
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:14,170
I can I'll introduce him now so we don't have to do an interview that he's originally Swiss had the early

31
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,630
to mid part of his career working at this really prestigious federal research institute in Switzerland.

32
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:30,490
Came to Michigan later in his career, ended up being here for longer than he planned, I think about 17 years or so and retired.

33
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,450
He and his spouse moved back to Europe, but he's not really retired.

34
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,900
He's actually taken a position at the University of Denmark. So he's in Copenhagen.

35
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:44,140
He will not be here in person. He will be joining us over Zoom but will still meet here in class.

36
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:51,280
And again, remember how I kind of gave you a little bit of a warning? There's different lecture styles from me to our different guest lectures.

37
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:58,299
Yeah. Professor Julia is revved up and ready to go, and even worse, it's going to be like mid-afternoon where he is, right?

38
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:05,530
So he's going to be way ahead of all of us in terms of so come maybe extra caffeinated or something for Tuesday's class.

39
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,860
But anyway, just to give you a kind of a just a call a heads up for that class.

40
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,229
All right. I will open up and we'll talk about the debate itself.

41
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,780
But in the second half of the class, so don't be thrown off when you see a little bit of extra information.

42
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,390
And the only reason I'm showing this here is just for the groups.

43
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,320
So I'm going to suggest that we break up into six groups for our Yes in the news discussion.

44
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,220
And these are the assigned groups for the debates.

45
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,610
So maybe it'll help if I tell people where to go.

46
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:47,470
Let's have Group one organize over here on this side of the room, a group to up in the front of the classroom, maybe group three.

47
00:04:47,620 --> 00:05:00,490
And that that corner three four and that that corner three, five up here in the front and then maybe group six towards the back on this side.

48
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:06,159
And then once you get organized, you can go ahead and start with the first person in your group to share your vote,

49
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,640
your time, or even 5 minutes like we've done for you.

50
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:19,060
I don't know. And then I saw you.

51
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:34,710
So I was in a classroom and I had never been in.

52
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:54,830
I was to become more interesting.

53
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:07,590
Sophie, you are you?

54
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:15,185
Yes, I think you. And that's one of the things I was like when I was like, like, way to refuse people.

55
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:23,957
All right, let's go ahead and reconvene.

56
00:06:23,957 --> 00:06:31,207
This sounds like it's, uh, the discussion is quieting down, so that means the folks had enough chance to get through this one.

57
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:36,857
So let's do like, as we done previously, you know,

58
00:06:36,877 --> 00:06:44,797
the consensus do like a quick report out from each group about whatever the article that seems like most interesting or most noteworthy.

59
00:06:45,157 --> 00:06:50,197
I think we office on this side of the room. So let's switch it up and start over here and work our way around.

60
00:06:50,737 --> 00:06:54,487
I think this was group five. Yeah, let's start with three five.

61
00:06:55,987 --> 00:07:01,807
On the article I looked at was called. There was a New York Times article called After the Storm The Mold.

62
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:12,787
And it was very recent. It was discussing the aftermath of hurricane events in and the flooding that caused a lot of those homes.

63
00:07:14,107 --> 00:07:20,887
So I was kind of looking at ways to assess individual's exposure to mold.

64
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:23,987
And I found that you can do urine, micro toxin tests,

65
00:07:24,007 --> 00:07:33,757
but also you can do blood tests to look at the responses with IGG antibodies in the blood that shows that person's been exposed to mold.

66
00:07:34,207 --> 00:07:43,207
And then mold, like the root of exposure, could be skin color, skin contact, ingestion, but mostly inhalation.

67
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:53,346
And the health consequences of mold exposure can be very significant, but it can also they can be short term and long term, just like amplify asthma.

68
00:07:53,347 --> 00:08:01,717
If someone suffers from asthma or any other health issues, but then they can have long term consequences as well.

69
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:06,487
Yeah, that's pretty much what the article discussed.

70
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:12,957
It was just saying that with hurricane and like all with all hurricanes, there's a lot of flooding and then more exposure in homes.

71
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:20,047
But with hurricane in that was just the most recent and the article interviewed like

72
00:08:20,077 --> 00:08:24,907
a health inspector or a mold inspector in Florida who says that with Hurricane Ian,

73
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:29,817
he got more calls than he ever has before. Excellent.

74
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:34,847
Yeah. Thank you so much. So a great example of a different type of biological agent, right.

75
00:08:34,887 --> 00:08:38,487
That we haven't discussed a ton and some of our class periods.

76
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:49,107
Yeah. And you know, how much more newsworthy could it be that with massive flooding that just happened recently as a result of the hurricane?

77
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:55,267
And that's a difficult one, too, because, you know, there's the initial kind of cleanup, right.

78
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:58,646
Which is, you know, removal of massive amounts of water. Okay.

79
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:06,867
Things look dry now. They're not. Right. And it's often weeks later where the mold has an opportunity to really become a problem.

80
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:11,607
Thank you so much. Let's go back here to I think it's group six. Yes.

81
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:22,087
Oops. Okay. So I looked at the one for dioxane contamination of the groundwater and this area.

82
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:29,827
And so dioxane is a likely human carcinogen, but there haven't been sufficient studies to prove that yet.

83
00:09:30,247 --> 00:09:34,327
But it's shown in rats and mice to cause cancer of the nose.

84
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:39,627
Abdominal cavity could be a mother, and it was used in the manufacturing.

85
00:09:39,637 --> 00:09:47,077
Quite ironically, the water pollution filters by Gelman Sciences Inc from 1966 to 1986.

86
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:57,907
So that's like not far from here. And it was detected in 1985 and some residential drinking water wells and like the CYO Township area.

87
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:04,567
And so basically for the past almost 40 years now, it's just slowly been spreading out.

88
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:12,367
And there's a lot of community activism around it, but not sufficient actual surveillance of it.

89
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:21,007
So it came up recently because they just determined that it spread a lot further north than they had originally thought,

90
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:26,407
which they thought it was like one by four miles, but now it's just shown to be larger.

91
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:34,147
And so it entered the environment because of overflows and leaks at their storage lagoons.

92
00:10:34,147 --> 00:10:40,477
So they had unlined like ponds that they were storing all their wastewater at and that just like leaks straight into the ground.

93
00:10:41,197 --> 00:10:49,627
And they're also spraying the wastewater to water the grass around the factory, which is like so unbelievably irresponsible.

94
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:56,437
And so it was like absorbed into the soil, eventually just trickled into the groundwater.

95
00:10:56,437 --> 00:11:02,317
And now they're concerned that it's like connecting to the surface waters as well,

96
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:10,267
because they've detected very low levels of it in Barton Pond recently, in the past year, which supplies water to Ann Arbor.

97
00:11:10,897 --> 00:11:21,157
So see, it's not like a forever chemical in most forms way, like something like past, is it,

98
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:26,857
when like connected with heat it'll dissipate and form different gaseous forms which then can be inhaled.

99
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:30,187
So it's ingested in water because it persists in water,

100
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:39,487
also ingested by food that you've cooked with the water and inhaled when you shower and it will cook with it, things like that.

101
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:47,977
And so basically the way to track it then right now they're doing like water world testing,

102
00:11:47,977 --> 00:11:56,377
but it seems to me like the best thing to do would be to test both the water and the urine and blood samples of people within the known like

103
00:11:56,407 --> 00:12:06,426
original plume within like the suspected plume and outside of it to determine like how it is actually spreading out using like the smallest,

104
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:09,996
like most sensitive tests because generally they don't right now,

105
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:15,337
which is how like all of a sudden they're like, oh, no, it's in the pond, it's in the surface water.

106
00:12:17,347 --> 00:12:25,987
Also part of that would be like tracing what kind of products people use because it is a like chemical byproducts.

107
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:33,727
It's in a lot of cosmetics. So like being able to control from that, but that's like much less severe than drinking it.

108
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:38,667
But you do absorb it through your skin improvement. Yeah.

109
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:46,377
Excellent. Yeah. Thank you so much. So, uh, an example of a chemical hazard that, again, I don't think we've talked about specifically.

110
00:12:46,377 --> 00:12:49,527
It's very local issue. This is an Ann Arbor area issue.

111
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:54,537
Uh, the original contamination that Morgan mentioned was decades ago,

112
00:12:54,537 --> 00:13:02,727
kind of where another one of those legacy emanations from a manufacturing facility on the west side of Ann Arbor and underground,

113
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:06,117
the plume, it is slowly spread over those decades.

114
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:15,237
Most of the population is on that municipal, uh, city water supply and so are not impacted, although,

115
00:13:15,447 --> 00:13:21,867
uh, households that do have private wells are aware that groundwater has been contaminated.

116
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:26,637
But yes, as Morgan said, as it's drifted kind of to the to the east and to the north,

117
00:13:27,087 --> 00:13:33,327
it's getting closer and closer to the kind of the primary drinking water source for the municipal water.

118
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:37,647
So being watched very closely and with a lot of concern. Thank you.

119
00:13:37,647 --> 00:13:40,707
Let's go to, I guess, group four in the back.

120
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:46,416
So they both research plastics, which is very important.

121
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:52,357
Why I was nominated because I found an article about the environmental impacts of the war in Ukraine.

122
00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:59,287
And it's extremely broad and obviously we won't know everything until.

123
00:14:01,147 --> 00:14:10,536
Probably years from now. But the exposure pathways involved in this are obvious, like munitions are firing,

124
00:14:10,537 --> 00:14:15,907
and then when they explode, they can release different toxins into the air, soil and water.

125
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:26,047
But also when they hit buildings or cars or other objects, they destroy those and then other toxins are released.

126
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:34,867
So things like asbestos, concrete, any sort of like toxins that might be found commonly in household areas.

127
00:14:36,487 --> 00:14:42,976
And then Russia also has been targeting chemical plants and energy infrastructure and wastewater treatment facilities.

128
00:14:42,977 --> 00:14:47,257
So all of those things obviously have their own host of pollutants within them.

129
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:54,427
And if they're not being properly contained or monitored, then there's a lot of concern around that.

130
00:14:54,787 --> 00:15:02,467
One example was a steel and iron plant, which they've listed some of the chemicals that they have there,

131
00:15:02,537 --> 00:15:08,256
which are like metals, cadmium, copper, chromium, lead,

132
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:14,167
manganese, nickel, zinc, arsenic, cyanide style cyanide sulfide,

133
00:15:14,257 --> 00:15:20,947
volatile organic organics such as benzene, tolerated poly aromatic hydrocarbons and phenols.

134
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:27,007
And then so those harkening into the environment when these places are destroyed,

135
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:33,426
additionally blown up tanks and vehicles leak oil and then fires that are caused by

136
00:15:33,427 --> 00:15:38,047
these also aerosolize other pollutants and are creating both particulate matter,

137
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:44,767
but also creating this like toxic snow that ends up falling and can contaminate groundwater and soil.

138
00:15:46,507 --> 00:15:51,307
The interesting thing about this is there's a lot of social media reporting of this.

139
00:15:51,307 --> 00:16:01,117
So one of the ways around measuring exposures that I think would probably happen, it's like using that historical data from the social media,

140
00:16:01,387 --> 00:16:07,207
like literally just video footage that people are hosting of like the playoffs being destroyed.

141
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:13,987
But there's also satellite imagery. Like there is one town that has like tailing ponds that have been changing color

142
00:16:13,987 --> 00:16:17,676
and they're not sure what's going on because they can't go and monitor the water.

143
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:24,217
But they've seen like the water changed from like teal to like black to like pink.

144
00:16:24,577 --> 00:16:26,137
And it's like very concerning.

145
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:34,357
And then I think there will probably be a lot of like modeling and estimation that will have to be done for exposure assessments.

146
00:16:35,197 --> 00:16:42,277
But Ukraine is actually trying to get Russia to pay ecological reparations for the damage.

147
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:51,707
We were talking about how unlikely that probably is going to be, but it's the first time I've ever heard of ecological reparations before.

148
00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:56,377
But I. Lots of exposure.

149
00:16:56,857 --> 00:17:01,686
Absolutely. Yeah. Oh, thank you, Kate. That's I mean, you kind of hit it.

150
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:08,496
I an absolutely awful situation on so many fronts, but certainly from an environmental exposure perspective.

151
00:17:08,497 --> 00:17:10,987
Right. And I wasn't sure you went through a pretty long list.

152
00:17:11,437 --> 00:17:19,297
Did you mention, uh, you know, nuclear power generating plants and that that one was specific to an iron and steel production plant?

153
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:27,126
Um, but yeah, that's also yeah, there's the concern about the legacy contamination related to Chernobyl, again, going back decades,

154
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:37,837
but then also the, the very strong fear of with either, you know, direct bombing or just simply an inattention to existing nuclear facilities.

155
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:42,307
All right. Thank you so much. Let's see, three of the group, three back here.

156
00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:44,437
Yes. Have you guys go next, please?

157
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:54,727
So I was looking at the same article that Morgan was looking at with the one four dioxane leak into, like, our groundwater.

158
00:17:55,327 --> 00:17:57,906
Just like some other information that I'd like to add.

159
00:17:57,907 --> 00:18:08,407
Is that so the like, as you stated, that like all the wells are our like secondary like backup water source.

160
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:16,987
And so like in the next two years or so, they're looking to like abandon those water sources and connect into Ypsi for like,

161
00:18:17,557 --> 00:18:26,046
so like transition to have like a second water source. Um, but obviously it's also an issue if it's seeping into our surface water.

162
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:30,367
And so just the next couple of years it's going to be really interesting to see how they really handle it.

163
00:18:32,257 --> 00:18:40,477
Yeah, I agree. It's a mess. There's no easy way to state it otherwise.

164
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:45,246
And, uh, it's good, right, that there is attention to.

165
00:18:45,247 --> 00:18:53,677
To mitigation, right? Uh, this is here. It's not like you can just kind of, like, dig down and clean things up and put it back, so.

166
00:18:53,677 --> 00:18:57,037
And taking multiple approaches to the issue as well.

167
00:18:58,427 --> 00:19:04,927
Well, thank you. Group number two. I can go on.

168
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:13,807
So I found an article. It's like a series of articles and a couple videos about a recent finding at an elementary school in Missouri.

169
00:19:14,527 --> 00:19:17,677
They had extremely high levels of radioactivity.

170
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:23,857
So this came from the Coldwater Creek that runs parallel to the elementary schools campus,

171
00:19:24,487 --> 00:19:31,447
which was a dumping site from World War Two for radioactive weapons.

172
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:37,956
And the Department of Army Engineering actually looked completely aware of the fact that this creek

173
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:44,047
and like areas around it were contaminated and have been working to clean it up for decades.

174
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:48,307
But they never tested far enough away from the creek.

175
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:57,006
So a separate company ended up testing within the elementary school grounds and

176
00:19:57,007 --> 00:20:01,567
found that some of the levels were like 22 high times higher than they should be.

177
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:07,717
And one of the worst areas was in an elementary like kindergarten area playground.

178
00:20:07,717 --> 00:20:13,207
So like the youngest students were having the highest exposure. So obviously that is very bad.

179
00:20:14,137 --> 00:20:21,696
But I watched the video on the Weather Channel yesterday and it seems like the school district is taking like very swift action

180
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:29,436
that they completely switch to remote learning for the time being and are going to redistrict all the students after Thanksgiving.

181
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:33,277
So at least for now, the elementary school is shut down.

182
00:20:34,237 --> 00:20:40,657
But obviously, like there's been 70 years worth of kids to pass through this elementary school.

183
00:20:42,127 --> 00:20:46,836
And there's a lot of people in the area who have been diagnosed with like where types of cancers and stuff.

184
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:52,097
So there's like a woman who went to the school board meeting. It was like this gives an explanation.

185
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:55,807
Like, I'm very grateful that you're, you know, taking my grandkids out of this building.

186
00:20:55,807 --> 00:21:01,597
But like, my life is kind of been ruined because of like the elementary school that I went to.

187
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:05,587
So it'll be interesting to see what happens there.

188
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:10,897
Thank you so much. Yeah. So a physical hazard.

189
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:22,356
Uh, and in a, you know, very much it sounds like a public space and, you know, not just, again, concern around current exposures, but, you know,

190
00:21:22,357 --> 00:21:29,137
like you very clearly stated, you know, looking retrospectively what's been what's been the impact and it sounds like,

191
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:35,277
uh, there's, you know, potentially a lot there. Thank you.

192
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:38,097
And then, last but not least. Group number one over here.

193
00:21:39,737 --> 00:21:51,417
Um, so I found an article on a biological exposure that they're dealing with in aftermath of Hurricane Gabriel.

194
00:21:52,917 --> 00:22:03,177
Vibrio vulnificus. It's a flesh eating bacteria that small in salt and brackish water.

195
00:22:03,627 --> 00:22:13,107
And it's been I think it's proliferated even more in that area because of sewage spills that occurred during a hurricane.

196
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:18,597
And they were saying that it's not very prevalent.

197
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:25,377
Normally, it's just usually about like a hundred deaths per year in the US and 80,000 cases.

198
00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:33,657
But since hurricane in Florida, there's been 26 cases and six deaths in one county.

199
00:22:35,157 --> 00:22:42,086
And so they're advising people to see if you have like open wounds and things to stay out of the water,

200
00:22:42,087 --> 00:22:46,317
even like for cleaning purposes and retrieving things.

201
00:22:47,007 --> 00:22:51,117
Because that's how most of the cases have happened, is that people are cleaning their houses or something.

202
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:59,026
And so, yeah, the source of the exposure is the the salt and the brackish water.

203
00:22:59,027 --> 00:23:12,537
And then for testing, it's, um, they test for it through blood cultures and cultures, the same way that you test for other viruses and.

204
00:23:14,117 --> 00:23:22,517
Yeah, that's great. Thank you so much. So another one related to the hurricane, another example of a biological agent.

205
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:32,057
And yeah, thanks for bringing these to attention because what's in the forefront of most folks minds with an approaching hurricane, right.

206
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:36,707
Is the powerful wind and, you know, kind of like acute destruction.

207
00:23:37,127 --> 00:23:44,717
And there is so much risk. Right, that that becomes a bit more chronic and latent following that event.

208
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:47,987
And two really good examples here today. All right.

209
00:23:47,987 --> 00:23:52,936
So thanks again for, uh, for your engagement in that exercise.

210
00:23:52,937 --> 00:23:59,297
And it's again, you know, some of the material we have a few examples and we're going to class and discussing things,

211
00:23:59,537 --> 00:24:01,397
but a lot of it's kind of like nuts and bolts.

212
00:24:01,787 --> 00:24:07,347
And so this is, you know, an opportunity for you all to kind of like apply and then bring them in, right?

213
00:24:07,477 --> 00:24:11,077
So that hopefully folks are are able to kind of hear, you know,

214
00:24:11,087 --> 00:24:20,777
aspects of what we learned in class and how they apply to like real world events going on around us either right now or not too far into the past.

215
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:28,247
Okay. So let's go ahead and shift gears and talk about the debate and assignment.

216
00:24:30,647 --> 00:24:37,847
So let's first introduce the assignment. So let's go through this.

217
00:24:37,997 --> 00:24:41,627
These are both linked file on our canvas site.

218
00:24:42,257 --> 00:24:47,097
So and again, this is far off. This is basically the first week of December.

219
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:56,446
So our last three class periods and we'll have three independent student debates, one on each class period.

220
00:24:56,447 --> 00:25:01,757
I think it's December 1st, December 6th and December 8th that my memory serves.

221
00:25:02,717 --> 00:25:07,577
And so when we look back at the groups here in the topics and moment,

222
00:25:07,577 --> 00:25:14,717
but each group has been assigned based on the topic you are assigned to either be for it.

223
00:25:14,897 --> 00:25:22,367
And that's your your task is to build a case for a certain topic or you've been assigned to be against it.

224
00:25:22,607 --> 00:25:26,867
Right. And build a case for why we should be against it.

225
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:32,267
And so the groups are for the most part, it's four groups of four.

226
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,807
There's one group I think has three team members.

227
00:25:36,487 --> 00:25:42,947
And over the next several weeks, your your charge is basically to research the topic.

228
00:25:43,517 --> 00:25:50,267
Right. Learn about it, probably to have to be able to effectively debate your opponent.

229
00:25:50,657 --> 00:25:54,167
Learn both sides very well. What are the true pros and cons?

230
00:25:54,587 --> 00:26:05,177
And then be able to kind of strategize around your own argument, your assigned argument of being for or against, you know, collaborate, communicate.

231
00:26:05,927 --> 00:26:09,317
This is definitely a group team project.

232
00:26:09,707 --> 00:26:13,696
It's not expected to be individual and talk through, you know,

233
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:18,947
what's the best way to put forth your your argument, how to construct it and how to present it.

234
00:26:21,017 --> 00:26:31,007
A little bit about the grading. So, uh, it's going to be twofold and I think there's some examples of the grading sheets further down.

235
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:37,147
Uh, so let's see, the exam was worth 30% of the course grade.

236
00:26:37,337 --> 00:26:43,337
The proposal that you all are maybe have started working on is also worth 30%.

237
00:26:43,337 --> 00:26:48,077
And then this group debate is worth 30% in terms of that grading.

238
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:53,957
20% will come from my assigned grade to each of you.

239
00:26:54,497 --> 00:27:01,907
But 10% of that is actually going to come from the peers on your on your debate team.

240
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:07,757
And so they'll be scoring sheets that you all will submit on the day of your debates.

241
00:27:08,747 --> 00:27:14,087
These are going to be pretty strictly formatted and timed.

242
00:27:14,597 --> 00:27:18,677
So each team is going to have 10 minutes to make a presentation.

243
00:27:19,067 --> 00:27:23,806
So using something like PowerPoint or Google Slides or whatever it is that you did,

244
00:27:23,807 --> 00:27:28,577
your team decides is going to work, assemble that ten minute presentation.

245
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:34,457
Now, you might want to divide that roughly equally across each team member.

246
00:27:34,457 --> 00:27:43,247
So I mean, 2 to 3 minutes of kind of presentation for a team member and you know, following what you feel is a kind of a logical order.

247
00:27:44,147 --> 00:27:48,947
So it'll start with the pro group around the topic presenting for 10 minutes.

248
00:27:49,787 --> 00:27:56,927
No questions, no comments. The pro group will sit down, the against group will come up and give their ten minute presentation.

249
00:27:57,647 --> 00:28:08,267
After that, both groups will be able to maybe step into a private area, huddle up and have 2 minutes to come up with the rebuttal.

250
00:28:10,217 --> 00:28:15,827
There's no expectation for anything to present in terms of slides as part of your rebuttal.

251
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:23,537
But based on what your opponent just said, you'll have 2 minutes to come up with your rebuttal and come back into the classroom, send the pro group.

252
00:28:23,657 --> 00:28:29,567
We'll give their two minute rebuttal. Very quickly after that, the against group will give their two minute rebuttal.

253
00:28:30,197 --> 00:28:35,887
The debate will have ended. And then we can have we can open it up to the full class,

254
00:28:35,897 --> 00:28:44,897
will have maybe some informal voting who thinks the pro group one who to be against group one and then just about the issue itself.

255
00:28:44,897 --> 00:28:52,787
Right. Who is actually for whatever the issue is and who is actually against it and is going to open up to some class discussion around the topic.

256
00:28:53,207 --> 00:28:58,637
So that's, that's the structure of it. Let's see.

257
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:01,846
Yeah. And you know, use science, right?

258
00:29:01,847 --> 00:29:05,297
So stuff that we're learning about in class and how you approach things and

259
00:29:05,297 --> 00:29:09,827
where the risks are and where the concerns are from an exposure perspective,

260
00:29:10,637 --> 00:29:15,617
does this idea actually make sense or not? Why does it make sense and why doesn't it?

261
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:25,517
So have you no true scientific resources to support on the basis of your of your your points and contentions?

262
00:29:26,927 --> 00:29:30,407
Uh, what else do I have here? Yeah.

263
00:29:30,407 --> 00:29:40,127
So here is just an idea of like, a rubric. This is what I'll be using to kind of evaluate each group and, and eventually assign scores.

264
00:29:41,537 --> 00:29:45,196
And there's also an opportunity here from, from students.

265
00:29:45,197 --> 00:29:48,467
So if you will complete this, right.

266
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:57,827
So for your group, you'll evaluate, you know, team number, first person in your group, the second person in your group,

267
00:29:58,307 --> 00:30:04,097
the third person in your group and score them based on how they've engaged and participated,

268
00:30:04,517 --> 00:30:09,857
contributed to the preparation and then contributed to the actual delivery.

269
00:30:09,857 --> 00:30:15,707
And those I will just take, you know, on an altered and plug it to the grading.

270
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:22,907
So that's a little bit of the description and format for the debates.

271
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:33,277
Do folks have any questions? All right.

272
00:30:33,307 --> 00:30:36,636
So so these are pretty far off. Again, this isn't until the first week in December.

273
00:30:36,637 --> 00:30:41,827
So lots of opportunity to come up with questions. Let me shift back to.

274
00:30:43,307 --> 00:30:47,266
Our assigned groups and then actually the topics. So, yeah, I was corrected.

275
00:30:47,267 --> 00:30:49,817
My mom rounded the dates first.

276
00:30:50,717 --> 00:31:00,047
It is our first debate topic with the question of should urban farming be permitted in heavily industrialized cities like Detroit?

277
00:31:00,947 --> 00:31:07,517
So group number one is assigned as the program, so in support of urban farming.

278
00:31:08,027 --> 00:31:21,647
And then group number two on the control board against group is assigned to be against urban farming for debate number two on December 6th.

279
00:31:22,307 --> 00:31:30,107
The topic is should indoor residual spraying of DDT still be allowed for the control of malaria?

280
00:31:31,217 --> 00:31:35,687
And we have group three and the pro group. Group four and the against group.

281
00:31:36,377 --> 00:31:41,266
And then our third and final debate on December 8th is should we use geoengineering

282
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:45,167
approaches to try to reverse the effects of human induced climate change?

283
00:31:46,247 --> 00:31:52,217
With Group five being the four scientists in Group six in the against design.

284
00:31:55,737 --> 00:32:01,256
So what I'm going to suggest in the remaining time that we have in class, which is about 25 minutes,

285
00:32:01,257 --> 00:32:07,916
I understand that you guys are super busy and your schedules don't overlap very well in terms of availability.

286
00:32:07,917 --> 00:32:13,017
So I wanted to allocate some time now we'll have some again in a few weeks to to meet in class,

287
00:32:13,587 --> 00:32:16,737
but just to give yourselves the remainder of the class period and a chat.

288
00:32:17,337 --> 00:32:20,787
What do you guys think about this? What's the best way to communicate, collaborate?

289
00:32:20,787 --> 00:32:26,817
You know, Google Docs I don't know what I did. Supply in this file is each person's unique name.

290
00:32:27,117 --> 00:32:34,887
Right? So the way all the emails are just you name an image that you knew for, you know, getting in contact with you members.

291
00:32:36,177 --> 00:32:41,367
Otherwise if there aren't any questions yeah go ahead and kind of re huddle and

292
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:45,147
see what you come up with or how to organize yourselves around this debate.

293
00:32:45,627 --> 00:32:57,658
And I'll I'm still up here, but if any questions arise because these people feel like I feel like you're having a useful experience.
