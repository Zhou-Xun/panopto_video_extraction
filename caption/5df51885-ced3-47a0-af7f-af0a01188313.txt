1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,670
Well, Sam's not here today because he's at his brother's graduation.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:15,450
But look, we have a new person who's joined, so, Josh, I'm going to make you introduce yourself like everybody else did, as you'll see in the videos.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,690
And then you have to tell us what emoji you use most on your phone.

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:26,250
All right. I'm Josh. I'm a second year EFP student in Moscow for the rest science cert.

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:32,249
And, uh, Ash, then, I mean, I really isn't notice too much.

6
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:38,459
Just. Just like the the text smiley face. Like, that's probably the one I use the most out of all emojis, I think.

7
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,660
I think it's the most versatile like know it's really hard to convey humor and attacks.

8
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,200
And so by putting on a smiley face, it's like easier to convey.

9
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,940
Do you have an android? I do have an android, yeah.

10
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,510
It doesn't seem like something that changes things in school.

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,580
But are you that person that puts periods at the end of your sentences when you text?

12
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,500
Oh, I use proper. Okay, why are you mad at me? Like I never use proper punctuation.

13
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,340
Someone go through them. This is where I find it. Whenever I take someone younger than me, they don't have anything or use any punctuation.

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,200
I'm like, It takes me so long to read their messages. Oh, what are you saying to me?

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,560
I mean, I use proper punctuation, but when I end attacks, I don't put a period at the end because to me that means the person's mad.

16
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:30,960
So I just have no punctuation or an exclamation point where I end it with various emojis and I guess it just stuff.

17
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,320
I interned at Kayla, which is Stomach Dagger manufactured here in Vermont and safety stuff, which is cool.

18
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,919
And I've been on other intel interests in this class but could do this. Got one step.

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,270
Wasn't able to originally be in here,

20
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,799
but I'm glad I'm in here now and I'm kind of very much interested in like the middle kind of play between safety stuff,

21
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,430
but then also just kind of like how the environment impacts or have mission.

22
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:59,640
And I always found like starting to destroy her like tie in green space to cortisol levels and stuff like that.

23
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,940
And Josh Hardy took my seminar on nail salon workers, so he really, he knows what he's getting into.

24
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,830
So welcome, Josh. So when, you know, people come back, maybe, you know,

25
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:19,020
a slightly fuller room as you saw my desperate email that said just told about class because with the registrar,

26
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,610
if you get below a certain number, they're like, we may cancel this in the future.

27
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,430
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'm like, Oh, don't do this to me, please.

28
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,219
It's not so much time. But today you joined just in time.

29
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,240
We're going to get into a deep dove on survey methodology,

30
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:44,219
because one of your major tasks for this semester is to create like a questionnaire based on psychosocial factors that,

31
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,090
number one, your pilot and cognitive test, and you'll refine it.

32
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:55,560
And then your final your final deliverable will be like the refined version of that survey with a write up.

33
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:04,830
So we're going to get an overview of survey methodology and then be able to explain our error can be introduced into a survey.

34
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,130
So I will say all this lecture material today is coming from Dr. Bob Konya at Indiana University.

35
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,570
He also runs the National Survey for Student Engagement for this content.

36
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:24,870
So I'm basically trying I myself took his class, so I'm trying to give you a semester's worth of content in about one and a half lectures.

37
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:34,020
So, well, we'll get started. So the current definitions of survey methodology, picking up where we left off last lecture,

38
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:41,790
this is a systematic method for gathering information from a sample of entities for the purpose of constructing

39
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:48,330
quantitative descriptors of attributes for the larger population of which the entities are members.

40
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,190
And then the second definition is to produce numerical descriptions about some aspects of the

41
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:59,220
study population by asking questions and answers that constitute data that can be analyzed.

42
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,659
Now, this one based on present day practice, they say,

43
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:09,629
besides the sample and information gathering, there's other recurring definitions or descriptions.

44
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:15,660
And that is not only quantitative, but also it has to be systematic and organized.

45
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:24,510
So you can see a survey in a way as a form of research strategy in which you're systematically collecting information about a population.

46
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,980
So really, surveys involve mathematics.

47
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,400
Number one, we have to understand probability and statistics.

48
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,860
The second component is psychology.

49
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:42,270
We have to understand how people interact with interviewers and the surveys and think about the questions and responses.

50
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:50,420
We'll do an exercise on Tuesday about this sociology and anthropology, thinking about social stratification,

51
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:58,350
cultural diversity, demographics, how people of different demographics might receive the questions and answer them.

52
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,860
And then also. Computer science, right?

53
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:08,120
Because you have to have some way to analyze your data, whether that be through database, through programing, human computer interaction.

54
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:15,830
So the very beginning thing you want to do is to create a survey.

55
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,180
What is your research, objective or objectives?

56
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:26,570
So based on your research, what is already known and like what type of studies are there?

57
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:34,040
So is this a unique area that's worth being investigated or a particular question that might be worth replicating?

58
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:40,360
So for example, we wouldn't do a survey on like, why is the sky blue?

59
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:46,880
Because we already know the answer to that. And that's also a very difficult question to answer via a survey.

60
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,669
Right. If you're interested in particular, like replicating some things.

61
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:56,240
So you might ask, you know, what?

62
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:03,049
What are your perceptions of like the Michigan, you know, abortion ban?

63
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:11,570
Right. You could replicate that question in different counties or different areas of Michigan, and that would still drive you a different answer.

64
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,390
But if you investigate something that is pretty well-known, like, you know,

65
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:26,149
what is the association between, you know, eating a lot of animal fat and cardiovascular disease?

66
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:35,240
We, again, already kind of know that. So once you kind of have an idea of what your research objectives may be to better understand,

67
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:44,840
you know, the relationship between perceived rewards in a workplace and job satisfaction,

68
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:51,770
or to understand the association between like two other kinds of drugs,

69
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,940
you'll start to narrow it down to what is of value or interest to you and others.

70
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,120
So again, is this a new issue or a problem that needs to be solved?

71
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,680
Is it too broad or too narrow, and is it appropriate for survey research?

72
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,390
So there's two types of inference that we have.

73
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:19,160
So this one here shows that you respond to respondents answers,

74
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:24,830
you get respondents answers to question, and then you make some kind of inference about them.

75
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,590
And then based on their answers, you can characterize the population that way.

76
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:38,870
Another way is that you get characteristics of the sample, whether that be just this classroom, right?

77
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,970
And then we make an inference about the characteristics based on this class,

78
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,550
and then we say we can apply that to the rest of the University of Michigan.

79
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:57,590
Does that make sense? Okay. So when either of these two conditions are met, service statistics are subject to error.

80
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,030
So deviations from the true value applicable to the population.

81
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:09,260
So if we can't make either forms of these inferences based on what your survey is trying to accomplish,

82
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,720
there's going to be error introduced into your survey. And that's okay.

83
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:21,470
It does happen. And we're going to talk about that. So this is generally the life cycle of a survey.

84
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,200
One is we can do it from the measurement side, and one is we can do it from the representation side.

85
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:34,520
So thinking about the representation side, you know, you have a target population.

86
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:41,030
Let's say our target population is like the whole of the United States, right?

87
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:47,030
Our sampling frame, we're not going to be able to survey every single person in the entire United States.

88
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:53,510
So this might be something like NHANES, for example, where they have a sampling frame where it's like,

89
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,940
you know, one state out of every region or two states out of,

90
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,050
you know, two states from the West Coast, two states from the mountain region,

91
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:09,020
two states from the Midwest, two states from the South, two states from the East Coast.

92
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:15,260
And then their actual sample is even derived smaller from that sampling frame.

93
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,370
Who responds? Maybe only 10% of people.

94
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,770
And then, depending on the responses you get, you might need to make some adjustments in your statistics.

95
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,999
And then your final thing, whether that is like a descriptive statistic,

96
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,320
like 94% of people said this or you have a regression like we talked about on Tuesday and you get your beta weight.

97
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:45,770
That is your survey statistic. On the other side is measurement, and that's what you're going to be doing for your specific worker interview.

98
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:51,830
So you're going to have a construct. You're going to think we'll talk more about what a construct is next week.

99
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,579
You're going to think about the way to measure that construct,

100
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:01,650
whether or not it's established already in a validated scale, you'll get a response to it.

101
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,510
You might have to edit the response a little bit.

102
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:12,649
Whether that's recoding values or creating dummy variables, you're not going to actually do the statistics right for this class.

103
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:21,560
We're just going to think about it conceptually or, you know, just say you have a scale of strongly agree to strongly disagree.

104
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:30,380
I generally don't like to deal with ordinal categories, so I'll code them as numbers one through five to make it continuous.

105
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,760
So you can do a little bit more like robust inferential statistics that way.

106
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,030
So in that way, that is a form of editing the response.

107
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,800
And then you get your survey statistic. Okay.

108
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,560
So how design becomes an actual process.

109
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:51,130
So you'll see here again on the measurement versus representation side,

110
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:57,760
first we want to define our research objective in the sample survey that's available to you on canvas.

111
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:02,500
Remember that person wanted to look at burnout in academia, right?

112
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:10,990
So their research objectives was to determine how the specific constructs they selected attribute to burn out in academia.

113
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:17,859
Then you're either going to go from the measurement or representation side, recruit and measure the sample code,

114
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:24,070
edit the data, make post measurements, post survey adjustments, and then perform the analysis.

115
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:31,780
So the first is the first form of error is called total survey error.

116
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:40,510
So the sum of all the sampling and non sampling errors is an indicator of the quality of usefulness of the data.

117
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:48,100
So if we add if we're doing representation right coverage error plus sampling

118
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:54,370
error plus non-response error plus adjustment error gives us total survey error.

119
00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:01,330
An error is always given as a numerical value just again conceptually.

120
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,810
So on the representation side, we'll start here first is coverage error error.

121
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:15,040
So this means that there's a non observational gap between the target population and the sampling frame.

122
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:21,459
So either you're missing somebody in your sampling frame that's a part of the target

123
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:28,420
population or you're accidentally capturing people you did not intend to for this study.

124
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:40,090
So, you know, let's just say again, your target population is the University of Michigan and your sampling frame is the School of Public Health.

125
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,530
Statistically speaking, interestingly, women are more likely to answer surveys than men.

126
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:54,220
So in our sampling frame for the School of Public Health, we only have female respondents.

127
00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:05,440
We're missing entirely from this frame male respondents or like people who are non-binary, for example, or may identify as another sexual orientation.

128
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,419
Or if in our sampling frame we only intended to survey students,

129
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:16,960
but we accidentally got some staff of faculty in there that is considered a part of coverage error.

130
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:29,100
So this is just a visual representation again, where your target population is the blue box,

131
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:35,520
your sampling frame is the yellow box, your covered population is kind of somewhere in between.

132
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:42,390
And then what is on the outside are either ineligible units, but then you have like this big area of under coverage.

133
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:51,510
That makes sense. Okay. The next source is between the sample and the sampling frame.

134
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:59,030
So sampling error is now a non observational gap between the sampling frame and the actual sample.

135
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:08,450
So, you know, if we look at this, what percentage of the population said yes versus what population said yes?

136
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:18,980
Depending on the actual sample size, larger samples statistically are more likely to be closer to true population characteristics.

137
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:24,140
So if you survey ten people versus you survey 100 people,

138
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:31,040
the 100 people is going to get you statistically closer, a lot more to the normal distribution than ten.

139
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:36,290
Ten at ten would be sufficient if you're doing like a qualitative study.

140
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:43,250
So like just say you're conducting semi-structured interviews or you're doing observational studies,

141
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,590
but oftentimes that's not sufficient to be able to say like,

142
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:56,820
you know, these ten people truly represent a population characteristics unless you're sampling frame is actually that small.

143
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:11,810
So just say your sampling frame is like an indigenous Amazonian tribe that only has like 50 people living in it, and you manage to capture 30 of them.

144
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:21,110
You know, if you look at it out of context, 30 doesn't seem that great, but realistically you've got like nearly 60% coverage.

145
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,470
So that's pretty, pretty decent. Okay.

146
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,790
So standard error of the sample.

147
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:36,410
So if many samples are taken from the same population, it's unlikely that they all have characteristics identical to each other.

148
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,390
So their statistics will be different.

149
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:47,060
So the sampling error estimates the difference based on probabilities between the sample statistic and the population statistic.

150
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:52,399
So again, it d it decreases when sample size increases.

151
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:59,780
So anything greater than 25 will usually yield a more normal sampling distribution towards the mean.

152
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:07,700
So here we are again, just showing, you know, sample size according to normal distribution.

153
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:15,470
So depending on the margin of error and the confidence levels the researcher is prepared to tolerate.

154
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:27,380
Usually in surveys, we want to have a 95% confidence interval and we only will tolerate anywhere between a 5 to 10% margin of error.

155
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,720
Anything larger than that starts to get a little bit unwieldy.

156
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:42,490
So again, how large must my sample be? First, it depends on your research questions and the design.

157
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,260
Population size, your confidence level and interview intervals.

158
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:56,350
Again, the likely response rate, I would say I usually just aim for 10% and that I say, is being optimistic.

159
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,770
One survey I did of met emergency medical technicians,

160
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:10,570
it was sent out through like the National Association of Medical Technicians and like all these professional organizations.

161
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:19,840
So the final sample size itself was 2400, which seems great, but the listserv was over 200,000.

162
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,350
So if you like, take a look at the response rate.

163
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,900
I think that's like 1%, 2%.

164
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,819
It was pretty dismal and peer reviewers didn't like it.

165
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,740
But I was like, I got 2400 people for free.

166
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,950
Like, I didn't have money to pay them at that time. So that was very nice of them to do.

167
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,740
But statistically it was still sound as long as you can justify the right tests.

168
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,200
The accuracy required the kinds of variables that you're going to be using.

169
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,650
Once you kind of get a hang of survey methodology and take a survey,

170
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:03,220
you can't help but just think about how bad some of them are or how good some of them are.

171
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:09,849
Like, for example, I've seen a lot of surveys where they have a lot of tables.

172
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:18,100
So you ever see the surveys where you have like like terms or like statements and they want you to like strongly agree, strongly disagree.

173
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,450
And you have to like click on the table for each item and go across.

174
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:29,530
That actually causes a lot of fatigue for responders or, you know,

175
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:37,870
in terms of like survey design, putting answers horizontally rather than as a vertical list.

176
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:47,440
The vertical list is is better practice because the goal is to let people read in the natural order of what their eyes will follow.

177
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,700
Statistics be used. We'll talk about strata in a minute.

178
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:59,830
The number of variables included in the study, the more variables you include, the larger your sample size has to be.

179
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:08,799
Because statistically, like, if you you don't want to overload the the, you know, the inferential statistics in your model,

180
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:16,390
for example, representativeness allowances to be made for attrition and non-response and then proportionality.

181
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:27,970
So we'll talk about this more. So this here is a graph that shows you basically a population in the sample with a 3% versus a 5% margin of error.

182
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:36,130
So you'll notice here so that the the population is the blue line, 3% is orange, 5% is gray.

183
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,739
As the population increases, the proportion decreases needed for the sample.

184
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:52,840
So if you only have a population size of 100 to get a sampling of only plus or -5% error, you need 80 of those 100 people.

185
00:19:52,840 --> 00:20:04,300
So 80%. Now, if you have a population size that's bumped up now to two 504 plus or -5%, you only need 217, which is now like half.

186
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:12,370
Whereas, you know, when you get up to the ten thousands, if that's your actual population size, you only need 370.

187
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,189
So why is that? It's based on this sampling error formula,

188
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:26,980
which is essentially the 96% plus the population size versus the respondent count and then the square root of that.

189
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:33,190
But you don't ever need to worry about this. And the nice thing is that later down the line in your future,

190
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:40,299
whether that's in your career or like if you decide to do a Ph.D. or something like that, no.

191
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,680
Okay. And you want to incorporate a survey.

192
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:50,439
There's plenty of websites where you just like punch this in your numbers.

193
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,640
And and let us tell you, Qualtrics has a calculator that does this for you.

194
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,770
So I'm just conceptually again. So again, large sample sizes are preferable when there's many variables.

195
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:09,520
You only expect small differences or small relationships to be predicted.

196
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:15,400
So like very nuanced things, your sample will potentially be broken down into subgroups.

197
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,850
It's heterogeneous, and then there's reliable measures of the dependent variable or unavailable.

198
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:27,940
So what do we mean by that? Reliable measures of the dependent dependent variable or unavailable.

199
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:34,800
That's like stuff like psychosocial factors where they're reliable measures aren't necessarily always of.

200
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,950
Elbow through previously validated scales.

201
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,950
We're still testing a lot of this stuff out now.

202
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:49,319
If you are doing something like, okay, I'm going to collect blood pressure, I'm going to do a max vial, too.

203
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,830
I'm going to do a lot of like anthropometric measures.

204
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:58,710
Those are reliable measures. So you wouldn't necessarily need as large of a sample size.

205
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:08,970
The next is non-response error. So the non observational gap between the sample and the respondent pool itself.

206
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:17,669
So an operational representation is realistically who do you have access to, right?

207
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:27,360
So whether this is a database or a list of persons, we are things in the population with contact information and community.

208
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:38,400
I can basically just like find anybody's email and hypothetically I could email everybody in the university if I took the time to do it.

209
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,100
But like sometimes you just don't have that ready of access to people.

210
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:52,200
And I would say sometimes you get lucky, like just say, I've done this before, I'm a huge online stock.

211
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,940
Or just as a caveat, I like stuck most people, but just to be concerned.

212
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:02,399
No, I mean, it's more for a like curiosity and like safety purposes.

213
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,000
But, you know, now you don't you be concerned.

214
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,219
But like you can figure out sometimes people's email addresses because you'll see like, oh,

215
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:17,340
all of the people at County dot gov, it's like their first initial plus their last name, right?

216
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:23,760
But then certain entities like certain federal organizations or whatever, they keep their emails like super tight.

217
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:29,820
So I do a lot of contract work with knowledge and people's email addresses make no friggin sense.

218
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,979
It's like G8, the CDC, dot gov and their name has none of those letters.

219
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,850
Right. It's very difficult to figure out for security reasons.

220
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,929
They just don't want some, some, you know, general public people emailing them.

221
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:47,040
But anybody can email us as professor.

222
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,930
He is Google us and then we have no, no, no people harassing me.

223
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:59,159
It's mostly like people begging me for funding and they're like, I do work similar to yours.

224
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,910
And I like, look at what they do and they do like ophthalmology.

225
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:09,000
And I'm like, no, anyway. Okay, so per post survey adjustments.

226
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:19,740
So obviously in a beautiful, perfect world, everybody will fill their survey out 100% from start to finish.

227
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,690
How many of you have started filling out a survey and gave up during it?

228
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I have definitely done that.

229
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,310
Why did you give up too long?

230
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,820
Too long? Like, I think it's going to be a five minute thing.

231
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,170
Then I'm on tab for like nine and it's too long.

232
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:46,860
Yeah, too long. Or it's like it doesn't make sense to me.

233
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:54,450
And then I give up or sometimes I'll like start a survey and then in a time when I think I have enough time and

234
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:58,920
then I have to like go do something else and then I forget about it and then they just never come back to it.

235
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,879
Not in recent years though, because now that I do survey research a lot, I believe in like survey karma.

236
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,400
So like in order to get the responses I desire in the future, I fill them out.

237
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:17,730
But before, before I had this job and like my other job, that was more taxing.

238
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,030
I used to be part of, you know, you all know Southwest, the airlines.

239
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,670
So for the Rapids Rewards program,

240
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:34,739
they had this offshoot that I was in for a little bit where if you take a bunch of like industry surveys on random stuff

241
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:42,840
like sneakers or like I used to watch commercials for Ulta Beauty and like give my thoughts and reactions in survey form.

242
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:48,740
Like they would give you like seven rapid rewards points for every survey that you do.

243
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:54,210
Number one, no time for that anymore. But it was just so long.

244
00:25:54,570 --> 00:26:01,620
Or sometimes when questions are of supersensitive, nature, people skip them or they don't want to answer them.

245
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,120
Interestingly,

246
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:12,420
I recently had a grant where I was collecting saliva samples and doing some psychosocial measures on waste workers here in Southeast Michigan.

247
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:17,189
And when I do make questions, I try to frame them inclusively.

248
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:21,780
Right. But these waste workers are like usually blue collar workers.

249
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,620
So I kid you not because they administered them on the paper. And I was there in the room with them.

250
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,690
All of them laughed at the question when I asked about gender identity.

251
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,770
And one guy like went on this rant to me about how.

252
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:43,049
His like he just brought his daughter to Michigan medicine and his physician scolded him and his wife for addressing

253
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:50,340
the daughter in pink clothes because she should choose like what color clothes he like that their child wants to wear.

254
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,250
And he was like, blah, blah, blah, these, you know, liberals with Obama.

255
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,899
So, you know, sometimes when people get frustrated and that sounds like they won't,

256
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,720
you don't know why people don't answer questions for various reasons.

257
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:07,860
And especially when you have that table format, people get so confused because they don't realize they have to do every single row.

258
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:15,240
They might just like click one. So when you have missing data, you have a couple of options.

259
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,959
First is just drop those cases entirely.

260
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,400
So just say you have 100 cases, 100 respondents.

261
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:32,910
Anybody who misses one answer, who doesn't even have 100% of responses or at least 100% of responses for the questions that you're interested in,

262
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,800
you just dump them out of your sample.

263
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:40,890
Now, that might come at a cost to you, though, depending on how big your sample is, because you could be dumping out like half of your sample.

264
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:48,659
Another one is a statistical method called imputation or multiple imputation,

265
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:53,400
where given there's only a few instances of missing data across the variables,

266
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:05,180
so we'll fill it in using what we call an expectation maximization algorithm, Yasur, theta SAS, SPSS, who knows how to do this.

267
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:11,549
So essentially what it does when you enter this code is based on your responses.

268
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:18,810
They'll figure out what's missing and then they'll look at someone who's like responded similarly to you and

269
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:27,450
then kind of fill in what they expect the missing value to be so that it's now a complete set of answers.

270
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:34,290
And then the second option is waiting. A This is more commonly used in large, really large data sets.

271
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:40,740
Again, like and Haynes, the National Substance Use Disorder survey and like drinking survey,

272
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:46,620
quality of work life survey where you want your pop urine.

273
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:52,169
We will want your sample to represent the target population right where here in the United States.

274
00:28:52,170 --> 00:29:07,470
Now, I think we're at like 65% non-Hispanic white, 13%, 12, 13%, but like 6% Asian, you know, bi racial and then non-Hispanic, Latino, etc., etc.

275
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:16,350
But just say, for example, your your sample is like 90% white and you only have like 1% of black people respond.

276
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:24,120
You have to wait your survey where you take the responses of white people to you wait that less than one,

277
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:33,870
and then the other response is more than one so that it balances according to what you think your population characteristics should look like.

278
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,870
Now, if you're ever using a large data set,

279
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:43,440
it always comes with the codebook and they should have just the code in there for you for what the weight is like.

280
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,620
You'll you'll generally never have to figure out the weight yourself.

281
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:55,320
It's somewhere. So tools needed for drawing a sample again a well-defined target population.

282
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,700
Your strategy. Are you going to go through groups?

283
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:05,010
How will you make sure subgroups are represented, represented and what's your rationale?

284
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:09,870
So here are our main sampling strategies.

285
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:15,800
The first is quota sampling, but this is looking at representativeness.

286
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:19,080
So again, we're attempting this is kind of what survey weighting does.

287
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:24,540
We're attempting to mirror the population in terms of its key characteristics.

288
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:29,520
So just say, for example, very basic example.

289
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:36,090
We want we want ten people to respond. We want five women and we want five men to respond.

290
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:43,710
Now, we've already had five women respond to the survey, and more women keep volunteering to respond to this survey.

291
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:51,179
We have to turn them away. Right. We're trying to go recruit males to take our survey now so we don't stop until we

292
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,230
get the five and the five because we're attempting to marry the characteristics.

293
00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:00,030
So that's what you do with quota sampling, probability sampling.

294
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:07,439
This is the most common. So this is just random sampling where like anybody, like if we draw a number out of a hat,

295
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,400
everybody has an opportunity, equal opportunity to be selected.

296
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:15,389
I'll talk about stratification a little bit more in a second.

297
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:23,430
And cluster panel surveys, interestingly, collect data from the same respondents repeatedly over time.

298
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:29,129
So there are people who who opt into being part of these panels where they get paid to do it.

299
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:32,490
And interestingly, Qualtrics has panels, panelists.

300
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:42,390
So if you're ever conducting. My research and you can't, like, find your target population for some reason while trucks can draw on their panel.

301
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:53,030
You just have to, like, pay extra for it. And then there's multi stage area probability sampling where it's like random sampling within a cluster.

302
00:31:53,390 --> 00:32:00,200
So like random sampling within a block, random sampling within a zip code, random sampling within a household.

303
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:09,710
Okay, so I mentioned what quota sampling is it because individuals are not randomly sample.

304
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:17,630
You might be introducing now systematic biases into your survey with simple random sampling.

305
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:26,000
Mm hmm. This is, again, the equal probability. So we use the same model, which is equal probability selection method.

306
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,620
How would you actually go about doing this? And what tools do you have?

307
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:35,870
You just, like, shoot out your survey wildly to see who takes it.

308
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,500
I mean, it depends on the kind of group you're trying to contact.

309
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:46,340
Like, if it's older people, you could go for phone or something because older people were like, whatever Lamont means by zip code.

310
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:53,930
Yeah. Door to door, maybe. But one thing to consider was simple random sampling and inherently all surveys.

311
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,660
I think I'll get to this in a few slides.

312
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:04,890
The people who choose to respond to you are inherently different than the people who don't choose to respond to you.

313
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:13,940
So you have to acknowledge that there is some kind of respondent bias to your survey because like, you know, like I, I don't know if I mentioned this,

314
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:22,469
so I but I'm in that covered study that the that the School of Public Health is doing where like basically I'm I'm pretty far into it.

315
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,840
It's I only have like four months left.

316
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:31,310
But for the last two years, I've just every two months I let them draw my blood to check if I still have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

317
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:36,230
And every week, I fill out a Redcap survey on my symptoms.

318
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,260
I don't get paid for this at all. I'm doing it for the science.

319
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,670
So someone like me who's doing this is inherently different than, like, somebody who isn't doing this.

320
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,180
Like, some people are scared of needles and they don't want to get their blood drawn.

321
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:55,370
Some people are like, I can't afford to be spending my time like this without getting paid.

322
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,120
Or like SaaS. Is it SARS-CoV-2?

323
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:08,570
Is it real? Like, there's a various reasons why people aren't participating in the survey, but they are, again, somehow inherently different than me.

324
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:14,320
So that is something to consider with random stratified sampling.

325
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:17,240
This is essentially like a two stage situation.

326
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:26,780
So first you need to identify characteristics which appear in the wider population, but they must also appear in your sampling frame.

327
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:30,739
And then the second stage is to randomly sample within these groups,

328
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:37,190
and the size of the group being sampled is determined by the judgment or tables of the sample size.

329
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:48,260
So here we go. So if we were just to do random sampling of a whole company, as I showed you earlier, with a plus or -5% error,

330
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:58,820
if we have a target population of a thousand to reach 95% confidence interval, 5% plus or -5%, we only need 278 people total.

331
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:07,970
But when we start getting specific and we want strata, I want to stratify the company by people who are English employees,

332
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:13,280
Scottish employees, Welsh employees and American employees.

333
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:18,530
We break down the population based on how many people are within each one.

334
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:26,660
So rather than just needing like 28% from the whole thing now like for American and Welsh and Scottish employees,

335
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:31,880
we basically need like 80 to 90% of all of those people to respond.

336
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:36,860
And then for English employees, you need like over 25% of the people to respond.

337
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:44,720
So when you're doing strata, even though it's the same 1000 people because you chose to break it down this way,

338
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,420
your actual new total sample size is 428 rather than the 270.

339
00:35:51,560 --> 00:36:00,020
Does that make sense? So the more strata that you have, the larger your sample will need to be statistically.

340
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:07,309
So if you do decide to do strata, there should be a justification or a really good reason for it.

341
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:10,190
Whether or not that contributes to your hypothesis,

342
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:17,630
where inherently like you think these four groups of employees are very different in terms of your dependent variable.

343
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:23,000
But if you're just interested in demographics, you don't have to do strata.

344
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:32,470
You can just like report later in your sample. Like 80% were English, 10% were Scottish, you know, that kind of thing.

345
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:34,460
People most.

346
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:48,230
Commonly used strata when it comes to things like income, nutrition levels, distribution of resources, etc. like in census type of things.

347
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:55,340
Cluster sampling can lower costs, but it sacrifices the design effect.

348
00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:02,810
Cluster sampling essentially is just like you're going to go into your sample and just grab up like a this bunch here.

349
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:10,790
So you're sacrificing precision. And then the systematic sampling is every case element.

350
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:19,700
So in a way, this is implicit stratified sampling but less specific than like breaking down people, like by ethnicity, for example.

351
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,880
So if you have like a listserv of 1000 people, you'll say every 10th person.

352
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,530
I will solicit them to join the sample and hopefully everybody will respond.

353
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:39,559
Or if you're like a person, do as I'm sure all you see them downtown like where they try to get to by the newspaper all the time outside

354
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:46,730
of like CVS or you see a person for like Greenpeace and they want you to like sign the clipboard or whatever.

355
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:51,260
So if you were to do systematic sampling, they wouldn't like go up to everybody.

356
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:55,370
But like every fifth person that they saw, they would solicit.

357
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:06,590
Human subjects considerations. So, Brigitte, were you one telling me you didn't have to take responsible research conduct?

358
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:12,180
You did. You did. And Jake, I think you said that everyone should should have taken that.

359
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:18,240
Okay. Oh, it's my other class where the students who are dual degrees don't have to take it.

360
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:28,260
Okay. So you already know about all this things that they'll consider, though, although survey research is considered pretty minimally invasive.

361
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:34,990
We do still on the IAB have to put what are the risks mental fatigue board.

362
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:39,690
Um if they're sensitive questions they might you know be triggering.

363
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:46,860
But generally we always try to emphasize that the you're minimizing harms and the benefits will outweigh the risks.

364
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,670
Is data protection on that list? Yes. Yes.

365
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:58,470
Data protection. If you're if you're not you know, if you're not collecting any identifiable data, make sure to emphasize that, like with my surveys,

366
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:07,200
I just say no personally identifiable information, no individual responses will be shared with employers or coworkers.

367
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:11,130
All data will be presented in like an aggregated form.

368
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:18,060
When you do the actual IAB like Qualtrics, because it's paid by through the university, has a secure cloud.

369
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,210
So you don't have to worry about like it being hacked or anything like that.

370
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,670
But oftentimes they want to know like what you're doing in terms of security.

371
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:32,280
And then when you're not able to pay people, which, you know, before I got a grant and stuff,

372
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:37,319
I wasn't able to essentially the benefits are like finding out more about X,

373
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:43,140
Y and Z that could potentially benefit workers in your population in the future.

374
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:49,829
Right. So they're like intangible benefits. And I haven't had too much trouble.

375
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,969
I was really surprised.

376
00:39:50,970 --> 00:40:02,190
I recently I have an opioid survey going live on Monday that's on non-pharmacological pain management approaches in the construction industry.

377
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,340
And so we don't ask really, really sensitive questions like do you use heroin?

378
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:14,010
Like do you use these other like, you know, do you take fentanyl or anything like that?

379
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:22,680
We ask like what non-pharmacological pain management approaches use to use like acupuncture, music therapy, blah, blah, blah.

380
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:30,719
So because those questions weren't supersensitive in nature, it went through really fast as an exempt protocol.

381
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:40,620
But for my my colleagues who I know who mostly do like youth research, I don't do youth research because it makes things so much more complicated.

382
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:45,510
But a lot of my colleagues and friends do LGBTQ plus youth research,

383
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,820
which adds an additional layer of, you know, complexity because now you need parental consent.

384
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:58,830
But, you know, the the youth may not be out to their parents, but, you know, so you don't have to get a waiver and all that kind of stuff.

385
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:03,059
So the same human subjects considerations still have to apply.

386
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:08,580
Obviously, it's not invasive like a cancer treatment, but all these things still need to be taken into consideration.

387
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:15,150
Mm hmm. So why are you doing this survey?

388
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:23,190
Are you doing it for research? Meaning, this is a systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable

389
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:28,290
knowledge or emphasize applied knowledge that can be more generalized and universal.

390
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,270
This is usually what I try to aim for. Or are you just doing an assessment?

391
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:39,089
So this is a process to determine, like, for example, individuals improvement in learning over time,

392
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:47,130
like pre and post tests for a training performance of a program, a school wide climate survey, for example.

393
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:55,270
And it emphasizes formative or summative results, which is really localized and specified, or even like what Kroger likes.

394
00:41:55,290 --> 00:42:00,899
Occasionally I fill out the like customer service to get the bonus 50 feel points or ever.

395
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:06,479
But I don't go to Kroger for my gas anymore. But like those are considered more like assessments, right?

396
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:14,340
Because that's for them to improve upon themselves or for more internal use rather than like generalized or universal knowledge.

397
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:26,260
Okay. Okay. So again, here we are, just a visual representation of the non-response error and the bias effect.

398
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:31,090
So here you have your survey sample. Those are the people who responded.

399
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:36,190
Those are the people who didn't respond. That is the level of bias in between them.

400
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:44,530
And this is considered the non-response error. So a higher response rate is less risk of a non-response error.

401
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:51,690
Intuitively. That makes sense. It's also hard to tell with the masks on.

402
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:58,140
So we've talked about like why you haven't responded to surveys, mostly with it being too long.

403
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:09,680
Have you all ever like just stopped doing a survey because it was like too personal or like like it was bad or like, you know, what?

404
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:12,690
What's your experience most stories? Do you like doing them?

405
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:17,760
I like doing written surveys. I've stopped doing surveys because they're too long.

406
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,999
But I'll stop doing ones because I felt they were just like really gunning for a certain response.

407
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,470
And it's clear in the language. And I was like leaving questions and I'm like, I don't see the point of this.

408
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:35,820
Okay. Have you ever have you ever had poll pollsters polled, like in a political survey?

409
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,800
Oh, I have. I think I have to a not for like a 38 kind of thing.

410
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:44,300
But I'm surprised because this is a big swing state, maybe technology.

411
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:51,000
How about how about you, Bridget? Kind of similar to Josh like I don't think it's like too long.

412
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,060
I'm definitely more motivated. I feel like take the survey and you'll get the like you're motivated if there's an incentive.

413
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:59,489
Yeah. Okay. Okay. And more so.

414
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:06,440
And sometimes if it's like I don't know if it's like the questions are a little too deep that I have to like think about it more than I want to,

415
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:10,080
that I'm like, okay, I'm not going to do that. Yeah. Yeah. How about you?

416
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:16,440
Yeah, yeah. I'm just. I just stop because it's too long.

417
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:25,290
I have experienced, like, people might take, like, 30 minutes for one survey, so I.

418
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:30,890
Now I can tell you more than like ten is a game over.

419
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:39,560
And interestingly here, certain surveys like I've noticed, mostly surveys sent out to students are like Qualtrics.

420
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:44,500
Most students and most surveys sent out to faculty on Google forums.

421
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:53,660
I skip over a lot of it because I feel like I don't have tenure and you're collecting my email address, so I have a lot of things to say.

422
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,860
Is that from is it usually students and faculty?

423
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:01,730
Because I can see students using Google forms. No, it's like the administration.

424
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:09,060
Oh, wow. Because, like, students will send other students. Yeah, that's like you hear them like figuring out how to log in the quarter.

425
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:14,270
Yeah. The funny thing is the anonymous, anonymous comment form on the heights.

426
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:21,650
Number one, you have to sign into your unique ID and then in it is the actual Google form that goes to the dean.

427
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:27,679
So it's like I had this way, let's just have a Dropbox, write a comment.

428
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:35,419
Dropbox unless they're going to like fingerprint does that but like come on or like have a key and rather than us and a student and like,

429
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:43,520
put this in the box, just. But yeah, generally like there are a lot of, I remember from my personal experience.

430
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,110
So I did a mixed method study for my dissertation where I,

431
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:54,980
I collected qualitative and quantitative data and there was this other student who was getting her PhD online,

432
00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:00,050
not even at my university at a at an online university.

433
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:04,970
But it wasn't very good. So she was learning nothing about research.

434
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:10,309
And so she found my dissertation advisor and was like, Can you please advise me?

435
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:15,680
Even though I don't go here, I pay tuition. And he was very nice and did it anyway.

436
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:25,700
And, and she finally, like her dissertation survey came out like a little bit after mine and I took it and I was like.

437
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:37,220
It was like a gray, dark gray background with light gray font now and then.

438
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:43,130
And there was a video for you to watch in the middle, like an embedded YouTube clip.

439
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:50,240
But it but it timed out. And then when you go back into the survey, it doesn't let you pick up where you left off.

440
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:58,720
So then you have to start all over. But then like but then you get to that same point with that video again and you can't proceed.

441
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:07,610
And I was like, how did you not beta test this before you like rolled up like that?

442
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:09,890
So those kinds of things are very frustrating.

443
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:16,100
But even here, like at the University of Michigan level, we have people who do survey research like myself,

444
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,790
where like an AP and bio stat and then you'll see some other people's research

445
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:24,590
projects will do like integrate a survey component and it is just not good.

446
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:26,870
But you know, to each their own right.

447
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:36,629
During my undergrad at MSU, I got a pretty sick of ALS from like one of the like online library sites of their doing usability study.

448
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:42,470
And it was like 100 bucks for an hour and I just like go in and get her and stuff.

449
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:46,970
It's very easy, but I'm curious how they found pain response.

450
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:52,280
I'm trying to inverse attention. But does it change their responses and how they would answer questions?

451
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:59,780
Because I've paid for service sometimes before and I almost felt like I want to give them better data for like their thesis or something,

452
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:07,010
or like they're might be offices because of the fact of being paid. So I'm curious, just in their study, it depends on the population, right?

453
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,659
Like who's your target population?

454
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:15,320
So of course, if it's like for a student's thesis or dissertation, like I'm more likely to answer it and like try to help them out.

455
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:28,400
But when it comes to paying survey for surveys, it's really complicated because how much how do you quantify how much people's time is actually worth?

456
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:33,560
My billable hour rate is probably very different than your billable hours rate,

457
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:40,910
and they've tried this new model like traditionally we think about like you do a survey and then when you're done, you get paid, right?

458
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:45,170
Like, you know, anywhere between like 5 to 20 bucks,

459
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:53,570
but depending on your target population for some $20 could be considered coercive like P, some people really need that $20.

460
00:48:53,990 --> 00:49:01,129
So when I was doing another research study with Burmese refugees, it was focus groups and I wasn't able to provide incentives,

461
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:04,490
but I could provide food there, considered vulnerable population.

462
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:13,520
So I had to give the breakdown by head how much like the cookies in the water were costing because it did it like it could be potentially coercive.

463
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:19,969
So like these studies, for example, where they're targeting like minorities who live in low x neighborhoods and say like,

464
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:23,330
we'll give you a $25 Walmart gift card if you like,

465
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:26,750
participate in our study or like if you pee in this cup or if you like,

466
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:34,630
give us blood that is maybe considered coercive because for some people, $25 can really make a difference, right?

467
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:39,830
Whereas for some people it doesn't like you can be serving university professors.

468
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:47,419
And there's also various other reasons that I learned when I was working is that in in the Muslim faith,

469
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:55,520
you're not supposed to accept, like, financial incentives when you're helping somebody out, like survey research.

470
00:49:55,790 --> 00:50:00,020
So I had a colleague who did my survey but declined to be paid.

471
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,920
So, you know, these I mean, there's always like these nuances.

472
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:11,320
There's this new model, too, where you pay people a little bit upfront just to get them started and then you pay them more.

473
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:15,739
That bridging, that's something that I talk about and like I have communications class and I talk

474
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:21,170
like the last semester is like they pay people ahead of time and that actually does.

475
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:25,290
Yeah. Increase the likelihood like you get paid regardless if you do the research or not.

476
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:31,190
Yeah. And like that's how like giving us like the Red Cross doing that, like trying to get blood donors.

477
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:35,960
They'll be like, we'll give you $5 gift card right now. And then they call you later and they're like, Will you donate blood?

478
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:46,249
Yeah, they'll call you every 52 days. They call me. I have O-positive blood that I do, but I banned because I had a dura dramatic graph.

479
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:52,430
So thankfully they don't contact me more. But yeah, like they'll start with like a $5 Starbucks gift card or something like that.

480
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:56,110
Was that is that the class taught by Dr. Zygmunt Fisher? Yeah, yeah.

481
00:50:56,110 --> 00:51:02,179
Yeah. Then I was also thinking about how when you're talking to like sometimes even people like really hard and like academia or at

482
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:10,940
least like kind of bad surveys or something that has to do with like surveys in essence are like communication in certain cases,

483
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:20,180
like health communication. So you like have that knowledge of like how to communicate to like your audience, then it's going to be a bad survey.

484
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:28,310
Yeah, I have a lot of feelings about this because it's mostly like what I do and they see like surveys are so common and like I said.

485
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:30,710
Colleges or social sciences research.

486
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:37,610
But certain people in this school have a very narrow view of what they consider to be real research to do science.

487
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:41,530
So they think they can do the survey. Oh, it's okay.

488
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:45,740
They have statisticians. They can pay to clean up this bad data later.

489
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:54,750
But yeah, they're starting more this model to like now paying people a little bit up front and then more later, which I'm surprised.

490
00:51:54,800 --> 00:52:05,330
Yeah. Like, like, you know, data shows that people are more likely to respond or if it's like a trusted sponsor or a trusted organization,

491
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:13,880
like if it's a survey from MSU, for example, I'm I'm more likely to fill it out if it's like a survey from, like Forbes.

492
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:23,750
Right. So yeah. So for response rate, like partial versus complete, you can cut it off at a certain point.

493
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:27,760
So what do you consider a partial versus a complete?

494
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:34,340
So less than 50% is partial, 50 to 80% partial or more than 80% equals complete.

495
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:37,960
This is entirely up to you to define. Okay.

496
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:43,220
But again, thinking about how makes it complicated for you later or your statistician.

497
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:48,350
So again, this is what we're talking about just now, social exchange theory.

498
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:51,739
People will be more likely to respond if they believe in trust.

499
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:55,580
The rewards for complying will eventually exceed the costs.

500
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:57,860
So it doesn't always have to be economic terms.

501
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:04,549
Like I said, I've gotten plenty of people to reply to my surveys just because they want to like help contribute knowledge to the field or,

502
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:10,130
you know, decisions are spur of the moment or it entails trust in an eventual outcome.

503
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:16,910
So Dillman, who is one of the big guys in the survey research along with Groves, he has something called Domain Method.

504
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:25,790
So how do you increase the benefits? Like these are things that I'll want to see in your surveys, so you'll have to put the purpose right.

505
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:31,610
So because you can't just ask people to fill something out and they don't know what their information is being used for.

506
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:34,880
You don't have to get into the nitty gritty, but like, you know,

507
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:40,480
your responses will help inform potential programs and interventions to make your workplace better.

508
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:47,990
Like that's sufficient enough to say how the results will be used, ask for help and advice, ask interesting questions.

509
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:51,260
I'm sure some of those are taking some real boring surveys.

510
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:55,429
Utilize sponsorship by a legitimate organization.

511
00:53:55,430 --> 00:54:04,520
So like for my dissertation that was on fire alarm evacuation, I, I didn't send all of them out myself.

512
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:09,799
So the public, I partnered with the university's public safety office and they sent a bunch of them

513
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:14,720
out for me because they are like a trusted or respected sponsor or for example,

514
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:19,730
now this opioid construction survey I sent, we're not going to the construction workers directly.

515
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:26,959
We're going through like the Center for Construction Research, the trade unions, the labor unions and safety managers.

516
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:32,630
So those are considered like sponsors stressed that opportunities to respond are limited.

517
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:40,340
So I don't use this that often. But, you know, if you have a survey incentive, sometimes people will do a raffle or like,

518
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:46,070
you know, the first 100 people who reply like five people can get a $25 gift card.

519
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:52,580
A raffle is always the more like financially efficacious method if you don't have that much money to spread around,

520
00:54:52,580 --> 00:55:00,680
but you still want people to respond, convey like, you know, other people have responded like 90% of your peers have already responded.

521
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:06,830
Make sure you get your response in today. Cash and material incentives to encourage reciprocity.

522
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:11,149
And don't deny that there's actually benefits. There's there's some benefits.

523
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:16,550
There's a reason why you're doing it. So you can't say, look, there's no reason why you're doing it because then people aren't going to do it.

524
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:21,920
You want to try to reduce the length and complexity, design the survey.

525
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,630
So it's easy to complete, avoid subordinating language or to look at some examples of this,

526
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:34,520
make it convenient to respond, avoid making respondents uncomfortable, and you can show how other people have responded.

527
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:39,679
The cool thing about Qualtrics, which you all have subscriptions to now,

528
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:45,140
they show on a panel how it looks on the smartphone as well, because so many people are going to take it on their phone.

529
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:48,680
And you don't want like a bunch of text that's cut off and it's really ugly.

530
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:59,360
I don't use Redcap. I know a lot of the AP people do just because it is care and like HIPA compliance that is less attractive looking.

531
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:05,419
But you have to think about how it's going to be perceived establishing trust.

532
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:08,510
Again, these things that we talked about and then.

533
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:17,120
Mm so online survey samples, so something like a mechanical Turk, for example,

534
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:27,620
this is potential source for research populations for participants, but it depends on like how much you pay them for their time.

535
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:31,270
What are the. Pros and cons. So this is essentially a kind of panel.

536
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:35,260
Another way you can do this is mobile population sampling.

537
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:39,910
So like I said, you stand outside like the grocery store, the mob or whatever.

538
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:47,319
I almost did this for my dissertation, but I didn't have time to do this, so I just ended up doing an online survey.

539
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,450
But this is a way,

540
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:58,179
if you have a population that you really can't access because you don't know how to use technology or like perhaps English isn't their first language.

541
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:04,480
So you need to have some kind of like translator, interpreter there, kind of helping them go through the questions.

542
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:12,560
Okay. So now we're going to this other side of the survey lifecycle when we're constructing it from measurement.

543
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:21,320
Next week, we'll talk more about validity. But constructs, as I alluded to, are ideas or information that we seek.

544
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:26,270
So again, these are things that we necessarily can't measure very easily,

545
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:32,480
like intercultural competence, financial stress, the likelihood of voting next election.

546
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:39,260
So constructs are generally abstract ideas like psychosocial factors.

547
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:44,390
So we are trying to quantify these abstract ideas in a way.

548
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:48,920
So usually it comes from a theoretical background.

549
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:57,500
And again, we'll talk more about this next week, but the validity of your construct depends on how well it's actually covered.

550
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:04,100
So, for example, just say my construct is.

551
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:14,200
My construct is job satisfaction, and I have three questions.

552
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:19,590
Generally, when you're establishing a survey question for a construct,

553
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:27,630
you want to aim for 3 to 4 questions within that area in order for it to be like statistically robust in case you need to drop one off.

554
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:35,460
So if my my construct is job satisfaction and my three questions are like how mid how,

555
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:40,890
you know, how often do you exercise 30 minutes a week or for 30 minutes each week?

556
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:47,520
I plan to eat fruits and vegetables in the next day and then like I take the stairs at work.

557
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:58,290
Like the the validity of those three questions together really have nothing to do with that actual construct of job satisfaction.

558
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,950
So if I were to pick a different three questions, for example,

559
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:12,450
like I feel my financial compensation for my effort is, you know, equal strongly agree to, to strongly disagree.

560
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:18,329
Like I enjoy coming to work strongly agree to strongly disagree like within those domains.

561
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:24,450
So we're trying to think about like are the questions that are making up this construct as it actually makes sense.

562
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:31,800
Mhm. So let's look at some questions and see if we can pick apart what's wrong with them.

563
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:42,120
So this first question, if you were in a foreign country and do not speak the language but knew someone who did, would you?

564
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:48,659
A Let the person that spoke the language speak for you be try to learn the

565
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:54,629
language on your own or see not try to learn the language or let that person,

566
00:59:54,630 --> 01:00:00,430
you know, speak the language for you. What's wrong with this question?

567
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:11,959
But I think to see that kind of split into multiple after because it's also like you could let the person speak for you,

568
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:18,310
both of them in their own language. Okay. Other issues with this question.

569
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:28,090
It overlaps with a. Yeah.

570
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:35,670
Yeah. So. So parts of the questions. I feel like this is a really can like long and convoluted and confusing question

571
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,709
where some of the answer choices overlap with what is in what we call the stem.

572
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:46,140
The question stem and yes C can be split into two options.

573
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:50,639
Okay. How about this one? Do you approve of the governor's oppressive crime policy?

574
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,150
What's wrong with this statement? It's like leader. It's leading.

575
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:57,360
Yeah, because you're using what term of oppression, right?

576
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:02,220
So you don't want to be oppressive. How about this first one?

577
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,080
What is your current age? Ten or less? 10 to 20.

578
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:12,690
20 to 30 or greater? Oh, no.

579
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:20,820
Yeah. Number one, there's overlap. So what if I'm ten? Through the tunnel or let's say 10 to 20 or it's a boat, right?

580
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:30,240
Yeah. Because in rotation, in surveys, when you have a box that's multi select, when you have a radio button or circle that indicates single select.

581
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:35,760
Also, like, what if I'm like 50? Yeah, but what if I'm 32?

582
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,950
And what if I'm 64? Do I really? Do we really belong in the same category?

583
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:44,100
Three categories are split up in kind of an arbitrary. Yeah, yeah.

584
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:49,470
Okay. How about this one? What percentage of teachers in your school are dedicated to their work?

585
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:55,070
What's wrong with this one? Like, how are you supposed to know that? How you just make it up?

586
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:59,990
I mean, you could do categories. You're like 10 to 30%, 30, 31.

587
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:03,959
I mean, like, as you get older, you're going to get really weird responses.

588
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:08,400
If somebody wants a 67.2, an older person to save one.

589
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:12,340
Yeah. So number one, how easy is it? How useless to quantify this?

590
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:20,070
Number two, if you're having an open ended box infinity, think about why you need it.

591
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:27,930
Because some people will put one, some people will put 1%, some people will type out the word one.

592
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:33,299
Some people will choose two. Right. Nobody. Just expletive at this place.

593
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:40,650
You know, so generally, if you're going to have like an open response question, sometimes we do that, do this for age, right?

594
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:45,690
Because rather than categories, you want a solid number to be able to get a mean.

595
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:51,360
So what you do is if you're building this online, you can restrict what the answers are.

596
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:58,860
So you can say it has to be a numerical value and it can only be within the range of like 0 to 100 to be an acceptable answer.

597
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:03,750
Or what percentage of teachers in your school are dedicated to their work?

598
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:10,920
Question mark parentheses e.g. 67% close parentheses.

599
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:15,780
So you give them an example of like what you want their response to look like.

600
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:22,350
But people still put all kinds of wild stuff. Like it's, it's, it's yeah.

601
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:26,850
So you have to think about the way you're, you're even like framing the question.

602
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:30,240
Yes. Bridget, do you because I did this on a survey once.

603
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:35,190
Do you usually do like the like how do you ask for John?

604
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:41,129
Because I've done it with the open box or people can respond because in that situation I was like, I know I can clean off the data.

605
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:46,680
It's not going to be that much. But do you do like an open box or do you do like a multiple choice for what?

606
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:54,750
For like gender or gender? I so I usually do a multiple choice.

607
01:03:55,230 --> 01:04:03,300
So let me see if I can think about having other box like multiple choice, different options and than other.

608
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:07,379
Yeah, because I mean it's it's the more open ended.

609
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:12,030
I mean these are docs where obviously for like numerical data doesn't make any sense.

610
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:16,860
Oh good. They didn't make me do the stupid do thing.

611
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:22,680
Okay, here, I will show you. So this is the survey I have going live on Monday.

612
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:27,540
Baby blue. Yes. You see tables. There was a reason for that, though.

613
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:33,420
So this is my this is the way I framed it. What is your current gender identity?

614
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:38,070
Males. Ashman Female slash woman. Transgender massage man.

615
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:43,860
Transgender female slash woman. Genderqueer gender nonconforming, other identity.

616
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:48,630
And then you leave a box to specify. So that way you don't have as much to clean up.

617
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:58,080
If you give enough categories where people like feel like they can select one and then you might have like a a handful of people do other,

618
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:04,860
and then you can choose how you want to like either reclassify them or you can create your own new category for that.

619
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:12,030
So that's how I'm doing that nowadays and like generally accepted way of doing it.

620
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:20,790
Or like do you have any sense of like if this is becoming more common or do people still do like the male female people still do the male female?

621
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:24,149
And like I mentioned with the waste workers,

622
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:32,310
like they laughed when I have these kind of questions because they don't like acknowledge other gender identities beyond the binary.

623
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:39,240
Right. Or like in this question here where I ask what is your height round to the nearest inch?

624
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:46,920
The asterisks next to it means that behind the scenes I've restricted what numbers they can put in there.

625
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:51,180
They can't all like ten feet tall. They can put ten, but they also can't type in the number.

626
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:56,940
Like they can't spell out t t n same with the weight thing.

627
01:05:57,150 --> 01:06:01,920
So, you know, it fully depends on what your target population is.

628
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:08,040
So if, you know, like for example, they're not going to give you anything beyond the binary, it's up to you.

629
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:17,100
I've also interested you. We heard from like fellow colleagues who identify as Hispanic and Latino and the Latino.

630
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:24,740
No community hates the term Latin X like it's like entirely made up by academics to be more inclusive.

631
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:32,580
But because of the way the romance languages are, you either put a O or a at the end of certain words, depending on what the word is.

632
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:37,319
So to them that's not specifically like a gendering, it's just the way their language is.

633
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:41,700
So they they don't feel like Latin acts actually represent them.

634
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,740
Like are Ritenour Latina.

635
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:54,120
So I've tried to like slowly get away from using these like made up terms by academics that don't actually apply to the people you're interested in.

636
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:57,810
Yeah. I also like I was in Spanish, I was like a double major.

637
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:05,070
Oh yeah. When I was studying abroad, this was kind of a thing with like young people,

638
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,209
and I'm not sure if people were actually like being Spanish speakers actually exist,

639
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:14,460
but they would say Latina because that works more with like the language.

640
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:18,650
You're speaking Spanish. There's no way for you to say Latin. Yeah, yeah.

641
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:23,070
And or like a E. Yeah, you got it like Latin.

642
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:28,560
Yeah. But that's like something I've been conscious about because I've always been cautious about landmarks.

643
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:34,030
I thought I was like, That's kind of odd to choose that, but I don't know.

644
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:38,490
Like, people actually use Latin. I don't know if that's like the younger generation starting to use it.

645
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:42,089
Yeah, I don't know how accepted it is. Yeah, I don't know.

646
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:52,920
I've not heard of that. So you know or like a lot of people will refer to like African Americans, but not everybody is American who is.

647
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:56,610
Yeah, black and black people have come out and said we're fine with just being called

648
01:07:56,610 --> 01:08:00,150
black or like obviously to whatever the community prefers to be called.

649
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:05,219
Yeah, but like I don't want to be called yellow. Like that's offensive to me, right?

650
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:10,680
But like, you know, whatever the community is comfortable being referred as to.

651
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:15,180
Yeah. So the next course of error is measurement error.

652
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:19,950
So this is the gap between the ideal measurement and the response obtained.

653
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:25,410
So was this due to random error with something totally out of your control?

654
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:30,660
Was this a biased response in terms of like who responded?

655
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:35,970
Was this an issue with the way your questions were written in terms of the validity of the questions?

656
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:40,229
Or is there a question, an issue with the reliability of your questions?

657
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:41,940
And we'll talk about that more next week.

658
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:50,850
So the fundamentals of question writing a question must be written so that every potential respondent will be

659
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:58,800
willing to answer and be able to interpret what you had intended the way for it to intend to be interpreted.

660
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:02,879
So any time you write a statement, you have to think about the cognitive effort.

661
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,510
You're asking from that person just to like respond to that.

662
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:11,160
So which of the following have you done or planned to do before you graduate?

663
01:09:11,790 --> 01:09:18,480
And this is a table, right? Participate in an internship, co-op, field experience, student teaching or clinical placement,

664
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,080
hold a formal leadership role, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

665
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:27,569
So like, this is a lot, right? And this is from the National Student Engagement Survey.

666
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:31,920
So this is just for undergrads, but this is a lot.

667
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:36,030
And there's like dozens and dozens of these tables to fill out.

668
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:42,719
So that's like a high cognitive effort request. So a couple of types of survey questions.

669
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:47,220
First is autobiographical facts or behaviors like how old are you?

670
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:50,430
Like, Do you intend to do this? What do you think you know?

671
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:57,989
And then attitudes are other objective states and then demographic sorry, demographic information is not autobiographical.

672
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:05,370
So like, you know, autobiographical would be like, how old were you when you found out Santa Claus wasn't real?

673
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:11,670
Someone like that. And then and then knowledge.

674
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:21,750
So about how many courses at this institution have included community based service, a community based project or service learning?

675
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:26,310
Almost some or none. How many of you feel like you can answer that question?

676
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:37,410
Like, could you confidently answer this? Not really. Okay, how about this one?

677
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:41,820
How would you evaluate your entire educational experience at this institution?

678
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:45,509
Excellent. Good, fair, poor. Feel good. Just send it.

679
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:50,680
Overall, that would be a better way of like the seven tires.

680
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:57,390
And how did you value your overall experience? Yeah, but it just makes it sound like review and every minute or.

681
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:01,110
I don't know. Yeah. And then, you know, the good with the bad.

682
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:06,900
Have you answered the survey on a really had a bad day or something like that.

683
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:13,530
Yes. You have to think about these kinds of things. Open ended versus close ended responses.

684
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:16,900
How many majors do you plan to complete? One or more than one.

685
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:20,220
Don't count your minors or you can leave it open ended.

686
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:25,260
Pros and cons to each. Obviously with the close I need, you're not.

687
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:29,190
You may not be capturing everyone as comprehensively but open ended.

688
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:34,979
Oh, you have so much more to code, so much more. And then other considerations.

689
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:41,430
Sensitive versus non sensitive questions. So have you been diagnosed with any disability or impairment?

690
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:45,870
What does that even mean? Do they mean physical? Do they mean like neurocognitive?

691
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:50,939
Like what are they referring to you? And then all which of the following has been diagnosed?

692
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:58,200
Select all that apply sensory mobility learning mental health disorder disability

693
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:02,220
impairment not listed above like these are considered sensitive questions.

694
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:17,220
I have a friend who is Neurodivergent and she's in academia and they ask us these questions when we apply, like, do you have a disability or whatever?

695
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:24,400
And I'm very open about mental health, so like I am diagnosed depression and anxiety which who is in these days right now.

696
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,090
But they would consider that like a mental health impairment.

697
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:32,240
Do I mark that I need accommodations when I apply to jobs?

698
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:36,159
No, I don't, because you just have to keep functioning.

699
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:43,569
But I asked her because she has, you know, ADHD and then like a very low, low form,

700
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:47,110
like not a low form of autism, but like, you know, a mild form of autism.

701
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:54,879
So I asked her, like, when you apply for your postdocs and whatnot, like do you attempt do you intend to like Margaret you need accommodations?

702
01:12:54,880 --> 01:13:06,880
And she was like, absolutely not. Like, I spend so much time masking to try to like appear normal that like she is pretty open about it,

703
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:10,930
but she would not like mark that down on like a survey or like employment stuff.

704
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:18,910
So those are things to consider this one again with the tables, this is often the same survey.

705
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:24,190
This one when you put I don't know what this is, I don't know.

706
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:29,910
Not applicable. You really have to think about when you want to use this option.

707
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:42,340
These aren't sensitive questions. So if it was like asking people about their drug use history, I totally get the like do not want to respond option.

708
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:47,319
But if you put this in to let everybody have that, I don't know where.

709
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:53,290
I declined to answer for everything. This is essentially counting is like missing data.

710
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:56,919
So that's how they did the survey research. It is.

711
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:00,010
It is represented. Okay.

712
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:05,650
I'll finish off on this one. So and then we'll continue the rest on Tuesday.

713
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:10,179
Three types of survey questions. So first is nominal, right?

714
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:18,460
So you're either having like categories with no natural order, gender identity, race, ethnicity, marital status, country of citizenship.

715
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:25,870
Then for ordinal, right, you might have actual intervals like never, sometimes, often and very often.

716
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:32,410
We don't naturally know what the scale is between the two, but we'll generally assign some kind of number between them.

717
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:41,560
And then scale questions are things like How many hours do you spend a week on your phone, which now in your phone tells you what your screen time is?

718
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:46,959
Or like, you know, how many servings of fruits and vegetables did you eat this week?

719
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:53,680
Those are scale questions, but you can totally turn nominal and ordinal into continuous variables.

720
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:56,980
You just have to think about how you want to do that. Mm hmm.

721
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:05,390
Okay. I know that was a lot, so I'm going to take a stop there.

722
01:15:05,390 --> 01:15:08,530
I keep saying my front camera is going off. Oh, okay. I know what's happening.

723
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:14,139
So I keep getting notifications on my watch that the camera detects motion.

724
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:17,920
But it's the kid who moves my line on Thursday. So it's like, what's happening?

725
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:21,639
Who's trying to break in? Okay, so that's all I have.

726
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:25,780
Do I have any questions about today's content so far?

727
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:31,150
Okay. This is, again, you know, kind of we're trying to.
