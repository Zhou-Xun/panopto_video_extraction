1
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,750
All right. Every one of you all doing well today.

2
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,130
Hopefully, we don't have any more fire alarms during this lecture.

3
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,180
I'm starting off today on our global overview of HIV AIDS.

4
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,580
Good work on.

5
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:51,140
I saw a lot of really great comments and questions on there, so I hope that you enjoyed the video and the readings and go ahead and get started.

6
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,550
So first, just a brief overview of the lecture. Let's start with an overview of HIV AIDS history.

7
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,530
Let's go over some global health interventions. The current status of disease.

8
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,640
And then Ryan will do a case study on South Africa and Zimbabwe.

9
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:16,700
And then we will end with small group discussion on the 95, 95, 95 target with for case studies and the important link there.

10
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,470
It's also linked on the schedule on the first canvas.

11
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,610
I'm going to just get started with a brief video here for you.

12
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:41,960
About 37 million people around the world are currently living with AIDS, making the disease one of the worst pandemics in modern history.

13
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,240
AIDS or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is a disease in which the human immune

14
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:55,320
system is severely impaired caused by human immunodeficiency virus or HIV.

15
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,000
It is the last stage of the virus infection.

16
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:11,100
HIV attacks by entering the bloodstream and attaches to fatigue or worse than the time with AIDS caused by infections.

17
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,069
First, HIV attaches itself to a stadium or cell,

18
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:23,860
and they usually releases its genetic material into the stadium for sound, which combines with the cell's DNA.

19
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:34,120
This allows the virus to produce more HIV proteins inside the protein presentation released to take other C4 cells.

20
00:02:42,300 --> 00:03:01,500
Not sure. Without HIV medicine and individuals intentionally spread, it would actually 12 years advance to become AIDS is decreasing in it.

21
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,050
It makes patients with a number of diseases, including infections dementia.

22
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:18,030
Scientists believe that HIV originated in West Central Africa, where a similar virus was found.

23
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,630
And you can see it as a realist around the turn of the 20th century.

24
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:32,190
The virus was transmitted to humans due to the idea that we have the virus spread from everything through the mid 1960s,

25
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,160
through a single carrier, eventually making its way around the world.

26
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:44,820
In 1982, scientists of an AIDS in the following identified the virus spreading HIV.

27
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,960
Ever since, about 77.3 million people around the world contracted HIV,

28
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:57,630
with the majority of affected individuals living in countries with very few resources.

29
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,150
Scientists are working to one day develop a cure for AIDS.

30
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:10,590
In the meantime, advancements in biotechnology increase awareness, prevention and access medical care.

31
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,050
Getting those older kids and finally exterminating the disease.

32
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,080
All right. So that was just a quick little overview of HIV and AIDS.

33
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,970
So first, I want to start with a timeline of the HIV outbreak.

34
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:43,480
Kind of the first indicator of HIV globally was identified by the CDC in 1981 in California.

35
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:52,510
And a young gay man, he had a skin cancer lesion called Kaposi's sarcoma, which was out of the ordinary for minutes his age.

36
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:01,600
And then rapidly over the next few months, we start to see more and more cases of that pop up, especially in like L.A. and New York.

37
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,740
And then over basically across the entire United States, these cases start to show up.

38
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,679
One of the things, though, that you write in your reading, which I hope you notice that it's quite interesting,

39
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,770
is that HIV typically takes about 8 to 10 years before an HIV infection turns into

40
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:23,650
AIDS and causes symptoms like skin cancer that was noted in this young man in 1981.

41
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,530
So thinking about your first reading that you had for today.

42
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,900
Just really quickly, what does that indicate to you?

43
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,460
The first case is noted in 1981, but it takes about 8 to 10 years for HIV to turn into AIDS.

44
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,840
It was circulating before that. Yes. Precisely.

45
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,840
And what are the implications of this? Presumably.

46
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:55,330
There it is. Correct. And furthermore, there's also, like we noted in the video, there's cases that are taking place elsewhere in the world.

47
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:01,180
So there's this narrative about HIV AIDS, about being found in California and starting to spread.

48
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,880
And I live in New York City. But given it takes about ten years for HIV to turn into AIDS,

49
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:14,860
we clearly have cases that are endemic spread prior to kind of what is the typical story of the HIV outbreak.

50
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:30,280
So there. Right here. Is a graph of the blue line, a t cell count, and the red line is HIV, RNA copies and plasma.

51
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:37,600
So as you can see right around here, this is where thera conversion happened.

52
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:45,940
So this is the initial infection. And at this point in time here, you would have some noticeable symptoms like flu like symptoms, fever, cold.

53
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:52,420
But it's a whole range of symptoms that don't necessarily indicate anything specific or out of the ordinary.

54
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:59,830
So when when it first started circulating in the US, we didn't really notice anything specific here that would have caused an alarm.

55
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,020
But over here, once we get into that eight to 9 to 10 year mark,

56
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,840
this is when your T cells really drop off and HIV copies and nerve cells start to ramp up.

57
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:18,940
And without intervention around this 10 to 11 year mark, here is when you would potentially have like an AIDS related.

58
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,970
Yeah. Go ahead. Oh, sorry. I just wanted to ask, with the Kaposi sarcoma, was that found?

59
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,450
And just like the patient that was the first one identified have HIV?

60
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,350
Or was that found in multiple or multiple?

61
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:40,320
Yeah. The very first case that was reported to the CDC did have the Kaposi's sarcoma.

62
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,880
But what really caused it to start ramping up to be a public health crisis is

63
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,710
that doctors across the country were sending in cases to the CDC of young,

64
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,209
predominantly gay men who were having skin cancer. And like, why?

65
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,450
What's going on here? Clearly, something that's happening that's out of the ordinary.

66
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,640
You wouldn't see skin cancer happening in this population under normal circumstances.

67
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:13,889
So we got into this just a little bit. But in terms of the origins of HIV, so it did come from the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus,

68
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:25,080
which was a virus circulating in primates in eastern Central Africa and as early as the late 1800s,

69
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:34,170
although most likely in the 1930 that morning to the NIH, the earliest known samples we have of HIV date back to about 1959.

70
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,110
So the HIV, when it came into human contact, that's when it transformed into HIV.

71
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,900
So there's two strains of HIV, HIV one and HIV two.

72
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:55,530
They came into humans separately. So two different kind of exposures were they be changed into HIV and then to different strains of HIV.

73
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,860
HIV one is the most common strain globally, while HIV two is most common in West Africa.

74
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,810
HIV two is harder to transmit than HIV one and has a lower transmission risk and heterosexual contact,

75
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,340
as well as a much lower transmission risk between mother and child.

76
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:24,180
So that also can potentially lead into why we have this kind of major circulation happening in Africa prior to us noting things in the U.S.,

77
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:32,010
just namely that HIV, too, was the more common strain in Africa, less likely to be transmitted and.

78
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,600
The symptoms, perhaps a little bit less severe at first.

79
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:47,190
And then earlier research is showing that in the 1980s, prevalence of HIV and AIDS in Central Africa was already extremely high.

80
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:54,149
About 35% of truck drivers in one study and over 9% of blood donors had HIV.

81
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:59,420
And there in a test that was noted and this mid 1980s.

82
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,410
So you have this narrative in the US, right, of this disease that's impacting gay men.

83
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,380
But we already have really high community prevalence of this disease and East and Central Africa.

84
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:17,840
And then so we have this endemic disease in Africa circulating in the community at large.

85
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:23,730
It's not really getting a lot of attention globally because it was kind of confined to the African continent, at least at first.

86
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,479
But then once it comes into the US and Western Europe,

87
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,580
that's when you start to see kind of like the CDC and global health organizations began to take it seriously.

88
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:44,200
I'm going to skip this video. We already kind of went over a segue into HIV and just want to make sure we have enough time for all my five.

89
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,230
So the main mode of transmission for HIV, you're probably all aware.

90
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,810
Sexual contact, breastfeeding, blood transfusions, direct contact and shared needles.

91
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:02,980
By region, it does break down a little bit differently in terms of the main mode of transmission and something here in Africa.

92
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,040
The primary mode is heterosexual contact as well as mother to child transmission,

93
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,740
although that has been decreasing with higher uptake of ARPU over the last few years.

94
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,090
And Eastern Europe. Central Asia, North Africa and Middle East.

95
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,910
Injection drug use as a primary leading cause of transmission of HIV.

96
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,660
And then in North America, Western Europe and Oceana. Homosexual contact.

97
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,220
One thing that I did want to know here, to avoid this issue of stigma,

98
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,240
we're going to keep kind of talking about as it relates to HIV, which really does impact our data.

99
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,180
So there could potentially be errors in our data here. Right.

100
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:51,389
So in countries that have a really strong social stigma against homosexual contact, the data that you're collecting,

101
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,980
you might not be getting fully accurate data in terms of like how did this person actually get HIV?

102
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,090
Are they being fully truthful in terms of like from where with their exposure?

103
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:09,480
So that could in part lead into why we're seeing different modes of contact as being the primary transmitters of HIV in different regions.

104
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,219
The quick chart is on risk of transmission by exposure.

105
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,710
So shared drug use is the most risky behavior, followed by receptive anal intercourse.

106
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:28,540
And it kind of goes down from there, oral intercourse being kind of the least risky transmission.

107
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,860
With early impact on busy.

108
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:43,830
So we start to see these cases happen in the 1980s and then into the 1990s we're seeing really high morbidity and mortality associated with HIV.

109
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:51,750
In the 1980s, the W.H.O. reported that global cases increased by about 56% over seven years,

110
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:58,230
and in the US that quickly became the leading cause of death in men aged between 25 and 44.

111
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:06,190
Globally. By 22, HIV becomes a leading cause of death for all people aged 15 to 49.

112
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,300
So that's just over the course of two decades. It becomes a leading cause of death.

113
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:23,040
At the initial impact of disease, especially in the US and Western Europe, we do have this really strong stigma attached to the disease.

114
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:29,740
So it's HIV. And then there was kind of a for ages that were described as being the poor communities most impacted,

115
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:36,190
at least what was being seen in the United States. Homosexuals, hemophiliacs, who got blood transfusions.

116
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,670
So we weren't testing blood for HIV at first. And that's why there was really this big spread of HIV in that community.

117
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:50,310
Haitians and heroin addicts, we talked already about sharing drug shared drug use patients.

118
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:57,130
There was a couple of specific incidents of people from Haiti that came into the U.S. that tested positive for HIV.

119
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:05,590
They kind of became a scapegoat for the idea that HIV was coming into the US from other places, even though like we talked about,

120
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:11,860
there was obviously widespread community endemic spread of the disease prior to this outbreak being noted.

121
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:21,760
And so. At the time where we kind of had these major news stories of immigrants from Haiti coming to the US who tested positive.

122
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:27,910
The US put into place a ban on entrance for anyone that test positive for HIV,

123
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:34,520
which was actually in place until 2012 when it was repealed under Obama, which is very surprising to me.

124
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,570
I was not aware that it lasted that long in terms of morbidity.

125
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:44,640
50 to 80% of hospital beds in sub-Saharan Africa were dedicated to HIV.

126
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:53,080
And the eighties and nineties. And then most African countries saw over 50% of adult mortality attributed to HIV.

127
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:57,250
I thought a topical note this and the perusal.

128
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:07,410
High rate of infant mortality from HIV. So over 50% of infants born to HIV positive mothers died before their second birthday.

129
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:14,219
So there's this transmission from mother to child. We don't yet have a ARVs which can stop that transmission.

130
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,760
And then you have events with very weak immune systems that are not prepared,

131
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,620
that are not able to like they don't even last that ten years, basically.

132
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:33,340
So the early global burden of disease, this is kind of a prevalence map of HIV in Africa from 1986 to 2001.

133
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:41,800
You can see kind of at the beginning, you have more cases in Central Africa, but then over the course of about 15 years,

134
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:50,410
you get up and down and the southern regions of Africa here, you have to look at 20 and 40% prevalence of HIV.

135
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,389
It's not able to find recent data on kind of global incidents.

136
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:02,870
But this is or I wasn't I wasn't able to find data from like the 1980s and global incidents,

137
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:09,480
which is what I was looking for, mostly because that data wasn't being tracked yet, but this is data from 2015.

138
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:17,340
So as you can see, incidence of HIV per 100,000 has dropped pretty dramatically.

139
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:25,110
It's pretty low in most of the world. Most of these regions are in the zero two, eight or eight, the 20 per 100,000.

140
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:33,840
But we still have this major region and southern Africa as well as Central Africa where you're seeing these really high rates of HIV incidence.

141
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:51,830
I mean, some water. Going back to the conversation we were having about modes of transmission.

142
00:16:51,840 --> 00:17:02,120
So outside of sub-Saharan Africa, 94% of new HIV infections are still in kind of those key communities that we discussed.

143
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:09,530
Men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, people in prison and sex workers or transgender people.

144
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,950
And that's compared to 51% in sub-Saharan Africa.

145
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:20,840
So again, we're seeing a much higher prevalence of heterosexual contact, as well as current to child transmission of HIV.

146
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,810
There are currently 38.4 million people living with HIV globally.

147
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:36,890
About 85% of them know their status, and 28 million of those are on an advanced antiretroviral therapy.

148
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,870
There were 1.5 million new infections last year and about 650,000 people dying of

149
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,340
AIDS last year for a total of 40 million deaths since the beginning of the pandemic.

150
00:17:51,680 --> 00:18:01,850
You can see the incidence mortality ratio here. So you have a spike in incidence in about like the 1994 or so.

151
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,480
And then our highest spike in mortality is in about 2004.

152
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:12,320
So again, there is that ten year gap between the initial infection and when an AIDS related death might take place.

153
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,870
So we have this rapidly spreading global pandemic of disease.

154
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:22,910
And what causes the countries to begin starting to take action?

155
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:31,309
So one of the most important things was that globally there becomes begin to be a recognition that HIV is not just

156
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:38,510
contained within homosexual communities or kind of the four h communities of people that were easier to stigmatize.

157
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:48,080
So. As we start to note high levels of HIV infection broadly in communities, countries begin starting to take action,

158
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,700
especially in Africa, as well as some of the global health organizations.

159
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,440
We think kind of about like a contemporary example here.

160
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,970
So when AIDS first started, it was called red or gay related.

161
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,430
And the deficiency basically just thought this is happening with gay men.

162
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:13,580
We don't know why this is a disease once it becomes being called HIV and we're recognizing that it's not just contained within those communities.

163
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:19,010
That's when it changes to HIV. And if you think about a recent example, we have monkeypox.

164
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,530
It starts out being this disease. Everyone is saying it's like a gay disease.

165
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:24,980
It's only spreading in gay men.

166
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:32,990
And then we start to have some education right over the next couple of months of actually, that's not the only way that this can be transmitted.

167
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,050
And it's not only gay men that are having these infections.

168
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,659
Some really prominent narratives also help to shake the thought that you have a bunch

169
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:47,600
of celebrities that test positive for HIV and or die of AIDS as well as Ryan White.

170
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,440
He was a 13 year old kid and school in Indiana.

171
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:58,860
He was a hemophiliac, actually got HIV from a blood transfusion and was banned from attending school.

172
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,650
It was this really prominently court battle and administrative appeals case.

173
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:11,919
To try and get him back into school. That kind of media attention.

174
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:21,560
And then he died at the age of 18. And he was a big kind of reason to promote intervention on HIV treatment.

175
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:27,350
We'll get more into him later. I don't know how you all do this.

176
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:36,860
Them every day, even. Going to talk a lot with the mask on, straight out my throat.

177
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:47,580
And then importantly. You begin to start seeing community organizations start to take action.

178
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,850
So you have an act up in the US and you have similar groups of gay men in the UK and in

179
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:57,470
Western Europe that are starting to protest and ask their government to take action.

180
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:05,540
And you also have organizations in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of Africa that are founded to raise awareness,

181
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:13,989
to protest lack of action by their governments. And to try and get action to be taken.

182
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:18,550
So the Take the Treatment Action Campaign was formed in South Africa in 1998.

183
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:25,629
I don't know. Some of you might have read the reading about South Africa for the class that was scheduled.

184
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:30,040
So if you thought in their constitution there is a universal right to health care.

185
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:36,310
So part of the protest that took place by the to see was saying there's this universal right to health care

186
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,830
transmission from mother to child can be stopped if interventions are taken and they're not being taken.

187
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,660
And so they they started doing some really effective protest against the government.

188
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,520
They sued the government and pharmaceutical companies to try and get them to start taking action.

189
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:58,210
And I tell you, a quick video from. The Treatment Action Campaign.

190
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:03,400
I might not complete the whole thing, but we'll get started with some of the.

191
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:29,600
What's going to happen if I say to someone that they think I did 6 minutes and then asking for health for you to try to make it right.

192
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:37,490
I just got the theatrics and the reason that they're so expensive in South Africa.

193
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:47,230
You have it and you. Didn't know anything about ice industry as a workforce.

194
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:59,680
We don't see any actual applications. What we're saying today is that the government is going to allow this to happen.

195
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:07,130
In this country appropriate to deny access.

196
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,070
That's what it means. All right.

197
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,139
So I don't I take up too much time, but there's this idea, right,

198
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:20,660
that if your health care is supposed to be covered by the government and then you can't access these drugs because they're unaffordable,

199
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:26,360
that becomes one of their primary focuses for their protest.

200
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:35,120
So a brief bit on treatment. So the first blood test for HIV comes about in 1984 and 1987.

201
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:43,190
We have the first antiretroviral therapy for HIV, but it's extremely expensive at first and very hard to come by.

202
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,650
We then talking about Ryan White just a little bit more.

203
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,910
So Congress passes the Ryan White Act, which provides federal funding for care and treatment of HIV.

204
00:23:54,510 --> 00:24:00,810
It continues to be the largest source of funding for HIV treatment and care in the United States.

205
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,220
The first oral test for HIV comes about in 1994.

206
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:17,450
And in 1995. We have a highly active antiretroviral therapy, which is a three combination air treatment,

207
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,840
which really starts to dramatically reduce mortality from HIV.

208
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:26,510
But in 1999, at Philip morris, leading cause of death globally and the first leading cause of death in Africa.

209
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:34,030
However, in the US we start to notice a drop of 40% due to uptake of HRT.

210
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:40,060
Generic manufacturers begin selling discounted air to low and middle income companies.

211
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:48,490
And then recent developments in 2012. The FDA approved prep for HIV negative people to use as a means of production.

212
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:56,200
And there's also some current research. So there is some long acting injectable prep which has been approved.

213
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,440
And then there's current research going on on an HIV vaccine.

214
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:09,350
Of note for people in the US CAP is required to be covered by private and public insurance under the Affordable Care Act as preventative treatment.

215
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,600
So where do we focus our global health intervention efforts then?

216
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:27,830
So one of the biggest focuses for global health is trying to destigmatize and educate people around HIV.

217
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,030
So trying to move the conversation away from the poor is.

218
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:39,250
And educate people on both. How is HIV actually transmitted as well as what can we do to stop this transmission from taking place?

219
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:50,990
Focus this for education would be things like safe needle exchanges, condom use, safe sex practices, information for mothers about breastfeeding.

220
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:57,250
There's also a major issue with anti-retroviral therapies and viral suppression.

221
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:05,640
So. If you're taking her every day, you can suppress your viral load so that you cannot transmit HIV to another person.

222
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,770
But the cause of this is extremely high.

223
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:17,500
So this becomes a major focus for global health organizations and community organizations looking to increase access to HRT.

224
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,580
Male circumcision is a focus of some organizations.

225
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,560
It has been shown to reduce transmission by about 50 to 60%.

226
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:40,050
And about 10 million men have been circumcised over the past five years under circumcision campaigns.

227
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,930
Blood supply testing. Increased global access to prep.

228
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:58,230
Sorry. So global health interventions.

229
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,320
Some of the first interventions actually happened in Africa.

230
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:07,790
Uganda becomes the world's first African AIDS control program in 1986.

231
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,630
UNAIDS was formed in 1996 to serve as the UN's coordinating body for HIV.

232
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,450
And then Pap Bar is set up in 23. So this is a really important organization from the US.

233
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:31,960
It is the single largest donor. Donor for HIV relief efforts globally and spanned 50 countries.

234
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:39,540
Current funding for Pet Bar and UNAIDS from the United States is about $110 billion.

235
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:55,910
The U.N. Sustainable Development Goals includes a goal to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all all people at all ages.

236
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:04,280
Those were adopted in 2015. And one of those goals is to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030.

237
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:16,780
There are some private sector interventions that are people like the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation who have committed money.

238
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:24,790
And then currently there's about $22.6 billion in global funding available for HIV treatment and prevention.

239
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:33,810
So the U.N. AIDS has all the 90, 90, 90 targets change to 95.

240
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:40,260
But we'll talk about that later. Basically, that says that people living with HIV will know their status.

241
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:45,210
People diagnosed with HIV will have access to antiretroviral therapy.

242
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:51,270
And people on HRT will be able to achieve viral suppression by maintaining their adherence.

243
00:28:53,790 --> 00:29:00,580
In terms of progress. You can see here that in most of the world, really, the incidence of HIV has dramatically decreased.

244
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:07,050
While we still do have some major problems in South Africa, you can see new infections in the US here.

245
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:15,180
They've dropped really dramatically. We're kind of on track to reach about 3000 new infections by 2030.

246
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,600
In terms of access to energy. You can see the gaps here on air coverage.

247
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,540
At the front of the data for a decent number of countries.

248
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:36,440
But the largest gaps that we're seeing here are in Africa, the Middle East, and not naturally as the countries over here in Oceana.

249
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:46,979
And I think way the death rate fell, the highest number of HIV does taking place is in southern Africa,

250
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:52,610
Central Africa and actually Russia and Ukraine. All right.

251
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:59,300
I'm going to hand it over to Ryan. I don't think you missed on the slides I sent you earlier.

252
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,520
Maybe some I'll share my screen with and give.

253
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:15,609
Just throw one slider because it's probably better if you share the one with the video.

254
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:28,100
So I'll tell you when this gets back. Then we go.

255
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:39,790
Gray. Can you see that? Yes.

256
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,129
Bloomberg once again. Adam.

257
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,500
Well, my friends over there. Wonderful.

258
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:56,820
Very good. Awesome. So I'll just talk briefly about the HIV situation in Zimbabwe.

259
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,120
And it's worth noting that every country has a very different situation with HIV.

260
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:12,750
For example, in Zimbabwe and much of much of sub-Saharan Africa in general, there's pretty good awareness of HIV.

261
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:19,260
Almost everybody knows at least HIV exists as opposed to in Bangladesh, for example,

262
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:25,800
we just found out from one of our surveys that 80% of people in Bangladesh don't actually know that HIV is living.

263
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:33,750
So so take that into consideration. Also take into consideration that between different countries, you know,

264
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:42,270
even bordering countries because of political situations and and overall levels of health literacy, the context differs quite a bit.

265
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:50,280
Two examples out gay bar in that in Zimbabwe, homosexuality is still legal as opposed to in South Africa.

266
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:56,610
Homosexuality is not legal and the decent legal protections surrounding homosexuality,

267
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:02,400
even though the countries are so close to each other, causing pretty big differences in HIV care.

268
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:14,309
On the flip side, however, in Zimbabwe, the government has really never done things to deny HIV or stand the way of HIV care,

269
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:23,250
other than all the health care issues that come along with having a dictator for so many years as opposed to Africa even quite recently,

270
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,550
the president has has has, you know, spread misinformation and even denied HIV.

271
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:35,250
Two examples I'll give are the last president of South Africa, Jacob Zuma.

272
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:39,780
He allegedly raped one of his employees.

273
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:49,140
The the judicial process concluded it was consensual, having sex consensually.

274
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:57,650
But then it came out that this employee was HIV positive. And he said on national TV, Oh, I won't get HIV because I showered after I had sex with her.

275
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,810
And when you shower after you have sex, you can't get HIV.

276
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:12,270
Even worse than that, Sambo Mbeki, who was the president of South Africa between 1999 and 2008, blatantly said, Hey, HIV is not a thing.

277
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:22,140
It's it's it's just a conspiracy from the US and would not allow antiretrovirals to enter this African formulary.

278
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:27,270
So just keep that in mind. Is this very so much country by country?

279
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:39,510
But just to give you a bit of a background on HIV in Zimbabwe, there's about a 12% prevalence among people aged 50 to 49, higher in women than men.

280
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:45,500
But you have a few key populations to sex. Sex workers, they have a 45% prevalence.

281
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,420
Men who have sex with men who have a 21% prevalence and prisoners who have a 24% prevalence.

282
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:59,070
When you're looking at at least in 1999 is Zimbabwe is doing decently with the first two nannies.

283
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:07,230
96% of people living with HIV notice status, 91% of people living with HIV are on eighties.

284
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:13,350
HIV and AIDS are used interchangeably and 85% of people HIV have suppressed viral loads.

285
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:23,640
What is quite good is that 87% of pregnant people living with HIV are on abuse to prevent mother to child transmission.

286
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:28,890
And you have about 7000 people on track, which we'll talk about a bit more a second.

287
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:35,250
Zimbabwe does have high rates of of intimate partner violence, but 19%.

288
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:42,750
But just looking at a proxy of satisfaction and and access to reproductive health programing,

289
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:50,430
about 85% of women in Zimbabwe are satisfied with their reproductive health programing they are receiving.

290
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:58,290
Just talking briefly about the prevention methods you have in Zimbabwe.

291
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,650
The three main ones are male circumcision and condom distribution.

292
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:15,110
So Zimbabwe has actually circumcised about 80% of males aged between the ages, aged between 15 and 49, which is absolutely fantastic.

293
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,270
Normally the target is about 80%, so that's going really well.

294
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:27,870
They do that primarily through going house to house, village to village, town to town, using this bus.

295
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:34,080
This is a mobile male circumcision clinic where you go and you get circumcised and you get sent home.

296
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,920
So you don't have to go to a hospital or a health center, anything like that.

297
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:46,440
They also allow people they call medical practitioners there a sense the equivalent of a P.A. or an MP to do circumcisions.

298
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:51,450
And they've licensed a few different non-surgical ways circumcised,

299
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:58,440
one of which being essentially a constricting band which causes the foreskin to eventually die and kind of fall off.

300
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:06,730
Prep is another big one. So a majority of at risk populations at least accept crack.

301
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,010
But sometimes access is a bit of an issue. They have to be targeted for that.

302
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,730
I do just want to point out to to kind of new things in the world of crack.

303
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:23,760
The first is injectable prep where you just have to get injected every month and that is your prep.

304
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,620
And the second is a vaginal ring which lasts a few months.

305
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:32,610
The only thing I would mention about the bachelor ring, though,

306
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:40,590
is it only has about 27% effectiveness, so decreases your chance of getting HIV by 27%.

307
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:45,320
And you have to be cognizant of this compensation.

308
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:49,799
So people often might be on prep and say, I can have unprotected sex,

309
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:57,870
but that's not the case, especially if you have an intervention which is only 27% effective.

310
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:06,360
And finally, condoms. 79% of adults in Zimbabwe used condoms in their last high risk sex,

311
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:18,210
which is sex with somebody who is not not their usual partner or or or men having sex with men or something like that.

312
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:27,209
Pretty interestingly in Zimbabwe, this is a project I was quite privileged to work on that the condom market was only free.

313
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:31,710
Condoms were available until about, you know, was seven, eight years ago.

314
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,840
And usually, you know, the condoms you would get from, say, if you went to, you know,

315
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,249
whatever office and you mentioned there was a standard condom, that kind of smelly.

316
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,130
They were really thick. They they just weren't good condoms.

317
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:53,190
So Nadia, the NGO I was working for had was what if we introduce, you know, condoms, which is still affordable to most of the population,

318
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:57,990
but kind of market them in the way that say, hey, these are like actually really good condoms is a luxury item.

319
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,390
And that intervention worked quite well because then you had men going from set,

320
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:10,830
going from not wanting to use a condom to buying these condoms and almost using them as a status symbol, you know, telling telling their partners.

321
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,979
I bought, you know, the good condom, so you should have sex me.

322
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:21,680
And that worked really well. Jonathan, if I can hand it back to you for this slide since there's a video.

323
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,390
Wonderful. Thank you. Just a second on the video.

324
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:51,329
So then you get into how we tested and screened for HIV in Zimbabwe.

325
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:57,960
And, you know, they don't use the method of going to a healthcare clinic or going to your doctor or hospital for this.

326
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,800
The big thing over there was bringing HIV testing to people.

327
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:07,650
So it started off, you know, when they started doing it, having these tents that you see on top.

328
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:14,100
And they would set these tense up in malls and parks, you know, just anywhere in the community.

329
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,659
And people could come by and get tested. But this year you had which you talk about quite often,

330
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:25,110
is people still don't want to be seen these areas and they don't want their parents or their neighbors or or whoever to see them.

331
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:33,210
Walking into this tent about seven or eight years ago, HIV self-test became approved by the W.H.O.

332
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,510
And these look like a pregnancy test or a COVID test.

333
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:40,290
I guess the analogy you can use these days is know no, that is.

334
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:46,410
And you just swab the inside of your mouth and it'll give you your HIV test result.

335
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,390
I will caveat, though, that these are antigen tests.

336
00:39:51,780 --> 00:40:00,600
So an issue we did run into in Zimbabwe was people would get tested on the self-test and test, go on to ARVs.

337
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:09,299
They would then go to their traditional healer who would say you're healed because they were on jobs, they wouldn't have any antigens.

338
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,100
They would test negative on the antigen test.

339
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:18,270
So take test again and see if the traditional healer work it would come negative because they're virally stressed and then they would go out to HIV.

340
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:26,820
But I was, you know, one problem we saw with this and now we will play a video just kind of showing you how the Self-testing program worked.

341
00:40:48,130 --> 00:41:13,630
Does that sound? Game that I wasn't interested in making that deal because I forgot the real deal.

342
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,820
That would be really good and it wasn't going to be that easy.

343
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:39,780
Similarly is always something that's a to see and that we say goodbye to is the way we've.

344
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:45,570
Think so.

345
00:41:45,840 --> 00:42:08,820
Look, it isn't always easy to see that these are all in danger when it is getting a little other cases.

346
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:18,340
Let's see what they. I got to go.

347
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:34,340
I got to go. It is in the. And then I got up to, you know I don't son of.

348
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,170
Because he went down without significant illness.

349
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:50,250
So would you take the risk of injury you.

350
00:42:55,580 --> 00:43:12,800
I think we can move on that. And then the last step in the HIV care cascade was initiation of difference on art labs.

351
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:18,920
So what we did was we made sure people as soon as I tested positive for HIV, obviously,

352
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,970
if that was a test positive in one of the clinics or test community testing sites,

353
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:33,890
was there in the same day was to a counselor where abuse be initiated so they get a few weeks supply of the BS being

354
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:42,080
initiated on ARVs early is pretty heavily associated with being adherent on your ARVs and also ultimately suppressing,

355
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:52,130
suppressing your viral load. It's also important to note that when even if someone tested negative, they would then receive counseling on on HIV.

356
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:56,240
So they'd say, okay, great, you're negative. Yes. How you keep yourself negative.

357
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,230
Here's how to use condoms. Do you want to get circumcised for the males?

358
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:07,730
And they would, you know, even be maybe give them STI screening or refer to other services like that.

359
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:14,389
But this is only possible, but this is only possible, particularly the same the HIV initiation,

360
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:19,790
if you integrate HIV testing and counseling with clinical care services.

361
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:27,260
So you have to make sure any testing programs are, you know, well integrated and you coordinate with the clinical care services.

362
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:31,820
And it's also possible to have other matters of integration.

363
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,950
Couples testing is a great one.

364
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:42,480
What we would actually use to do in Valentine's Day was we would say, come in for, you know, junior partner, come in for HIV test.

365
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,589
We give them like a coupon for like KFC or something like that to have dinner sometimes

366
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:50,419
that was thinking back probably isn't the best thing for a health NGO doing,

367
00:44:50,420 --> 00:45:00,799
but it worked out integrating the HPV vaccination, you know, thinking people are already here to get the HIV test or get circumcised.

368
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,220
They have some level of willingness for these kind of services.

369
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:09,740
We can probably get them vaccinated against HPV or testing powder, STIs or other diseases.

370
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:19,640
And we will now watch video about integration of the HIV Self-testing service with other services in South Africa.

371
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:29,270
Alexandra, the challenge to these monsters that is in these days,

372
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:34,580
they they're do that with a lot of influence and letting them be through the various.

373
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:46,800
So in this area, about 5000 people in council over the country are actually some of them living on their own.

374
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:55,470
Some of them living with their families. Some of them are living in an area like Nisour Square where there's a lot of prostitution going on.

375
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:06,060
Obviously don't just like abuse. They are basically said to be a population like you're going to die on the streets.

376
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:15,600
So, you know, just three days out, baby, some of them are waiting.

377
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:19,520
They may take that chance.

378
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:25,960
I think that has been very important to me.

379
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:33,240
I think they know that because people have been questioned.

380
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:37,320
Because you know what I remember.

381
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:41,240
Yes. That's May.

382
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:45,000
So it's important to know that these things.

383
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:58,480
Yeah. People are testing HIV negative now. So it's it's worth noting that.

384
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:05,380
So by removing the foreskin, I'll be protected. And that's one thing that can be accomplished.

385
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:10,470
Coming from a musical piece. I think it's all about me always in South Africa.

386
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,840
I think the government is and that you can't have the same size.

387
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,930
5.5 million, maybe it's not like that.

388
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:20,380
It's the bill that started in 2009, 2010.

389
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:28,920
Maybe go go the house and maybe find a place with this kind of space.

390
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:50,710
There is a facility and inside is line to speak to finance or expenses depending on the space to take every time.

391
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:54,290
So they receive exclusivity. They know these service.

392
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:08,760
But the evidence that we have done is that people say populations that one is not testing people at high risk of HIV infection.

393
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:17,550
Yes, it was also done in Zimbabwe, in Malawi, in Sofia, that he could increase rates of HIV testing at community level.

394
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:22,560
Before our investment in HIV self-testing the market was non-existent.

395
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:27,179
Today we're excited to see the momentum being generated as more countries in Africa

396
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:31,660
and beyond start to integrate this key innovation in their HIV testing service.

397
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:42,570
I think we can probably start that. Is that because in the end I'm handing out condoms.

398
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:53,399
So the idea of HIV testing. So I just want to point out as well, the people in that video, they know that community very, very well.

399
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,690
So. Lindsay whoo hoo!

400
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:04,230
Talk a little bit out of privilege of walking with her a little bit. When I was in South Africa and when we used to go to Alex.

401
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,700
People will know her. They would like say hi to her. She'd walk into restaurants and they would know her order.

402
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:13,980
And that is so important for these kinds of programs. So back to Jonathan now.

403
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:17,860
All right. Thanks for. I am.

404
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:31,250
So just want to discuss briefly the one article that you had on COVID 19 and our progress report, the 90 1990 or the 95, 95, 95 goal.

405
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:35,980
So it's all a brief but a classic question.

406
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:43,810
So what what do you think are some factors that impact our progression to 1990 Target, specifically thinking about COVID 19.

407
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:58,030
I know you all are addicts. I saw your comments on this article, though.

408
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:13,860
On now. Yeah. Jump in. All right. I found one point pretty interesting in regards to how in some countries they helped just the came in with COVID.

409
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:21,180
They were forced to hand out like self-test treatment or like test testing equipment for COVID.

410
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:28,830
And they're potentially seeing that those same pathways in regards to passing out HIV tests.

411
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:32,310
And so I thought that transportation system was pretty interesting.

412
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:35,670
And I feel like oftentimes, I mean, obviously COVID was bad and everything,

413
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:40,200
but it's good to see that there are some things that we can learn from it and

414
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:45,180
implement and use to implement and other cases of other like illnesses and stuff.

415
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:51,660
Thank you. Very insightful. And I want to just add on to that.

416
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,719
That's that's an excellent point.

417
00:50:53,720 --> 00:51:01,560
Now, but it's also important to acknowledge most of the HIV self-testing programs were done in low middle income countries,

418
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,860
mostly in southern and eastern Africa.

419
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:11,220
And if you look at COVID self-testing the first countries to adopt, it was once at least in Africa,

420
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:15,390
but high income countries like the US and UK and European countries,

421
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:23,490
they have this refusal to learn to take lessons learned in low income countries and apply to their own countries,

422
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:27,070
which delayed self-testing for COVID, you know, a lot of high income countries.

423
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:31,110
So if anybody, you know, goes into work domestically in the US,

424
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:35,550
making sure you still acknowledge lessons learned from low income countries because they're still perfectly valid.

425
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:43,350
Absolutely. Thank you, Ryan. Anyone else.

426
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:56,340
The reading mentioned a few things. One Reduced availability of routine outpatient HIV care, especially during the first few months,

427
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:01,559
kind of hospitals kind of closing down outpatient clinics,

428
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:09,300
not doing as much routine primary care, shifting to virtual visits, reductions and testing volume.

429
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:15,780
People are having delays in seeking care. One thing that I think is really interesting is reduced adherence to prep.

430
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:22,229
So I think Prep is amazing. The fact that you can take like an HIV prevention drug,

431
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:28,440
you just take it daily and basically you're pretty much guaranteed like 99% effective

432
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,550
if you take it every day the way you're supposed to take it and not get HIV.

433
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:36,870
However, especially beginning in the pandemic, Prep really took a big hit,

434
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:45,420
both in terms of not increasing uptake to new people looking for prep as well as in reduced adherence.

435
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:51,910
Interested to see some more recent data, and I think part of it may have been people were social distancing,

436
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:57,660
maybe people weren't going out to the bathroom, might not have been having as many sexual partners as they used to have.

437
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:03,720
And so maybe they feel they're going to be as much of a need of adhering to Prep regularly.

438
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:14,190
But there was a pretty steep decrease in daily adherence and a pretty steep increase in what they call on demand prep,

439
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:21,659
which is essentially like if I were to say like, Oh, I have a date next weekend, so I'm going to take prep for a few days or maybe a week,

440
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:26,580
even until that day, and then like I'll be good and just use that kind of as needed.

441
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:37,200
A lot of people also lost contact with their providers during the COVID 19 pandemic, so we could see an increased risk of HIV progressing into AIDS.

442
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:42,120
This is especially prevalent in migrant populations and low income populations,

443
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:48,450
people that might not have access to the telemedicine offerings that came about during COVID.

444
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:54,180
So if you're losing contact with your provider or you're losing contact with a community health center,

445
00:53:54,180 --> 00:54:00,089
that might be the one that is offering you free testing and helping you get your anti-retroviral therapy.

446
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:06,899
All of those community health centers kind of either shut down temporarily or had reduced offering of services,

447
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:11,760
maybe reduced clinic hours where they used to go after work and now they're no longer open after work.

448
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:19,860
There was little change noted in the study in terms of it's typically of HRT adherence.

449
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:28,470
So I think maybe the bigger risk is like new infections that aren't giving an opposite or Archie's Africa in their diagnosis.

450
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:33,059
Do you have symptoms of. Yeah, I was just going to point to I thought it was interesting.

451
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:40,530
I don't know. This is from the same article or maybe I had an article that there was like this transition

452
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:47,820
of infectious HIV specialists to other infectious disease specialties like COVID 19 pandemic.

453
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:51,000
Yeah, I think that's really interesting as well.

454
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:57,570
HIV has been something that I think a lot of people have been doing a lot of really great research and intervention work on.

455
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:00,210
And then COVID kind of became like been new.

456
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:08,370
Like obviously there was the first initial like emergency of like hospitals being overwhelmed and we did not have PPE or ventilators,

457
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:16,650
but then also kind of like people starting to shift their research away from maybe HIV or their like community advocacy and

458
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:24,630
then vaccine distribution or other things from organizations that maybe used to do HIV testing and treatment outreach.

459
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:34,620
Yeah. You wonder how we deal with that scarcity and like an immediate impact of of an epidemic over 19 of that transmission.

460
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:41,220
That's a really good point. A lot of work for public health professionals to do and maybe not a lot of the funding to do that work.

461
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:53,860
All right. And then I did mention this already, but basically we have moved from 90, 90, 92, 95, 95, 95.

462
00:55:53,860 --> 00:56:00,280
So the 1990, 90 seconds, decent bit of a hit during Copan rather than settling for that.

463
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,530
The U.N. has actually filed left increase our goal. Let's move faster.

464
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:09,760
Let's take more effective action to reach the 9595 targets by 2030.

465
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:16,150
So one of the big things that the U.S. is trying to push under is trying to push as.

466
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:26,769
Access to generic medications for HIV treatment. Further estimates we can cover everyone who needs generic access to LP for 2 billion a year,

467
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:32,470
which is really not that big of a cost compared to what the global budgets are for HIV relief right now.

468
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:44,850
And then one thing I just thought was really interesting and some research that I read to Botswana actually achieved 95, 95 Target and 2022.

469
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:50,070
They're the first country in Africa to reach those 95, 95, 95 target and the third country in the world.

470
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:57,110
Interesting that no, the actually had a long history of kind of being a leader on HIV treatment.

471
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:02,620
They were the first country in the world to offer free HIV treatment to all of their citizens in 2002.

472
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:07,780
But there are still some gaps, especially for young people and for young women in particular.

473
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:15,950
So what do you think can be done or should be done to reach those 95, 95 target?

474
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:20,960
Anything from your readings that stick out to you as prime places for intervention?

475
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:28,440
Yeah. I do think stigma around, like texting and like having the disease or access to medication.

476
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:35,580
Yeah, absolutely. I know in one of our previous readings,

477
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:46,410
we talked a bit about about how a majority of people and what people in low and middle income countries breastfeed instead of use formula.

478
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:50,130
And so I was just, I, I don't think the article talk too much about that.

479
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:58,230
So I was just wondering how the prevalence of AIDS would change if there weren't that there was more access to formula,

480
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:06,030
especially since the mortality rate for was really high when it came to the transmission between maternal to child.

481
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:10,440
And so maybe you like having more access to formula would reduce that.

482
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:14,430
Yeah. So yeah, that's that's interesting.

483
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:22,620
I mean, breastfeeding is a but I think the focus of global health organizations is more on access to HRT.

484
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:30,700
So like if the mother is adhering to HRT at. Not possible to transmit HIV to her child if she is.

485
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,730
Completely undetectable viral load. But that's interesting of like thinking about.

486
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:42,830
If they don't have access to those keys, what do we need to do about nutrition in the meantime?

487
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:49,180
And just to add on to that, that that's that's a good point to bring up.

488
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:57,040
There is a split on that if you should be giving mothers with HIV formula.

489
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:02,739
But the general consensus is there's so many benefits to breastfeeding, like the antibody protection,

490
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:09,040
like the, you know, the superior nutritional quality of breast milk most of the time,

491
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:15,999
and also just maternal child bond that as long as the mother's on the so every

492
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,299
effort should be made as much as possible to make sure the mother's on Abby's.

493
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:27,459
And that's the absolute best thing you can do. It's only if for some reason that's not possible, which, you know, doesn't even come down to supply.

494
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:32,140
Because when breast milk is available, armies of Bethany available, it's more of the mother has,

495
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:37,870
you know, very highly resistant HIV that you have to do that you'd consider breast milk.

496
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:41,590
So that says one thing to point out. Also consider.

497
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,490
When you're using formula, you don't have to think about how safe is the water and all the other factors in there.

498
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,690
And quite often that may be more dangerous than the HIV itself.

499
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:00,930
Do you know if the over-the-counter tests are heard or not?

500
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:07,770
If the home tests are over-the-counter, like in America or other high income nations,

501
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:16,340
I know you can purchase them over the counter in the US and you know, internationally their availability.

502
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:21,860
I have not seen them in the U.K. at least. Yeah.

503
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:26,440
Rachel, what are the other two countries that have reached the 95, 97, 95 goals?

504
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:29,830
You know, I wish I knew that off the top of my head for you.

505
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:34,720
I would like to know. I can look that up for you. I tried to Google and I couldn't find.

506
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:40,270
Yeah, I know this is too much of an issue anymore,

507
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:47,320
but I do remember like patents being being issued that much like lower middle income countries from being able to

508
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:59,350
like have like generic versions of NRT because like they could only be produced by specific companies in this way.

509
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,850
They had like a brand name. So like maybe, I don't know how much of it is really.

510
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:08,749
I know like. Some patterns like expire like a decent number of years,

511
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:15,350
but just making sure there's more like protections to make sure that like there's not like this like monopoly on,

512
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:21,590
like who can and can't make insurance. Do you have a comment on patterns for each other?

513
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:26,360
Okay, I'll, I'll go back there and then I think I might have skipped over it.

514
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:34,700
But one thing that I did find interesting, too, so there is more access to generic treatments for HIV now.

515
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,890
So the patents are perhaps less of a problem.

516
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:44,570
Or I did find interesting though, as we kind of expected to see a drop off in cost of HIV treatment once we shut in,

517
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:52,700
especially in low and middle income countries from kind of the name brand of the generic right, you would expect treatment to be less expensive.

518
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:57,830
While the thing that's happening is at the same time as we're getting generic versions of the medications,

519
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:03,170
we're also improving the quality of the HIV treatment that we have.

520
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:10,370
So they found that if they shifted to the generic, but they also shifted to the better quality generic,

521
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:13,560
that cost actually pretty much remained the same in terms of treatment.

522
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:20,780
So yes, they're using the generic, but the more expensive, better quality treatment kind of outweighs the cost savings of that generic.

523
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:29,629
One thing specifically in terms of prep, also prep is still I don't know for sure globally,

524
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:36,560
but I know for sure in the U.S. at LUTH it is still under patent from Gilliard, which makes Truvada.

525
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:45,499
And so until the FDA forced insurance companies to cover prep, prep was frequently very expensive,

526
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:49,940
like something around like $2,000 a month if your insurance didn't cover the cost.

527
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:59,670
Rachel Yeah. So I know like in certain areas in the US, like the exchange clinics are like really controversial.

528
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,520
Does that remain constant like throughout the world?

529
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:09,600
And like then areas where like injection drug use is the most common mode of transmission, like needle exchange programs, things.

530
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:17,010
Ryan do you know much about needle exchange programs in central eastern your.

531
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:24,880
Do they have kind of the same controversy that they might have in the US and in other places?

532
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:32,170
I can't speak too much about Central and Eastern Europe. They are pretty big in the UK now at least.

533
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:38,220
We are beyond that. I can't say in heels. And in sub-Saharan Africa I haven't seen them at all.

534
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:43,230
But that is because the main mode of HIV transmission here isn't so much HIV drug use.

535
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:50,820
No one else. All right.

536
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:55,650
So just just a couple of things from UNAIDS, though.

537
01:03:56,070 --> 01:04:01,590
In terms of reaching our 95 goals, one of the most important things is identification of cases,

538
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:10,890
reducing barriers like stigma and cloth, reaching hard to reach populations and reaching children.

539
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,270
And then linkage.

540
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:26,330
So offering treatment at the point of testing so that you can immediately get people on it has positive increasing access to health monitoring

541
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:34,220
stigma and fighting the stigma and discrimination in order to ensure that people that do test positive are able to adhere to their medications.

542
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:43,699
And then similarly on linkage, so to make maintenance increasing access to peer support, decreasing wait times,

543
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:50,450
making sure that countries with high prevalence of HIV have little to no access

544
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:56,090
with stop issues with HIV and then increasing better follow up with patients.

545
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:05,510
So I do want to move on to discussion. So if you have a GM board, you can pull that up from your computers.

546
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:12,050
If one person wouldn't mind jumping on zoom.

547
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:20,570
And it can pull my husband to a room with you like anyone, if anyone in the room can join this area.

548
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:28,280
You got it, Rachel. Thank you. So think about your country's progress to the 95, 95 target.

549
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:33,560
You might not have time to go over everything but support groups.

550
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:39,400
There's a link here. Are you going to search AIDS and U.N. AIDS?

551
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:46,730
You can look there to get some information. About your specific country.

552
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:50,790
So you. John.

553
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:54,800
And just in the interest of time, can I make a suggestion on this? Yeah, go ahead.

554
01:05:55,250 --> 01:06:00,350
Can we say that every group does Thailand and then they split up which box they're doing?

555
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:07,660
It's a wonderful idea. Thank you, Ryan. Yeah. So go ahead and split up into four groups.

556
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:14,650
We're all going to Thailand and. One, two, three or.

557
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:35,220
What's going on, in other words.

558
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:39,780
I think.

559
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:52,260
It's something. It was a apartment tonight.

560
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:58,740
We are going to be doing for. Really here.

561
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:08,490
There is a similar.

562
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:28,240
As whether or not having some of their customers.

563
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:44,080
Full coverage of the event regardless of whether or not it their intention.

564
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:58,580
Senator Cruz said. But sometimes he said, I'm going to.

565
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:07,880
Oh, yes. I have friends. That will be. Well, there's a 1%.

566
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:26,040
It's mean that's the one thing that has strengthened by the storm is that it wasn't all that much.

567
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:34,530
They want to send people. Those.

568
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:44,110
Incredible. Well, that's a number. That number, $100,000.

569
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:53,010
Oh, I see. Tabulation of.

570
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:13,510
In every industry. So I'm not ready to be serious.

571
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:31,770
What have you done for me lately? And then I we're sort of saying, oh, my goodness gracious.

572
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:37,860
Oh, my God. Thank you for letting me know.

573
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:43,770
I they're very important that I have say that.

574
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:49,520
So is. They?

575
01:09:52,340 --> 01:10:05,570
Medical devices are listed on studies for women and individuals.

576
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:17,930
It also said that while another document.

577
01:10:35,430 --> 01:11:11,910
So. Both the hospice and its events deserve to have their treatment.

578
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:29,220
We're in a. All the progress.

579
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:39,580
There's. If you're on.

580
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:47,190
The all. Let's do one more minute.

581
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:58,360
So that was the golden rule.

582
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,930
Does this work? The program.

583
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:12,570
I have 7 minutes of.

584
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:22,850
There will be responsibility for.

585
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:44,310
But those are the places. You don't have to about money.

586
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:58,050
All right, everyone, I'm going to bring it back in just for a couple minutes of discussion before we wrap up for the day.

587
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:04,950
I must've messed up on my phone enough. So we had a couple people doing the second one, but that's okay.

588
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,990
So group one progress towards the 95, 95, 95 targets.

589
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:17,500
Can you tell us a little bit about what you found? Okay.

590
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:27,360
Well, we found that 95% of people living with HIV, AIDS, violence with their families, which is a pretty high rate.

591
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:35,870
And then on top of that, 91% of those 94% of people that know their status are on therapy.

592
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:43,920
And then we also found that 75% of people living with HIV have access to high pressure.

593
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:51,760
Yeah. So that the barriers a little bit having access to treatment is going to be one of those barriers.

594
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:58,870
Yeah. And then our two groups doing number two and have a couple of people report out if you are.

595
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:08,959
I first saw that there was a program 100% kind of program that was successful in heterosexual transmission in the nineties.

596
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:17,540
But then more recent programs were like, men have sex with men, other forms of transmission.

597
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:23,500
And so we were just looking at one that was the reach of recruit, test, train,

598
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:29,840
retaining programs and aiming at a cascading effect at every step to try to.

599
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:38,899
Improved numbers. And we also found like a couple of other programs on that.

600
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:49,040
I found this program, which was since 2014, has been offering people who are in high risk populations.

601
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:58,130
And then in 2019, they introduced under the Universal Health Care Benefits Package as an attempt to scale up nationwide.

602
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:07,639
They also had like smaller programs like everybody access treatment for free and antiretroviral antiretroviral therapy for everybody,

603
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:14,570
regardless of their individual levels. Anything else from interventions.

604
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:29,550
We can see something about how there used to be a law that said that hospitals had to include the names of HIV positive patients on a registry.

605
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,700
But that isn't anymore. Christian.

606
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:41,099
All right. Thank you. Ryan, did you have a brief comment on barriers?

607
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:45,030
So 95, 95 target? Yep. Just have a quick look.

608
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:49,470
It looks like stigma is the biggest barrier in Thailand when it comes to HIV.

609
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:59,370
You know, this is as deep as in the healthcare setting where, you know, there's found that nurses predominately have really stigmatizing beliefs.

610
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:07,350
When it came to HIV in Thailand, a big a big cause, HIV was I.V. drug use as well.

611
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:12,899
And and there's pretty strict drug laws in Thailand to the point that in 2004,

612
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:19,740
the state government said people who got HIV from maybe drug use could actually not get the AIDS.

613
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:30,330
I.V. drug users didn't want to get tested for HIV and still don't because they feared legal issues the same when it comes to migrants.

614
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:40,020
There are also a lot of stigma and discrimination in healthcare services when it comes to many of sex men,

615
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:44,220
transgender populations and also people who have mental health issues.

616
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:56,070
And finally, Thailand has a pretty big tuberculosis problem, which, you know, when you have a infection with HIV causes pretty severe disease.

617
01:16:56,370 --> 01:17:04,860
But there's also a pretty big stigma against tuberculosis, which further causes issues with seeking heat over care.

618
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:11,360
Thank you. And our last group.

619
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,079
Where do we go from here? So it was a little difficult.

620
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:21,049
One thing, like all the prior research that the two groups had done, but we tried to come across the same statistics.

621
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:28,340
I don't think we did, but we did suggest that we should increase access to prep because we came across

622
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:32,780
this statistic like only a small fraction of the population was accessing prep,

623
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:41,929
which may or may not be accurate. But then we also along the lines of like reducing stigma and also just general awareness about how HIV is spread.

624
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:48,709
We're recommending that we integrate HIV education and sex education and high school in higher

625
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:57,320
education because about less than 50% of young men and women have knowledge about HIV prevention.

626
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:02,230
And that's as far as we have the perfect. All right.

627
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:08,740
Great job. Thank you for the discussion, everyone. Ryan, did you have anything to add before we wrap up today?

628
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:12,849
No, nothing on this. Just firstly to apologize.

629
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:15,909
I'm in Nairobi of Mombasa right now in Kenya.

630
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:20,860
So I'll be joining over Zoom for the next couple of weeks. So thanks for being with me on that.

631
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:26,800
And just to let everybody know, the session on Thursday will be in-person.

632
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:32,919
It was originally by Zoom, but it will be in-person. As always, if you need to join by Zoom, that's fine.

633
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:38,980
And that will be Dr. Cheryl Moyer from the medical school coming in to talk about reproductive health.

634
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:43,750
And then no class next week on Tuesday, because you have your study break.

635
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:51,720
Wonderful winter. I am sure it has to do it in here.

636
01:18:52,230 --> 01:19:01,200
There where I was probably of zero or seven.

637
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:05,120
And I hate that.

638
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:05,870
I don't like.
