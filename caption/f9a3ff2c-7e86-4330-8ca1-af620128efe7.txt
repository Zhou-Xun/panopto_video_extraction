1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,400
Ten days. Have you tried unity vibration yet?

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,379
Okay. Welcome back, everybody.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:17,500
For those of your ear, it seems like the classes dwindle down substantially today, but this will be on the exam, so hopefully I got the recording.

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,020
So I have a couple of sort of general.

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,450
Comment. Sorry, there was a point in the day today to have all the slides,

6
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,189
but she felt all this work and so she is going to all of looks like she's going to

7
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,420
record it and then we'll all send out a theater post once we have the recording up.

8
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:46,620
So again, appropriate feedback will be back on the cards.

9
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:57,130
Of course, this is onward. And then if you want to do the peer review, that will also be available on Monday.

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:05,109
The second thing is the due date for the exam review is for the second mid-term review is marked as today we got it wrong.

11
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:12,339
It should be next Monday. So I'm sorry if you rush to do it as you did last night, but yeah, it should be due Monday.

12
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,630
So we we've already updated that now. So there's nothing today to do.

13
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:30,370
So we have today post-inauguration, we have Wednesday is going to know a breakdown and then the following Tuesday is the final report will 6 p.m.

14
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,940
I apologize. I didn't get that way. I'll try to stay away, but you guys should try harder to do it.

15
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:41,560
It's still in the throat, right? It'll still be in. Yeah. So be here for the next hour.

16
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,480
I think that on the exam will be similar to the first two attempts.

17
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,570
There is obviously no review, not obviously there is no review session planned because our last lecture is on Wednesday.

18
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:07,280
So yeah, I don't believe is your question given that that's good given the time is at 70%.

19
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:15,820
So basically the same as the first time. Yeah, it will be the same 25 ish, multiple choice in two moments you'll have the whole 2 hours.

20
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:26,650
If it's not judgment like it would be modified, you can just enjoy that or you can leave early and not stay over till 6 p.m. on Tuesday.

21
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,770
So that's okay.

22
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,110
All right. So I think that you all have the logistical stuff.

23
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:39,130
So so today we're going to talk about protein and amino acid capitalism leading into the area cycle.

24
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,290
So this is actually my favorite lecture of the entire year, even though it's second last.

25
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,709
And the reason for that is there are 20 different amino acids we have to capitalize off.

26
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,790
One of you have to regulate the catabolism a 20.

27
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,030
So we get to go through 20 of all catabolic pathways in one lecture and remember how far we've come from

28
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,670
one just we talked like two weeks ago to psychosis and now we're going to do 20 of them in one day.

29
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
And trust me, by the end of this lecture,

30
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:07,150
I don't think you can understand how all 20 of them are actually regulated in a nice, synchronized, regulated manner.

31
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:13,480
So get to that quickly. So I'm going to start today with one protein breakdown.

32
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,910
So there's really two mechanism by which there is proteins to be broken down.

33
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,990
So remember, when you break down glycogen or you break down triglycerides,

34
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:28,629
there is still regulation that there is activation of like a these activation of, I think the cycle policies.

35
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,340
But that activation was relatively less stringent and relatively straightforward.

36
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:40,749
You did break down some glycogen molecules, but not others. If it was in the levee, broke it down, if not in protein breakdown.

37
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,200
They have to be quite careful about breaking down a protein. Right.

38
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:50,290
Because as I talked about, last class making a protein is so energetically and essentially amino acid can cause it.

39
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,860
Right. So you don't want to just break down a protein because it's going to cost a lot to make.

40
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,810
So there's really two different processes that can be used for breaking down proteins.

41
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:06,550
So the first one called pro dialysis is mediated by organelle type thing called the proteasome.

42
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:15,730
Now the key thing about protein, all of this is that it's directed, which means that if you decide that you want to break down a particular protein,

43
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:21,800
you can target it for breakdown by adding these small molecules called ubiquitin, which are shown right here in blood.

44
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,400
So this is the ubiquitin system.

45
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:31,510
It recognizes some protein through the E3, which is the sort of pattern recognition system targets a particular protein for breakdown.

46
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,070
And that goes to the protein zone where it can be broken down into oligo factors and eventually amino acid.

47
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:43,240
So in this way you can selectively say, I don't want to break down all the proteins and in the cell, I just want to break down this one protein.

48
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,740
So maybe, for example, you've decided that you are using your glycogen synthesis machinery very often because you're not getting enough glycogen,

49
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,160
so you target glycogen synthase for breakdown by liquidating it, right?

50
00:04:54,340 --> 00:05:00,900
So you can target a specific protein in a really, really specific target there.

51
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:06,130
And we talked about this before already. So we talked about the atropine,

52
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:13,030
which are activated by Foxo Way back when we talked about cortisol signaling one of the outer genes is called Murph one.

53
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,570
There's another one called Adaptogen one. These are E3 ubiquitin like daisies.

54
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,530
So when we say that cortisol through FOXO activates protein closeness and in this

55
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:25,270
case it's muscle and specifically targeting the SARCOMERE proteins like actin.

56
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:33,550
I think it does it by Foxtel activating four three, which is the idea is that Ligeti's goes out and finds active bias and breaks it down.

57
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:39,519
Right. So that's how you can selectively liberate the act into myosin without having to break down the entire muscle.

58
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,440
Something like this. It's very, very targeted and it is regulated by a bunch of different processes.

59
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,810
This is this process here is specific to actor genes. It's not for all protocols, it's just for particular type of classes.

60
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,510
But there's lots of other signals it can regulate, lots of other E3 in different lines.

61
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,230
So that's very specific, not super high throughput.

62
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:06,880
The mechanism is called autophagy. And so largely this is regulated by the inactivation of chemical.

63
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,410
So enter is activated when nutrients are high, amino acids are high energy fired into one type.

64
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,330
But when those things become low sugar amino acid start for energy start, you're going to inactivate hematocrit.

65
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,730
And so what that does, you can think of it, this is sort of a targeted, selective.

66
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:27,490
I'm going to throw away this sock with quality. This is I'm going to take the whole closet and just throw it in garbage bag and throw it out.

67
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:33,339
Right. So this is very nonspecific. So basically what's happening is you're engulfing whole chunks of cells, right?

68
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:41,620
So maybe you're engulfing entire mitochondria or entire entire clumps of proteins and then you're breaking them all down in this organelle here.

69
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:48,760
That's called a lysosome or chemically of obviously otherwise autophagy just means self-cleaning.

70
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:53,290
So that's basically what it does. So if you starve long enough, a cell will start eating itself, right?

71
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:58,719
It'll start eating up its mitochondria and start eating up its various organs.

72
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,620
And so all various sorts of other organs. So this is not that specific.

73
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,870
It's a little bit specific. There's been a lot of study of why when autophagy happens, some things are broken down, but not others.

74
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,450
But it's much, much, much less specific than proteins, but it's also very high throughput, right?

75
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,750
So you get a lot of amino acids available because you're breaking down things more or less nonselective.

76
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:22,410
So that's a difference between between these two. So when did this happen?

77
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,840
So I've already kind of mentioned a lot of these already.

78
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:31,890
So when you promote protein breakdown, it's always going to be antagonistic to the signals that promote protein synthesis.

79
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:38,310
So insulin, glucocorticoids, IGF one, they probably all at least in the case of muscle, which is a protein reserve,

80
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:48,000
they all mostly work through the through the dialysis, whereas insulin and tau work largely through through the artifact.

81
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,560
The these are the hormonal signals. So high testosterone would block protein degradation.

82
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,270
And then these are the nutritional signals.

83
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,870
These are the same signals that we talked about last pass that would activate import and promotes protein synthesis.

84
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:08,460
So you would start breaking things down, specifically looking at the levels of these amino acids, low energy and low insulin levels.

85
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:15,420
Could you just repeat which of these two prefers the pretty all of this versus other?

86
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:22,860
Yeah. So IGF one and glucocorticoids work almost exclusively through pretty alters as insulin through here.

87
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,960
But insulin also regulates and torc1. Right.

88
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:37,920
So insulin kind of affects both processes. But I would add to our one with auto P and again, we want to be very,

89
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,149
very controlled about this because we don't want this to happen in excess because like I said,

90
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,990
it would be very energetically costly because get a temporary need for amino acids.

91
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,880
You broke down much protein. We make those frequently. All right.

92
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,570
So another way that proteins are broken down, some of this is atrophy.

93
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,099
And this is kind of the converse of what I was talking about last class in that we know

94
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,630
that there is a signal that promotes protein synthesis that is associated with resistance.

95
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,400
So we know that resistance or enforced load is going to promote protein synthesis.

96
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:15,810
By the same token, the absence of of a resistance in this case, the absence of use is going to cause proto ulcers.

97
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,909
Now, what this is showing here is somebody who had a broken leg and they were in a cast for a very long time.

98
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:25,210
So they didn't use that muscle for a very long time. And you could see the amount of atrophy that occurred there.

99
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,600
And this happened relatively quickly with with this like even within a week of this use,

100
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:35,129
you start to get some blah, blah, blah, like for those who were planning to become astronauts.

101
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,850
And so a couple asked whether it's best practice or not enforced against the law.

102
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,490
And just like protein synthesis,

103
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:49,770
we don't really know the exact signal by which the load or the lack of load is transduced into the protein synthesis or the prevention of protein.

104
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:56,400
But there's a couple of things that I think this picture really highlights. It's very unlikely to be an endocrinology nutritional signal.

105
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,710
This is for the same reason I talked about last time.

106
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:04,380
It was an endurance signal, like I just a decrease of testosterone or nutritional signal, like an absence of protein.

107
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:09,630
It would affect both legs equally, right? Because you can't get the cells from one leg, not the other.

108
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,550
So it's probably a localized signal and it probably has something to do with sensing of load within the muscle,

109
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,230
maybe even within the within the muscle cell itself.

110
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,230
You don't really know what it is, but we do know that atrophy can be can be used to.

111
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,030
BLOCK There's another kind of atrophy that you might think about, which is induction by disease.

112
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:36,570
So the is used would be things like lose or they can activate atrophy through FOXO.

113
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,600
Now one of the confusing things is that we know disuse atrophy.

114
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,080
So we took a biopsy of this leg versus looks like some of the same genes that are induced by foxo in glucocorticoids the nerve.

115
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,190
One of the aspects they are induced to cause this atrophy.

116
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:59,730
Right. But it's not because it took apart so some other signaling pathway that is causing the target protein, all of this muscle because of signal.

117
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,290
So it's not caused by glucocorticoids, but it's caused by the same, we think the same targets of equal problems.

118
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:16,319
So it's interesting, I did some work with TI and they've been doing like blood pressure cupping to kind of reverse that with like ACL tear

119
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:24,440
and you are blessed and so that you're increasing the load without doing like the true impact of the muscle around.

120
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,540
Just kind of interesting like working through all of these mechanisms.

121
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:34,590
Yeah. So that's, that's a good example. So you can do that with reduced or sometimes quite a handful use it to us selecting pulse stimulation.

122
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:41,549
So basically to stimulate the muscles, the muscle keeps contracting even in the context of, of, of a breakthrough within a castrate.

123
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,459
And that can reduce because this can cause real problems. And, you know,

124
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:49,650
atrophy in the elderly is a major reason why there's a high risk of falls and a high

125
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:54,240
risk of of muscle breaks or sort bone breaks as not just because of the disuse,

126
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,450
because of the age related. And this can be alleviated somewhat by high protein, but not in really any form of protein.

127
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:07,440
And and, of course, as an astronaut like symbol of resistance training, because I've heard like as you get older,

128
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,240
obviously you can't do higher impact, but it's going to take more of a tear on your butt.

129
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,200
This is like senior adults and like at what point is resistance?

130
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,670
How often do you have to do resistance training to see similar benefits?

131
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:25,700
Yeah. Well, so I don't exactly know, like, dose wise. So don't be easy on you got a better sense of dose.

132
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:34,610
But you know, as a general rule I think so are the I guideline for many many years is just recommended amount of hours or minutes of exercise.

133
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:37,879
And it was only a few years ago they actually said they broke it down and said, no,

134
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,980
no, you need that resistance training along with aerobics exercise for that reason.

135
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:48,889
So there is a lot of evidence that the elderly people who are older that can do resistance training,

136
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,940
even if it's just bodyweight things or very limited, it has a benefits kind of throughout the life.

137
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,910
No, I don't really tend to like the dose of the requirement,

138
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:03,830
but it's probably roughly similar to to sort of younger people like 2 to 3 days a week, but with less intensity.

139
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:11,360
So there's more time to recover. I don't know if the cardiology people are more specific that earlier you started the better.

140
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,370
So like if you're starting at like eight years old,

141
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:20,329
it's kind of lost impact if you can start it at least by the time you're 35, 45, it's something different.

142
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:26,030
Yeah. Yeah. And this is really similar to we'll talk about this with from in Nutrition 631 but it's a really similar thing, right?

143
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,189
So making protein is so much more difficult.

144
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:34,280
So you want to sort of take advantage of the high levels of growth hormone and even male testosterone that occurs in younger age,

145
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:42,140
but then decline over time. It makes it so much harder to to both build and prevent breakdown as you get older because a lot of signals disappear.

146
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:51,320
It's also one of the reasons why the protein requirements are slightly higher protein degradation.

147
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,970
So for that, that's super straightforward. But there's really just two, two systems here that work.

148
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,260
So I'm going to move on now to amino acid degradation.

149
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,770
So one more question.

150
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:10,400
The toxicity comes out during the during the digestion lecture is what happens if you have an excess number of utilizes, even if it's temporary?

151
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,830
What is this pool and where does it exist now? The reason it will does it you know, it's kind of vague about this.

152
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,410
When I started talking about this, nothing is a little more specific.

153
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,239
This amino acid pool, the free amino acid pool is really the essential amino acids.

154
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,050
And then glutamate and glutamate. If you remember back to last class I showed you the vast majority,

155
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,350
three amino acids are glutamate and we know those can be used to be interchanged into the other amino acid, which is great.

156
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:41,210
But what that means is excess amino acid, especially excess dispensable amino acid can be in timelines pretty quickly,

157
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:47,149
so they can go into the amino group immediately. And you are simple that way you can store the nitrogen glutamate glutamine.

158
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,400
So when you need the non essential amino acid, you can make them.

159
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:55,250
And then generally when you have an excess of amino acids, those carbons going to get used for free glucose or energy.

160
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:01,530
Right? And a lot of this is regulated purely on equilibrium, but it's a factor.

161
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,760
Okay. So there's really two different types of amino acid metabolism processes here.

162
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,750
And so if I think first about that, they are just the amino acid, right?

163
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:17,989
So if you follow what happens to the nitrogen group on utilize it, it almost always follows this pathway here.

164
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:23,030
It starts on an amino acid, it gets transferred to a glutamate, usually by a trans Japanese reaction.

165
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,800
Then it kind of hangs out of the glutamate.

166
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,050
It might go to become glutamine back and forth, but then when that glutamate gets broken down, that becomes ammonia.

167
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:36,230
And eventually the ammonia is going to get converted by the urea cycle into the sort of more safe product urea.

168
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:41,360
Right. So that's what happens for the amino acid glutamate, glutamate, ammonia, ammonia to urea.

169
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:49,340
On the other hand, for the carbon skeleton, the key is really very well read because every single amino acid has an amino group sometimes too,

170
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,250
but every amino acid has a completely different carbon skeleton.

171
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:58,250
Now, some of these carbon skeletons, as we talked about, are just the metabolites we're familiar with.

172
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:04,700
So for example, the alanine carbon skeleton is just pyruvate and the acetate carbon skeleton is just acetate.

173
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,910
So they feed it directly where some of them have multiple step reactions.

174
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,029
So there's really two things we have to monitor what's going to go on to the amino

175
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:17,210
group and then what's going to go on with the rest of the of the ability to last years.

176
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,440
And it turns out there's really two points of regulation that matter here.

177
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,970
So the first step of regulation generally is not this transmitting step, right?

178
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,990
Those are generally not regulated because those are just equilibrium reactions.

179
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,940
If you need more amino acids, you're going to be in fact, this way, if you have too many amino acids, you'll go back to work.

180
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,930
But there is a key point of regulation which will spend a good amount of time on the glutamate dehydrogenase step.

181
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,950
So I glutamate dehydrogenase.

182
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,900
That's when you make the decision that you're going to start breaking down the glutamate glutamate and turning it into ammonia.

183
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,200
So this step as we talk about last class is not reversible.

184
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,240
Right? So as soon as you had made the decision to get rid of glutamate, that amino group is effectively going to be gone.

185
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:03,169
Pretty much correct. So that's one next step. And then the last step here is you're going to regulate the level of your areas and how quickly you want

186
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:08,120
to take this ammonia and convert it to urea because some ammonia could be recovered back into glutamate.

187
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,130
It could be reported back. So there's a second regulatory step here.

188
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,610
So for the vast majority of amino acids, there's only two steps of regulation.

189
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:23,790
One decision is, do I get rid of the glutamate? And then that's going to decide what happens to this amino acid, which we'll talk later.

190
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:28,220
And then the second step is, do I finally get rid of the ammonia into the area cycle?

191
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:35,130
Now, there's one exception that we know of right now, and that is regulation of the branch chain amino acids.

192
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:41,549
So branch amino acids have a special set of restraints that kind of prevent this very, very, very first step here.

193
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:46,380
And we'll talk about that in terms of branch can curiosity hydrogenase in a couple of slides.

194
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,010
So why glutamate? So I'm focusing a lot on glutamate here.

195
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,450
Last time I talked about how glutamate is sort of the precursor for all the dispensable amino acids.

196
00:17:54,750 --> 00:18:01,830
Well, actually, turns out if you look at the catabolic pathways of all the amino acids, almost all of them somehow go through glutamate.

197
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,140
So, for example, a bunch of these transmitters is how one side of the glutamate on the other side.

198
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:13,020
So much of the work directly friends that made it such as allergy advocate and some of them are indirectly

199
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:18,059
because apparently it becomes aspartate which then helps through attractiveness that that arginine,

200
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,500
histidine, glutamine, proline.

201
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:25,649
They all become glutamate through sort of different processes of not tread down these reactions, but through similar kinds of reactions.

202
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:30,600
And then lysine also becomes glutamate through a particular lysine, dehydrogenase reaction.

203
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,459
So what that means is out of the 24 hours,

204
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:38,970
it's all but three go through some sort of transmitter's reaction is there's some sort of glutamate involved.

205
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,080
And so glutamate is critical for 17 of the 20 amino acids.

206
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,329
Now, of course, there's exceptions such as three need, which becomes glycine and then glycine,

207
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:54,900
which is basically just carbon dioxide attached to gonna just get split through something called the glycine cleavage system.

208
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,489
Syrian also gets a catabolism glycine through this glycine cleavage system.

209
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,750
So that's kind of the exception. But the majority of these make their way through, right?

210
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,069
So glutamate super important for amino acid synthesis.

211
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:14,880
And as we'll talk about, glutamate is also really, really important for the regulation of all 2017 of these 20 amino acids here.

212
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,960
Okay. So like I said, first step, transitions, reaction.

213
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,810
Sometimes there is restriction before the trans devotees reactions such as Frenchie, amino acid,

214
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:30,600
potentially methane, potentially lysine, although we don't really have too much detail on how these actually work.

215
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:37,860
And then the last step is to get through to ammonia, back to the trans eminences is actually on this slide three times already.

216
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:44,580
So you can see this is the catabolic pathway now for alanine going from this direction to that direction.

217
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:51,660
So there's trans entities reaction, ammonium ammonia moves on glutamate pyruvate is your carbon skull.

218
00:19:52,260 --> 00:20:00,980
And so that's and that's also true for for aspartame and also getting ready to chain amino acids here.

219
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:06,030
So these are these three amino acids. And remember, they're particularly important because these are very,

220
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:10,350
very abundant in proteins, but very, very rare in their report, in their free form,

221
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,790
which means that we want to be very, very cautious about breaking down these particular amino acids,

222
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:22,110
because once we get down, all three of them are essential. We run the risk of now needing more leucine to make to make some protein.

223
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:29,370
So the first reaction is a trend, Japanese reaction, right? And so there's an enzyme called branched chain amino transferase right here.

224
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,540
And it's one enzyme,

225
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:37,829
but it takes each of these three different precursor amino acids and turns it into a slightly different version of an alpha ketone.

226
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,040
Hasn't Caprock control a black acid or metal or gas?

227
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,760
Right. And so those are the carbon skeletons for that very, very, very first step.

228
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,870
Now, if I look up here, this is that very, very first step blew up here.

229
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:53,579
So the next step, which is the important step, is this step here, which is regulated,

230
00:20:53,580 --> 00:21:00,090
which is controlled by an enzyme called branching cue acid dehydrogenase, which we'll talk about the project 50 minutes or so.

231
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,580
This step here is the regulated state.

232
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:07,830
So remember up here, you can go back and forth between these two reactions because they're transmitted reactions.

233
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:14,100
If you have a build up of these things, they can become go back to becoming daily baling.

234
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:19,620
They can come back and become tubular. But once you get past this step here that's now irreversible,

235
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:24,710
now you're completely fated to eventually break down these branching amino acids into the various products.

236
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,260
It's still quite elastic and still correct.

237
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:36,420
So controlling the breakdown of these three, this it's a step after the transmittance reduction, which is right here, that is the most important.

238
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:41,910
And so that enzyme is, like I said, branch chain, you know, acid dehydrogenase.

239
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:49,860
And again, it's one enzyme and it catalyzes all three of a simple Eric Isaac approach and metabolic acids,

240
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,060
which are the Quito acids for for the rich amino acid.

241
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:58,290
So this enzyme here is subject to quite a lot of regulation that we know of.

242
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:06,329
So the analogy here is that this is quite similar to Pyruvate Dehydrogenase now hopefully not entirely clear pyruvate,

243
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:10,110
yeah, from the history of memory. But that's the thing that decides whether pyruvate is going to.

244
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:20,670
Organized and backed. The regulation of 88 is so analogous to pirate radio dredging is that the same phosphatase deposit correlates will be created.

245
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:27,960
And and pirate radio dredging is the difference is the inhibitor step.

246
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:34,020
So there's a kinase that inhibited just like PDK one through PDK four inhibits PD h there's an

247
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:39,620
enzyme here which I'm just going to pop music for now that phosphorylated inhibits this escape.

248
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:44,610
And so there's been a lot of studies lately to understand, well, what regulates BCC.

249
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:49,380
So it's branching. Otherwise the dehydrogenase kinds is what all that stands for.

250
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:55,950
And we've learned a little bit about that. We know that this is activated by insulin and that preserves these amino acids,

251
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,670
but we still don't know exactly the signaling pathway by which insulin gets there.

252
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,090
There's some pretty good evidence that BK gets regulated through Enter.

253
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,820
But again, it's not it's not entirely clear.

254
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:11,990
It might be different between between different things, but that's the key regulatory step and this is only true for you.

255
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:21,870
But it's possible that this is going to be true for lysine, dehydrogenase and for the the breakdown product with Diamond's dehydrogenase as well.

256
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,050
But we haven't quite learned what that's going to look like.

257
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,870
All right. So that's the regulation here.

258
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:33,239
So again, there's one step of restraint here, and that's really the only point at which there is an equivalent.

259
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:39,930
So even if you have a buildup of these things here, you're not going to start breaking them down unless BCD is in sort of an active form.

260
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,240
And that's what you mean. Are these more stable than the other?

261
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:54,690
Okay, so the CKD age is important not only for regulation, but it's actually a mildly common metabolic disease.

262
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,730
My favorite name, metabolic disease of the ball, which is maple sirup, urine disease.

263
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,740
It has nothing to do with overconsumption of maple sirup like hockey.

264
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:09,160
Okay, but it is an inherited disorder of metabolism of PKU.

265
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,780
So basically KBH, as I said, breaks down fresh amino acids.

266
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,470
And so when you have a deficiency that you have a buildup of the French gene amino acids,

267
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,920
you also have the buildup of these branched chain ketone acids.

268
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,700
They get the very, very high levels and those can cause neurological damage.

269
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,520
So if we look at a little more closely, this is what the structure of basically the edge looks like.

270
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,970
It's got four different subunits.

271
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:41,940
You want to know would be that in two and three, which is enzyme 23 and so you could have mutations in any of these that could cause disease.

272
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:50,849
And indeed, there are different types of chemical types of maple sirup during disease that are associated with different mutations in these diseases.

273
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:57,030
So the first three of these are reasonably straightforward, their loss of function variance in either one or two,

274
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:02,850
and they are more or less severe depending on how much of a loss of function it is.

275
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:09,480
This last mutation here, which is a thymine, responsive CBT mutation, what that is, is thymine,

276
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:18,600
which again if you take mutations 31 we'll talk about is a cool factor in the story in the E2, which is the DDT part of the enzyme.

277
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,490
So it's a mutation such that thymine binds really, really early to it.

278
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:33,030
So in this particular subset of people, so if you're into the people with a very high volume, fine, you can overcome the bad thymine binding pocket.

279
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,930
Let's find this mutation and you can treat that one mostly by timing.

280
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:41,310
But for all of the other ones, you treat them very similar to how you might treat PKU.

281
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:47,610
You want to have very low levels of branched amino acids, all three isolate using leucine in daily but not zero.

282
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:53,190
Right? Just like I said, for PKU, it cannot be done because these so are essential amino acids.

283
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:58,589
Okay, so the problems of this not super common, but one in 185,000 people.

284
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,669
Again, if you work in a clinical dietetics career,

285
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:07,559
you're probably going to come across some of them and tend to be quite present in old order Mennonite population.

286
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,970
So if you're in, say, western Pennsylvania, you might see a higher prevalence of this.

287
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,680
The females are roughly affected equally. You can have mutations in any of those three genes.

288
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:24,240
Those are the three different Alpha one up to Alpha three. And because of that, you have effectively no KBH activity.

289
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:29,190
Now, hopefully, as you can appreciate why this is bad, because you have a buildup of these ketones ketosis,

290
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,299
a branch amino acids, and you've no way to get rid of them, right? So your body may want to break them down.

291
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:38,520
You could build up with these byproducts in the same way that we would build up those byproducts can build up.

292
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:45,179
They can turn into other pulp, other products, and they tend to accumulate mostly in the brain for the severe cases.

293
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:50,850
Usually you get potential death, usually within weeks or months for the less severe cases it presents a little bit later.

294
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,160
These are some of the symptoms you can get.

295
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:59,640
So failure to thrive due to sort of impact of protein metabolism, poor feeding, vomiting, sweating, delayed development.

296
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:03,690
And the reason it's called that is because the urine has a maple sirup smell.

297
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:09,130
And that's one of the breakdown products has a maple sirup said this is typically diagnosed and.

298
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:14,300
It's almost always in America. Diagnosed in blood clot testing, right?

299
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:19,100
Right. What does it mean by failure to fly? Inability to run.

300
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:24,220
So like a baby who's, you know, you need to start the.

301
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:30,829
So the treatment, if it's diagnosed early, is fairly effective.

302
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:35,580
So generally lifelong treatment, just like PKU, to keep those amino acid levels very, very low.

303
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:44,060
So just like you would, you would constantly, not only in this case, you monitor it wasn't it typically tends to be loose.

304
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:49,720
You want to have a protein restrictive diet because you don't want to have any excess of protein eventually.

305
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,870
Meanwhile, you need enough to help support growth, but just enough to support growth.

306
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,989
Right. So you want to have just enough to be sufficient, but no more than that.

307
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,230
So what's a lot of fruit, vegetables, potatoes, fats, things like that.

308
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,400
They're usually synthetic formulas to provide the essential nutrients so you can get

309
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:09,170
medical food that provides reduced Leucine Balian or ISO leucine or that's nuts.

310
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,590
And then these two points here are pretty important generally.

311
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,830
Physical activity is important, and again, especially resistance training.

312
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:20,260
And that is because you want those free amino acids to be pushed into proteins, right?

313
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,120
You don't want them to be broken down any excessive, you know,

314
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,419
acids you want to have you got to want to ensure there's sufficient fuel necessary because

315
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,870
if you have too much physical activity such that you start to become energy depleted,

316
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:37,220
you'll start to break down those proteins and now you have those free amino acids that you can't catabolism.

317
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,380
So fasting is very, very challenging.

318
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:47,840
Generally, children run, as are advised, to even eat up to sugary shape before bed to make sure that they are never in this sort of caloric deficit.

319
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,069
And so you have to be careful monitoring of of calories and you have to avoid things

320
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:58,310
like high stress and illnesses that could cause cause of excess protein metabolism.

321
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:06,110
So if that happens, when levels become so controlled, you the main goal here is to find ways to reverse protein catabolism.

322
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,650
So that's why I'm start using this as our switch from proteins to amino acids.

323
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,169
You want to do as much as you can to reduce protein catabolism.

324
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:16,100
You could probably come up with a bunch of these now on your own, but you want to have a lot of extra calories.

325
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:22,069
So generally high glucose intake, sometimes there's an infusion of glucose and insulin, sometimes there's intravenous fat.

326
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:25,820
So you want to provide energy so that protein catabolism is not due to energy.

327
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:30,870
You want to provide all the other amino acids to make sure the protein synthesis can occur, and if necessary,

328
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:37,220
you need to undergo without to filtration to get rid of those excess red amino acids or alpha chain ketosis.

329
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,200
So generally, this is sort of a lifelong and lifelong disease.

330
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:49,820
It can be treated nutritionally, but there is some advantages, for example, of a liver is showing a child who had a very early liver transplant.

331
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:56,120
This is the brain improving over time. And the reason that a liver transplant is effective is that you'll need to restore

332
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:01,939
about 10% of bacteria activity in your entire body to support metabolism.

333
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:06,380
Correct. Most French amino acid breakdown actually occurs in the liver.

334
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:14,380
And so by having a liver transplant, you're providing just enough liver activity that now those levels aren't going to rise.

335
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,760
Right. So these are these children who are diagnosed with this.

336
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,889
Now, again, I can't be forever, but at least the Michigan medicine very early go on the liver transplant list,

337
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:29,120
because this once you have this liver transplant, then all of the other things that you had to do to sort of maintain and correct the disease go away.

338
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,910
You don't have to worry about that silly question.

339
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:37,730
But would they ever have to worry about getting back on the liver transplant list for a certain point like this, their body?

340
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:45,260
As long as that as long as the transplanted liver stays and there's not there's not disease.

341
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,400
Disease with that, then it should be. I guess that should cure it forever.

342
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,780
Of course. Now, as you can imagine, because we're getting much better at gene therapy,

343
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,520
the other option is to use something like an adenovirus to deliver b c cartridge directly to the liver.

344
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,200
And so there's a lot of clinical trials right now.

345
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,309
They're going on to do this not just for cartilage, but for many in whenever something happens, right?

346
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:08,330
Because if you can just give back the functional enzymes that stay in the liver again

347
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:12,950
and you don't have to worry about all the complex lifestyle management of this disease.

348
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:18,170
Okay, so that's maple sirup, urine disease and why it's called that.

349
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:21,470
So I'm going to take a break for a few minutes and I'm going to have you guys.

350
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:25,530
Oh, shoot, I forgot to bring my random cue card things.

351
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:32,000
So what this activity is going to be and the activity or key is on the first line here is in groups.

352
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:41,660
What I want you to do is pick up one of these enzymes here and I believe that try to pick one that maybe nobody else has picked.

353
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,720
And what I want you to do is look into what that deficiency is, kind of what enzyme is affected,

354
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:53,180
which chemical reaction gives it all involved, amino acids is affected,

355
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:57,770
which metabolite you might want to do the thing that you monitor and then do some

356
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:01,879
Googling about relative incidence and is there newborn screening in Michigan?

357
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:08,330
And this here is up. It's a bit like it to the Michigan newborn screening solution.

358
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,970
All right. So for example, these.

359
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:15,780
Like I said, it's one of the three forms of suppose if you want to wander all through eventually, you know, as it was there.

360
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:20,620
You know, I said Kuwait analogs, you know, satellites are going to be lost.

361
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:25,200
The incident this is right here and it is tested in Michigan or Maryland Street.

362
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:32,190
I think like a lot of it's all filled out and you just quickly get some.

363
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:42,620
That's last year. Last year to people's clarity. Close your eyes to look at the light and then.

364
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,350
Yeah, that's right. Usually I'm pretty good about building these things, as you can tell, at a busier morning.

365
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,800
And I'll tell you what, I'll circle around in case you have any questions.

366
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:59,929
So I guess that a first step then then I'll just take it one and put your name on it so

367
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:06,110
that you can see that not everybody is everybody will spend about 15 minutes or so.

368
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:19,430
Let me guess and make sure you submit your group as well.

369
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:29,270
Let's just do said according to the day's time for you.

370
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:54,620
So I'm constantly to be useful if you would like to thank you for that because that's really bad.

371
00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:09,920
You know what it is. So we have to I think I might be the next one here because I was thinking, you know, but I thought it was who we are, what it is.

372
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:40,970
I told him that you could do a oh, sorry. I should say, I think it's hard to say because those boys were only going to be so tired.

373
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:43,100
And he mentions.

374
00:34:46,570 --> 00:35:04,680
Yeah, I mean, you know, yeah, it's like we go to places which since you have personal things that you really like to hear and then you know,

375
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:09,280
there I actually haven't seen it. I really think so.

376
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:40,579
Yeah. It's one of the many reasons as to why is it so I just know of state last year used maximum break actually only 19,000.

377
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:46,750
Looks like it's not hard work, but she could feel it as well.

378
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,810
So I don't know. You just you zoom out on your screen.

379
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,110
Oh, I thought you. I felt like I was using.

380
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:06,530
What? You mean this was so stress because it's something that's all the way, you know?

381
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:16,330
I mean, it's just regular sensing, like, is.

382
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:22,030
But there's not a lot of.

383
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:35,210
Oh, yeah, but I think, you know, I know that if they lost money on it.

384
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:55,790
Yeah. So you take $2,000 of money and you chose from there, so why not resolve it was fine.

385
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:59,450
And you, they're just. So let me do that.

386
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:04,790
You know what you're going to like one it just seems that like in the liberal family.

387
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:14,000
So yeah. So they told me about that.

388
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:23,630
I would say something like everyone's like you say your situation was like, okay, that's good.

389
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:29,960
I don't know. What I'll do is I'll have like then that's terrible.

390
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:38,899
Thank you. It's a nice. Last year, we recorded every one of them.

391
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:53,600
And you do it on Tuesday, July 26 months, 600.

392
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,200
600. Oh, maybe not. She's the best.

393
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:01,310
What are we seeing in 24 hours?

394
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:20,090
All you can do, you have to meet your ass.

395
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:41,680
At one point, I was just like, Oh, my God, I don't feel like this.

396
00:38:42,170 --> 00:39:02,680
I wasn't ready for anything. I was a group of like minded people thinking there were times when he was probably I.

397
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:18,170
I found the one and only one I know.

398
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:32,450
I want to be sure. I was doing something, you know, increased the population.

399
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:39,379
That isn't the one that Wilson was going to be involved in.

400
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:50,570
The first one in the council. You just have to know when I was listening to my mind if I would just rather it's

401
00:39:50,570 --> 00:40:03,209
a pretty good hint in the name their I think I think there are times I use and

402
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:15,200
they didn't get like you use it you want to tell me surprisingly we start in terms

403
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:24,520
of screen rest times I don't know I was interested in from what we have now.

404
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:28,960
Yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah.

405
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,809
It's really hard for me to be in hindsight.

406
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:52,639
I like my chances, but I guess I like I'd sit and listen to evidence which would allow you to imagine like, oh, like, wow, so early.

407
00:40:52,640 --> 00:41:30,770
So I remember one time because of the current president's policies on this subject was back in 2013, somebody says something about, Yeah, yeah, yeah.

408
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:46,520
So I guess you read about it like video moments where you have to choose Andre Hudson for, you know, you you had, you know.

409
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:49,700
Yeah, yeah.

410
00:41:51,020 --> 00:42:04,160
1263.

411
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:26,030
I would be don't know exactly what was something that I could just feel.

412
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:31,670
No, you know I feel that I was 18.

413
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:38,930
I don't know like I. I think I could clean on your feet.

414
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,430
You know, it's certainly. That wasn't just you.

415
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:56,480
I know. I could just take it. In all honesty, the element is just cavalier, no matter where they're going.

416
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:06,660
I mean, I don't like something on this example the way I would.

417
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,160
I look, I have confidence.

418
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:19,580
I guess the the bottom link, the the issue that once people think is not working or has changed.

419
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:26,340
So general kindly posted the new corrected link online like 20 seconds.

420
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,269
26, 27, 26, 27. Yeah, the link is there.

421
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:40,900
So if you're, if don't use the link there, use the one that he does. Pirates. Honestly I don't, I don't yeah.

422
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:55,070
I don't know. I just do it all together. It's only 22 year old university.

423
00:43:55,670 --> 00:44:00,150
That's like reality. But that's harder to monitor. Definitely.

424
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:16,620
Absolutely. Like that question will drive aside a lot of the other stuff to go home and validate such a thing as I was like.

425
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,220
I think, yeah. Yeah.

426
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:32,640
Can you talk about what's going on?

427
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:36,790
Yeah, I was thinking.

428
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:46,080
It's like here.

429
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:51,490
All right. Sure.

430
00:44:53,140 --> 00:45:06,880
Again, there's a talk about how you look so spent like two more minutes on this and then we'll move on just three or four years.

431
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:14,430
I stop typos two years later.

432
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:23,190
I still like that. I just feel really stable.

433
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:52,170
Yeah. So, I mean, like everything else, I'm just like, you know, like I was, you know, I enjoyed the guys and I think the fashion designer.

434
00:45:52,170 --> 00:46:31,770
You feel like you have to move quickly, but I don't think my problems are supposed to be about doing it sometimes.

435
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:43,270
And there is no room for you to say, Come on, it's a dream.

436
00:46:43,640 --> 00:47:04,870
But it's not like was looking at you like exactly what you were saying.

437
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:19,180
So I think it's just good stuff that's already there.

438
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:32,940
So what you're not accused is actually like, you know what, it's not right.

439
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:39,750
And so, you know, spent last Thursday.

440
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:51,940
But I'm just like, I don't have time to outline what it means for whatever reason.

441
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:59,820
It takes me like that.

442
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:13,410
I was like, Yeah, I hope I like the level I have to get involved.

443
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:26,710
Well, it depends on how you think about which questions are missing and you have a one in 100 thoughts.

444
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:40,150
I guess my feelings are so much more mysterious in.

445
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:57,050
It's one. CNN says it's going to be interesting.

446
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:21,170
She does not like me, so she is probably more willing to will take you back to the tiger.

447
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:28,600
I respect that.

448
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:34,340
I don't want to discuss it. That's only the first night.

449
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:44,960
So maybe this is a good place to start.

450
00:49:45,260 --> 00:50:00,750
Very temporarily. Let me start to introduce to you.

451
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:12,469
Okay. Hopefully you guys were able to find the information on this, but a short sort of group related hands,

452
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:22,700
how many people's disease they picked was on the Michigan newborn screening and then how many was not on anyone's screening.

453
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:29,270
So just one group that's searching here. All right.

454
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,460
Okay. So we test for most of these, but not all. I think there was to one.

455
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:39,220
Give that or not. I thought you were okay. So as Evan said, back to these trans eminences.

456
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:43,970
So up till now, the first two we talked about in terms of allergy and aspartate, the next three, the branching, he was one.

457
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:47,990
So I'm just going to skip ahead and say the next four also have a different transvenous.

458
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:50,209
As you can see, these reactions all look very similar.

459
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:56,930
They all are not peculiar on one side, women on the other side, and then a different sometimes maybe never seen what the name of that is.

460
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:03,010
Alpha Ketone asked Would you manage to become permanent self? Oops.

461
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:08,840
Okay, so glutamate is super important in terms of understanding what happens to the excess new glasses.

462
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:12,709
So like I said, most of this is driven because of supply and demand.

463
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:19,130
So with the exception. Speaker Maybe lysine potentially with iodine most of the time when you have the excess amino acids,

464
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:24,560
the first thing you're going to do is go through a transmitted reaction. So for example, after a meal, your amino acids are going to rise.

465
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:31,490
So generally. All of these things are going to be high.

466
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,270
And so the tendency is for all of these things to become all of those things.

467
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:38,750
Right? If you have if you're in the postprandial state,

468
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:43,220
that's one of the reasons why so many of the amino acids that we ingest actually never even make it to the muscle.

469
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:48,860
Right. Because as soon as there's a little bit extra of those amino acids beyond that, then that's going to come.

470
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:55,429
Now, in the liver, the transmitted reaction is almost always going to go from amino acid to alpha ketone acid,

471
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:58,639
especially postprandial, right, because the liver is getting in excess.

472
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,690
Therefore it has has a. Has nothing else.

473
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:07,730
So what could you give somebody if you wanted to sort of retain all of these amino acids?

474
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:12,490
What would be that substance you might want to supplement with to make sure that you don't get broken down?

475
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:20,020
There's one there's one substance that which all of these reactions is glutamate.

476
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,280
Right. So if you have a lot of glutamate, then you're going to write down any of these, right?

477
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:26,740
Because that will push all of these equilibrium actions back in this direction.

478
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:33,430
Right. So then if you only consume has relatively low levels of glutamate, then you're going to tend to break it all down.

479
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:38,260
But if the meal has a lot of glue, that is going to keep this push forward.

480
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:41,980
I haven't seen any studies that say MSG is going to prevent amino acid catabolism,

481
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:45,010
but I would not be shocked if that was actually the case based on this.

482
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:50,680
A lot of this catabolism, as I mentioned, in the digestion class actually occurs even in the digestive tract.

483
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,930
Right. So all of these transient is reacting to our current right.

484
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:59,950
And I guess that's how amino acids are not escaping from the digestive tract literally 50% of us get from our digestive tract.

485
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:06,550
Okay. So the other reaction that's important here is the breakdown of glutamine type glutamate.

486
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:14,320
So glutamate that is is reasonably large, but it's about ten times less than the glutamine, ten times higher than the outer world.

487
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:20,679
So this first step is you're going to start breaking down glutamine for eventual metabolism.

488
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:25,040
You're going to go through this reaction. Glutamine is and that's almost exclusively regulated by energy needs.

489
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:31,150
So this is showing a graph activity and you can see ATP in particular stimulates activity of glutamate.

490
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:34,990
So when there's energy demand, you're going to start breaking down into glutamate.

491
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:40,930
And then as we'll talk about in a minute, that glutamate can go out and become an energy source if needed.

492
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:47,379
So Q10 is or glutamine is a pretty interesting molecule for another reason.

493
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:53,770
So glutamine can go through these pathways. And glutamine not only can it become alpha key to glutamate, which is what we're talking about here.

494
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:55,660
So glutamine becoming glutamate in chloride.

495
00:53:55,870 --> 00:54:03,130
But because this is central to so much other amino acid metabolism, a glutamine can be used as both an energy source of the TCA cycle.

496
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:07,390
Also, it can be used as amino acid source for making the essential amino acids.

497
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:12,819
So one theory is that in cancers which are undergoing a lot of the Tao, a lot of building,

498
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:19,720
a lot of anabolic metabolism, what you might be doing is relying on glutamine as, as an energy source.

499
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:26,589
So for some cancers, for example, they rely heavily on glutamine because glutamine can eventually get your tablets down and then be used as energy.

500
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:31,389
And then that spares say the fats and the and the glucose is for other use.

501
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:33,910
Right. Because cancers are very, very energetic.

502
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:41,680
So these cancers here that have disorders of glutamine metabolism, they tend to operate glutamine transporter.

503
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:47,559
And we've been sending the glutathione enzyme here to allow for use of this sort more effectively.

504
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:52,629
And so there's inhibitors of both glutamine, transport and contaminants that are very,

505
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:59,170
very actively in use for anti chemotherapy, especially the kinds of cancers that tend to rely on these.

506
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:05,500
These are these are a type of cancer we call glutamine addicted because they use so much glutamine as an energy source.

507
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:08,500
Okay. So for the rest of the carbon skeleton,

508
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:17,110
so these are all of the other things on the on the other side of the trends have those reaction in general, what can they do?

509
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:20,679
Well, now that's going to depend on the homeostatic state of the cell, right.

510
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:25,030
Because they're feeding into the DCA cycle, which we've discussed a lot in this class.

511
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,059
And so if you need glucose, they could become Google genic, right?

512
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:34,360
So there is all your variety of eukaryotic signals that your catabolism, you know, acids are going to go out to become glucose.

513
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:41,350
But if you have plenty of glucose and maybe you have excess energy, they can go off and they can become fatty acids or maybe even cholesterol.

514
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:47,170
They could become ketone bodies. If you are catabolic, although from from glass metabolism, that's probably not the case.

515
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:48,940
And then they can of course,

516
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:57,490
we use just going through the TCA cycle depending on the amino acid for energy because as we go through the two year cycles and LDH and appendage,

517
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:04,540
right. So what actually happens to the carbon skeleton depends on what's going on inside the cell and almost all of the things that matter here in

518
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:12,590
terms of what is the activity at PDC and what is the activity of the gluconeogenesis enzymes are things we've sort of already covered a lot of.

519
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:19,510
Okay, so what distinguishes whether they're glucose, Jennifer Ketogenic or kind of touched on this a little bit if they catalyzed was,

520
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:27,460
you know, acetate or acetyl acetylcholine, they are ketogenic and they catalyze into a cycle intermediate or into pyruvate.

521
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:34,210
They are glucose, jack. There are several these three here, these four here, they catabolism to two pieces.

522
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:36,999
So for example, if you look tyrosine is right here.

523
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,050
So part of it becomes as he lasted, but another part of it becomes the precursor to Fumarate, right?

524
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:44,560
So that makes it both legal and ketogenic.

525
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:52,240
So for example, if somebody was, let's say, glucose intolerant, but they needed some stimulation for the glucose,

526
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:59,430
you could provide them with any of these amino acids here in time they would that work is, you know of course pyruvate would be part.

527
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:04,240
And Alan would be most most direct. Okay.

528
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:07,570
So what controls the degradation of glutamine and glutamate? Right.

529
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:11,590
So that first whole step was all those transmitting reactions, getting us down to that glutamate.

530
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:16,089
So it turns out the key point of regulation is, is the glutamate steps.

531
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:21,480
And so we mentioned driving this reaction. Last part for you, right?

532
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:30,190
The reversal reaction, we're allocated glutamate could be the source of glutamate in the context of dispensable amino acid, biosynthesis.

533
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:35,860
And as I said last class, because the ammonia binding pocket of glutamate dehydrogenase is so bad,

534
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:43,030
the levels of ammonia would have to get so high for this reaction to go in this direction here that effectively it never happened.

535
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:49,830
So this is effectively a unit directional reaction where the only direction it goes is when glutamate can become an alpha cue to do that.

536
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:55,720
So this gap is is irreversible and that should be the primary source of most of the ammonia that goes off into the area.

537
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:57,700
So this is a very, very important step.

538
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:02,800
And so it's regulated by, as you can imagine, a bunch of different things is going to be inhibited by high energy things,

539
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,830
specifically GTP, which is analogous to PDB and Pol with oil, correct.

540
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:14,050
So basically, if you have high levels of activated fatty acid with inhibit glutamate that produce,

541
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:17,730
it's going to be activated when you have high levels of ATP or GP.

542
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,910
So those are low energy metabolites giving you and indeed as opposed to energy.

543
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:27,809
And it's also activated when you're very high levels of branched gene amino acids are specifically key to isolate Valerie.

544
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:32,660
It seems to be the most important. So those are the allosteric regulator. So the idea was it's oral energy.

545
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:37,780
If you're going to do this and if you have high energy or high fatty acid, you're going to prevent the breakdown.

546
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:43,810
And so this is at least the third or a third example of macronutrient costs.

547
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:49,690
We've talked about this fast, right? So we talked about how high levels of glucose can inhibit fatty acid oxidation.

548
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,139
We've talked about how high levels of fatty acids can prevent Genesis.

549
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:58,390
And now we're talking about how high levels of lipids can prevent amino acid.

550
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:03,309
Right. And this is one of the reasons why people who are suffering from an amino acid image are

551
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:08,740
generally eating these fuzed with extra energy and or extra energy and extra bacteria,

552
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:11,500
because you're going to want to not break down these products.

553
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:17,230
There's an atmospheric regulation which is by and towards signaling, which is a bit indirect.

554
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:22,149
So we know that enter activates glutamate dehydrogenase. So we've known that for a long time now.

555
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:31,930
The way it appears to work is through and toward when it's active in activates this thing called search for surfboards and acetyl A's,

556
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:35,680
which then normally would inactivate glutamate dehydrogenase.

557
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:39,040
So it's like you're breaking a break, right?

558
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:45,160
So since these are two double negatives, that means we have high end tau, you're going to promote amino acid breakdown.

559
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:51,790
Okay. So this is a little counterintuitive. I remember when I read this paper the first time I was ten years ago, I heard thing, well,

560
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:56,320
that can't be right because Ed like makes them and this is like breaking something down that doesn't make any sense.

561
00:59:56,830 --> 01:00:00,220
My rationale for this, and I know this is true, but this is my explanation for it,

562
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:04,510
is one of the things you would do when you have excess amino acids is activate M tau.

563
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,870
Now certainly one of the things that I'm towards going to do is promote protein synthesis.

564
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:12,520
So if you have an excess of amino acids, promoting protein synthesis is one way to deal with that.

565
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:17,980
But the other way of dealing with that excess of amino acids is to break them all down, right?

566
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,620
So if you're just a cell that's being like, I have too much of this thing here,

567
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:24,010
you can either use it in this case for protein or you can get rid of it.

568
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:27,549
In this case, catabolism. Those are really the only two major options.

569
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:30,190
Right? So I think this makes sense as long as you don't think of them.

570
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:35,530
Tau is necessarily a anabolic pathway, but more is a response to high levels of nutrients.

571
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:42,610
So again, high m tau means high activity, which means more glutamate break down.

572
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:47,470
Okay, so I have a question that I'm going to pose to the group here.

573
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:54,090
There's 20 different amino acids, right? And generally, we're probably going to want to break them all down around the same time.

574
01:00:54,370 --> 01:01:00,130
Right. It's pretty rare that we're going to be like, you know what, I don't want to have alanine, but I do want to have all that.

575
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:04,240
So how do we think that all of these amino acids are going to be synchronized together?

576
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:07,990
Because what happens is when you start breaking down protein, you can have this excess acid,

577
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:12,149
but you're going want to break them all down at the same time. Right. That's kind of the point.

578
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:18,550
If you're breaking out, that's amino acid. So what is the mechanism by which all of this happens at the same time for most amino acids?

579
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:38,479
I go talk about it within your groups for a minute and see if you have an idea and just

580
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,470
kind of two or 3 minutes and then I'll see if you have any thoughts that you can correct.

581
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:47,750
And I won't. I mean, is it possible solutions to really the question is how to all of, you know,

582
01:01:47,750 --> 01:02:06,190
acids get broken down kind of at the same time as opposed to one by one and having to regulate all 20 independent in this case, I don't know.

583
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:18,290
She may not care if it's like I said, I think it could be right.

584
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:40,970
You still think you're going to hear another try to explore the person that is and you deal with it?

585
01:02:41,660 --> 01:03:07,730
Just remembering just briefly is like using it like, you know, I'm just going to sleep.

586
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:15,830
Okay? All right. So do you guys have any thoughts they come up with a solution for how do you break down

587
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:19,070
all the how you promote the breakdown of all these amino acids kind of at the same time.

588
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:29,250
What's the point of thinking of the candidates these days?

589
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:33,450
That's going to be important in a minute,

590
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:41,129
but that's not I don't think what drives the breakdown of all the things we're kind of talking about how in the TV cycle,

591
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:43,480
everything's kind of being stopped at different points.

592
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:48,630
So it's almost kind of like you're on a bike where everything is kind of being limited by different things.

593
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:54,970
It keeps going round. That makes sense, right?

594
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:58,590
So it's a cycle, right? So like a series of a build of one thing, it's going to push back on the other.

595
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:06,780
So I think that part of what I was getting at, if it's something to do with like glutamate, if there's less glutamate, everything will be pushed.

596
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,919
Yeah. So that's, that's, that's kind of what I was getting at.

597
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:18,030
Right. So remember, a lot of amino acids are going to be in these equilibrium reactions with all of those different transmitters,

598
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:25,709
reactions are going to be in equilibrium with glutamate. And so if you drive glutamate right down through mediation, right?

599
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:32,430
So if you proceed to break down glutamate into allocated glutamate, every single time you pull the glutamate in this direction,

600
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:37,770
that's now going to pull all of those amino acids in to replenish the glutamate that you're taking out.

601
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:43,950
Right. So as you pull glutamate out of every single Trans-Am and his reaction is going to go in that direction.

602
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:48,030
Right, which is most of the amino acids that I have been saying over and over again.

603
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:53,340
So by just controlling the regulation of glutamate, because all of these other reactions are at equilibrium,

604
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:58,350
as you pull glutamate out, all of those amino acids are going to come with it at the same time.

605
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:04,380
All right. And by the same token, if you push glutamate back into the system, that's not going to stabilize ozone.

606
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:10,920
So it turns out you only need to regulate glutamate, catabolism. And by controlling glutamate catabolism,

607
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:22,020
you indirectly control the catabolism of all of these things that are downstream in equilibrium reactions from glutamate.

608
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:29,700
Now some of them are downstream. It really directly is like alanine is directly related to glutamate by alti and some

609
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:33,389
other in more complicated ways where there's like a multiple step reaction before that,

610
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:43,049
right? So for example, like disparaging is going to become aspartame, but then aspartame is going to get drawn in the same thing.

611
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:45,030
This reaction here is also going to be equilibrium.

612
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:51,809
So as you pull the amino acid towards glutamate, that's going to pull all the disparaging along and that's the thinking, right?

613
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:55,709
So since all everything flows through glutamate, all you need to do is control glutamate,

614
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:59,760
catabolism, and now you've indirectly controlled every single amino acid.

615
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:04,740
It happens, and whatever else the other could be said that the amino acids are not controlled.

616
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:07,860
Yeah. So those three, they go through the glycine cleavage system.

617
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:11,190
It's not clear cause they don't go along with glutamate levels.

618
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:14,969
They don't break down a lot. Now they're pretty small, they're pretty indispensable.

619
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:19,410
So it's not clear how this glutamate regulation connects to the glycine, which doesn't.

620
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:20,670
It probably does in some way,

621
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:27,930
but we don't really exactly know what you're until 17 out of the 20 you can control through glutamate and then the other three are are left.

622
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:32,490
Does that make sense? Okay.

623
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:37,230
So it's sort of a pretty clever evolutionary system where you just need one enzyme.

624
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:42,450
Which you cannot control pretty tightly. But then because you're controlling this enzyme appropriately,

625
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:49,590
now you're controlling every single other amino acid at the same place and 20 different amino acid break down pathways in like 45 minutes.

626
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:58,110
Okay, so last step here is what to do once you have generated that ammonia from that hydrogenase activity.

627
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,870
So a variety of these processes generate ammonia.

628
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:08,520
The most important one is gage, but also arginine is an aspiration and we also generate ammonia indirectly.

629
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:12,959
And then the glycine cleavage system also generates ammonia. So all of this ammonia is generated.

630
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,380
Ammonia, when it goes off is quite toxic to our bodies.

631
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:22,290
And so that ammonia has to get processed into urea in order to to be excreted.

632
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:29,640
So most of what happens, most of the area cycle happens in the liver, but the urea excretion happens mostly in the kidneys.

633
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:36,050
So this is sort of the complicated biochemistry of this, but you're basically starting with the ammonia.

634
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:45,650
You fix it with some carbon dioxide through seeps, one which was one of the enzymes that were on many of the spreadsheet that we did.

635
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:52,550
And then through this sort of relatively complicated set of reactions again, which is a cycle, you're going to break down urea.

636
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:00,500
Just as a bit of a side note, you'll notice here is this sort of like one, two, three, four or five step reaction to generate arginine.

637
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:07,850
So going all the way back to the amino acid biosynthesis, I mentioned that we can make arginine but kind of and not that effectively.

638
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:10,540
This is actually the biosynthesis of arginine, right?

639
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:16,250
So if you start with this stuff, you can make arginine as long as you have aspartate as its as its precursor.

640
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:25,090
So arginine is by far the most complicated amino acid that we can use that we can make synthetically because it's got five steps.

641
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,870
The other ones have even more than three.

642
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:34,230
But the reason that we sort of retained arginine, the ability to make our own arginine is because arginine is intrinsic to the urea cycle, right?

643
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:38,540
So we kept it because we needed the urea cycle as well. But you can notice this is a cycle, right?

644
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:41,779
So just because you go through the area cycle, you're not generating arginine.

645
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:46,160
If you start pulling arginine away, it's like the TCA, you're going to catapult roses of the area.

646
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:50,450
And so that's one reason why if you're undergoing a lot of amino acid metabolism,

647
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:53,660
you're not able to make as much arginine as you need to be able to do it.

648
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:59,960
So that's also why babies need supplemental protein, whereas adults don't because they're not undergoing nearly as much growth.

649
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:05,320
The key regulatory step for this whole pathways is very first step cpf1.

650
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:11,970
And so that one is regulated somewhat indirectly by another chemical, which is called acetyl glutamate.

651
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:19,400
So any sort of glutamate which is which is shown right here is increased when you have high levels of glutamate,

652
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:27,080
high levels of arginine and high levels of acetylcholine, that has been going to stimulate the activation of cpf1, which is right here.

653
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:31,670
Okay. So it's this pathway here generates this metabolite. I don't want to give you nightmares,

654
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:39,530
but this is kind of like fructose to 16 phosphate whose metabolite doesn't do really anything else except act as a signal to the one.

655
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:46,790
Right. So energy is sort of a signal that when you have a bunch of this stuff in excess which like he was that signals back to all right

656
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:53,839
what speed up the area cycle as clearly we have a lot of excess amino acids both especially glutamate and in our glutamate.

657
01:09:53,840 --> 01:10:00,559
Hopefully at this point you can understand why it's important and to be signal here at some point for energy reasons and arginine because as I said,

658
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:05,780
arginine levels and without this because you want to use up all the arginine for amino acid synthesis.

659
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:12,770
And there's also some transcriptional content regulation by both glucagon and glucocorticoids and decreased by insulin.

660
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:17,990
So under a high levels of glucocorticoid, you're breaking down a lot of proteins through the activation of those A2 genes.

661
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:24,800
And because you're breaking down those proteins that make sense, you also uprated the urine cycle to get rid of of those amino acids.

662
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:31,520
And then this reaction is connected to the to use every single time you're going to use that aspartate

663
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,829
right here that aspartate is going to come from muktsar acetate through a transverse reaction of its own.

664
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:46,490
Right? So this reaction here is already going to be catastrophic to it's easy to say, okay, you're in a cycle is pretty energetically inefficient.

665
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:57,469
So that keeps 1061 step, uses two ATP equivalents, and then this step right here uses up another two ATP here.

666
01:10:57,470 --> 01:11:00,530
Right? So used for ATP use every time you go through this cycle.

667
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:05,510
So again, if you go in for all the way back to Genesis, maybe even energy balance,

668
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:13,570
I mentioned at the beginning that when you undergo algae break down your kidneys, 15 ATP because 40 tips are needed to dispose of the nitrogen here.

669
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:20,990
That's where those four inches are, right? So the catabolism of amino acid is already right here.

670
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:24,770
The catabolism of amino acids already requires a lot of energy to detoxify.

671
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:31,010
And again, that's one of the reasons why we sort of restrained amino acid catabolism as much as we can.

672
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:40,490
Okay. If there's no other questions, then that's all I have for Amino Catalyst, for all that sort of does not to come out on top of that.

673
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:46,850
Oh, one other thing. So I'm going to try just I was talking about one of the students mentioned that

674
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:51,290
they had their exit exam on Monday and then a person who was like stooping in

675
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:55,579
our conversation mentioned that also and his students have their public health

676
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:59,240
exam on Monday and also kinesiology students have their messiah exam on Monday.

677
01:11:59,510 --> 01:12:04,190
So I'm going to do everything I can to try to move our exam from Tuesday to Wednesday.

678
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:10,550
I cannot guarantee again, but I will try to find if I can find a room on Tuesday, I will I will book that room.

679
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:15,770
Now, I know all of you are free 4 to 6 on Tuesday. Right. Because you're all you all that blocked off on your calendar,

680
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:22,270
you can still choose to take the exam 4 to 6 on Tuesday if you've got travel plans or if the Wednesday timing is not working.

681
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:28,880
But I'll try to find a room and I'll try to find some options. And then what I'll do and please pay attention to this is I'll put up here to pull up.

682
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,030
Let's say there's a couple of.

683
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:35,950
And options on Wednesday for people to kind of board which options work for them, and then we'll go with whatever we want.

684
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,130
If I can, I will try my hardest, but I cannot guarantee it. Right?

685
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:44,310
Hopefully, if you guys can respond to the poll by Wednesday, we can make an announcement on Wednesday in class.

686
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:52,490
So that really based on 90 days between seconds sections.
