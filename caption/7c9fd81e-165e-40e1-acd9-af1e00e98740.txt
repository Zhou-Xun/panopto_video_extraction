1
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,560
Okay. Welcome to Wednesday. I don't know about you guys.

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:16,600
I was feeling a little bit of the hump day thing today, just trying to get over the midweek slump.

3
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:23,200
We are going to continue today with some of the stuff that we talked about on Monday.

4
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,430
We talked a lot about some of the beginnings of policy evaluation.

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,229
We're going to build on that today. And we were working with the three E's model, which you can think of as the three E's,

6
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:43,210
plus some other core concepts that you might think of, those E's being equity, efficacy, efficiency.

7
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:49,110
I'm going to build on that a little bit more and talk a bit about how to evaluate different alternatives.

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,870
So this might come in handy in a couple of different scenarios.

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,379
If you're doing advocacy, you might care quite a lot about comparing policy alternatives because you

10
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,790
want to know which one is going to be best for the people that you represent.

11
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,620
And so you might be trying to figure out internally, well,

12
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:16,390
what's the position that we should take as an organization or as a coalition of organizations in order to get the outcome that we want.

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,120
You might also want to have some evidence and evaluation of the policies that you're recommending,

14
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:31,710
because then you're trying to present that evidence and that evaluation to people who have decision making authority in that area.

15
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,930
So when you're doing your advocacy and lobbying, you're taking that evidence with you.

16
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:43,340
And I think, too, it can be really helpful if you're doing any kind of policy job where you are working for

17
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,040
a government and you want to think about the different options in a constructive way.

18
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:54,970
We want to move from just the conceptualization to also thinking a little bit about how you might measure these different things.

19
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,239
So this is not a methods class by any means.

20
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:07,840
We're not going to talk really about methods, but I do want you to think critically about measurement and what when you do policy evaluation,

21
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,840
what are some of the things that get measured and are they the right things?

22
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,080
Because I'm pretty critical about all of this policy evaluation you might have figured out by now.

23
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:24,770
So. We have today a little bit of discussion.

24
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:29,630
We can talk together about how to measure our three E's or any other E's.

25
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:38,430
We're going to talk about surprise billing, which is a bit more of a medical case or a health services case than I would normally give you.

26
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,850
And it's a bit more intricate. If you touched on any of the readings or listen to the podcast.

27
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:52,190
Don't worry about all of the details. This is a deep kind of rabbit hole policy where there are lots and lots of details.

28
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,350
And if you're really wonky about it, you can go delve right down that rabbit hole.

29
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,670
But if you don't, I'm going to sort of highlight the key trade offs.

30
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:07,520
And I think the trade offs are actually the important part for about our concerns today in class.

31
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:17,299
Okay. So I want you to understand, oh, start thinking critically about some measurement alternatives when you're doing a policy evaluation,

32
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,930
when you're trying to figure out whether a policy idea is a good one.

33
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:28,790
And I want you to try and understand, like we did. We're also going to grapple again with the tradeoffs between our three E's or

34
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:34,340
any other core values that you might choose to introduce into this evaluation.

35
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,590
So. A couple of points that I want to discuss with you all a little bit more.

36
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:51,350
How do we know when a policy is equitable or efficient or effective or fits with any of the other values we might have identified?

37
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,410
We talked a little bit about this on Monday, but I wanted to point out a couple of things.

38
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:02,360
So. Equity is a difficult one, I think, in these contexts,

39
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:11,540
partly because the people who do a lot of policy evaluation tend to prefer quantitative methods over qualitative.

40
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:19,190
When you are assessing equity, maybe you want to do some more qualitative things for measurement.

41
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:26,950
So you might want to. If you're thinking from an equity perspective, you want to measure need.

42
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,510
We talked a bit about the idea of equity on Monday,

43
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,639
having a policy that is responsive to need and thinking about bringing people up

44
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:41,810
to the same level rather than equally distributing something regardless of need.

45
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,050
Right. So how do we actually address what the need is?

46
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:55,020
And so I'm going to offer the very simple suggestion that you might want to actually talk to people who are going to be affected by the policy.

47
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:03,570
And that might involve some qualitative research, chatting to people, some community engaged research.

48
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:11,190
It might involve, if you're in a government public consultation and paying very careful attention to who can

49
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:17,490
access that consultation and trying to seek an elicit information to go into that process.

50
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,760
You might also really want to assemble some experts who actually know what they're doing when they're talking about equity.

51
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:31,469
I think here that the. It's interesting to watch the federal government and what they're doing.

52
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,190
And I've talked a bit about Justice 40 before, but I'm going to use it as an example.

53
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:40,170
Again, it's very interesting to see this policy unfold.

54
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:48,030
The Justice Forces policy, as a reminder, is the idea that we should spend 40% of public investment from the federal government,

55
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,520
which goes towards all different things. But this is largely targeted in terms of climate change.

56
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,380
There's some health components in there,

57
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:05,430
and the idea is that 40% of that money should go to what the Federal Government defines as disadvantaged or marginalized communities.

58
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,760
The interesting part to me from the point of evaluation and measurement,

59
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,060
is that interest groups on the outside are asking for an accountability framework.

60
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,409
They're asking for measurement and benchmarking of this.

61
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,440
Where is this? Is this 40% going to actually show up?

62
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:33,320
I think they think. And if it shows up, how can we actually hold the government to account to see where was this money spent?

63
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,570
Was it really spent in the places that we would like to see it spent in in those communities?

64
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,140
Or did this somehow go astray? Is it really?

65
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,800
Weird, interesting new approach to policy that is not usual for the federal government.

66
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:57,550
And it's interesting to me to see outside interest groups that are invested in some of the affected communities asking for measuring and benchmarking.

67
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:05,050
You know, I think there could be a lot of problems with that. The first thing the government is doing in this area is building a map.

68
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:10,929
We're going to do a whole class on Justice 40 later in the semester and we'll explore this map.

69
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:17,560
And the map is how do we define what's written in the policy as disadvantage of marginalized communities?

70
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:22,180
And they use a lot of quantitative data in different layers to do that definition.

71
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,230
And they did a big public consultation around that definition.

72
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:32,350
And I'm kind of waiting with bated breath to see the results of the consultation, which haven't been published yet.

73
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,820
But you can go and look at the map. You have a bit of spare time and you're interested.

74
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:43,870
I recommend it. It's really interesting. I don't know whether it fulfills the criteria that some of you might want to see when

75
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,340
it comes to really connecting with and addressing some of the affected communities.

76
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,480
But it is it is really fascinating to me as someone who's been thinking about these these data questions.

77
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:07,190
So. I want to point out here then the clash potentially between understanding equity and thinking about how to capture a need,

78
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,709
which might lead to at least some things that are more qualitative,

79
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:21,680
some forms of data that are more qualitative with efficiency, where the mainstream evaluation method is a lot of quantitative data.

80
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,650
We talked about efficiency is the idea.

81
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:32,180
There are a couple of different definitions, but the idea that we want to monitor inputs and outputs and look at the relationship there.

82
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:39,170
So hope with a bit of luck, a small amount of input produces the desired output.

83
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,990
There are a lot of different people within the School of Public Health.

84
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,790
A lot of them are in my department whose entire career is around.

85
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:55,549
I will do the kind of analysis that balances inputs with outputs.

86
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:00,770
I'm going to understand efficiency, and some of them do also cost effectiveness analysis,

87
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:08,810
which also works in a similar way, like weighing up how much an intervention cost versus how effective it is.

88
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:18,139
And so one of the big problems with efficiency in a political sense is when we talk about efficiency,

89
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:23,060
and particularly when members of Congress talk about it, they equate it with cost.

90
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,910
Right. I just want you to realize that a policy can be expensive and efficient.

91
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:38,630
At the same time, if you think about it. Right. You might have to spend quite a bit of money to achieve the outcome that you want,

92
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:46,190
but maybe the money that you put in does translate quite well into the outcomes in which you could say it is efficient.

93
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:54,259
Right? Whereas a lot of the times the political debate will look at any policy that costs a lot of money and say,

94
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,510
this is not worth it because it's expensive. You know, we talk about health all the time.

95
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:07,969
Treating preventative care, public health and treating health problems is really expensive.

96
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:15,560
And so I don't want you to think that by talking about efficiency, we're necessarily saying everything has to be cheap.

97
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:25,190
And then effectiveness, when you're evaluating the effectiveness of something, I think it can be really helpful,

98
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:30,770
especially if whether you're an advocate or working in a government or doing this evaluation in another context,

99
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:37,950
understanding the relationships between the different components that are working in this policy area.

100
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,710
So you might want to build a logic model to see, okay, if X happens,

101
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,170
then Y is going to happen and then that's going to affect the outcomes in this particular way.

102
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:53,030
So there are lots of ways to do that in policy evaluations. Like like I said,

103
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:58,099
it's not a methods class but understanding the causal relationships as they stand

104
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,290
before you pose your policy idea and try to change things can be really helpful.

105
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:13,370
There are lots of ways to try to do that. Quite often in advocacy groups work together, particularly if they have different perspectives.

106
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,350
This can happen quite a lot actually in global health where you get lots of different actors working together.

107
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,320
They'll have everyone come together and try to map out a system that relates to a policy.

108
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,850
Try to understand all the factors that are at work. Because if you don't do that,

109
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:34,430
the problem is that you're missing something really important and then your policy idea won't actually work out on the ground.

110
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,640
So it can be a collaborative thing.

111
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:46,280
A lot of the time in American politics, it's something that's done by a think tank or research shop or by somebody within a federal department.

112
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:53,359
And then a lot of people in each MP do cost effectiveness analysis.

113
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:02,360
So they're doing quantitative methods to try to figure out the how effective and cost something is and what the relationship is there.

114
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:11,540
The key thing when you're thinking about these things is how can you be sure that the policy created the change and not something else?

115
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:17,600
Right. That's why I think that understanding the causal factors and relationships here is really important,

116
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,459
because if you just assume that the policy made the difference,

117
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,260
you end up with a really bad set of policy recommendations that don't work and don't fit.

118
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:33,210
And that happens a lot more than I think most people who do policy would like to admit.

119
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:39,590
Right. Then the other issue and this has been a big issue in a lot of the tobacco control work

120
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:45,500
that I've done is how do we know whether something's effective before we even try it?

121
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:52,730
So when you have a brand new policy idea, there can be lots of different opinions on how effective that is,

122
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:58,430
but how do you actually figure out how to test it and work out whether it's actually going to to be effective?

123
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:04,270
So in tobacco control, the example I would give would be labeling of packages.

124
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:11,929
So I don't know if you've ever seen we don't have them in the US, but in a lot of other countries they have really big.

125
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:17,330
And if actually if you come to my office, I have a whole display. I promise it's not to like put students off.

126
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:25,760
I have picked images of different diseases that you can get and the consequences of smoking cigarets on the packets,

127
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:31,460
which is a pretty controversial idea. It was incredibly controversial before it was first done.

128
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:41,330
And the problem for tobacco control people was figuring out how much evidence of effectiveness did they need to provide?

129
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,420
Would this thing actually work?

130
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:49,790
If you're going to put a lot of lobbying effort into forcing governments and companies to change the packaging of their products?

131
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,670
Is this thing actually going to work?

132
00:13:52,850 --> 00:14:02,900
Because especially working in a nonprofit space, you only have so much energy to to put into deciding, you know, put into advocacy.

133
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:11,449
So they really had to spend a lot of time doing experimental research and like trying psychological research,

134
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:17,030
trying to figure out how people react to branding on CIGARET packets and how that might change.

135
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,259
If you add these very ugly and disturbing pictures,

136
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:27,620
along with really big warnings about smoking and there is a reasonable body of evidence that that stuff works.

137
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:35,209
I think when they put it into practice, they found out more things about how it worked and there were some gaps in knowledge,

138
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:40,910
like you have to change the pictures very frequently because they stop being effective after a time.

139
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:47,600
But the idea is that you have a smoker pick up that pack depending on how much they smoke 20 to 40 times a day.

140
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:55,670
And they see an image. And for the most part, if somebody already has an intention to quit seeing as a reminder,

141
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:00,620
a warning and an image will strengthen their intention to quit.

142
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:06,649
But it doesn't do a lot to help people who already don't have that intent to quit.

143
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:10,340
They're going to ignore and sideline those warnings no matter what.

144
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:19,280
So you guys don't need a really long lecture on tobacco labeling, but any time you want to come ask me, I will go on about it forever.

145
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,680
But this is just to illustrate the fact that we have to figure out how something

146
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,610
is effective before it's actually put into practice the best that we can.

147
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,320
Who has questions about these these issues of measurement or.

148
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,100
Are there other things that you think we should be doing to try and evaluate how?

149
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:44,760
Yeah. Please let me grab your cube. Sorry.

150
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,120
I don't want to focus everybody's head so close together.

151
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:57,530
So how do you measure the policy after it's been implemented if you can't hold other factors constant in society or other interventions?

152
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:02,270
Yeah. So. Well, if you think about it, if you do a quantitative analysis,

153
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:06,710
you have to have a methodology for figuring out, well, I've got a bunch of quantitative data.

154
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,380
I'm going to try to hold some factors constant.

155
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:18,080
So there's various kinds of analysis like people will do, various forms of pre and post analysis that hold certain things constant.

156
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,280
They'll do like a different kind of analysis, but worry if you haven't heard of these kinds of analysis before.

157
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:34,010
But that's the kind of idea I would tend to for an evaluation, because I'm a more of a qualitative researcher.

158
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:39,610
I care about context, and I want to know whether the context has changed over time.

159
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,849
So as part of the evaluation, I would try to collect qualitative data.

160
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,090
That tells me, is the context still the same?

161
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:52,780
I'll probably look at some descriptive statistics I might like go in a deep dove into some cases of has the policies,

162
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,080
how the policies worked on the ground, because that's how my brain works.

163
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,420
I'm not one of these people who would do a lot of quantitative pre post analysis, but that works too.

164
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:08,719
But very good question. And it's always a challenge for policy research because we're doing it in the

165
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,680
real world and the real world is really complicated and constantly moving.

166
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:19,520
So I would say an essential part of that evaluation is asking the affected people, how did this work for you?

167
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,880
Which I'm afraid evaluations very often fail to do?

168
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,900
Any more questions? Okay.

169
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:35,350
All right. So. This is the me talking part of the study.

170
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,250
I want to ask you have more of a conversation because this is a.

171
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:46,830
How many people in this room currently have ever received a surprise bill?

172
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,240
In a health care setting. Okay.

173
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,220
Does anyone want to tell me about their surprise bill? Experience?

174
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,560
Well, you don't have to tell me the details of the health thing, but what was that like?

175
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:06,170
Yeah, please. So it's going over your head.

176
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:13,830
Look, I got a surprise, Bill, like, a week ago from my Kellogg Ice Center.

177
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:19,060
And I don't remember what it was, and, like, the building, like, a lot.

178
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:26,090
I also was, like, too lazy to call. So. And she's part of my security deposit that I got back to pay it.

179
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,490
Oh, I'm so sorry. It's. It's awful. I had a lot of problems with this when I was pregnant.

180
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,630
I couldn't get physiotherapy and I couldn't walk. They're like, Yeah, sure.

181
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:43,220
Thank you. In theory, my health plan should have included physio.

182
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,589
I went and got some physio eventually,

183
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:52,520
and then they decided that they were going to charge me a very large amount of money for that which should have been covered under my insurance.

184
00:18:54,020 --> 00:19:01,220
So a lot of people especially receive incredibly large bills for things like ambulance services,

185
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:08,420
which is a huge problem and it remains unfortunately a huge problem, even though we've had surprise billing legislation.

186
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:16,880
So to me, this is a fundamental issue around healthcare access, which makes it a significant problem.

187
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,890
It's going to change. The people's view of surprise. Billing is going to change how they interact with health care.

188
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,520
It's going to change influence how they seek out care.

189
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:36,730
They might choose to forgo care or delayed care because of worries about billing, particularly surprise billing.

190
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,450
And, you know, bear in mind that from an equity perspective, we're again talking about people with insurance.

191
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:51,609
Right? Some of those people are going to be underinsured and have poor quality insurance with a lot of worries about surprise billing.

192
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:56,050
But surprise billing can also affect people who think they have really great insurance.

193
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:03,520
And what worries me is when I asked students about surprise billing, it can impact you,

194
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,710
even if you have a lot of knowledge about health insurance in the health care system.

195
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,720
I teach a bunch of health systems managers who go and manage hospitals.

196
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:18,320
They get surprise bills. They freak out about it and they get really stressed about it.

197
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:27,370
So how does somebody who is knows a bit less about how the system is working and maybe a bit less about how to game the system deal with this.

198
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:37,560
So from the perspective of patients, the problem for surprise billing is this is a large, unexpected cost.

199
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:42,250
It might deter them from obtaining care or it just shows up.

200
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,330
And part of the problem is how do you know when you've been surprised, billed?

201
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,560
I'm sure there are some people who assume that that's just what they've got to pay.

202
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,069
This is a question for all of you. Why were health policy experts surprised?

203
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:03,740
Because they were that it took a long time to get legislation on surprise billing.

204
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:13,010
Like it took over. Congress, attempted to legislate on this, and it took nearly two years from start to finish.

205
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:22,370
And the bill we got at the end was okay, but it wasn't nearly as good as policy folks were hoping for to try and fix this problem.

206
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,170
And it does need legislation to fix. So anybody know why?

207
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:34,240
We were surprised? Now you're frowning at me like this is a weird question.

208
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:42,750
This is a bipartisan issue, right? There is consensus in Congress as much as the two sides fight over everything.

209
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,860
There is consensus in Congress that surprise spending is a serious problem needed to be addressed.

210
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:54,520
And there was willingness from representatives on both sides of the aisle to actually try and work on a solution.

211
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,280
This is like a classic issue. Some people always say we should have bipartisan politics.

212
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,140
And, you know, isn't it great that Congress is built on the need for bipartisanship?

213
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,620
You notice I said some people say because I don't necessarily think that,

214
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:15,220
but there's a lot of emphasis put on what we need to be conciliatory and work with both sides and come up with solutions.

215
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,950
And this was an issue where they actually had a consensus,

216
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:23,890
at least this was really serious hurting people and that they wanted to do something about it.

217
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:30,760
But the problem is then the actors and their positions on surprise billing,

218
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:37,480
particularly the position of providers on the one hand, and health insurers on the other.

219
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:47,800
So the problem, according to insurers and providers, was who is going to bear the cost of doing this?

220
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,750
So there's discussion in Congress, they're crafting legislation.

221
00:22:53,260 --> 00:23:01,330
The core idea that everybody agrees on is that patients shouldn't be forced to cover the cost of surprise bills.

222
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,960
But then the political problem becomes how do you allocate the losses among different actors in the health system?

223
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:19,710
Who's going to pay? And providers and insurers had built business models in which the failsafe is to push costs onto patients.

224
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:28,150
So if you've ever battled with your health insurance company and you phone them up and they said, well, we can't possibly bill for that.

225
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:34,180
We can't possibly cover that. And you've had a long conversation with them, maybe multiple conversations.

226
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:40,120
You've had to advocate yourself in that situation. That's the business model that they have.

227
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:49,390
And then this legislation is telling them they can no longer rely on pushing costs to patients and to figure out how to cover those costs internally.

228
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:56,410
Similarly, for providers that they want to fight for a high level of reimbursement.

229
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:04,030
So they actually don't care if costs are high because they want to be reimbursed more substantially.

230
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,140
And so there's sort of a fight over who in the health system should bear the costs of these surprise bills.

231
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:21,130
So this created a really big problem for anybody representing patients as part of a patient interest group or the public.

232
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:29,890
Right. How do you how do you figure out what this what the position is of insurers and providers

233
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:34,480
and what the position of the legislation is if you don't really have a seat at the table.

234
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:38,540
So. Congress discusses this legislation.

235
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,860
There's a lot of lobbying from all aspects of the health care industry,

236
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,870
but particularly an argument between insurers and providers over who's going to pay.

237
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,130
And patients are in the window here. Right.

238
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:58,610
And so after the legislation was passed and the legislation contains some big old loopholes,

239
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:07,129
like ground ambulances not covered, and the reason for that is that they while writing the legislation,

240
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:16,760
they discovered a lot of local governments, particularly in rural areas, particularly in the south, rely on ambulance services to create revenue.

241
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:24,980
And there were actually a very large number of local governments that would have gone bankrupt if they could not charge people for ambulance services.

242
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:29,030
Yeah. Welcome to my world of health care research.

243
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:37,590
It's lovely in here. So. Um, the ambulance services are not included.

244
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,370
So this legislation gets passed, it's got a bunch of loopholes in.

245
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,160
And then this fight between insurers and providers moves to litigation.

246
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:52,080
So you've got now less public access to this debate.

247
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:59,970
A lot of the issues being dealt with through regulation, guidance and then litigation against that guidance.

248
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:07,860
So I just want to point out that the the the lack of a role for patients and lack of transparency for the public,

249
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,219
even though this is a very big issue of public concern.

250
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,090
And now Congress, members of Congress are going around saying, look, look how great it is.

251
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,900
We've solved this problem, which they have partially done.

252
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,150
But there are lots of circumstances that are not unfortunately covered by the new law.

253
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:32,620
So. Does anybody have more questions about how surprise billing works or anything I've said?

254
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:37,690
Because I'm aware that this is maybe a bit of a new topic for some people.

255
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:45,310
Because we all going to do a group exercise on it. So we're all going to be talking about this in small groups in a minute.

256
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:48,460
I just want to give you the opportunity to ask me some questions.

257
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:58,290
Please. Oh, hang on. I need to wear, like, running shoes or something.

258
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:09,450
You can tell it's Wednesday because I'm not moving so fast. So the context of surprise building is the whole, like, lack of patient anticipation.

259
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,670
But I feel like that's kind of subjective.

260
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:22,500
So how is that being determined when they are like deciding to reimburse like in network at the network standard?

261
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:29,100
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. So this is very difficult if you think about it.

262
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:33,360
It relies on the patient figuring out they've been surprised, built.

263
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:41,990
Right. The idea of this law is to put. Legal constraints on all of these actors in the health sector.

264
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,510
But those legal constraints only mean something if the health actors comply.

265
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:54,830
So there has to be some kind of bureaucratic push to ensure compliance, like make sure that they're behaving.

266
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:02,310
And normally in some of these policy areas, there are a few actors always that are bad actors and are going to screw people over no matter what.

267
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:09,860
So the government will have to act to try and seek compliance either bureaucratically or eventually through legal action.

268
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:13,200
Right. The law at least makes legal redress possible.

269
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,770
But what's the problem with trying to get legal redress around hospital costs?

270
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:27,150
There are several. One of which is it's a cost. A lot of money and time and resources to seek legal action.

271
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:31,470
You have to recognize this is an individual. You've been surprised build.

272
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:38,580
You have to recognize that the health factor that you're dealing with is noncompliant with the law.

273
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:43,850
And then you have to figure out how to seek redress. You probably start internally.

274
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,340
You have to put resources into talking to that health actor.

275
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:52,170
And then if things progress and nothing is resolved, you might have to take them to court.

276
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:59,390
Some people just can't do that, right? Probably the same kinds of people who already have.

277
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,380
Thank you. Poorer health insurance might be underinsured.

278
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:11,089
So there's a structural bias here in how people can take advantage of their opportunity for legal redress.

279
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:21,240
Right. So. You put your finger on it by saying context, because the implementation of this law is really important.

280
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,560
And those are two of the things I don't know yet how that's going to go.

281
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:34,050
But those are two of the things that I worry about is identification of surprise, billing, compliance with the law.

282
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:41,180
Good question. All right. We're going to go through some of this in a bit more detail.

283
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,570
And John and I will be right here to help take you through it.

284
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:50,390
We're all going to talk together. Don't freak out by the details I've included in this slide.

285
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:59,130
If you're not that into health care services. But I think understanding a little bit of this in the trade offs is sort of important.

286
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:07,020
So we're going to have a look at. What would be a policy option to prevent surprise billing?

287
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:10,290
And most importantly, to figure out who covers the cost.

288
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:19,680
If you get out of network emergency care or the patient gets stabilization care after being transferred from the emergency room,

289
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,390
a lot of these surprise bills are to do with emergency care.

290
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:32,640
And so you get screwed over because you get charged a huge amount of money for being admitted to the E.R. even,

291
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,600
or you get charged a huge amount of money for the hospital.

292
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:45,410
Right. And then the second part is you could get screwed over again because you moved from one provider to another.

293
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,020
So you get into the emergency room. Fine.

294
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:55,140
No surprise billing there. But they move when they transfer you out of the E.R. and you're being stabilized.

295
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,540
There's a potential for as you move over to a new provider within the hospital,

296
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:06,600
within the health care system, that you get billed a huge rate for that.

297
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,320
Post stabilization post emergency stabilization care that you get.

298
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:18,740
So really tricky to navigate for anybody, let alone somebody who is seriously sick enough to be in the E.R. in the first place.

299
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:23,040
Right. So we're going to ask you to look at two different options.

300
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,030
First of all.

301
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:34,899
The original idea in the legislation that was floated was this idea that we should find a standard rate that everybody in the health care sector

302
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:43,840
can agree on and patients should not have to pay anything and patient doesn't have to pay anything legally in either of these scenarios.

303
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:53,469
And we should just force the there to be a standard payment rate for all of these surprise bills based on the health care plans,

304
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,690
median in-network rate, right.

305
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:03,639
Not out-of-network in network. Then the second one idea that was floated and again,

306
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:10,330
there were like six or more different competing bills on this which I do not expect you to know the details of,

307
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:14,920
but the fact that there are so many different ideas about how to tackle this is a bit frustrating.

308
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:25,480
The second option is to require the insurers and the providers to get together and negotiate on price for a lot of these different surprise bills.

309
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:33,370
And the idea is that they do this informally and they just talk to each other in these private conversations,

310
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:41,410
but that it's backed by a formal arbitration process. So if the two sides can't agree on who's going to pay for this and what the cost is,

311
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:48,250
they get forced into a formal arbitration process where they have to do certain things by certain deadlines.

312
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:52,000
Right. So. I hope you can tell.

313
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:58,900
The second idea is what insurers and providers liked more, particularly the insurers.

314
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:06,640
Why do you think that insurers might like the second policy idea a little bit more than the first one?

315
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:12,270
Please. Thank you.

316
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:19,590
They can get patients to pay more because the insurers and providers both want a higher price.

317
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,340
Yep, they want a higher price. Thank you. So you're dead, right?

318
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:30,690
The first option, I think, is more likely to result in some higher prices potentially, but it's a standardized rate.

319
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:40,200
So insurers didn't like that very much because they're thinking we've built our business model on pushing costs onto patients.

320
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:46,500
This is going to involve us having to recoup those costs in a lot of other different ways.

321
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:52,550
We're going to have to change what we do quite substantially, and it's going to cost us money and insurance companies really hate that.

322
00:33:52,560 --> 00:34:05,160
So the second option is something that was floated a bit later that was supposed to try to calm down, particularly the insurers.

323
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:11,390
But the providers didn't like option one either. AsMuch a little bit more, I would say, but not entirely.

324
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,480
I think both insurers and providers would prefer that we didn't do either of these things.

325
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:23,430
In other words, we did nothing. So we want you to look at these two options and we can answer more of your questions about

326
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:32,550
them and see whether you think either of these would create would be an equitable solution.

327
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,960
Would it be an efficient solution? Would it be an effective solution?

328
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:44,490
Or feel free to apply any other values like empathy that we thought of in our previous class or anything else that occurs to you.

329
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:50,910
Right. But I want you to discuss these options and make a recommendation about which one we should do.

330
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:58,520
It's okay to feel personally like none of these is quite right because I feel personally like neither of these is quite right.

331
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,360
But if you're in that situation, when you a legislator, what would you pick?

332
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:08,160
And. For the option that you picked.

333
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,020
How do you think you could measure whether this was actually effective at all?

334
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:20,430
Who would you talk to? What data would you collect? What might be some questions that you would want to ask in order to figure that out?

335
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:26,820
Okay. So we're going to have you in in groups for the next 25 minutes, I think.

336
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,180
I think ten past is good so we can have a chat together afterwards.

337
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:36,630
Feel free to trust however you like. I would suggest like four or five people is a good group,

338
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,640
but if you find you're having trouble hearing everybody in the group because this room is terrible for that.

339
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:47,320
Feel free to cluster in smaller groups. I won't mind. All right.

340
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,250
You want in? I'm feeling it, too. It's okay. You're going to make me yawn, too.

341
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:55,570
So let's do this. I'm going to come round. John is going to come around.

342
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:05,630
Start by grading these two options on those three criteria and having a better discussion about which one you think we should recommend.

343
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:58,860
Okay. Now the guy.

344
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:16,090
Yeah, I. Yeah.

345
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:46,600
My. Apologies for the writer's.

346
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:18,230
Yeah. I think.

347
00:38:48,370 --> 00:39:04,370
More. I think I got.

348
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:30,480
You. Oh.

349
00:39:55,570 --> 00:40:10,700
Yeah. So it.

350
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:26,540
Alex. Yeah.

351
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:32,520
I hear you. Yeah, I want to come.

352
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:50,010
What you say. Why do you.

353
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:26,440
Thank goodness my car and.

354
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,300
I actually think he is.

355
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:40,630
I guess I would be. Right now.

356
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:48,630
I'm. This has.

357
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:22,940
Look at the time. Then I realized.

358
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:32,100
Every time I go on average.

359
00:42:42,090 --> 00:43:17,390
You're. Questions that have been raised.

360
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,410
It's hard. Some countries.

361
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:33,610
Thought. Obviously.

362
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:51,760
That's where you decide if you call. Or is it?

363
00:43:55,090 --> 00:44:35,740
You guys all right? Yeah. Yeah.

364
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,960
I mean, I get the personal letters.

365
00:44:52,180 --> 00:45:08,110
She? But it's not. So where are you going?

366
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:54,570
You have. One. So.

367
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:30,650
For life. So. I draw that line.

368
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:39,010
So in that sense. That's not exactly what I've been thinking.

369
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:53,010
And it's very. Her confidence and.

370
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,840
Yes. How did you first?

371
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:20,120
Yeah. More than 70.

372
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:36,310
I'm not sure if you know the.

373
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:54,860
Yeah, I don't. Yeah.

374
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:07,910
Oh, yeah. What?

375
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:27,520
Like how? I.

376
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:27,230
Anyone else. Know much.

377
00:49:41,450 --> 00:50:40,840
Well. I.

378
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:58,500
I think. You want to.

379
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:21,400
It's not like it's. Really good luck.

380
00:51:26,440 --> 00:52:00,100
That's right. Yeah.

381
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:38,970
In. The same.

382
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:48,700
In the last. My understanding is that this.

383
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:17,490
I. He.

384
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:28,710
Stay here.

385
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:02,390
I was. Yeah.

386
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:24,280
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

387
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:16,790
As you might have.

388
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:12,900
I don't really. Not as.

389
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:06,530
Yeah, I'm working on it.

390
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:34,730
So. I.

391
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:56,260
But that's the thing about. So.

392
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:46,990
You know. Now.

393
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:14,070
What? I get that.

394
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:29,070
So that was good, I. Okay.

395
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:35,120
So it's kind of. You get stuff.

396
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:53,690
Because the. So we.

397
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:16,570
Right. I.

398
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:49,720
Yeah. Hello.

399
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:56,740
Okay, so I'm going to pull up the the jam board.

400
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:06,250
Finish up whatever conversation you're having. I can get this to go backwards.

401
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:11,239
There we go. Please tell me this is recording yet?

402
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:20,040
Still recording. Good. So which of who could you mind putting the jumbled up?

403
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:25,010
What? I think you. So who chose option one.

404
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:28,940
The first option within that group. Okay.

405
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,360
And who chose option two? Okay.

406
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:38,270
Interesting. I kind of want to go to the auction to groups. There's no let me be very straight.

407
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:42,020
There's no right answer here. It's just asking you to explore this.

408
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:46,330
So why did you guys choose option two? Thank you.

409
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:54,370
She's. So we chose option two.

410
01:01:54,610 --> 01:02:00,010
Honestly, we weren't really sure which one to choose because neither of them really made a difference to the patient.

411
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:06,190
It was more like deciding whether to prioritize providers versus insurers.

412
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:11,350
But we thought that when we were debating providers versus insurers,

413
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:18,520
that insurance companies have usually so much money that they can afford to take a little bit of a hit and.

414
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:25,400
So we just decided to prioritize the providers and we knew that option two is more effective for providers.

415
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:30,920
Okay. Why was it what, in your opinion, was option two more effective for providers?

416
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:42,500
Because with the first option, the payments would be the same across the board for every provider and every like provider company.

417
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:50,549
And there's not as much wiggle room for like companies that maybe are more skillful or people who are more skillful to,

418
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:55,610
like, make more money in their field once they can have that job flexibility and mobility.

419
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:06,620
And so the second option allows them to kind of charge more based on skill or effectiveness of their providing of care.

420
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:11,149
Okay. So you're saying there's no scope here because it's a standardized rate in the first

421
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:17,390
option for different to charge different amounts based on the quality of care?

422
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:22,480
Right. Yeah. Or the I don't know, the specialization of the care quality is not quite the right word.

423
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:27,320
Okay. I think I am worried about costs with the second.

424
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:29,590
Well, I'm worried about costs with both options.

425
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:38,930
So when you're thinking about providers, I tend to think at the health systems level, not necessarily at the level of an individual professional.

426
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:47,360
But the worrying thing is worrying about some health systems that might already be in financial trouble,

427
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:51,330
of which cover does not really help that very much.

428
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:59,209
And so I have a project right now looking at rural health care and rural health systems, and some of them are in real trouble,

429
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:05,410
and some of them have closed down or drastically reduced services since the start of the pandemic.

430
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:07,160
There's a lot of financial problems there.

431
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:14,540
So one of the worrying things I think would be on the minds of providers is, is our health system going to survive this?

432
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:22,310
If we take some standard, like in this example, the median in-network rate for the insurers?

433
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:28,670
What does that what does that translate to in terms of the financial bottom line for health systems?

434
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:32,510
I think that's definitely an issue of concern.

435
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,500
So who didn't? Who else chose an option to.

436
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:45,700
Just a couple of groups. Well, who wants to tell me a little bit about option one and what you thought about that?

437
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:51,190
Because I had lots of people choose option one is. I want you to tell me why you picked that.

438
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:01,270
All right.

439
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:09,320
So our group chose option one as the official policy recommendation, because although it didn't accomplish every single goal that we wanted to,

440
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:15,210
we felt like it was significantly more feasible than having a neutral arbitrator for every situation.

441
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:20,370
And for the most part, it would effectively reduce costs for patients.

442
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:30,060
And it would be more likely that providers and insurers would support this bill because it would mean as much work on them than option two was.

443
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:38,400
So we felt like to get something that would effectively be passed and was somewhat reduce costs for patients, we felt like option one was best.

444
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:47,000
Yeah. Thank you. So. A lot of groups told me this, like the difference between option one and option two.

445
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:57,330
There was some questions around the. The length of time that option two would take the idea of a negotiation

446
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:01,829
potentially delaying some important things that might be important to patients.

447
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:08,010
Or I think really some of the issues in my mind are more around compliance.

448
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,690
The category actually ensure that any actors within the health system are complying with the law.

449
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:18,600
And I think you were telling me that in your experience, you didn't think they were complying.

450
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,920
Do you want to just tell us a little bit about the work you were doing?

451
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:32,640
Thanks. Yeah. So I worked with the hospital this summer in the revenue cycle department, and this was something that came up the no surprises art.

452
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:41,910
And essentially they are just not implementing it at all because it does not benefit the hospital in regard to getting cash through the door.

453
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:48,209
And also providers in the hospital system already have so much back and forth between like who's

454
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:53,040
going to cover the cost of care and like no one really wants to because it's so expensive.

455
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,350
And a lot of like the case that we were seeing to that we're at the highest cost are like

456
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:03,120
these motor vehicle accident cases or accounts and then bringing in like the car insurance.

457
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:07,500
And they also don't want to cover the cost of care. So, um, I feel like.

458
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:16,080
The incentive for this policy is in regards to the patients and they have no power in the health care system.

459
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:22,170
So like for the cost of care to be transparent, like we'd have to really reconstruct the whole system.

460
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:25,920
So people are seeing costs upfront, which just doesn't happen today.

461
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:34,110
So yeah, and I have to admit, I didn't really get into the whole they have issued a final rule, I believe.

462
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:38,040
I think there are several different rules being considered on. Exactly.

463
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:43,650
That's the regulatory action that tries to lay out exactly how this law should be implemented.

464
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:51,900
We're going to talk a bit about regulatory politics in a future class, but I didn't get into all of that because it's actually litigation going on.

465
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:56,970
And so I think it's these two interacting there.

466
01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:02,999
Yeah, I think the actual state of implementation is in question.

467
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,180
I bet there are a lot of actors like your hospital where they're like, Nope,

468
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:12,120
we don't really going to address this because what's the compliance mechanism here?

469
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:19,290
You have two different options when you're considering compliance in a case like this, compliance meaning?

470
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:23,220
Like, how can you force the actors to behave and act in accordance with the law?

471
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:30,510
You can have some kind of bureaucratic option, whereas monitoring and reporting requirements and things like that,

472
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:37,530
and that might well work for at least for publicly funded health care.

473
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:41,790
But frankly, it's not going to work because of the nature of the US healthcare system,

474
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:47,880
how fragmented it is and how data moves around and where data doesn't go, which is it's often not public.

475
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:58,040
So. One of the main compliance mechanisms here is the idea that this is establishing the ability for patients to bring this up and escalate this,

476
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:05,179
which to my mind is a huge problem because how many people have already the ability to

477
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:11,000
bargain with when they are confronted with a medical bill that's like part of the problem.

478
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:14,780
So I would want to see how is this going to be implemented?

479
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:17,840
How is compliance going to be achieved?

480
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:26,060
Really big questions that I personally did not get super involved in reading all those regulations because I think they're going to be changed.

481
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:29,030
So who else would like to share?

482
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:38,630
Who would like to tell us a little bit about how equitable, efficient or effective they thought their chosen option was?

483
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:45,110
How did you have some discussions around those values or anything else that you chose to bring in as a core value?

484
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:49,430
Oh, thank you. It's Wednesday.

485
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:53,740
I need more caffeine. Obviously, I'm not noticing everybody signed up,

486
01:09:54,550 --> 01:10:01,060
so we thought that the first one was effective because it really alleviated the whole surprise

487
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:06,520
billing part because it made sure that the patient was paying something that was expected.

488
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:13,690
Like even if it was high, it was still expected. So we evaluated the efficacy based on that aspect.

489
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:20,290
I think a lot of this revolves around the definition of what a surprise bill is like.

490
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:24,610
How do we define such a thing? Thank you. Especially to me.

491
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:29,320
Like under both of these scenarios, the patients are not expected to pay for a surprise bill.

492
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:35,350
But I think the interesting point that you brought up is if they're, um.

493
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,950
Oh, sorry. I know it's 20 past. I finish my thought, and then you guys can go.

494
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:44,080
So I think the interesting part here is how would the cost be transferred then?

495
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:50,860
If you are thinking about this as an insurer or provider and you're looking at a cost shortfall, how are you going to recoup that?

496
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:54,879
Are you going to change the way you bill for other things?

497
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:58,570
Are you going to change the way you reimburse for other things in order to try and figure that out?

498
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:04,990
So I thought the idea that this is all connected and we've created this maybe some

499
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:09,969
arbitrary distinction between a surprise bill and any other bill could be a problem.

500
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:13,720
Yeah. All right. We'll wrap it up there for now. Thank you for being patient for me.

501
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:15,580
And I'll see you all next week.
