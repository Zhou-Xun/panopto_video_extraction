1
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,740
Yeah. I need more practice on this one. Yeah, me too.

2
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,590
That's right. She?

3
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,370
It's here and there.

4
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,930
And if I want my sister here and she gets tickets to the military.

5
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:29,139
I have my mom last like two, two Christmases ago, and she bought one on QVC that was larger for like 70 bucks.

6
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:36,580
And I was like, I already gave what I wanted to pay or why they're seeing me.

7
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:41,850
That's just how she it.

8
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:52,750
That's true. So her homegirl died at home.

9
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,160
So it doesn't really bother me personally, I think.

10
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:03,040
I think I'm glad she's never had food in her house.

11
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,550
Yeah, it has this incredible day in the life, I think you.

12
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:20,540
I like make it plain and secure. Yes, I of them do.

13
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:27,540
I know I have a very old laptop with no butter on that because you're going into my concerto.

14
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:39,500
Oh, thank you for that.

15
00:02:40,290 --> 00:03:03,460
I know, Mr. Williams. You know, my best friend is like.

16
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:33,680
To be honest with you, I don't think it's more than.

17
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:49,820
Oh, yeah. Thank you. I'll say I'll do it and concentrate right now.

18
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,840
Sometimes I forget usually. And there was there was a gap of 5 minutes there.

19
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:20,360
And then I got into it again. And I still feel like it's not quite the same because I know what I'm doing, but.

20
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,410
Yeah. That.

21
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:56,960
Some leads into, Oh no, think we can do this, but it is legal.

22
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:59,430
And. We have so many things here.

23
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,140
Oh. Do.

24
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:41,879
All right, let's see where we are. So many things.

25
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,330
I have some moving parts. Ownership is like your front door.

26
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,419
You have to do with that. I'm so disappointed.

27
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,810
Intensely. Oh, I think the projectors.

28
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,740
About to take place, but we'll see what happens and hopefully a write down.

29
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,950
Okay. So we're going to review some histology today.

30
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:11,550
I was kind of hoping to have my wireless mouse because if I have the wireless mouse, I can give it to you guys.

31
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:17,720
You guys can drive this. Which would be very cool, but I must be disappointed.

32
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:23,300
But maybe we can do that for his optimism. Whatever happens is the plan.

33
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,110
All right. This is where we are here.

34
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:36,970
So today we're going to review some actual histology slides so that we'll finish our discussion of the results and the format we're going to have.

35
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,639
First, I'm going to talk just a little bit about histology,

36
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:49,420
interpretation in general and with the kind of aiming it towards the idea that you are as toxicologists or as experimental biologists

37
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,950
are most likely going to be encountering microscopy or pathology interpretation or reading a study or working with a pathologist,

38
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,020
or maybe you're scoring your own model.

39
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:07,580
So different things you need to know about good scoring systems and also some kind of pitfalls that make it hard to interpret the literature.

40
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:13,540
So a lot of the literature, there's some nomenclature, some semantics, things that make it a little bit hard.

41
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,840
So we'll talk about some of the things that can kind of trip you up a little bit.

42
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:23,080
So we'll do that first and we'll look at our slides. We have some actual slides to look at, so we get our results there.

43
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:30,610
So we'll be able to sum up the results. And then at the end, we'll just talk briefly about some statistical methods for histology,

44
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:37,630
which is much more problematic and difficult than statistical analysis of the other data that we have looked at.

45
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,390
So that's kind of the format for today. And then next week we're just going to wrap up.

46
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,790
So we're going to have some immunologic like conclusions at the end of today.

47
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,590
And next week we're going to spend time just talking a little bit mechanistically about why that happened.

48
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,330
So that will help you in your write your discussion in terms of finishing up your papers.

49
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:10,840
Okay. So next week will be the end of our kind of study related interpretation and then we still have one sort of extra class.

50
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,010
And the plan was if we kind of went over, if there was anything that spilled over, we would do it.

51
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:22,150
There I think probably will have everything on the 11th, but it's there and then we'll just do our in-class review for the quiz.

52
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:27,910
So there's like a study guide to that and it's just hitting the highlights, the stuff that will appear on the quiz that make sense.

53
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,379
Okay. And then remember that the last day of this course is the second.

54
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,440
That's when your final paper is due and there's an in-class quiz,

55
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,590
and then there's no class for 717 on the ninth so that you can concentrate on your 616 final.

56
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,090
All right. So start with this.

57
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,690
Let me just make sure. Hit my on, Jack. I do. Okey dokey.

58
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,310
So disappointed about my nose. Anyway, I'll try to get over it.

59
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,350
Okay. So pathology and interpretation and non-clinical toxicology.

60
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,610
So today, as I said, we're going to talk about his interpretation and scoring.

61
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:14,360
So basically, when you're trying to interpret microscopy, these are the basic questions that you're trying to answer.

62
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,600
So first and most simply, is there a lesion?

63
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:24,230
So essentially incidence data like how many animals show inflammation, how many animals have a tumor, whatever, whatever it is.

64
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,080
So is there a lesion is the most basic question.

65
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:35,000
But remember that these are actual animals that are complex biologic systems and a lot of complex biologic processes are occurring.

66
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:42,020
So the next question, there might be a lesion that has nothing to do with anything that we did experimentally to the animals.

67
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:47,360
So not only do you have to identify if there are lesions, but also if they're associated with the study.

68
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,900
So is there something appearing in the control animals as well that might be background disease or maybe something happened

69
00:10:53,900 --> 00:11:00,230
in the vivarium and there could be incidental background findings that may or may not be confounding for your study.

70
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:08,149
So is the lesion study associated? So you have to demonstrate that it's not something that you would commonly see, you know, as a background finding.

71
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:15,290
If you get something that's really bizarre and it's hard to biologically imagine that that could happen from treatment with your test agent.

72
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,570
You always have to consider the possibility that there is something kind of floating in the background.

73
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,070
And so then you can have lesions also that are study associated,

74
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:33,770
but not associated with your experimental compound or in the language of regulatory talks, not associated with your test article.

75
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:41,420
So these could be things that are very much related to stuff that happened in the study but are not toxicity of your compound.

76
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:47,959
So a good example of that are things like garbage injury, create a little bit of inflammation in the esophagus,

77
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,070
or maybe there's been some aspiration or there's lung lesions related to aspiration.

78
00:11:52,520 --> 00:12:01,190
Those are study related, but those are not tests particle associated in a tox path in a tax report.

79
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,630
Those things have to be mentioned. So you have to account for them in the data.

80
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:12,110
But you can state that we don't think that this is test article associated because it appeared in the controls,

81
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:16,220
because it's consistent with the large injury or whatever your justification is.

82
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:23,480
So you have to explain it and you have to come up with a plausible justification why you're calling it non test article associated.

83
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,260
And depending on how much of this is going on that may or may not confound your study, it's might be fine,

84
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,170
might be able to ignore it or it might be a real problem and you might have to repeat a study.

85
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:34,970
Okay.

86
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:43,460
And then the next thing, if you have a lesion that's non neoplastic, but is a tissue injury lesion, oftentimes you'll apply some sort of scoring.

87
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,020
We're going to talk a little bit about that today. So that's the question of how bad is the lesion.

88
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:54,470
So usually that takes the form of ordinal ranks mild, moderate, severe in the language of tox baths.

89
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,730
So that's another assessment of the data that's applied,

90
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:04,460
and that is one of the ones that is important is the most problematic to deal with from a statistics standpoint.

91
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,150
So we'll talk a little bit about that. So now we have a lesion.

92
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:16,580
We think it's test article related. We have a sense of how severe it is and then the ultimate point of a regulatory talk study.

93
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,120
So what we are doing is a little bit of a hybrid difference.

94
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:27,350
We have an efficacy arm and we have a toxin, but in a strict toxicity study like safety testing for regulatory purposes.

95
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,910
The pathologist is responsible for answering the question Is this lesion adverse?

96
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,580
So as we talked about in the very first lecture, the question of adversity,

97
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:44,330
meaning have a negative consequence for the animal is always answered in the context of the animal study.

98
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:52,550
So all you're trying to say is dosing with compound X at such and such a dose or such,

99
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,900
and such a dose regimen in rats was adverse at whatever dose level.

100
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:06,169
So you're just trying to assess in the context of the rat. And then that piece of information is used with a lot of other information to try to assess

101
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:11,960
at what level of dosing in a human might you start to expect some adverse findings?

102
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:19,070
Okay. So we're not necessarily saying that because this happened in a rat, that at this dose we're going to have the same finding in humans.

103
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:26,690
But the point of regulatory tox testing is to establish whether there adversity and what level that's poor as a dog.

104
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,920
This question seems simple, but this actually there's like whole articles and position papers written about this.

105
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,740
And there's a lot of debate, debate sometimes with adversity.

106
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:45,140
So in general, adverse consequence for a lesion means something that disrupts the normal function of the organ.

107
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:51,830
Right. So if you have areas of necrosis in an organ and it's destroying the parenchyma, like we had our lungs.

108
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,799
Regions where there's alveoli filling up with inflammatory cells that is going to

109
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,740
obstruct the normal function of a lung may not be this is not a maximum tolerated dose,

110
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:14,709
things that might not be a life threatening thing, but it's an adverse consequences for the animal compared to if I have a vaccine that is

111
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:20,320
going to cause immune stimulation and I have an increase in lymphocytes in a lymph node.

112
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:28,810
Okay. So all I have is an increased cellular T in the lymph node, one that might be expected with my compound.

113
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:36,010
So it's physiologic response to what I'm giving the compound did what I'm giving to the animal and an increase in lymphocytes.

114
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,110
That's the lymph nodes. Do lymph nodes can accommodate that increase without any adverse effect.

115
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,300
So as long as that's not accompanied by, say, an autoimmune reaction,

116
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:52,270
an increase in cellulari in a lymph node would be a test article associated finding that's not adverse.

117
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:59,500
So those are easy examples, but that is an area that frequently gets pretty gray, but it's very important.

118
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:08,680
Okay, so when reviewing microscopy in tox path, usually the other data is reviewed prior to the microscopy.

119
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:14,410
And this is both because it helps you and the state is generally finished quicker.

120
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,880
So for a toxicology pathologist, usually we have a list of body weights.

121
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:24,280
So that will might be our first clue that maybe there's something going on in lymphoid organs or liver or kidney.

122
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,569
Um, well, actually that will be organ wide. So your body and organ weights.

123
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,530
So a sense of general toxicity or of organ specific toxicity.

124
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:39,099
We have our clean path data, so we're trying to correlate clinical chemistries and hematology to kind of point as well.

125
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,860
There might be something going on in a particular organ class.

126
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:48,760
And then ideally, we also we're going to have some sense for this class of compound, whatever it is we're studying,

127
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:55,390
what are the expected effects and that can help sort of titer the level at which you're looking.

128
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:01,330
So there are compounds that could have a really subtle effect where you might actually need to count something.

129
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:10,120
So one example might be compounds that cause low level neurotoxicity where all that you're really going to see like maybe in development,

130
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,020
you're going to have a decreased density of neurons in certain areas of the brain.

131
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,319
And unless that's really obvious,

132
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:23,770
like where the animal would be having neurologic signs a decrease cellulari can often be really difficult to pick up by eye.

133
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,330
And if you're doing a general tox screen, you're usually not counting cells.

134
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:35,049
But if I know that's a potential effect of this class of compound, I'm going to build into my workflow for pathology,

135
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:39,010
evaluation, maybe some cell counts so I can assess that more precisely.

136
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:46,930
So this we run into a lot in this setting of experimental biology, and we're going to talk a little bit about blinding versus nonbinding.

137
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:54,820
But you can still have a sense of the expected effects of a class of compound and be blinded to your slides.

138
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,640
So when people talk about blind pathologists, I always tell them that doesn't mean don't tell the pathologist anything.

139
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:07,989
It's more sense. It builds to a more sensitive evaluation if you have some sense of what the expected biology is,

140
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,690
because you might have to look at a different level of intensity.

141
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,950
So even if your slides are blinded and you don't know what is control and what is experimental,

142
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:21,040
if you kind of know what you think is going to happen, that might allow you to detect things that would otherwise be missed.

143
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:31,240
And then finally at the end, you also apply to microscopy, as we did to clinical pathology, a preponderance of evidence approach.

144
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,470
So related parameters that change together are generally more believable than single parameter changes.

145
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:44,889
So if a random few small inflammatory aggregates in the liver in a couple animals and I

146
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:50,560
have no change in my clinical pathology liver enzymes and it doesn't seem dose dependent.

147
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:57,430
That could be background, but if I have an increase, a dose dependent increase in inflammatory aggregates,

148
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:04,000
even if I don't have enzymatic change, like even if it's fairly well tolerated, that might be something test article associated.

149
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,250
So again, you can kind of see how sometimes it gets a bit difficult,

150
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:12,400
but you're trying to build sort of a preponderance of evidence approach to your conclusions.

151
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:23,170
Okay, I've heard about that. All right. So to bind or not to bind the internal question, especially in our setting here in academic biology,

152
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:31,540
so a blinded microscopy read versus an unblinded read, both can be useful in different situations.

153
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:40,749
And so whether you choose a blinded read where you don't know which group is the control and which group are the dosed animals versus an unblinded

154
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:48,250
study where you would know that information depends a little bit on what type of error is more acceptable for your experimental question.

155
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:56,130
So at the beginning of the class, we talked. A lot about bias and how in especially in academic medicine, we want to reduce bias.

156
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,940
We want to be claiming things that are not true.

157
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:04,570
So blinded studies are highly favored for hypothesis driven science where you don't want to fool yourself.

158
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,770
Okay, so in hypothesis driven science, in academic medicine,

159
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:14,800
usually we kind of want to find something like it's hard to write your thesis on negative data.

160
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,900
So usually people want to find something that their phenotype, phenotype of mouse or with their treatment.

161
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:26,590
So if you know which are the controls and which are the experimental animals, remember about all the background stuff I talked about.

162
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:32,530
There's a little bit of a bias, even with the best of intentions, towards finding little things and trying to make them have meaning.

163
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,159
So when we talked about the array of guidelines,

164
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:44,830
one recommendation for hypothesis driven science is to blind the evaluator for microscopy or for whatever it is to which groups are which.

165
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,820
And by doing that, you can decrease the type one error.

166
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:56,829
So if you remember from starts, the type one error would be if you're falsely making a claim that there is a difference,

167
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:03,880
that the test population is different from the control. So you'll be falsely rejecting the null hypothesis when there's really no difference.

168
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,650
So blinded studies decrease because you don't know which is which the likelihood of you're doing that.

169
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,850
So the net effect is to decrease false positives.

170
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:22,180
So in hypothesis driven science, trying to mean unbiased, it's going to decrease false positives and that is preferred for hypothesis driven science.

171
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:29,080
Whereas think if you're in regulatory talks and you're reading microscopy for a compound that's going to go be given to humans,

172
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,890
they're I would rather error on the side of finding something that's not there if it means that it could be a toxicity.

173
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:42,550
So if I have an unrelated study, I might be biased and I might be like, Oh, well, the test animals have this little adverse effect.

174
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,740
And so it's going to decrease the risk of type two error,

175
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:55,660
which is the false claim that there is no difference when falsely accepting the null hypothesis when there really is one.

176
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:02,200
So maybe there's something really subtle that I wouldn't necessarily pick up for a reading blind it,

177
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:07,360
but I'm starting to notice that it's more in my dose group, maybe those little liver aggregates.

178
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,030
I feel like maybe there's a little bit more of those in the dose group.

179
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:19,270
So that is why the recommendation or the sort of guidance documents from toxicological pathology are that tox studies,

180
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,210
at least for a regulatory context, should be read unblinded.

181
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:27,340
So those are preferred for safety testing, and that tends to decrease the false negatives,

182
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,290
but it does increase the risk that you're going to pick up something that's not really there.

183
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:40,779
Yes, I would maybe if I've been too far ahead for this, the pathologist who's doing these as if they do,

184
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:46,380
they start with a mouse that's completely outside of either control or no.

185
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,840
Okay. So from memory of like, what does it look like?

186
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:57,520
And this is different. Yeah. So by the time I mean in regulatory talks, usually you're talking about someone who has a credential,

187
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:04,990
has some sort of board certification in pathology. So you're relying on the expertise of that person to know what is normal.

188
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:12,400
So they've taken a certifying exam, they've seen bajillion slides, they have some baseline level of what's normal.

189
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,009
That does sometimes come into play though.

190
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:25,330
So like in in regulatory talks, each institution or each company keeps records of what lesions they see background in their historical controls.

191
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:32,770
So like, you know, with different genetic lines of mice, different lines might have more or lower likelihood of certain background lesions.

192
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:40,750
And that gets really, really helpful for chronic studies where you have an unusual lesion that just by chance happens to pop up in your high dose.

193
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,780
You know, a few animals, like statistically it's higher in your high dose group in that particular study,

194
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:51,720
but maybe you don't believe you're like, I just can't understand how the biology would drive it here.

195
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:59,410
You might point to your historical controls and say, in this individual 50 miles study, it was only seen in the high dose group.

196
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:05,380
However, we know that historically in our controls we have a background level of 2% for this lesion.

197
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:11,140
So they do pull in the sort of internal historical controls or strain specific controls,

198
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:17,110
particularly if you're trying to make that decision about whether something's caused by a combat related or not.

199
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,140
But again, that's an area that gets kind of fuzzy.

200
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:30,490
So yeah, so this kind of reiterates that with hypothesis driven research, generally you need to have a higher burden of proof before you make a claim.

201
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:36,190
So your goal is to decrease type one errors. There are caveats to this as well.

202
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:42,670
So here we work in academic science. Pathology is a pretty broad diagnostic test, right?

203
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:47,260
Because you're looking at tons of organs, you're assessing tons of different processes.

204
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,390
It's far more broad than if I'm, I don't know, running a PCR or.

205
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:58,910
Immunology detect a particular protein or something. I'm just looking to see broadly what's going on from a pathobiology perspective.

206
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,170
If you don't know, if you're not using an established model and I've no idea.

207
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,580
Like, say, a new transgenic mouse, I have no idea what I'm going to find.

208
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,940
I might have a suspicion based on the gene that's being altered, but I have no idea.

209
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,950
Very often for those models,

210
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:21,560
it's better to do an and to do an unblinded read so I can closely compare a control animal to my experimental and I can pick out really subtle things.

211
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:30,530
So even in experimental biology, generally, I recommend a blinded read only if you know exactly what kind of lesions you're looking for.

212
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,210
So you have an established model like, I don't know, a colitis study.

213
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,920
So I know that there's going to be a certain degree of colitis. And my question is, you know, I gave it this compound.

214
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:45,080
Does it decrease or increase colitis? So there I'm just essentially severity for a known lesion.

215
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:50,150
But if you don't know anything that you're looking for, it's much preferable to do an unblinded read first,

216
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:54,950
identify lesions, and then you can always go back reblogged the slides.

217
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,790
And sometimes people, even if you're digitizing slides,

218
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:04,009
you can even rotate the image because pathologists get kind of scarily good at

219
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:08,540
pattern recognition to the point that you can remember if you saw the slide before.

220
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,030
So there actually, if you're doing digital slides,

221
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:15,740
you can rotate the image or they can reinvent the tissues in a block if you really want to go that far.

222
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:21,440
But you could do an unblinded read through if you think there's an increase and you want to make sure you're not doing it by bias.

223
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,400
Then you can test yourself to see if that particular lesion is truly there.

224
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,930
So that's kind of an important discussion in experimental biology.

225
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,430
You know, what is what's the scenario here? Or should we read this blinded or unblinded?

226
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:42,220
And then what do we want to do subsequent versus toxicology, as I said, where the goal is to identify toxicities.

227
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:47,930
So your preference, even if you get a false positive, that's preferable over missing toxicity,

228
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:53,510
knowing that these are compounds that are going to go to humans. So even there, that gets kind of controversial.

229
00:26:53,570 --> 00:27:01,610
Controversial, particularly if you work for something like a zero because the zero one compound to go into a human and when you do it,

230
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:06,679
you're at the end, you want to help people. So sometimes there's something that's really borderline and you might need to run a

231
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:12,830
subsequent directed study if you suspect that something might be in the background.

232
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:21,960
I actually have a consultation for a study right now that was actually done in dogs where the compound is causing pancreatic atrophy.

233
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:29,390
So the pancreas, the X components are atrophying and it's only in there are medium and high dose groups are looks totally dose dependent.

234
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:36,990
But in beagle dogs, it's kind of known that there's a background incidence with age of pancreatic exocrine atrophy.

235
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:43,040
So this may be background, but the study that they have in front of them, it looks for all the world like it's compound associated.

236
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,840
And so that is probably going to need some more directed secondary testing because

237
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,900
you don't want to assume that it's background if it really does have that effect.

238
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:58,850
So, so here's an example of some of the stuff that you can see on the right is one in first tubule.

239
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,390
This is a super high mat in a test, this one test. This would have lots of these once a minute, first tubule in a rat.

240
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,090
And this is a similar first tubule.

241
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:15,230
So in the normal segment appears to be all these are the stem cells and then they divide and these are the immature spermatozoa.

242
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,280
And then at the end, the mature sperm decides with the tails in the center.

243
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:25,370
So everything differentiates towards the middle in young rats as spermatogenesis is developing.

244
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,270
They actually have some tubules or areas of the tubule that sort of fail.

245
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:36,140
So you get disrupted spermatogenesis where the cells just kind of drop off and you lose all the dividing cells.

246
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:42,950
This is normal at low levels in young rats and often at the same age where you started toxicity studies.

247
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:48,100
If you look around, you can pick out these empty tubules, but these are dividing cells.

248
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:52,310
If you have something cytotoxic, this is also a lesion that can be compound associated.

249
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:59,470
So unless it low levels of this lesion are present, you're going to miss them unless you're counting or comparing condone control.

250
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:05,510
So that's one. Finding that in a tough study often is important and it's hard to pick out if you don't have a known control.

251
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,330
This is a cervix from a baboon.

252
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:16,220
This is from a study I did many years ago, which was looking at a particular agent that was supposed to cause inflammation in the cervix.

253
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,450
This was a model for chlamydia losses, which is a bacterial infection in humans.

254
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:24,050
So the lesion we were thinking we were going to see was inflammation in the cervix.

255
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,530
But these are baboons. These are complex animals.

256
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,660
You can't keep them in a germ free cage.

257
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:36,389
And I was totally blinded because this experimental science and I was sitting reading slides with the investigator and I'm like, oh,

258
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:42,170
we have this look at all this inflammation here in the cervix thinking he'd be like excited because that was establishing the model,

259
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:45,650
thinking what he found was getting quieter and quieter and more and more aggravated looking.

260
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,310
I'm like, Why aren't you happy? It's like, This is the control.

261
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:59,020
I was blinded. I didn't know. Which side I was looking at. It turns out that these animals actually had background infection with a papilloma virus,

262
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:03,390
a cervical papilloma virus that actually had not been described in a baboon four.

263
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,550
So I couldn't even screen the animals for it because it had not been described.

264
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:14,229
So that was a confounder which kind of sucked for that study, although we did write a paper about this new discovered cervical papilloma.

265
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:22,330
So we we made up for it. But that's an example of a confounding lesion that you would only know because this was present in controls as well.

266
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,010
Okay. Problems in interpretation.

267
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:38,380
So another issue that drives non pathologists crazy is the fact that pathologists use the same use different words for the same lesion all the time.

268
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,280
And this is particularly true in the academic literature.

269
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,490
So in the tops world, like if you work in a S.R.O.,

270
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,990
there's a standardized non-nuclear chair and you have you're forced really to use the same nomenclature.

271
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:55,840
But if you're researching background material for your Ph.D. and it includes a pathologic lesion,

272
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:01,720
you're going to go a little bit crazy because different words will appear in the literature for essentially the same thing.

273
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,090
So this is liver. This is a small aggregate of macrophages.

274
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,810
So this is a clean up response in an area where there's actually been some hepatic necrosis.

275
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,550
These are actually little necrotic parasites here and there's even a little bit of acute inflammation in it,

276
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,590
sort of a mixed inflammatory aggregate in older mice as mice age.

277
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:26,410
You see this tiny little things all the time in the liver and it increases in incidence with age.

278
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,350
Sometimes you can see them in young mice as well.

279
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:34,290
You see them in mice that have GI inflammation because it's based on stuff coming up through the portal tracks.

280
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:42,190
Unfortunately, it also is something that you can see with drug accumulation in hepatocytes where there's been hepatocyte damage due to drug,

281
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:47,379
all those terms there. Those are all terms that have been used to describe this lesion.

282
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:52,030
Like the pathologist reads, any of those, you'll immediately get a mental image of this.

283
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:57,700
Why we can't all sit together and agree on a single term. I guess they like driving other people crazy.

284
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,660
I don't know. But this is the same lesion, different names.

285
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:09,550
So if you're using background literature to support your animal model and you're seeing these weird discrepancies,

286
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,749
it's worth it kind of reaching out and talking to somebody with a little bit of background in

287
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:18,310
the model to find out if some if all these papers are kind of referring to the same thing,

288
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,810
if there is degrees of them that it's trying to speak to separate out.

289
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,580
But it's always better rather than thinking that there's six different things that can go

290
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:32,440
on with the same disease to understand where the nomenclature is just tripping you up.

291
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:38,350
And that is particularly the case in the academic literature, which is why in your methods,

292
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:43,330
it's often it's really prefer to specify what kind of jaw you're using.

293
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,760
And then, as I said, this can sometimes be a background finding.

294
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:53,830
So another decision that has to be made as a pathologist or if you're doing an experimental study.

295
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:58,629
What's my threshold? Like, I know this happens in mice ordinarily.

296
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:04,360
And if I called this, if I saw one of these in the entire liver of a mouse, I probably would call it normal.

297
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,500
I wouldn't say anything.

298
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:13,870
But there might be instances like if I'm blinded and there's a low level increase of this and I'm not calling that, I might totally miss the lesion.

299
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:18,490
So you have to decide what is my threshold going to be? Am I going to count focal small lesions?

300
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:22,450
Am I going to read everything which is going to give me some very noisy data?

301
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:26,740
But those are decisions that have to be made based on that particular context.

302
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:33,870
For nomenclature. There are some standardized nomenclature systems, particularly in the talkSPORT world.

303
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:40,710
There's been a huge effort towards standardization. So I've talked before about the in-hand effort, which is the international harmonization effort.

304
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,020
And for regulatory talks, you're now required to use this nomenclature.

305
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,300
This is the TouchPad, loves acronyms. Never met an acronym they didn't like.

306
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:57,710
So send is the data format that's required for submitting animal data to the FDA.

307
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:05,380
Now for an investigational new drug submission and send format requires you to use in-hand.

308
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,900
So if you see people throwing those terms around, you'll be in the know what they're saying.

309
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:16,020
The NCP being the NCP, has its own noninfectious system, which has a lot of parallels.

310
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:22,050
But the anti, if you're using that, would say to using A.P. criteria, people would know what that is.

311
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:27,450
And then the World Health Organization actually has diagnostic criteria for rodent tumors.

312
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:32,700
So if I'm writing an academic paper, a lot of times I will use one of these systems.

313
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:39,360
And I'll say in my methods, these are the criteria that I use. So everybody knows what kind of creature I'm going to be utilizing.

314
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:47,160
This is just the anatomy page. So at minimum, you want to define in your methods, your diagnostic criteria and the nomenclature.

315
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:50,550
And that could be based on standardized things like I talked about.

316
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,919
It could be based on your previous papers.

317
00:34:52,920 --> 00:35:00,750
Maybe you established an animal model in your lab and you have your own diagnostic criteria, or there's literature existing for a particular model.

318
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,590
Or maybe this is the paper where you are defining your new criteria,

319
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:10,740
and then you have to be very specific in your methods about what you're using to define lesions.

320
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:19,890
And finally, especially in animal models, a lot of people will in human pathology, we have certain diagnostic criteria for pathologic lesions,

321
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:26,340
and a lot of people will attempt to use those and apply those to mice or to whatever their animal models.

322
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,610
That can be quite problematic, as we learned this morning.

323
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:35,280
There are even some anatomic features that are quite different between rodents and humans, like in the structure of the lung.

324
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:42,209
So you always have to be careful that you're not forcing, you know, a square peg into a round hole too much when you do this.

325
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:47,550
And you might have to define specific variations that are murine related when you do that.

326
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:51,840
A lot of people get into trouble when they do that, but it is sometimes necessary.

327
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,990
So if you're reading slides, you're a human being. You're not a robot for the most part.

328
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:05,400
So you want to also strive for consistency because it can be tiring and it can be hard to be consistent if you're reading large studies.

329
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,410
So in the diagnostic criteria, there can be overlap between criteria.

330
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:16,230
So the criteria that define something that's just hyperplastic versus a benign tumor have some overlap.

331
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:20,790
So we want to try to make sure you're following your guidelines of being as consistent as possible.

332
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:25,980
And with lesion severity, this is probably the most common kind of lack of consistency.

333
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:33,150
Actually, people have done studies. If you're reading large numbers of slides and you're trying to assess, even if you were to find it very precisely,

334
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:37,680
if it's mild, moderate, severe, you're influenced by the five slides you've just read.

335
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:43,340
So if you're reading, I don't know, five slides that are mild and then you have one that's severe,

336
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,919
usually I'll jump to severe, but then the next slide that you read,

337
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:54,329
you'll tend to make that more severe anyway because so you might have all mild lesions, one severe one, and then more mild,

338
00:36:54,330 --> 00:37:00,330
but you're more inclined to call that last one more severe because you've just got, wow, look at this, this is terrible.

339
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:07,650
So that's just human nature. And depending on the degree of sensitivity that you need or the degree of, you know,

340
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,780
the degree of confidence you have in your scoring system that may or may not matter,

341
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:17,910
because overall, you're really kind of looking okay, is this in general worse in the high dose methods?

342
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:25,860
But a lot of times, like I'll go back through and just scan quickly at the end to make sure that I was relatively consistent across all my slides.

343
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:32,940
But that's an area where there's going to be inter observer variation and even intra observer variation.

344
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:40,380
Because I read the same study six months from now, I'm probably not going to be exactly the same for all the slides on how I classify them.

345
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:48,000
But you're hoping that the general trend is going to be the same diagnostic threshold for background lesions we already talked about.

346
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,370
And then another feature of consistency is to define and justify if you're going to group terms.

347
00:37:54,360 --> 00:38:01,649
So here is an example of a liver study where we had a pick button when I grabbed the screenshot,

348
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:05,160
look how boring the data is and pick something that had better findings.

349
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:12,930
But in this study we had some neoplastic lesions and we had some non neoplastic proliferative lesions.

350
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,960
So there are two different types of hypoplasia that we were seeing.

351
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,510
And then when we did our stats, we have like six things here, but some of them kind of go together.

352
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:26,790
Like we know that there is a little bit of blurry line between a benign and a malignant.

353
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,680
TUMA So the decisions that we had to make, are we just going to assess the incidence of all neoplasia?

354
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:37,720
And we also know that foci of of or alteration are considered pre neoplastic.

355
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,530
So another choice would be to assess these as one finding.

356
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:45,040
So maybe I don't have the sensitivity if I'm just looking at this.

357
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:49,570
But what's important to me, if I want to know if something's pro neoplastic.

358
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,140
This is really the category that's of most importance to me.

359
00:38:55,060 --> 00:39:02,350
Okay. Looking at severity scoring systems, it's kind of astounding how little actual literature there is,

360
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:08,470
particularly in academia, and people make up scoring systems based on really nothing.

361
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:15,740
But there is some work, at least in the comparative pathology world now on what a scoring system should feature.

362
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:22,030
So this is a really nice kind of a best practices paper on how to develop a histology scoring system.

363
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,290
So the three main things that should have are definable lesion criteria.

364
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:29,500
So we already talked about there can be systems in the literature,

365
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:34,960
but you have to have some method of defining what you're calling hyperplasia or what you're calling an adenoma.

366
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,770
So define your own system or define the system that you're using.

367
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:45,880
It has to have a fair degree of reproducibility between different people and also with yourself over time.

368
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:51,489
And so to validate a scoring system, you want to assess how reproducible is it like?

369
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:59,559
Is it described so amorphous and loosey goosey that every time I do it I get vastly different answers and there's different ways of assessing.

370
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:06,340
Enter observer reproducibility, for example, one common one for incidence data is just Kappa scoring.

371
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,219
So here is just for human diagnostic path.

372
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:15,040
There's Observer A and B, and they're trying to assess how often they agree on what's at carcinoma versus adenoma.

373
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:23,470
So an observer, if they had perfect congruence when observer a called something a carcinoma observer B would call it that as well.

374
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:27,700
But as it turns out, some percentage of the time they were discrepant.

375
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:31,660
And so you can calculate what percentage of the time they are consistent with one another.

376
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:35,020
And so that's a way of assessing your scoring system between observers.

377
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,920
And there are a couple of other different measures of assessing reproducibility.

378
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:44,890
And then finally, that's great. If you have lesion criteria that work, it's reproducible.

379
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:51,070
But if it doesn't pertain to actual biologic disease, then it's really not useful as a severity scoring system.

380
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:55,610
And this is the part that is actually most frequently skipped in academic science.

381
00:40:55,630 --> 00:41:01,890
Very, very few people do this with a scoring system. So you have to find some other measure of disease severity.

382
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,320
Could it be body weight? Could it be survival curves?

383
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:10,250
Could it be something and show that your scoring system gets worse?

384
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:15,040
The more severe scores correspond to the greater independent marker severity.

385
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,469
So this was just made up in numbers.

386
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:23,590
But they're trying to say if you look at your scoring system versus body weight or something or whatever their severity marker is,

387
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:28,540
it should have a correlation. And very few people actually formally do that.

388
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:39,340
Yes, it depends on the size of the study. Sorry, but I'm just wondering how many observers are usually like per sample, like 20 groups or 20 samples?

389
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,800
How many observers that we have in that team?

390
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:48,070
Yeah, the vast majority, certainly in academia, the vast majority pathology studies are read by one pathologists,

391
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:57,310
either in regulatory talks, though, the pathology reports that go for an indie have to undergo peer review.

392
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,630
So in regulatory Toxie, if the primary pathologist reads the study, gives their report,

393
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:07,780
and then that whole report or the pathology portion actually first goes for peer review with another pathologist.

394
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:13,270
A lot of times those are even from outside the company, like you get called to do peer review for another study.

395
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:19,870
So there is some consensus in regulatory talks, in academic toxicology.

396
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:30,220
Very rare that that happens. So but what you should be doing is trying to I mean, like any other aspect of science, build the case,

397
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:37,390
build enough evidence and give enough detail in your methods that somebody else reading it who is a pathologist or who has some knowledge of it,

398
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:44,800
can sort of see that you've found all the trouble spots and you're robustly backing up your data and all the trouble spots.

399
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:49,540
And then beyond that, it's just reproducibility like any other area of experimental science.

400
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:56,890
But yeah, there's just there's just not enough people that it would take to like, do double reads or something for every single study.

401
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:06,740
Okay. So this was our study. So this is the severity scoring in our study.

402
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,190
And this is actually in your study protocol.

403
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:16,760
So your study protocol on campus, I know it's gone through several incarnations, is now the full protocol.

404
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:22,750
So all the secret information is now in it, including what we did for stars.

405
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:30,590
There's actually p values at the end of the protocol thing, at the end of the study protocol where we have that stat section.

406
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:34,640
There are p values in there, so you could use those like in your finger legends and things.

407
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,720
So the study protocol should be done now. And this is in the histo section.

408
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:44,900
This is a very generic scoring system because like I said, we're looking at a lot of different lesions.

409
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:48,590
So we're trying to find something that's applicable to a lot of types of lesions.

410
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,060
And even here, you know, even though there's a lot of a fair amount of detail here,

411
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:58,280
you can imagine already by looking at it like you have to kind of assess by eye

412
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,900
if something increases or decreases by 10 to 25% versus the next category.

413
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,799
So there's going to be some gray zone. So that can be problematic.

414
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,700
But at least there's some sort of marker of what you're calling mild, moderate or severe.

415
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:16,340
And then the other thing to notice is that it's not I mean, not that our eye can really be that symmetric.

416
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:24,290
It's not necessarily symmetric. So the most severe lesion is basically saying that it's affected by greater than 50% of normal.

417
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:31,910
So you could there are some crazy scoring systems where they try to make ten scoring categories by 10% increments every time,

418
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,470
which I think it's kind of ridiculous. One, because your eye has a really hard time doing it.

419
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:45,980
And by the time 50% of the tissue is affected, in most cases, the tissue from a biologic standpoint is pretty adversely affected.

420
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:55,460
So it's even rare that you would have, you know, an animal that's going to survive so that 90% of its tissue is going to be affected.

421
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,390
So once you get past 50%, you get sort of diminishing return.

422
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:04,970
And the severity, like the incremental severity, is not linearly increasing at that point.

423
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:11,090
And that differs a little bit organ by organ, but this is just kind of a generic, commonly used scoring system.

424
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:16,620
Okay. I'm kind of busy. Yeah, okay.

425
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,920
So this was the tissue list for this study. So we on our protocol, we had all these different things.

426
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:27,770
We're not going to look at all these tissues for a couple of reasons. One, how have all these tissues for the study?

427
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,420
Because the set of data that I was given for this actually just had microscopically.

428
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:37,940
It just had long. I have some ringer slides in here, though, from other studies to kind of show examples.

429
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:44,900
And just for the sake of time. So when I'm reading slides looking for the average, usually if I'm reading through slides,

430
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:50,120
if I'm going kind of slow is like ten slides an hour and that's what severity scoring.

431
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:55,370
And then if people are reading top studies where most things are negative, it's like 20 to 30 slides an hour.

432
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:58,790
So and that's for a trained observer going relatively fast.

433
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:03,560
If we were to try to read through all these things and we have two treats, this would be the entire class.

434
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:08,450
So we're not going to do that. We're going to concentrate on the things that are most likely to be of importance.

435
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,680
So we're going to do one.

436
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:15,320
We're going to do the injection site because remember, this is an intramuscular injection and I'm going to do some lymphoid stuff.

437
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,050
Okay, it's 216.

438
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,710
Let's do this. And then we'll take a very short bio break.

439
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:28,180
When I pull up the slide, his design. Okay.

440
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,670
So I think we're going to do first is look at the immunization sites.

441
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:39,890
So if you remember what happens at the immunization site, this was delivery of an antigen via a needle into the muscle.

442
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:46,040
And so the first responding cells, those are the ones that we said had to wake up first.

443
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:51,920
So we have innate immune cells like macrophages mast cells at the site of infection that

444
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,290
are going to start reacting to the if there's any damage in the in the host tissue.

445
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:59,960
And they're going to start reacting to the foreign material present.

446
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,459
And then we also are going to have dendritic cells that are pharmaceutically active,

447
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:11,450
that are professional antigen presenting cells, and they're going to grab onto some antigen and then bring that antigen.

448
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:16,340
So local innate immune response, which is local inflammation,

449
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:25,070
and sometimes we have things like adjuvant in there that actually induce their local irritant and pull more innate immune cells.

450
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:30,830
And we have alum aluminum as our adjuvant in this preparation and then the dridex cells are going

451
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:36,170
to bring that antigen to the draining lymph node to get our our adaptive immune system involved.

452
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:41,450
Okay. So I'm going to pull up some slides and wants to jump out real quick and take a quick style break.

453
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:53,260
Yeah. How about we just.

454
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:59,080
Every did. Kind of like.

455
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:15,000
Sorry. People who were in first place.

456
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:33,510
All right. So that was a warning to you, that sort of at the top, the other, because to me, it's like my mouth so much better.

457
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:37,090
This is really choppy oxygen today.

458
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:43,740
So when you feel. Yeah.

459
00:48:45,760 --> 00:49:08,070
Is that because it's a fear? All right.

460
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:21,050
Yeah. You know.

461
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:43,890
My. Hey, Mom.

462
00:49:54,110 --> 00:50:14,160
Yeah. Okay.

463
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:34,290
This is a cheater slide. This is a tissue from a dog, actually, because it's what I had as an injection site.

464
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:41,970
This is actually a diagnostic case. This is a dog with a lump that appeared at the site of a vaccination like a week or so later.

465
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,980
So that's what this biopsy is.

466
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:52,260
It's a cheater slide because it's actually the subcutaneous it's not actually quite in the muscle, but it's a good example of that because you.

467
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:05,640
The later.

468
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:11,850
Okay. All right.

469
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:17,210
I'm sorry. I'm going to go ahead and go on. So this is an and this is the cheater slide.

470
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:21,479
This is an injection site. This is kind of a big tissue.

471
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:27,150
And this is actually a tissue from a dog. So I'll have this from the rat. And so this is an this is an immunization site in a dog.

472
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:35,100
This was a dog I presented with a lump kind of at the site of a vaccine, probably already know what it is.

473
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:40,440
But this is just an example so that I had another way of saying this is actually in the subacute.

474
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,820
So this is. This is skin at the top.

475
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:47,610
It's actually hair and skin. There's some hair follicles up here.

476
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:53,900
And then in dogs, they have a ton of adipose tissue and there's some cutest things, like a dog skin is very mobile.

477
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:58,240
They have a lot of subcutaneous area and most vaccines in dogs are given subcutaneously.

478
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:05,310
So this is actually hitting the subcutaneous I don't have an example of an intramuscular one like our rats, but it's a very similar appearance.

479
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:14,100
Okay. So in our big picture, like the most this is a big section of skin and it's mostly concentrated on the nodules.

480
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:19,950
So this is what this kind of darker consolidated area in the middle would have felt like a nodule in this animal skin,

481
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,680
and then this would have felt like more normal tissue.

482
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:29,550
So the normal subcutaneous is mostly adipose tissue, like those vascular things that you see at the edge.

483
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:36,880
So just to kind of give you a sense of how many looks like. I missed my mouth so much.

484
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:42,030
This is just a good example of it's all different than mouse, but there's very prominent.

485
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,250
These are cutting across. These are follicles, hair follicles here.

486
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:47,290
So squamous epithelium at the top,

487
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:55,630
the red stuff in the background are dense collagen fibers and then there's fat underneath it and then there's hair follicles within the dermis.

488
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,120
But then as we get to the middle,

489
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:05,380
we start to see an area where the dermis has become consolidated if we want to use the word like we learned this morning.

490
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,860
And at low magnification, there are areas of darker blue.

491
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:16,030
So we're getting the sense that there's some cellular aggregates and then there are areas where it's lower secularity.

492
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:24,290
So to give you a sense of what things should look like. Analysis is much better.

493
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,120
Okay. These dense pink things are collagen bundles.

494
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:32,090
There's a little art of factual separation because it dries during processing.

495
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,420
These are a whole bunch of collagen bundles in the superficial skin.

496
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:39,890
This is an inflammatory infiltrate, and we'll get that in a minute.

497
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:50,510
And now the collagen bundles are kind of breaking up. And we have in between those collagen bundles, we're getting fluid accumulation.

498
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,920
But the fluid is not like that pink stuff really that we saw on the lawn.

499
00:53:56,540 --> 00:54:00,800
See if I can find out. Really, there was an Eric Weiner that had like all three things I want to show you.

500
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:04,640
But there's fluid that's kind of this grayish, amorphous color.

501
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:14,940
See. I can find it again. Maybe here.

502
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:20,910
Okay. So if we were going big picture too small.

503
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:31,169
If we look at the little thumbnail to get a sense of our big picture, we have a section of skin with a large area of consolidation in the subcu.

504
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:34,620
This would be in the muscle in our experimental animals.

505
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:38,580
And in that area of consolidation, we have a number of things happening.

506
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:44,250
Right. So what's an obvious thing that we have happening for these things?

507
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:48,570
Inflammation. So we have different kinds of inflammatory cells.

508
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:53,400
We have a loss of collagen fibers, we have a couple kind of hanging on.

509
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,200
And then we have this accumulation of gray stuff that we're going to talk about in a minute.

510
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:08,800
But let's look at the inflammatory cells. Okay.

511
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:13,060
This is actually a little area there used to be called in fibers here.

512
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,800
But this little aggregate, there probably was an area of necrosis here of the collagen.

513
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:24,490
So here's a nice little aggregate. And then as far as the different types of inflammatory cells we see.

514
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,720
Drive an area where it's very, very clear.

515
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:39,320
Oh, here's good. So we have some cells like these with a whole lot of cytoplasm.

516
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:43,070
We get the sense the cytoplasm is kind of bubbly. So they're giants.

517
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,120
They're huge. And then here's another version of that cell that's a little bit smaller.

518
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:53,700
Another version. And here's one that has a little bit big stuff in its cytoplasm.

519
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:57,570
What kind of cells do you think those are? The cells.

520
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:01,850
That's actually an excellent guess. There are enough cells in here.

521
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:04,980
I'll try to find them for you. Those aren't them. But that's an excellent.

522
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:09,750
Usually in a mass cell, in a species that has visible mass cells.

523
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:15,860
If they're granulated, you'll actually see little speckles around the cells themselves.

524
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:20,390
And they're actually already granulated myself in here. I'll try to find them in a minute, but that's not what those are.

525
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:27,300
These are a common cell type that we've talked about before that are phagocytic, reactive macrophages.

526
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:35,060
They are macrophages. And these guys are like overachieving macrophages that have gobbled up a lot of this amorphous, gray stuff in the background.

527
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,870
So they're phagocytosis, debris and that gray stuff.

528
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:45,620
And then what about these guys that look just like naked nuclei?

529
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:50,000
They actually have a little rim of cytoplasm around them, but they look just like nuclei.

530
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:57,500
What kind of cells are those? What are their choices of cells that we know from them?

531
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:02,540
There is neutrophils. What's the difference between a neutrophil and I want to say fragmenting nuclei.

532
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:05,809
Yes. And this is as high as this side will go.

533
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:07,930
But a lot of these nuclei mostly look like you.

534
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:17,510
They look like single round balls or like multiple segmented like multiple segments and any other votes.

535
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:22,370
So I'm drawn. I know why they do look like that. Because this looks like a multiple segmented, doesn't it?

536
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:26,510
Mm hmm. These are actually lymphocytes.

537
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,130
And so some of the clues, one clue that can help you.

538
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:35,900
I'll try to find a good neutrophil later so that you can in a minute so you can see it on a red cell here.

539
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,310
Lymphocytes are a little bit bigger than a red cell.

540
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:49,940
So if the nucleus of a lymphocyte is about the size of a red cell here, this might hope to find a good neutrophil.

541
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:59,300
Those are. Not as many neutrophils present neutrophils once they enter the tissue.

542
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:06,490
Very quickly, did granulation kind of shrink up? And so in a chronic lesion like this, there's not going to be many neutrophils.

543
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:14,050
And the ones that are in tissue are very have a very tight nucleus, a sort of condensed nucleus.

544
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:21,550
See if I can find any. A lymphocyte has a nucleus that's approximately the same size as a red blood cell.

545
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,840
So what's looking like a segmented nucleus?

546
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:30,100
There are actually overlapping nuclei of adjacent lymphocytes.

547
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:33,670
This is going to be like ridiculously hard to see.

548
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:37,749
This is not a eosinophil. So this is a cell looks very much like a neutrophil.

549
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:42,070
It actually was. So these are lymphocytes. This is the size of the nucleus of a lymphocyte.

550
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:51,370
This is a neutrophil and or eosinophilia and has a segment, a nucleus and very, very synovial like granules.

551
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:56,350
This lesion doesn't have as many neutrophils because it's a more chronic lesion.

552
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:05,500
So most of the cells that are that kind of very uniform blue, if I can think of another way to explain it,

553
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:14,680
that very uniform blue that I can even see at this level and where the nuclei themselves don't look degenerate in any way.

554
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:19,440
They're just round circles and you can even see in a clear line here.

555
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:23,050
So they're not really condensed. They're have like a lighter appearance in the middle.

556
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:27,200
Those are a non that's not a condensed nucleus in any way. It's just a regular nucleus.

557
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:31,690
These are lymphocytes. So this is a very intense lymphocytic infiltrate.

558
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:38,110
Yes. So these little pink dots that I'm seeing in the models of the lymphocytes.

559
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:43,870
What's going on? Oh, like this? Yeah. So a react.

560
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:50,680
So let's see how they explain. So a reactive lymphocyte is going to have really prominent nuclei and then the clear

561
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:55,570
like the areas that are sort of ribosome assembly areas in the nucleus itself.

562
00:59:56,320 --> 01:00:04,510
So these are granules that are in the nucleus itself and most likely they contain a little bit pinker looking, I guess you'd say.

563
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:10,599
So mostly what you're seeing is that the nuclear material itself is kind of hetero chromatic.

564
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:15,430
There are areas that are light and dark staining and that's picking up as this sort of speckling.

565
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:22,130
So is the nucleus like as big as the lymphocyte itself? They have a very thin rim of cytoplasm.

566
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:29,469
Okay. So at the at the level of resolution that we can see of light microscopy, they look just like that.

567
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:30,850
Looking like a nucleus. Yeah.

568
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:38,140
If we were to look at em, we'd see that there actually is cytoplasm present and some of that speckling is probably the overlaid cytoplasm.

569
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:42,070
But at light microscopy, we can't really see any cytoplasm.

570
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,650
It doesn't mean it's not there, but that's what we see.

571
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:49,870
And then the other cells that are present here, it's a little bit harder to recognize if you go to the edge.

572
01:00:52,350 --> 01:01:00,150
Nice. So here's a whole bunch of lymphocytes. Low magnification.

573
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:21,670
Well, here's some really good eosinophils. This is a eosinophilic, rich area which lets you see a little bit better the segmented nuclei.

574
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:29,250
What I'm looking for are plasma cells, which I might have here, but this is going to be hard to tell the difference.

575
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:31,890
This is not necessarily something I would expect you to notice.

576
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:38,190
These cells are kind of a hybrid between those macrophages and the naked nucleus of the lymphocytes.

577
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:43,860
They have a very they don't have as granular a cytoplasm, but they have a very pink area next to the nucleus.

578
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:48,630
These are differentiated sites. These are plasma cells.

579
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:56,220
These are the cells that make immunoglobulin. And the pink thing is actually an expansion of their endoplasmic reticulum.

580
01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:02,640
So remember, we make protein in the plastic reticulum and those cells are churning out antibody as fast as they can.

581
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:07,199
So they are actually building globulin in their endoplasmic reticulum.

582
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:12,629
So it's showing up as brighter. Later, I'm going to show you a lymph node that actually goes one step further.

583
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:17,340
And sometimes they make so much antibody that they have pink globules in their cytoplasm.

584
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:22,530
And that's like a that's called a mock cell, but it's basically a plasma, a differentiated lymphocyte, a plasma cell.

585
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:30,360
So this slide has a consolidated area in the middle of the subacute ES and in the muscle.

586
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:40,350
And the area of consolidation consists of large infiltrating aggregates of lymphocytes and plasma cells.

587
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:45,389
So we have an immune response and an activated one because we have plasma cells there

588
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:49,620
implying that there's been some production of some stimulation to produce antibody.

589
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:53,760
And then we also have some tissue destruction and we have macrophages present.

590
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:59,430
Okay, they're cleaning up the mess. Now, the million dollar question is, what is that gray stuff?

591
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:05,070
So I'm trying to zoom in on it. I'm kind of glossing over.

592
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:12,120
But there's also some areas where there's some fibrosis. But what do you think the gray stuff is in the immunization site?

593
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:15,299
And I'll tell you the reason, the macrophages wear a mask.

594
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:23,940
So I don't want to show you what the reason the map macrophages are so fantastically active is they're eating up all that gray stuff.

595
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:31,500
Remember what we said? Recruited inflammatory cells to a lot of times in a vaccine.

596
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:37,010
What's the thing that you adjuvant all that gray stuff?

597
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:41,550
A lot of animal vaccines have adjuvants that we sometimes don't use in humans.

598
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:48,480
And this is an alum adjuvant in vaccine. This is a whole killed virus vaccine with an alum adjuvant.

599
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:52,080
And this is basically what the aluminum adjuvant looks like.

600
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:55,500
And so all the information is kind of centered around that.

601
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:04,710
And as it's eating up or reacting to that adjuvant, it's also taking in the antigen that was brought in in that vaccine.

602
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:12,209
So all the draining dendritic cells from this site are going to go to the draining lymph node and they're going to present lots of debris and stuff,

603
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:14,730
but they're also going to present antigen from the vaccine.

604
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:21,480
So you're just getting a lot of responding, antigen presenting cells by inducing this robust inflammatory response.

605
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:27,330
This is going to clean up eventually. So this will go away. If they hadn't taken this biopsy, this would have been gone in a week or so.

606
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:35,760
This is more robust than most human vaccines will tolerate, but even this is probably pretty small in relative to the whole animal.

607
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:39,330
So this is an immune injection site reaction in a dog.

608
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:44,309
Yes. But imagine again. Again. So again, would you mind zooming in again?

609
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:48,240
Oh, sorry. That's a bit the play on this.

610
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:52,820
There's a certain type of cell, but I'm curious if you could tell me something.

611
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:56,489
No, I shouldn't have zoomed out. They're everywhere.

612
01:04:56,490 --> 01:05:01,880
It's just these, like, really or something you're not doing.

613
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:07,800
They're kind of there. All right, so just the. Just the hot pink cells with nothing.

614
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:16,680
No, those have things in them. Like maybe further down to the right now, more to the right up this way.

615
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:22,049
But now you can go up a little bit this way. Now the other way is the little pink.

616
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:27,959
So right there, this, now it's like this.

617
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:31,740
So here it looks like it has nothing in it. Yes. Yes. That's another red cell.

618
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:35,490
Oh, okay. That's from a red blood cell because they have no nuclei. Yeah.

619
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:39,660
So, I mean, there's so much damage here. A little capillaries are going to be breaking up and everything.

620
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:44,760
So there's probably five cells stuck in here or it's just like a consolidated fragment of collagen.

621
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:49,200
Okay, cool. And then where does that where does the adjuvant go?

622
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:54,570
It goes in the macrophages. Where does that go? The macrophages eventually going to die.

623
01:05:54,750 --> 01:06:04,430
So macrophages, so they can either break it down if it's something that they can break down inside their lysosome lysozyme so they can break it down.

624
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:08,160
So it's pretty much undetectable macrophages, too,

625
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:16,919
can get drained in the in the draining lymph nodes so they can go to whatever the draining lymph node is for this front.

626
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:26,159
So if I look in a lymph node downstream from a site like this in the lymphoid sinuses, a lot of times I'll see macrophages,

627
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:31,710
I'll see neutrophils, if there are a lot of neutrophils in here, but they're bringing whatever's from the periphery to the lymph node.

628
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:38,010
Those substances can just get broken down within macrophages in the lymph node.

629
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:45,330
If macrophages enter the blood downstream, they can end up in the spleen because the spleen filters all the blood.

630
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:51,180
And in the spleen, the red pop of the spleen is building out, filtering out particulate material.

631
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:57,720
So if there's like macrophages that are ruptured or free particulate material that can accumulate in macrophages in the spleen,

632
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:02,520
but most likely over time, it's just going to get broken down for this type of adjuvant.

633
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,810
It's just going to get broken down into it's like elemental particles in macrophages.

634
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:11,930
And you won't be able to see it visibly anymore. Well, will it? Aluminum can't really break down, right.

635
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:16,499
Like it's going to do. It's just going to get broken down to its elemental particles.

636
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:24,330
So it's not going to be like an aggregate anymore. So I can't see like a molecule of aluminum in histology is way too small.

637
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:29,280
So we'll just be like below the visible amount of aluminum.

638
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:40,440
So certain adjuvants and certain metals that accumulate in tissue if they accumulate over time, can be harmful.

639
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:50,490
Other elements over time, metal can get eliminated, you know, kidneys, renal tubules or via the biliary excretion.

640
01:07:50,760 --> 01:08:00,560
So some certain amount like if you dosed animals with minerals, you can detect in feces or in urine the like if you do that.

641
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,140
A spec or something, you can detect an elevated level of whatever the mineral is.

642
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:09,629
So it's just part of the, I don't know, kind of trafficking patterns of the body.

643
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:16,890
That stuff that gets broken down for macrophages can end up either in the blood to be eliminated through the kidney,

644
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:19,410
or if it's in the liver, it can get excreted in the bile.

645
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:24,600
But you would need a significant amount remaining in the tissues and it would need to be significantly

646
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:31,230
irritating to the body and accumulating in certain organs to have pathology associated with it.

647
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:42,780
It's probably a long winded answer, but yeah, so this is adjuvant and so that was inducing an inflammatory response.

648
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:49,049
So this is an injection site reaction and fundamentally so this is an inflammatory response.

649
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:52,890
Fundamentally, it's a macrophage heavy inflammatory response.

650
01:08:52,890 --> 01:09:00,780
And then the lymphocytes are indicative that there's immune stimulation as far as describing this from a pathology standpoint,

651
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,830
because it's macrophage dominant,

652
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:14,639
we use the word granular evidence, which we learned at the beginning of our kind of our general pathology inflammatory discussion.

653
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:24,299
So it's macrophage dominant inflammation. So often it's called granulomas inflammation, particularly if there is a lot of foreign material.

654
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:28,770
President So you're trying to indicate that the macrophages are attempting to remove that foreign material.

655
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,309
So this is a similar slide from the quadriceps of a rat.

656
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:37,350
So this is a muscle section, but the same kind of separation and accumulation of adjuvant in muscle.

657
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:44,459
This is from a vaccine development seminar that was given by the S t and they're illustrating

658
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:49,290
how this type of inflammatory aggravate is very localized to the site of injection.

659
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:52,920
So in a rodent study, you often have to take serial sections.

660
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:58,980
So these are serial sections of the same muscle and that one has basically nothing, some kind of part of actual fragmentation.

661
01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:06,180
But there's quite a bit of accumulation in these. So they're going to grade or assess the degree of severity of local change.

662
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:13,020
And this would be considered this would be considered an adverse change because it is causing tissue destruction.

663
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:18,570
But by itself, this is probably not enough of a concern necessarily.

664
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:22,380
You want to kind of minimize this, but by itself, it's part of what you would expect.

665
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:33,750
So this is an adverse change, but not necessarily one that would be sort of kind of stop the compound in its tracks unless it leads to other problems.

666
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:40,230
So this is an example, again, of aluminum containing formulations with some changes at the injection sites.

667
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:45,330
If this persists or becomes very severe, that would be problematic.

668
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:53,219
Even sailing injections of physiologic saline because it increases the fluid

669
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:58,350
locally in the tissue can induce some tissue damage and an inflammatory response.

670
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:05,550
So this is safely an injection in the muscle of a rat and this is muscle degeneration and inflammatory response.

671
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:10,409
The difference here is that it would be unusual for you to have lymphocytes that

672
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:13,890
were mostly B macrophages because there is no antigenic stimulation there.

673
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:19,440
Okay. So that's what happens locally, what happens after the local response.

674
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:28,590
So the dendritic cells travel in the efferent, lymphatics away from the site of immunization and go to the draining lymph node.

675
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:34,440
So in the lymph node we have areas of B cells and T cells.

676
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,650
So the main lymphoid follicles are mostly B cells.

677
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:46,980
And at the periphery we have some T cells and the first antigen presentation in the lymph node is outside of the follicular areas.

678
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:55,650
So you get some t cell stimulation and you get sort of B cells at the periphery that are going to go ahead and produce antibody.

679
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:59,670
But the antibody that is first produced is relatively low affinity.

680
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:05,159
So it's sort of a first pass antibody very quickly produced, but it's relatively low affinity,

681
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:14,850
meaning it doesn't have a strong bond with or the clones that are developed don't necessarily have a strong bond to the antigen.

682
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:16,740
So it's a low affinity antibody.

683
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:25,350
And then later over time you actually have a selection for higher affinity clones of B cells and you're going to get a higher quality antibody.

684
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:31,620
And that response. So I'm not showing it in this diagram because the other thing that's happening is memory cells.

685
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:39,089
But part of the we are the aspect of maturing of an immune response and part of the reason for giving a second booster with

686
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:49,140
many with many antigens is to facilitate both a memory cell response and to facilitate that higher affinity antibody response.

687
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:55,050
So those those things are happening in the lymph node. So I talked about something outside of the follicles.

688
01:12:55,080 --> 01:13:00,480
In the follicles, this is a super cool diagram where someone superimposed an actual histo picture.

689
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:04,790
With a cartoon. So here it's just the cartoon here superimposed.

690
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:12,169
And here is what the actual structure looks like. So it's showing you the structure of a typical lymph node which has follicles

691
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:17,719
in the superficial cortex and the follicle areas or the B-cell rich areas,

692
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:24,200
those little round circles. And then adjacent to those there's a para follicular area which is a T-cell rich area.

693
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:34,220
So the basic structure is that lymph, which is the draining fluid from that injection site enters the lymph node through afferent lymphatics.

694
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:42,500
So these are vessels, they're not blood vessels, but they're for fluid and lymphoid tissues or immune tissues from a site of antigenic stimulation.

695
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:50,300
Antigen presentation takes place in the para cortex, which is a T-cell rich area.

696
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:56,269
So that's the T-cell rich area. And then also in B cell rich areas.

697
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:58,100
And there's sort of two stages to that.

698
01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:07,339
So both T cells and B cells in the lymph node get stimulated, activated B cells that get stimulated in the follicular areas,

699
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:11,840
then migrate to the medulla, which is the middle part or the lower portion of the lymph node.

700
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:14,990
And that's where they have differentiated into plasma cells.

701
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:19,490
So if you have a stimulated lymph node, you'll have a large number of plasma cells in this area.

702
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:27,590
And then those activated cells and the antibodies that they're producing leave the lymph node by efferent lymphatics.

703
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:34,420
So now they're circulating in the blood where they might encounter virus or whatever your around or they might encounter

704
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:44,870
virus and eventually can make their way via the fat system back to the blood and then circulate to the sites of infection.

705
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:52,760
So I don't show it in this diagram, but lymphatics drain to the thoracic duct which goes back into the circulation.

706
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:57,050
So these lymphocytes are actually going to get to the site of infection in the blood.

707
01:14:57,590 --> 01:15:00,680
So lymphatics go to blood system and then to the tissue.

708
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:06,080
You would had a question about high endothelial Vinals this morning.

709
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:11,659
So I threw them because I didn't really address that. But the blood supply, that's the lymphatic drainage,

710
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:16,880
the blood supply to the lymph node comes in through an artery near where the efferent lymphatic is.

711
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,079
The blood supply goes kind of imbues the entire lymph node.

712
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:28,520
And then there's capillary junctions that join the arterial system to the venous system, and then it drains out the same way.

713
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:34,850
Amber was asking about something called high endothelial variables or H Eve's

714
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:40,640
the high occupancy vehicle lane and these are specialized version of the venue.

715
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:49,640
So your artery capillary system and then the venue which is draining that capillary and the endothelial cells there are really thick and tall.

716
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:54,200
So the name is just high endothelial Daniel is just because the endothelial cells look really big there.

717
01:15:54,740 --> 01:16:00,800
But that's where lymphocytes from the circulation can enter the lymph node.

718
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:05,629
So the lymphocytes that are in this lymph node don't live here all the time.

719
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:10,820
They're actually being repopulated from the blood and the lymphocytes are actually circulating through the body

720
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:17,330
and taking a pit stop here to see if there's anything being presented that they want to antigenic they react to.

721
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:23,990
So the high endothelial Daniels is sort of the exit point from the blood for naive and memory lymphocytes.

722
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:29,840
So I just threw that in because of that stat. It's not necessarily important for our purposes, but that's what it is.

723
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,260
And then finally, the spleen normal architecture looks like this.

724
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:42,440
So spleen also has lymphocyte organization and it's divided into the white pulp, which is really the aggregate of lymphocytes growth.

725
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,120
It looks a little bit whiter in the tissue.

726
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:49,610
And then the other portion of the spleen is the red pulp, which is where we have circulating red blood cells.

727
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:55,249
This is where blood gets filtered by macrophages and it's also where old or dying red blood cells

728
01:16:55,250 --> 01:17:00,590
or other cells are pulled out of circulation by macrophages and broken down into component parts,

729
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:09,320
sort of like the graveyard of the body. So that's the spleen, white pulp and the red pulp, and they have a little bit of a inverse structure.

730
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:15,230
The central area around the central arteries is t cell rich and then around that it's B cell rich.

731
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:19,130
So it's a little bit inverted from the structure of a lymph node.

732
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:24,350
And then finally, this is thymus. The thymus is the site of T cell development.

733
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:32,930
It has also a cortex and a medulla. The medulla is the lighter staining area centrally and the immature T cells on the outside.

734
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:36,469
And as they mature, they exit the thymus via the medulla.

735
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:41,270
So this is the lighter staining areas. So that's your basic structure.

736
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:53,020
To look at. So these slides are a little bit less exciting.

737
01:17:55,540 --> 01:18:01,960
So just kind of, actually. Um.

738
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:16,010
This image. I'm good at this one.

739
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:23,670
And then. How about this?

740
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:33,800
Okay. So this was from a different version of the class where we looked at an immune suppressive agent.

741
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:38,780
So this is an agent that causes lymphocyte apoptosis.

742
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:46,040
So these slides are at the same magnifications you can already get. So, no, you can't see a thing because.

743
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:58,750
Okay. So you can already guess which was the immune suppressor besides at the same magnification.

744
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,440
What organ do you think this is? I can zoom in a little bit.

745
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:08,200
Yeah, that's the spleen has the red pulp and white pulp.

746
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:13,180
The white pulp areas of the lymphocyte rich areas and there's actually a macrophage ring around them.

747
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:19,210
This isn't a particularly stimulated spleen, it's just kind of normal background state.

748
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:25,480
This, on the other hand, is a spleen that has some atrophy.

749
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:32,740
It's going to be a little bit hard to appreciate, but you'll notice that the cellulari of the blue areas on the spleen,

750
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,640
the central areas, it's a little bit more sparse.

751
01:19:37,150 --> 01:19:46,330
And then as far as the overall size of the darker areas in the center, they're much larger on the spleen on the left,

752
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:51,490
whereas this spleen has kind of an expansion of these lighter colored areas.

753
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:59,950
So the actual lymphocytes in the center of these areas are pretty small and there's a lot of macrophages kind of picking up debris.

754
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:07,630
And we actually if we were to put in a process marker, we have some apoptosis occurring in the central lymphoid areas of the spleen.

755
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:15,100
So this was lymphoid atrophy in the spleen and then in the lymph node.

756
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:17,889
So these are the this is thymus right next to it,

757
01:20:17,890 --> 01:20:26,830
but this is a lymph node on the animal with atrophy and lymph node from a normal animal where you can clearly see the lighter areas in the follicles.

758
01:20:26,830 --> 01:20:34,809
That's an area of active antibody development compared to this guy that not only is smaller, but everything's kind of compressed.

759
01:20:34,810 --> 01:20:41,710
And there is no lighter areas inside the follicles, which are signs, again, of B cell proliferation and activation.

760
01:20:42,010 --> 01:20:45,670
So this is a lymphoid atrophy of the lymph node.

761
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:51,129
Can you see the follicular dendritic cells really doing their little job?

762
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:55,730
You can't differentiate visually a macrophage from it in direct sound.

763
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,270
So follicular cells you might be able to see.

764
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:06,879
But most people use a special stain to identify follicular dendritic cells because dendritic cells are really kind of a special flavor of macrophage.

765
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,640
Essentially, follicular cells are a little bit different,

766
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:15,730
but visually there's nothing really that you could distinguish them from a macrophage, so unfortunately you can't really see them.

767
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:24,190
And then finally for this one slice so easy for the famous, which is this particular version of the class, just looks at dexamethasone,

768
01:21:24,190 --> 01:21:30,670
which is a corticosteroid, which has a very strong effect on lymphocytes, particularly in the famous and causes thymic atrophy.

769
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:43,240
So I said that the mature T cells were on the inside so immature to maturing and then these exit via the vasculature in the atrophied one.

770
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:49,030
There's very little sort of medullary area. It's all just immature cells sitting there resting, doing nothing.

771
01:21:49,570 --> 01:21:53,500
And then these were animals that also had a corresponding decrease in Thymic weight.

772
01:21:54,580 --> 01:22:00,160
Okay, so if you were to quantify this, you would want to be able to measure the difference in the cortical in the

773
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:04,690
cortical and medullary areas in the normal one versus the atrophy in this guy.

774
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:13,570
And then one last thing to show this thing. So that was a lymphoid atrophy project.

775
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:22,450
This one, this was a, I think, a naturally occurring case of immune mediated hemolytic anemia.

776
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:30,339
So this is an animal that was antigenic sensitized to its own red blood cells, and this is a dog again.

777
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:36,780
So lymph node looks a little bit different. It's kind of a mess.

778
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:43,859
I'll try to zoom way in because the one thing I wanted to point out about this antigenic reactive lymph node,

779
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:48,239
I'm sort of at the junction of it's a little bit tilted this thing.

780
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:55,380
So I'm at the junction of the follicular area and the medulla, all of these cells with a little bit more cytoplasm, a little penis to it.

781
01:22:55,620 --> 01:23:03,450
These are all plasma cells. This is almost an entire sea of plasma cells producing antibody, and those are lymphocytes.

782
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:07,740
So this is a very reactive lymph node that's been energetically stimulated.

783
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:14,940
And then it's a little bit hard to see here, but macrophages in this cell, in this animal are actually phagocytosis in red cells.

784
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:20,070
And that's because the antigenic stimulation in this case is actually its own red cells.

785
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,620
A lot of times this happens as a drug reaction.

786
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:31,680
You get a drug that shares either antigen city or triggers an inflammatory response that then targets antibody production against their own red cells.

787
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:36,120
Here we have some hemo phagocytosis, so this is autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

788
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:42,930
And the take on point here was the intense number of plasma cells indicating that it's a reactive lymph node.

789
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:51,570
So that's some lymphoid changes. It closed my slide.

790
01:23:55,850 --> 01:24:08,410
And then finally. Right.

791
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:14,650
So in this particular case, so this is just nomenclature for lymphoid tissue.

792
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:20,720
If you have like antigenic stimulation and the lymphocytes are expanded within a lymph node,

793
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:29,180
sort of the new in nature is just to be very descriptive lymphocytic cellulari increased and then you see the tissue areas that are affected.

794
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:38,240
So again, an example of the nomenclature issues, same thing with the spleen cellulari increased and then where in the tissue is it increased?

795
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:44,960
So you're kind of putting this together at the end with all your other information, like is there a lymphocyte increase in the outside?

796
01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:53,450
So I'll show that a minute. And then finally, the big one, the lung, lung normal architecture we did this morning.

797
01:24:53,480 --> 01:25:02,959
This is a mouse lung. And as I told you mice have a lot are highly likely to get bronchus associated lymphoid tissue expansion.

798
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:08,870
So here's an area of that bolt expansion. This is just some of the structures that we learned this morning.

799
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:16,610
And let's look at the long form.

800
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:23,670
I think what I want to look at. How about. Vaccine, no challenge.

801
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:28,020
So this should be this is our vaccine group with no infection.

802
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:34,920
So think about what we learned in the lung this morning, what the lung should look like and what this looks like.

803
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:42,570
So this is our vaccine only. So what we're looking, is there any problem with just giving the vaccine without any antigenic stimulation?

804
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:47,970
What do you think of this one? At low mark, let's look at low mark.

805
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:54,960
Yes. I get it. That's pretty good. I'm not missing anything.

806
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:58,730
Too much of concern. Beautiful section has nice big airways that we can look at.

807
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:04,220
So let's keep that open so we can go back and look at that. So, so far, so good on our vaccine.

808
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:07,770
No challenge. Let's look at our Novavax challenge.

809
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:11,060
So this is kind of the opposite. This is what happens with natural infection.

810
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:19,219
And then this is going to be hard because in class I usually give you guys ridiculously bad examples and these are more real.

811
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:23,990
So they're are less robust, shall we say, as that extra one.

812
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:31,390
All right. So at low magnification, you're not that impressed.

813
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:36,310
So because I didn't show you something huge. Are you seeing anything you want to look at?

814
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:43,350
When I get a little higher. Yeah.

815
01:26:43,350 --> 01:26:46,470
You kind of all will increase secularity around those bronchioles.

816
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:50,940
So we know that's where lymphoid tissue lives. We know this animal has had an infection.

817
01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:55,170
So we might expect that there are some in response to infection.

818
01:26:55,170 --> 01:26:57,600
Maybe we're getting some antigenic stimulation there.

819
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:06,150
So so far we have increased cellular already, para bronchial, bronchial or the slides really dark.

820
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:15,720
What kind of cells do you think they are for the most part? Dare to be wrong.

821
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:22,800
Well, what are they? Yeah, they're mostly lymphocytes. There are other cell types here as well, so I know it can get confusing.

822
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:27,980
But it's where I would expect lymphocytic tissue.

823
01:27:27,990 --> 01:27:33,840
There's actually some macrophages as well, and there's even some plasma cells here like these guys.

824
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:39,120
So there is an increase in lymphocytic cellulari and it's mostly around the bronchioles.

825
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:44,849
And when I'm looking at my bronchial epithelium, it's not too bad.

826
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:50,270
I'm not really seeing a lot of inflammation in the bronchial epithelium itself.

827
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:58,020
The airways are still nice and clear. So samples probably not feeling great, just like, you know, if you get a mild to cold virus infection.

828
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:02,250
So definitely has pathology, but it's not too bad.

829
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:13,290
Right. So there again, there's a really nice view of that increased secularity in bronchi around the bronchial area in the alveoli.

830
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:17,640
I should have looked more at the alveoli and the other one. What are you seeing? Just kind of floating out.

831
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:24,390
So do you think all those cells are inside the alveoli? Some of them are different.

832
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:29,250
So some inflammatory cells in the alveoli. This is actually anti a synovial.

833
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:36,600
That bright pink thing. But there's also an increased level of macrophages just sitting in the alveoli.

834
01:28:37,230 --> 01:28:39,930
It's pretty subtle. Like I had to zoom in really to see it.

835
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:45,190
But basically as I get a little bit farther out, I'm starting to get maybe a little increase.

836
01:28:45,210 --> 01:28:53,580
You can even see them at low back in macrophages. But on the whole, the wall, the interstitial lining of my alveoli is still nice and thin.

837
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:58,320
I'm not really getting a lot. Maybe a couple little areas, but not a lot of interstitial thickening.

838
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:07,500
I'm not getting any scarring or fibrosis or anything. So basically I have increased per bronchial cellulari maybe a little increase in macrophages,

839
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:10,560
but it quickly goes away as I get farther away from the bronchioles.

840
01:29:11,190 --> 01:29:15,360
And now let's look at our vaccinated challenged animal.

841
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:20,520
So this one has infection and it has vaccine on board.

842
01:29:21,550 --> 01:29:24,810
Now, let's see if we can do side to side.

843
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:38,990
Okay. So vaccine only is on the right. This is challenge infection only.

844
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:43,190
The middle one is infection only. And then here's our vaccinated animal.

845
01:29:43,370 --> 01:29:48,050
If the vaccine is working great, we would want to have it look like this, right?

846
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:59,900
Like a normal and enjoy the control, but like a normal lung. And so what do you think of our animal compared to this guy versus that guy?

847
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:08,070
It's a little better, but it's not quite the same as immunized infection.

848
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:16,220
Let's look for round here. So the middle one is natural infection.

849
01:30:17,150 --> 01:30:22,040
So here is an airway with a natural infection.

850
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:26,690
Here's a big airway with natural infection. Here's a big airway with natural infection.

851
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:31,070
And then this animal has infection plus vaccine.

852
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:37,960
Right. And. Here.

853
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,750
Not even near an airway. And I'm going to look at these higher in a minute.

854
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:43,820
But here's a little aggregate of something.

855
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:52,280
So that air in that area in particular, I'm actually losing some alveoli, trying to find an equivalent area.

856
01:30:52,460 --> 01:31:00,560
So here is perhaps an equivalent area. But one difference is that there's no airway here.

857
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:09,760
Like, okay, if this first of all, the cells with a little bit more cellular that more cytoplasm than lymphocytes and like what are they doing here?

858
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:18,470
There's like no airway that they're clustering around versus this looks like bronchial or like the lymphoid hyperplasia.

859
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:23,990
But it's not really consolidating the alveoli out in the middle of nowhere.

860
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:29,570
So it's concerning that this animal. So at the very best.

861
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:36,560
And look here. So here is bronchus bronchoalveolar hyperplasia.

862
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:43,400
But this animal has kind of spread. And in the alveoli, we actually have some areas of consolidation.

863
01:31:44,570 --> 01:31:45,709
So in an ideal world,

864
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:53,750
we would want our vaccinated animal to have no pathology or at the very least demonstrably less pathology than our infected animal.

865
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:58,610
And instead, at best, I think we could probably say it's no better.

866
01:31:59,510 --> 01:32:03,110
At worst, it actually kind of looks in certain areas a little worse.

867
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:08,630
I agree with you. This animal also has the samples probably in some respiratory distress.

868
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:13,189
These are a crystal. This is a multi nucleated cell. And this is like crystalline material.

869
01:32:13,190 --> 01:32:18,889
It probably inhaled, but from bedding or something as it was kind of breathing that said.

870
01:32:18,890 --> 01:32:22,300
So I agree with you. I do think this looks worse. I think it's pretty subtle.

871
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:27,770
So it's not like, you know, scale of ten worse, but it certainly doesn't look better.

872
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:35,660
So that would be disappointing in terms of the severity of disease. And there's actually some neutrophils and eosinophilia in here.

873
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:42,770
So not only does it have it's lymphoid induction, it has an acute inflammatory response as well.

874
01:32:43,490 --> 01:32:47,420
So it's doing a lot of inflammation. So that's not good.

875
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:57,710
Okay. It is more subtle. So like, even if nothing happened, like we didn't euthanize this animal overall, it's still got plenty of lung left.

876
01:32:57,890 --> 01:33:02,540
So like, you know, think of yourself with a respiratory infection, you're gonna have a few miserable days.

877
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:06,290
The animals probably not going to die from this if we had euthanized it.

878
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:14,600
But still, we're looking at kind of a we wanted to look at an improvement in disease severity and instead we have a little bit worsening.

879
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:16,460
So let's see what that looked like.

880
01:33:16,910 --> 01:33:28,940
So that is the actual these are the actual slides from the study and that's they'll found we did that normal architecture.

881
01:33:29,690 --> 01:33:37,430
Okay. So this is a paper kind of investigating this entire phenomenon of RSV infection.

882
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:46,790
The top two slides are from a human infant who sadly died of RSV infection.

883
01:33:46,790 --> 01:33:51,220
And even more sadly, this poor infant died after vaccination.

884
01:33:51,800 --> 01:34:05,720
So they received a formalin inactivated adjuvanted vaccine against RSV and then were infected with RSV just by bad luck and unfortunately died.

885
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:11,000
This is a bronchial and this individual has a bronchiolitis because there's inflammatory

886
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:16,850
cells destroying the lining of that bronchial and at higher magnification.

887
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:23,479
So there's inflammation both around and within the bronchial and at higher magnification in the alveoli.

888
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:27,080
They also have a lot of inflammatory cells coming into the alveoli.

889
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:31,910
At the bottom here is an experimental animal. This is a cotton rat.

890
01:34:31,910 --> 01:34:35,719
This is the same exact animal that we used actually in our study.

891
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:40,070
These are cotton rats. And it has it doesn't have as much in the airway itself,

892
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:47,780
but it has para bronchial inflammation and it has an increase in inflammatory cells in the alveolar space.

893
01:34:48,570 --> 01:34:54,830
So mcso inflammation in the alveoli us if we were to look at the nasal epithelium,

894
01:34:55,100 --> 01:35:03,080
another thing that we might see there are sort of two findings you potentially from infection could have inflammation in the nasal epithelium.

895
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,969
This is from a different example,

896
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:13,430
but there could be inflammation in the nasal epithelium or you could have kind of a response to injury and hypoplasia of the nasal epithelium.

897
01:35:14,270 --> 01:35:21,440
So that gets kind of enfolded. And this is the summary of findings from our study in our experimental animals.

898
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,920
This is the toxicity of the toxicity study only.

899
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:28,340
So this is the control non immunized, just like sailing.

900
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:33,799
So not much. Why does this happen?

901
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:39,840
Why don't you get a little bit of inflammation? In the lymph node, we think.

902
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:48,140
Be excited about that one out of ten. That's a good thing because they're producing stuff.

903
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:52,330
It could be they didn't we didn't immunize them. So like we didn't do it.

904
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:56,959
So that's an example of background. So like it's real data that sometimes happens.

905
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:02,360
You just get like a nonspecific finding. I don't know why that animal hasn't increased the deficit accelerate already.

906
01:36:03,110 --> 01:36:07,579
And these guys immunization, we didn't even really get that robust.

907
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:12,590
The response in the posterior lymph nodes, we can't say much there in the muscle.

908
01:36:12,590 --> 01:36:17,450
We did get some inflammation, but we immunized them. So not unexpected.

909
01:36:17,570 --> 01:36:22,190
So overall, the seem pretty well-tolerated. Nothing else was abnormal.

910
01:36:22,580 --> 01:36:33,290
And then so these are just related to species. In our efficacy study though, I put these up in our efficacy study, though we had several findings.

911
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:39,950
So in both the infected non immunized animal, we had some increase secularity in the spleen.

912
01:36:40,610 --> 01:36:45,220
So since it's in the infected group as well as the immunized, that's probably related to infection, right?

913
01:36:45,230 --> 01:36:52,160
Lymphocytes are just geared up because it's exposed to a virus in the lymph node which is draining the site of inflammation.

914
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:58,160
We had the site of immunization, we had an inflammation just in our vaccinated group.

915
01:36:58,580 --> 01:37:04,190
So that's our adverse local finding. But still they were tolerating it fairly well.

916
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:08,059
But it is an adverse finding. Um, well, actually, excuse me,

917
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:20,330
this is the adverse finding that is just indicative of lymphocytic stimulation in the lung natural infection produced bronchial centric inflammation,

918
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:24,200
but not much distant from the bronchioles.

919
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:35,330
In our natural infection, we had similar bronchial inflammation in our vaccinated animals, so no better in that sense, which we would have hoped for.

920
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:39,650
And then unfortunately we also had quite a bit of inflammation and alveoli.

921
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:47,870
So there was a big difference in that this alveolar inflammation appeared to be more prominent in the animals that have been vaccinated.

922
01:37:48,350 --> 01:37:51,800
So it's almost like an enhancement of response to disease.

923
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,180
So that is going to be the mystery explaining why that's happening.

924
01:37:56,750 --> 01:38:04,370
And then we have some other mild and mild changes in the nasal cavity that were present in both the immunized and the non immunized animals,

925
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:08,280
and that appeared to be related to infection. Okay.

926
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:18,560
So the main finding that was present in our vaccinated group that was not due to infection was this more extensive inflammation in the lung.

927
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:24,470
So this table, by the way, is in your results subfolder.

928
01:38:25,070 --> 01:38:28,340
So summing up, what was our answer?

929
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:33,740
Our experimental questions, where they answered, was the vaccine well-tolerated?

930
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:39,650
So by itself, yeah, nothing really exciting happened in the vaccination only group.

931
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:42,409
So by itself the vaccine was well tolerated.

932
01:38:42,410 --> 01:38:55,580
But we had a very not good happening in that we had some evidence of of a ameliorated disease from the virus titer, but that wasn't very dramatic.

933
01:38:56,480 --> 01:39:01,610
The serum neutralizing antibodies were disappointing because they were lower than in natural infection.

934
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:10,850
Virus clearance didn't seem to really give us any advantage compared to natural infection or most of the animals clear by day ten anyway.

935
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:19,669
And then we had a very adverse finding in terms of disease severity where there was no definitive or no evidence of protection from disease.

936
01:39:19,670 --> 01:39:23,660
And even worse, it seemed like disease is actually a little more severe.

937
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:28,850
That's probably as adverse an effect as you would want to have in a toxicity study for a vaccine.

938
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:35,360
So what is the meaning of all this? So some of the immune mechanisms, we'll go into more next week.

939
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:43,430
But as you know now from my publishing in the methods this vaccine was this virus was respiratory syncytial virus,

940
01:39:44,330 --> 01:39:51,410
which is the leading cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis inflammation of a small number of bronchioles in children less than two years of age.

941
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:56,870
Most children are exposed to this at some point in their childhood, and most kids get a cold,

942
01:39:57,050 --> 01:40:02,990
viral, cold, and then they're fine, especially very young children with teeny tiny bronchioles.

943
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:11,150
These infections can be severe and can even lead to death, but younger babies are more susceptible because of a smaller size of their bronchioles.

944
01:40:11,420 --> 01:40:19,280
So this is a serious illness. And although most adults, if you or I were to be exposed to it, we probably wouldn't have too much of an issue.

945
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:23,660
But elderly persons or immunocompromised persons are also susceptible.

946
01:40:23,990 --> 01:40:27,320
So there's actually a bit of a resurgence of RSV later in life.

947
01:40:28,130 --> 01:40:34,760
And RSV, I think, as I alluded to before, has kind of a very checkered past in terms of its vaccine history.

948
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:43,850
So because it affects so many people, there would be a strong a strong need for a vaccine because it can have such an adverse effect.

949
01:40:44,110 --> 01:40:45,030
On children.

950
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:55,240
And in the 1960s, a formalin inactivated RSV vaccine actually made it through animal trials all the way to late stage clinical trials in children.

951
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:03,490
But unfortunately, what happened in these late stage clinical trials is some percentage of the immunized children.

952
01:41:03,790 --> 01:41:07,099
So they immunized children and then just sort of let them live their regular lives.

953
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:09,910
They didn't. Obviously, it challenged them in any way.

954
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:16,209
But RSV is so common that a certain percentage of these children became infected and ended up hospitalized.

955
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:20,680
So the incidence of hospitalization was increased in the vaccinated group.

956
01:41:21,130 --> 01:41:27,910
Look at the percentages 80% hospitalization versus 5% in controls, which kind of boggles the mind.

957
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:32,530
And there were actually two deaths in vaccinated and actually exposed children.

958
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:38,709
So this was, as I said, as bad an outcome as you can possibly imagine for a vaccine trial,

959
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:42,790
even doubly so because it was a vaccine trial for a disease that affects children.

960
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:46,630
So obviously, that vaccine had gone terribly wrong.

961
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:51,430
There was not as much known even about immune system mechanisms at the time.

962
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:56,320
And the animal studies that were done for this were done in regular rats and regular mice.

963
01:41:56,330 --> 01:42:00,729
There was no indication that this would happen. So a lot was not understood.

964
01:42:00,730 --> 01:42:08,410
It was the 1960s, but the net effect is this had a major effect on vaccine development because nobody wanted to touch this with a ten foot pole.

965
01:42:08,740 --> 01:42:17,710
And so to this day, there's actually no RSV vaccine, although now with some RNA vaccines, there are several trials that have just concluded.

966
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:22,360
There are some late stage RNA vaccines in the pipeline.

967
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:28,900
But anyway, so there is no RSV vaccine and this also inhibited vaccine development for other significant

968
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:34,570
childhood illnesses because this was so poorly understood and obviously a devastating outcome.

969
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:41,730
Yes. Can you say that it was like an allergy since you had like the initial exposure and then the secondary?

970
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:47,830
Yes. So all like allergy is kind of a cold kill term for a hypersensitivity reaction.

971
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:57,160
So all I mean, even a naturally occurring allergy is a had a hypersensitivity reaction to something that you've been previously sensitized.

972
01:42:57,700 --> 01:43:04,870
Right. So your goal in sensitization is that you'll get a stronger immune response because you have memory cells and second exposure.

973
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:12,670
So an allergic reaction is something you've been sensitized to and then it's so robust the response that it causes you adverse effects.

974
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:18,370
So the path equivalent is a hypersensitivity reaction. So essentially, yes, it's an allergy.

975
01:43:18,370 --> 01:43:23,319
Usually we would use the term hypersensitivity just because we're trying to explain the pathologic mechanism.

976
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:27,610
But there are similarities that I should caveat.

977
01:43:27,610 --> 01:43:32,499
That is that there are several types of hypersensitivity reaction and there are several

978
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:37,390
mechanisms which we are going to talk about next week for why disease would be enhanced.

979
01:43:37,810 --> 01:43:40,870
And not all of those mechanisms are hypersensitivity.

980
01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:46,270
This kind of two main mechanisms why this might happen, one of which is hypersensitivity.

981
01:43:46,630 --> 01:43:50,800
So this was actually New York Times from like two days ago.

982
01:43:51,670 --> 01:43:55,569
Some of you might already know about this, but there is actually a current surge in RSV.

983
01:43:55,570 --> 01:43:59,320
Like I said, it's still around and because everyone's been hiding indoors for two years,

984
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:04,180
unfortunately, all the children who would have been exposed earlier in life are now being exposed.

985
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:08,360
So there's actually a big increase in RSV now, which, you know,

986
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:15,880
is doubly dangerous because now we have COVID influenza and RSV, we're kind of in a respiratory minefield.

987
01:44:17,350 --> 01:44:24,550
So the initial studies that were done in regular rats for RSV vaccine showed nothing exciting in the toxicology,

988
01:44:25,870 --> 01:44:30,009
but there was still a lot of interest in trying to figure out what happened because,

989
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:36,670
you know, if we ever want to make vaccines like this for children, we want to understand what things went horribly wrong, what was the cause.

990
01:44:37,330 --> 01:44:39,309
And so in order to study that,

991
01:44:39,310 --> 01:44:47,080
people wanted to develop an animal model that had a similar enhancement of disease in the face of vaccination when exposed to RSV.

992
01:44:47,950 --> 01:44:55,390
So through a couple of different trials, the animal model that's kind of the model of choice for this phenomenon is the cotton rat.

993
01:44:55,930 --> 01:45:00,130
So this is an animal that naturally lives particularly in the southern United States.

994
01:45:00,550 --> 01:45:05,410
It's kind of a famous infectious disease because it's the natural host of several zoonotic viruses.

995
01:45:05,410 --> 01:45:09,370
So don't go catching them out in the field for use in experimental research.

996
01:45:09,940 --> 01:45:17,710
But there are actually controlled health status, cotton rats available, particularly for respiratory studies now that have been bred for several,

997
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:21,430
several generations to make them inbred and have a controlled health status.

998
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:26,170
So these were cotton rats. They are highly susceptible to RSV.

999
01:45:26,170 --> 01:45:34,270
They have a lifelong susceptibility and are 100 fold more susceptible to infection and to signs of infections in mice.

1000
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:43,600
So there are much better animal model for an efficacy study in terms of representing what happens in human disease, the majority.

1001
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:50,060
Even though we had that horrible outcome, the majority of our skin infections in humans, mild, a viral cold.

1002
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:53,390
So an accurate animal model, you know,

1003
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:59,480
not all of them are going to die if you want to have that manifestation frequent enough so that you can experimentally model it.

1004
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:04,130
But most of the time, disease is relatively mild in cotton rats.

1005
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:08,570
And also the cotton rats that we typically would be infecting are a little bit older.

1006
01:46:08,570 --> 01:46:11,420
Like it's very hard to do infection studies in infant rats.

1007
01:46:11,810 --> 01:46:20,810
So the fact that we saw mild lesions in our lungs probably represents that these were essentially teenage cotton rats as opposed to infant rats.

1008
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:25,130
But disease is mild, like the majority of RSV infections in humans,

1009
01:46:25,370 --> 01:46:31,940
but it does replicate pretty well what happens in most humans in that you get a bronchiolitis and a para bronchiolitis,

1010
01:46:32,570 --> 01:46:38,390
which is at its worst on day six and then they clear the virus by ten days after infection.

1011
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:44,390
The antibody response after infection from natural infection peaks on day nine,

1012
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:49,100
but that antibody doesn't really last very long, so they become susceptible again.

1013
01:46:50,870 --> 01:46:55,940
So that's what we that's why we carried that extra arm out to date tend to see that antibody response.

1014
01:46:56,540 --> 01:47:02,599
And the really important thing about cotton rats is that certain types of vaccination enhance disease.

1015
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:08,060
So no longer do they just get that bronchial or lesion, they actually get an alveoli this as well.

1016
01:47:08,390 --> 01:47:11,420
So they get inflammatory cells in their alveoli.

1017
01:47:12,590 --> 01:47:16,969
So this is data. So all our slides were actually provided by Dr. Blanco.

1018
01:47:16,970 --> 01:47:20,690
Dr. Horton Blanco from Sigma Virus. It's kind of his field of interest.

1019
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:25,780
So those slides I showed you have long are from rats and they're actually I don't know,

1020
01:47:25,790 --> 01:47:29,000
they're from this experiment, but they're from an experiment very like this.

1021
01:47:29,270 --> 01:47:30,590
So this is some of his data.

1022
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:38,420
This is a formalin this is kind of trying to figure out that phenomenon of formalin inactivated RSV vaccination, cotton rats.

1023
01:47:38,930 --> 01:47:42,319
So this is the virus titer in lung.

1024
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:45,680
So this is our plaque forming AC and lung with primary infection.

1025
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:50,360
So if you looked at day five, there was a lot of virus in the long of a naturally infected,

1026
01:47:50,810 --> 01:47:54,469
primarily infected animal, but by day ten they've cleared it.

1027
01:47:54,470 --> 01:48:02,900
So that's normal infection. And I don't remember what timing the secondary infection was, but they do get at least some short lasting immunity.

1028
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:07,490
So if you then try to infect them again in the period where they have antibody, this is what happens.

1029
01:48:07,490 --> 01:48:12,050
The virus doesn't replicate at all. So natural infection is very good at stimulating immunity.

1030
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:22,070
The vaccine, though, does actually decrease the viral titer, just like we saw in our data, but it doesn't clear it all the way down to zero.

1031
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:27,920
So does vaccination with this formalin inactivated vaccine will reduce virus titer,

1032
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:33,260
but unfortunately it actually creates some pathology that's not there in natural infection.

1033
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:41,780
Okay. So and this slide was the one that I just showed you of the human versus the cotton rat.

1034
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:45,830
So this is again from that article I'm looking at the comparison of the two.

1035
01:48:47,000 --> 01:49:00,740
And it turns out that formalin vaccines, in contrast, actually give a robust cytokine response, both in a four tier two and Tier one cytokines.

1036
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:07,970
So the open circle dotted line is natural infection in these, and the solid line is vaccinated animals.

1037
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:13,070
And so almost every side of tanuja is more robust in the vaccinated animals.

1038
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:16,700
So it drives quite the inflammatory response.

1039
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:23,930
So the question still remains, how could this exacerbation of disease happen?

1040
01:49:25,070 --> 01:49:28,130
So we know we're getting some antibodies, even though they're not neutralizing.

1041
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:33,680
So this is a reminder from our immune system crash course of how antibodies develop.

1042
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:40,400
This was an alum adjuvanted vaccine and we know that alum is a to enhancing adjuvant.

1043
01:49:40,820 --> 01:49:47,930
So th2 responses tend to drive a cytokine response that promotes antibody dependent microbial killing,

1044
01:49:48,770 --> 01:49:55,730
so they stimulate T cells to move towards a22 direction and you get both b cell production directly,

1045
01:49:55,970 --> 01:50:01,940
but also expansion of T age to help our cells which facilitate B-cell antibody development.

1046
01:50:02,750 --> 01:50:10,370
And then antibodies can kill microbes both by directly neutralizing them, which didn't really work that well for us in this case.

1047
01:50:10,760 --> 01:50:17,820
But there are other mechanisms where antibodies can bind to a virus itself and facilitate phagocytosis.

1048
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:20,030
So they're recruiting macrophages.

1049
01:50:21,590 --> 01:50:29,900
You can have antibodies on the surface of infected cells that promote natural killer cells to come and destroy the infected cells.

1050
01:50:30,110 --> 01:50:36,750
Antibody dependent cytotoxicity. Or you can get activation of blood proteins like complement.

1051
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:40,999
So the antibody directly activates complement and complement.

1052
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,510
That complex of proteins itself can release microbes.

1053
01:50:44,690 --> 01:50:50,570
That's more in the case of bacteria, but also bind to virus and again, promote phagocytosis.

1054
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:57,860
So antibodies, in addition to neutralizing, can also promote destruction through an inflammatory response.

1055
01:50:59,420 --> 01:51:03,140
So in this case, one possibility is that this didn't work.

1056
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:09,110
This potentially worked a little too well, and we actually had enhanced recruitment of inflammatory cells.

1057
01:51:09,410 --> 01:51:15,750
So that's one potential explanation. And that will be similar to your question about a hypersensitivity response.

1058
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:20,360
So it's like a overly exuberant form of what would ordinarily happen.

1059
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:28,129
And then the other explanation is that perhaps we had an insufficient maturation of our antibody

1060
01:51:28,130 --> 01:51:34,730
response and we just didn't have enough antibody present to adequately clear the virus.

1061
01:51:34,940 --> 01:51:42,530
This explanation, because we have that virus titer and information is perhaps a little bit less likely to be the whole answer here.

1062
01:51:45,210 --> 01:51:50,650
So it's the same thing here. So next time, what kind of exam?

1063
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:56,560
We've already examined some of these. This is an example of all the potential adverse effects of vaccination.

1064
01:51:57,100 --> 01:52:03,070
So one adverse effect would be ineffective protection, which is really an efficacy problem, not a toxicity problem.

1065
01:52:03,460 --> 01:52:08,260
One adverse effect would be a local inflammatory response, which is a problem, but not that big.

1066
01:52:08,710 --> 01:52:12,190
And then we have three potential system wide responses.

1067
01:52:12,490 --> 01:52:17,510
One is, if you have a vaccine that resembles a host protein, you can induce an autoimmune reaction.

1068
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:20,650
So that would be very bad. We don't really have evidence of that here.

1069
01:52:21,130 --> 01:52:27,910
What would it look like? How would we tell if this were present, if our vaccination would induce an autoimmune response?

1070
01:52:29,050 --> 01:52:36,930
Well, finding when you think we would see that we didn't really see that for inducing using a

1071
01:52:36,930 --> 01:52:41,790
vaccine and we're inducing an immune response against a naturally occurring protein.

1072
01:52:42,430 --> 01:52:53,600
What would happen in our toxicity study? You see the central system itself, cells in which animals in general.

1073
01:52:54,550 --> 01:53:05,670
And so what we saw finding in our immunize challenged group, what group would be affected if this were the case?

1074
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:11,870
Does this require virus immunization challenge? Yeah.

1075
01:53:11,890 --> 01:53:17,920
So we might see it if the main problem is that we have an antigen that happens to resemble a host protein.

1076
01:53:18,190 --> 01:53:23,500
One thing you might see would be adverse findings in our vaccinated unchallenged group.

1077
01:53:24,190 --> 01:53:28,180
Right. Because basically they're the problem is you're mimicking a host protein which is already present.

1078
01:53:29,050 --> 01:53:33,360
There's some hand-waving as to that because those tend to be enhanced when you then throw a virus on top of it.

1079
01:53:33,370 --> 01:53:38,080
But that's a potential. So that seems a little bit less likely because we saw nothing about animal.

1080
01:53:38,590 --> 01:53:44,620
So that leaves us with these two possibilities. Antibody mediated disease enhancement.

1081
01:53:45,370 --> 01:53:50,680
And I'll show you an example of that next time or an overexuberant hypersensitivity reaction.

1082
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:58,390
So all of these, when you're doing toxicity testing for vaccines, these are all the parts of it's not just does it work or does it not?

1083
01:53:59,170 --> 01:54:03,910
From a toxicity standpoint, you're actually far more concerned with this, right?

1084
01:54:03,940 --> 01:54:07,480
Because this is a compound that we want to give in large amounts to healthy people.

1085
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:15,370
So it's one thing not to protect them from disease, but to actually make things worse is about as adverse a response as you can possibly imagine.

1086
01:54:16,120 --> 01:54:19,630
So we'll talk about that. Let's see how we're doing.

1087
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:25,300
I think what I might do. All right.

1088
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:29,820
So that's a contract. And that was my thank you slide for Dr. Baka, who gave us the slides.

1089
01:54:29,860 --> 01:54:32,860
Very cute. They're really nasty, though. They're very hard to handle.

1090
01:54:33,340 --> 01:54:41,680
So don't let their cuteness fool you. I'm kind of.

1091
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:46,690
It's 330. I generally like to just keep it to 2 hours.

1092
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:54,820
Next week is the 11th. We have basically immune data to talk about next week.

1093
01:54:55,960 --> 01:55:03,370
How do you guys feel? Do you want to do you want to put this with next week to our statistics with next week?

1094
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:05,260
I think we'd probably do it in the 2 hours.

1095
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:16,460
I feel like that's probably I think we've covered a lot of ground today and I think that's a good place to end in your results.

1096
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:26,330
So I put so we'll do the statistical part next week in your results section where I have this thing.

1097
01:55:30,790 --> 01:55:34,580
Oh, I mean this. This is just the in part.

1098
01:55:35,420 --> 01:55:39,260
So these were a summary of our final results at the end of this week's presentation.

1099
01:55:39,470 --> 01:55:43,700
This all these things are in your Dropbox section.

1100
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:51,640
So there is a figure of that long for you. So this hopefully I labeled it, but I can find out for you.

1101
01:55:51,650 --> 01:55:55,340
This was the vaccinated challenge.

1102
01:55:55,340 --> 01:56:00,860
That's challenge alone. So comparing in the efficacy group, I did not take a picture of the toxicity.

1103
01:56:00,860 --> 01:56:05,960
One is just man alone. So that's just for efficacy. And then there are the two tables.

1104
01:56:06,290 --> 01:56:14,780
Okay. For your figure legends, you're going to have to assemble a figure, a legend for that histologic finding and that.

1105
01:56:14,810 --> 01:56:22,040
So it gives you a little bit guide of what to include. Yeah, that's what I wanted to say about that.

1106
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:30,710
And then as far as important deadlines for next week, the results for all the other things, everything except the microscopy is due.

1107
01:56:30,830 --> 01:56:34,250
And then the following week results just to add half the microscopy.

1108
01:56:34,790 --> 01:56:38,209
You know, if you're on a roll and you want to throw them all into one, that doesn't matter.

1109
01:56:38,210 --> 01:56:42,260
That's fine, go for it. But split up a little bit that way.

1110
01:56:42,260 --> 01:56:48,380
And so then the structure is just from December, November 18th to December 2nd to work on your final papers.

1111
01:56:49,490 --> 01:56:53,180
You don't need to pass in a final draft that has internal discussion.

1112
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:56,540
You're perfectly welcome to do so if you'd like to get comments back.

1113
01:56:56,840 --> 01:57:04,549
But in order to get it all done in time, I ask that if you're going to do that, that you submit it by noon on the 28th to give me time to read it,

1114
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:09,050
get in comments, and allow you time to incorporate those findings or those changes.

1115
01:57:09,470 --> 01:57:14,720
And then the final papers are due on the second at the start of class, which is also the day of the final quiz.

1116
01:57:15,410 --> 01:57:22,880
So be aware, I really, really would like the final papers on December 2nd at 130.

1117
01:57:23,090 --> 01:57:27,200
So I have a fairly stringent point penalty for every day that it's late.

1118
01:57:27,980 --> 01:57:32,720
You know, obviously if some horrible disaster happens, talk to me.

1119
01:57:33,170 --> 01:57:38,840
But I really want that to be used as a method of last resort because it takes a lot of time to correct these.

1120
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:42,920
And I'd like to get them back to you before correcting like the 616 final.

1121
01:57:44,030 --> 01:57:47,450
So obviously if you have extreme extenuating circumstances, contact me.

1122
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:51,740
The paper is due on December 2nd at 130. Okay.

1123
01:57:52,190 --> 01:58:00,250
And then at the end of this is just repeat from the study report lecture just gives you a reminder of what to include in your results.

1124
01:58:00,260 --> 01:58:04,850
You can look at that on your own and please let me know of any questions as you go through that.

1125
01:58:06,130 --> 01:58:10,500
Okay. All right. Thank you, guys. Thanks.

1126
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:30,680
Yes. You have to crawl under and reattach the.

1127
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:38,680
Yeah. Dr. Bergen, you mentioned that.

1128
01:58:39,270 --> 01:58:42,360
Is that also on Kansas I mentioned. Okay.

1129
01:58:42,390 --> 01:58:46,590
I was just. That's my usual. Right. Like to have results and stuff.

1130
01:58:46,590 --> 01:58:50,050
So forget Dropbox. You don't need to know about Dropbox.

1131
01:58:50,070 --> 01:58:53,160
It's just. Okay. Okay.

1132
01:58:55,650 --> 01:58:59,640
Thank you. You guys are getting good in interpreting what I really mean versus what I did.

1133
01:59:00,720 --> 01:59:05,160
Thank you. Have a good weekend, everybody. Think you have to go in?

1134
01:59:05,260 --> 01:59:09,980
Try to do that. Oh, my God. Sorry.

1135
01:59:12,630 --> 01:59:18,740
Very simply, there is no way to find out what you've been up to.

1136
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:26,270
I know you have tried it.

1137
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:30,740
What was that? That appeal. That's the way it is.

1138
01:59:30,790 --> 01:59:33,590
Yeah, I just know you're doing it, that's all.

1139
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:48,500
Do you know about this whole thing that you've been working on, like the statement or where you started with a lot?

1140
01:59:49,310 --> 01:59:55,940
Uh, no, I was going to lie. That's all I do.

1141
01:59:56,090 --> 02:00:00,500
Okay. I'm like, you know, I'm sorry.

1142
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:06,180
I'm not as clear on the so for the intro and.

1143
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:13,340
Oh, please. Yeah. Yeah. That's where I was talking about, you know, grew up.

1144
02:00:13,380 --> 02:00:16,640
Uh oh. I don't know. Really true.

1145
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:21,330
I know I was that way. Oh, I guess so. I think the issue is I didn't work.

1146
02:00:21,330 --> 02:00:28,060
Wear the study design. So. Is it usually the results or is it in the lawyers is like, I know that's what it is.

1147
02:00:28,370 --> 02:00:33,680
Yeah. And when did you have like a description to put out ahead of this?

1148
02:00:33,950 --> 02:00:38,600
Like, I don't know. It's like, you know, to try to stop me.

1149
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:45,650
You can't catch me. Did you bring me? Yeah. What's our understanding was like?

1150
02:00:46,010 --> 02:00:55,940
Because I think it was all outside the building, but it's just try to, like, figure if you're going.

1151
02:00:56,240 --> 02:01:00,260
I remember writing that for somebody who has a long tradition of that right.

1152
02:01:00,410 --> 02:01:03,500
Of study design. I mean, and I was trying to say.

1153
02:01:04,970 --> 02:01:09,740
You really get in the way. I was like, I got to get I got, like, maybe a calling now.

1154
02:01:10,340 --> 02:01:15,650
Yeah. Yeah. And so, you know, like, you just have to look up your face.

1155
02:01:16,430 --> 02:01:22,470
You have a chance of getting well, been doing a little bit longer to realize that it's stolen money now.

1156
02:01:23,030 --> 02:01:28,070
Really? Yeah. I'm sorry. Did I give you.

1157
02:01:28,220 --> 02:01:31,250
You have a lot of money, and I'm sorry now.

1158
02:01:31,430 --> 02:01:35,480
Hey, if you're still, like, a week and, like, 12 days, you need to treat us like.

1159
02:01:35,580 --> 02:01:40,000
Oh, yeah, I'll probably deal with that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1160
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:43,880
We'll get some food in case of this. Oh, yeah, that sounds good.

1161
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:49,250
Is it the place near your house or. No, no, it's the you know, the last year.

1162
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:55,040
Yes. Yeah, yeah. I haven't seen the one on it so we only had a few.

1163
02:01:55,220 --> 02:01:58,370
Yeah. Now. Okay. Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Yeah. Positive.

1164
02:01:58,430 --> 02:02:05,600
All right. Yeah. Oh, because there are multiple things being assayed.

1165
02:02:06,290 --> 02:02:16,670
So the comparisons correction was because we're running multiple what we're looking at, however many like ten different clinical chemistry assays.

1166
02:02:17,180 --> 02:02:24,110
So every time we make a call, every time we run a comparison, there is a 5% chance that we'll find something.

1167
02:02:25,100 --> 02:02:34,040
And since we're running our immunologic testing on the entire clinic or our statistical testing on the entire panel of clinical chemistry tests,

1168
02:02:34,610 --> 02:02:38,660
we're running essentially ten different comparisons between two groups.

1169
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:48,170
So the multiple comparisons is correcting for the fact, just like if we were doing a DNA array and we're looking at a thousand genes,

1170
02:02:48,710 --> 02:02:55,400
odds are that 5% of those genes are going to come up as positive in our DNA array.

1171
02:02:55,940 --> 02:03:02,480
So if we're running a assay that asks ten different questions,

1172
02:03:03,140 --> 02:03:11,920
we're actually increasing the risk that we're going to get something positive or different from control by the end of the ten different promoters.

1173
02:03:11,930 --> 02:03:15,550
They are separate and they are they're not really separate.

1174
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:22,910
Well, but the test is just asking in the clinical chemistry because like we're in the clinical chemistry,

1175
02:03:22,910 --> 02:03:27,980
are any of these parameters different between the control and the experimental?

1176
02:03:28,460 --> 02:03:30,980
So like when we're plugging that into our statistics program,

1177
02:03:31,250 --> 02:03:37,100
we're putting the data for control versus experimental and then all the different ten parameters on the side.

1178
02:03:38,090 --> 02:03:41,090
So it's actually asking for any of these parameters.

1179
02:03:41,390 --> 02:03:45,680
Ah, is there a difference between our two groups? Oh, I see.

1180
02:03:46,190 --> 02:03:51,860
So it's kind of compare it for any of our ten comparison things.

1181
02:03:51,860 --> 02:03:55,460
Is there a difference between these two groups? Okay.

1182
02:03:55,640 --> 02:03:59,020
Is that overall test? Yes. So a good example.

1183
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:07,849
Think of it as like a DNA array, like when I run a DNA array and I can be comparing like thousands of genes and I want

1184
02:04:07,850 --> 02:04:13,160
to know is some is a DNA expression up or down in my experimental versus control?

1185
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:21,110
And so I'm actually asking a comparison between two groups, but over like thousands of parameters.

1186
02:04:21,380 --> 02:04:26,870
And so if I'm asking the same question, is there a difference a thousand times.

1187
02:04:26,870 --> 02:04:31,100
And every time I ask that question, there's a 5% chance that I'll falsely say yes.

1188
02:04:31,490 --> 02:04:36,380
I've now amplified my risk of getting a false positive five times a thousand.

1189
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:40,970
But here, obviously, we're not making a thousand comparisons, but we're making X number.

1190
02:04:41,090 --> 02:04:46,010
So we're trying to correct for the odds that one of those answers will come up positive just by chance.

1191
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:52,160
Okay. Okay. Sorry. I'm all right.

1192
02:04:52,160 --> 02:05:00,740
I'm still trying to look at my thing here. I don't know. That wasn't a comment that was tracked over somebody else.

1193
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:04,750
Did you have like did you already have an introduction to that? No.

1194
02:05:08,430 --> 02:05:15,120
Because I was just wondering, is the so for like the last sentence of the intro, is that just a brief overview saying we did toxicity in that?

1195
02:05:15,490 --> 02:05:19,920
Yeah. So usually when I read the paper from the intro, I want to know what's the problem.

1196
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:23,580
So I'm going to say something like RSV is a serious infection.

1197
02:05:24,180 --> 02:05:29,320
I mean, some evidence for that. And then I'm going to say vaccines would be useful for her.

1198
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:34,490
So that first paragraph ask me is a serious infection affects us, my Medicaid, blah, blah, blah, blah blah.

1199
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:38,130
And then I say vaccine. I want to kind of set the stage for the problem.

1200
02:05:38,170 --> 02:05:41,940
Vaccines to be a good thing for as me there have been.

1201
02:05:42,270 --> 02:05:47,489
Well, in this case we're like, yeah, you kind of hand-waving a little bit.

1202
02:05:47,490 --> 02:05:53,850
In this case, we're studying a formula and fixed vaccine so we could make our study like we already know that that happened historically.

1203
02:05:53,850 --> 02:06:01,120
So you could say vaccines have been. I know I have had a dark history because this is what happened.

1204
02:06:04,720 --> 02:06:11,830
Accurate animal models are useful for modeling or studying this, and I read a little paragraph about the contract and now what do we do?

1205
02:06:12,160 --> 02:06:21,280
So in this study we assessed efficacy and toxicity of a formalin inactivated RSV vaccine in a cotton rat model.

1206
02:06:21,670 --> 02:06:24,910
So in that just really short, you have to replicate your methods.

1207
02:06:25,210 --> 02:06:31,630
But now I'm going into it. Okay. They're interested in RSV, they care about vaccines, and they did an animal study.

1208
02:06:32,170 --> 02:06:36,040
And then if I'm reading the paper, most people then jump right to the results.

1209
02:06:36,940 --> 02:06:42,010
And then the first sentence of their results will be something like the vaccine was well tolerated,

1210
02:06:42,280 --> 02:06:45,700
but your tolerance for the toxicity study was tolerated.

1211
02:06:45,700 --> 02:06:50,529
You can have animals die. These are all findings for toxicity for the vaccine was well tolerated and then you

1212
02:06:50,530 --> 02:06:56,470
do your efficacy is you I'm saying sort of serious set the problem to the vaccine.

1213
02:06:56,950 --> 02:07:00,400
Here's an animal model. We're going to look at this vaccine in an animal model.

1214
02:07:00,970 --> 02:07:05,120
Now I jump to my results. Toxicity, stuff. Efficacy.

1215
02:07:05,230 --> 02:07:09,480
Oh, okay. And then I give some in my discussion.

1216
02:07:09,490 --> 02:07:12,850
I'm going to delve into that efficacy problem and explain what happened.

1217
02:07:12,940 --> 02:07:17,019
Okay. And then what we've most people do is like, oh, they did a platforming.

1218
02:07:17,020 --> 02:07:21,610
I say, I wonder what they did. Then we'll go back to the methods and like this is how we.

1219
02:07:21,880 --> 02:07:25,930
So that's why the methods is often kind of disjointed, but those subtitles are helpful.

1220
02:07:26,530 --> 02:07:30,970
Most people don't automatically become a hero like a student or something.

1221
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:35,890
Don't read straight through the methods they like, look at the results and they're like, Well, let me see if these people knew what they were doing.

1222
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:39,610
And then they go back and they check the method. It's like a spot. Okay. Does that make sense?

1223
02:07:40,270 --> 02:07:43,600
But like, what's confusing me I don't want to take is alone.

1224
02:07:44,060 --> 02:07:51,790
You see me is like I remember writing that because someone had started their methods or what did I do?

1225
02:07:52,420 --> 02:07:58,150
Because I was wondering, should I was was the comment just to delete this because it was like extraneous information.

1226
02:07:58,300 --> 02:08:01,780
The second this comment in your front of your little sentence.

1227
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:11,620
Our man was another because this was all related to, like, Hudsucker and stuff.

1228
02:08:11,710 --> 02:08:16,240
Okay. Okay. But. Oh. Figure out what I was talking about.

1229
02:08:16,870 --> 02:08:20,080
But, like, I'm having trouble learning it.

1230
02:08:20,290 --> 02:08:23,709
I'm always like, you know what I'll do now when I have better Internet at home?

1231
02:08:23,710 --> 02:08:33,220
I'm going to take another look at the draft. I have yours because I know I remember writing this for somebody who had written.

1232
02:08:35,020 --> 02:08:39,880
I couldn't figure out whether they were writing their intro and just included it in their methods description

1233
02:08:40,750 --> 02:08:45,400
because they had a whole big explanation of what as a group and all this stuff at the very front,

1234
02:08:45,410 --> 02:08:51,760
it sounded like the last paragraph of a introduction, and that's why I wrote that.

1235
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:55,570
But like, I don't see that for your side. Okay.

1236
02:08:55,660 --> 02:08:58,090
It could have been late at night or I do think.

1237
02:08:58,300 --> 02:09:03,760
But I mean, you were like, I don't I wouldn't change anything in particular because of that, because that's why I remember writing that.

1238
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:06,700
But I don't see I'll try to figure out from what I wrote,

1239
02:09:06,700 --> 02:09:11,720
but hopefully it sounds like you have it like what you have written there as far as the animals thing.

1240
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:15,560
That's totally fine. So you're good? Oh, thank you. So I don't know what was happening.

1241
02:09:15,580 --> 02:09:22,810
Maybe I read yours directly after someone else's, and I. I don't know, like some of the comments I copy, paste it, and maybe I copy paste.

1242
02:09:22,940 --> 02:09:25,959
Oh, okay. Well, you know what?

1243
02:09:25,960 --> 02:09:29,670
I might have been doing a lot of journals, though.

1244
02:09:30,430 --> 02:09:35,080
A lot of journals will ask you to have the regulatory part paragraph first.

1245
02:09:35,140 --> 02:09:41,350
Yeah. Yeah. And I don't ever worry about that for years. But a lot of people, because I didn't make that very clear, didn't have that first.

1246
02:09:41,860 --> 02:09:49,030
So I was copy and pasting a comment that said many journals to require a regulatory thing like the idea of approval to be first.

1247
02:09:49,070 --> 02:09:53,230
Okay, maybe I meant to paste that because you didn't have that first, right?

1248
02:09:53,680 --> 02:09:56,890
It's not a deal breaker. You don't have to put that paragraph first.

1249
02:09:56,950 --> 02:10:00,010
If it's required. The Journal Well, I tell you to do that.

1250
02:10:00,730 --> 02:10:08,240
Um, I think the reason is because obviously they're not going to publish an article that has not been, you know, ethics review.

1251
02:10:08,710 --> 02:10:13,270
So by putting it out front, like when they have the person checking for that, it's all there.

1252
02:10:13,330 --> 02:10:16,629
So I might have it throwing that comment in and copy paste it the wrong thing.

1253
02:10:16,630 --> 02:10:19,730
I don't know. Oh, okay. All right. Sorry about that. Yeah, no.

1254
02:10:19,870 --> 02:10:34,310
Thank you, Dr. Burton. Sure. Have a great weekend. You too. Okay.

1255
02:11:54,360 --> 02:37:44,240
Good Lord. Right now.

1256
02:37:50,260 --> 02:38:09,970
How? Gentlemen.

1257
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:23,420
They say the perpetrators.

1258
02:45:45,150 --> 02:45:49,170
I are. It took the.

1259
02:46:53,650 --> 02:46:53,990
Yeah.
