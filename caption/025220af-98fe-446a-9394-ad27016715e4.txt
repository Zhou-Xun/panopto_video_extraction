1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,300
So in the last module, we were going through kind of the stages of assisting students,

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:17,160
and we left off in the asking questions. I want to talk about asking some of the hard questions related to suicide.

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,730
These can be scary questions. But again, this is where it's really important that we practice

4
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:30,840
and get as comfortable as possible. So you want to practice asking

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,320
if somebody is thinking about suicide, and you're particularly doing this,

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:46,050
when you're just seeing signs that they seem really down, seem to be really disengaging,

7
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,390
I just tend to say when in doubt ask, and we'll talk more about why.

8
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:59,180
So are you having thoughts of harming or killing yourself? Sometimes if you want to kind of warm up to it, another way is,

9
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,900
so let's just say that you've gone through the other stages, you've said things to them like,

10
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:14,450
hey I noticed you haven't in making our meetings lately, and I wanted to check in and see how you're doing, and they tell you some of what's going on.

11
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:22,260
You might say it's not uncommon that when people are overwhelmed or just in a lot of emotional pain, that they have thoughts about self-harm or suicide,

12
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,090
are you having any of those thoughts? So you kind of normalize it,

13
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:31,180
you create an entry, you've kind of given an explanation for why you're asking.

14
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:38,150
The key here is that you have to use the words, are you thinking about killing yourself?

15
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,530
Are you thinking about suicide?

16
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:54,080
There's a lot of more informal language, that maybe you can kind of listen for to maybe que you to ask the question, but when we don't use those specific words,

17
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,240
number one, people tend to sense our discomfort, when talking about the subject.

18
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:05,810
And number two, we're not being very clear and direct. So at the bottom, in the gray square, I'll read some of that, the language that people use,

19
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,080
and again these are things you want to listen for, because it may que you to ask the more specific question.

20
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:18,730
But these are not the words you want to use to ask the question. You might hear students saying things like, I just don't want to be here anymore,

21
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:24,660
I don't think I can do this anymore. They just want it all to end, they just want it all to stop.

22
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,480
I just want to crawl under a rock or a blanket and disappear and not come out.

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,840
Now, a lot of people have those thoughts and feelings, so in and of itself,

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,340
it doesn't mean that somebody is thinking about suicide, but these are oftentimes where you might want to ask.

25
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:48,820
When you say that you don't want to be here anymore, are you having thoughts about harming or killing yourself?

26
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,660
And I would say practice, practice, practice,

27
00:02:52,660 --> 00:03:03,720
because you want to get comfortable with words so that they come to you in a time where you might be feeling some stress about even bringing it up.

28
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:11,280
So it's important to ask about suicide. And it's important to know that asking doesn't increase the chances that somebody is going to act on it.

29
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,620
You're not going to plant an idea that wasn't there.

30
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,020
If somebody is not thinking about it, they're just going to tell you no. If they haven't then they might be like

31
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:24,600
no, why are you asking me that? A worst case scenario is that you say, well, you know,

32
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,690
I wanted to just check in because lots of people do when they're going through difficult things.

33
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,750
And I just wanted you to know that you have a place where you talk about it. So that's

34
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:42,670
the only thing that would probably, worst case scenario with bringing it up is that somebody feels a little bit uncomfortable.

35
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,880
Life goes on. And also, even in that instance, plants to seed it for them,

36
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:57,770
that this is an okay thing to talk about. If somebody is thinking about suicide, it often decreases their anxiety, that it's been brought up.

37
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:05,660
Often people will say, like just, like finally just being able to say it out loud,

38
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:12,440
feels like some some stress has decreased. Most people who are thinking about suicide don't actually want to die,

39
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:19,190
they want to live, but they're having a really hard time seeing any options that make sense to them.

40
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:25,640
So the key here is that we want to be those first responders, intervene early so that

41
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,660
we can help people connect with people that can help bring down the emotional pain,

42
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:40,090
and identify other options to get through it. The other thing is that thoughts of suicide are way more common than most of us acknowledge.

43
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:45,780
Suicide is the third leading cause of death for 15 to 24 year olds,

44
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:57,340
and when pre-COVID they did a study that showed that 10.3% of college students had considered suicide in the last 12 months.

45
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,950
So 1 out of every 10 students, that you interacted with, had thoughts.

46
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,750
Now, over the course of people's lifetime, most people will have thoughts at some time.

47
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:13,280
Most people never act on those thoughts. But we want to treat all of the thoughts seriously,

48
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:21,880
and so we'll talk about that a little bit more in a second. In June 2020, as we had entered into COVID, they did a study,

49
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:29,280
and 25.5% of 18 to 24 year olds,

50
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:36,360
had thought seriously about suicide in that week. So

51
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,260
old data, 1 out of 10, during COVID data, 1 out of 4.

52
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:48,350
So we want to make sure that people are having safe places to talk about this when they're thinking about it.

53
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:58,850
The other thing is that we're going to treat all thoughts of it, all attempts, seriously, because they're a sign of emotional pain, extreme distress.

54
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:04,790
And so we want to avoid using language like, oh, this is just attention seeking,

55
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,890
because even if that were the case, which it's not,

56
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:20,100
that's a really loud cry for help that we want to take seriously. So this is kind of what I said earlier, even if somebody says no,

57
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:29,320
because they've done studies where sometimes if you ask a second time, the person will admit it, because they're really gauging

58
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,080
is it okay? Are you going to be able to hold this? Are you comfortable enough for me to tell you?

59
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,540
And so, even if they say no, you know, you might just say, like, you know

60
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:48,280
well, I just want you to know that if that were to come up, you have a place where you can talk about it, I want everybody to know that.

61
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:54,820
And one of the metaphors that I use that you may find helpful just either to express out loud, or to have in the back of your mind,

62
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:03,750
is that I will tell students that sometimes thoughts of suicide or even thoughts of self harm,

63
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:15,560
which we want to be careful to distinguish somebody who is just harming themselves or maybe drinking too much, abusing substances or cutting,

64
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,960
it's kind of a different thing, they're not usually trying to die,

65
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:25,970
but if they're not talking about it and getting help, they can accidentally do things that lead to death. So we want to get information about

66
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,260
either one of those, but understand that there's different things underlying them.

67
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,430
But either way, they're a sign of emotional pain and distress.

68
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,230
So I will often say,

69
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:44,840
the fact this is happening is kind of like when people are running a fever, it's your body's way of telling you that this is not okay, we're sending out the signal

70
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,560
that I am in a lot of emotional pain and I guess, I want it to end, I need to come down.

71
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,390
And so I'll tell students, the reason why I'm asking and the reason why

72
00:07:54,390 --> 00:08:01,400
I may ask, in a kind of an ongoing way, is because it's like emotionally running a fever,

73
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:08,050
and so we want to keep checking in, because just having thoughts that may be kind of like a fever of 101,

74
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:14,240
and we just need to manage it and get you some support and help. We also need to know if it goes above that 103,

75
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,980
104. And so the idea that I'm,

76
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,780
it makes sense that it's happening. It's a sign of emotional pain and we want to monitor it.

77
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:31,290
And we want to get people's support. We want to let them know that we're going to take it seriously.

78
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:40,120
So, with this means, it's important that if you get into this conversation and students are saying things like,

79
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,470
I need you to keep this a secret, I need you to keep this between us, it's important to tell them that that may not be possible.

80
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:54,400
And if you can't find ways to help them stay safe and supported that, you might need to bring in other resources.

81
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,360
And that that's like the most caring thing that you can do, because you really want to see them to the other side of this.

82
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:07,730
But being honest, upfront about that, excuse me, or even as you are in the conversation, that you're like,

83
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:15,230
I just want to pause for a second, because I want you to know that this may be a situation where we need to bring in more support.

84
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:22,830
The key here is that as you're having these conversations, you keep checking in with yourself,

85
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:28,050
and deep breathing, sometimes I know if a person is tense, I get tense,

86
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:34,420
and the more that I'm just breathing and that I'm calm, the more comfortable I am, the more comfortable they're gonna feel talking

87
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:39,380
with me about it. We don't worry about it too much, it's normal for there to be some discomfort in the conversation.

88
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:46,730
But we want to get as used to having the conversations as possible.

89
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:52,880
Depending on where the conversation goes, sometimes it can be important to ask some follow up questions.

90
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,530
So if a person says, yes, I am having those thoughts.

91
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:05,410
We don't know where to go next in the conversation and that can increase our anxiety. So you want to ask them,

92
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:16,080
do you have a plan, are you thinking about doing something soon? And they may say, yeah, I've thought about doing it this way,

93
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:22,110
but I don't have any intention to do it soon, I'm just kind of waiting to see how things go.

94
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,200
Or they may say, no, I haven't had any plans,

95
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:37,270
I'm just having a hard time figuring out how to manage it. If somebody, if you get the really clear sense that they just have passing thoughts,

96
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:42,460
absolutely no plans to act on it soon, it's going to be important that you connect them,

97
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:50,640
that's like you want them to have a therapist, you want somebody else to become involved who can help monitor and support them through it.

98
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,180
You may want to ask questions and we'll give you some links to some resources to,

99
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,890
you know, things that they might be able to do to help them through that time.

100
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:06,540
You want to help, for that day for that weekend, reduce their risk or reduce some of that emotional pain and get support.

101
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:17,390
And we're gonna give you guys some lists of ideas so that you can give it to them have them come up with ideas, but always give the crisis resources.

102
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,300
The text hotline, the national hotline, because even when they get done

103
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:28,410
talking with you, 30 minutes later they may be in a very different place, and you want them to have those resources

104
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,890
readily available. And if you're ever in doubt,

105
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:38,560
you never want to feel like you're trying to figure out the jigsaw puzzle on your own, if you don't feel like they're going to be

106
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,160
safe when you guys end your conversation, it's a good time to say,

107
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,100
how about you stay on Zoom or on the phone with me and text the crisis hotline?

108
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:57,990
Or how about you stay online with me and call the crisis line.

109
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,390
If it's not at that level, where you feel like they're fine,

110
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:06,910
they're just having a really hard time, it might be better to ask, like, who can be with you this weekend?

111
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:13,760
It just sounds like it's a lot, and I want you to have other support available. But

112
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,680
as a level of crisis goes up, you typically, if possible, want to stay on the line with them,

113
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,010
if you can't, you might say, is there a roommate there with you?

114
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:27,430
Is there a partner there with you, is there a family member there with you?

115
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:36,810
That you can kind of hear and confirm that's willing to stay with you while you contact emergency services.

116
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:42,060
Some things you kind of want to stay away from is shame, guilt and blame, so, you know,

117
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,890
you don't want to say things like you shouldn't be thinking about this,

118
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:51,080
why are you thinking about this?

119
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:59,170
People are usually already feeling really bad and hard on themselves, they're already feeling awful that these thoughts are occurring to them.

120
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,690
You don't want to use dismissive language, that's like, oh, it'll be fine, just stop worrying about this,

121
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:09,850
it's not that bad. You don't want to rush to positivity like, oh, you've so many good things going for you,

122
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:15,260
because often they know those things, but it hasn't decreased the emotional pain.

123
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:23,190
So you just want to validate that it's like, it's feeling really dark and heavy right now for you.

124
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:29,630
And so we just, how can we support you until things get better?

125
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:34,400
It may seem like that's not going to happen, but we want to stick with this process.

126
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,820
I believe that, slowly but surely, it can get a little bit less stressful than it is right now.

127
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:48,290
We want to stay away from oversimplified solutions. You don't want to try to wrestle them into doing things.

128
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:54,510
You know, it's like let's figure out what options, what level of help you feel comfortable engaging.

129
00:13:54,510 --> 00:14:02,850
So you're going to offer options and resources. The one exception to this, is again, if you don't feel like they're safe,

130
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:11,760
if you feel like it's a crisis and they hang up or end communication, that may be a time where you have to call emergency services.

131
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,320
We want to avoid unnecessarily invading their privacy.

132
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:25,330
So if you have the information that you need in terms of their safety, you don't necessarily need to go probing into asking more of what's going on,

133
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,300
if it's not directly related.

134
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:36,200
And also, even within the program itself, you want to be really careful about sharing people's private information with other professionals.

135
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,140
They're designated people within the program to check-in with about safety,

136
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,610
that's one thing. And even then,

137
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:52,340
you want to let students know kind of transparently what's happening so that they don't feel like everybody is talking about them behind their back.

138
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:57,940
And then, as we talked about early on, when we're talking about the role, you don't want to go beyond your training or your boundaries.

139
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,740
You don't want to over-promise, I can keep this a secret, I can be available 24 hours a day.

140
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:10,540
That's what the hotlines are for. You don't want to end up in that position. So you want to clearly communicate to them your boundaries and limitations.

141
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:16,390
So that might sound like, things like, I want to help you, but I want you to connect with more support, because

142
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:21,100
I think that's really what you need during this time. I can help you with some of this,

143
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,850
but some of this goes beyond what I'm capable of helping you with.

144
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:30,700
If you want to contact me about this, you can contact me by email, or during business hours,

145
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:36,360
but beyond that, I really need you to use these emergency services. I can talk, but

146
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,800
I've only got about fifteen minutes available, so I definitely want to hear and be of support,

147
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,900
but if more that is needed, let's connect you with some other resources.

148
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:56,000
And so you're, they may not love it, but you're being as clear as possible from the outside.

149
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,820
This is largely how you're gonna deal with this and then we'll talk about in the next module

150
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:11,280
some of the ways that you're going to kind of complete the circle of the process of helping students through crisis and distress.
