1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:10,930
Sort of like, you know. Yeah. And then and then this year, yeah, every time it's a very huge task.

2
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:21,220
It is, it is. Thank you so much. Yeah.

3
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:29,410
I mean. So, yeah, I get it, I usually get it.

4
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:52,590
Maybe next. OK.

5
00:00:52,590 --> 00:01:01,710
We are now into the world of parasites, and I have scheduled I'm going to try to do this lecture 200 slides.

6
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,830
I'm not going to try and do it all today, but I'm going to try and finish whatever.

7
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:14,190
I don't finish, I'm going to finish next time and then start the next group, which I think is mycology after that because we need to make up a day.

8
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,690
So I'm going to try and pull ahead a little bit each lecture so that we make up that day.

9
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:26,430
OK, so I know we haven't done any research yet.

10
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:34,290
You know, last week we asked, what are we going to do? Yeah, of course, I'm sorry we did do parenting, OK?

11
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,000
My problem then? I don't.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,760
Yeah, I have. We got it to. OK.

13
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,610
Escape. We're going to go up to 86. This makes things much better, actually.

14
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:56,920
I wasn't even thinking about that. I'm glad you guys remembered.

15
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,200
I was trying to figure out how to make up a day. OK.

16
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:14,570
Eighty six is Echo parasites now, I remember because we have this parasitic.

17
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:22,580
So now when we finish this, I'm going to have to figure out how to load up next, the next one, so then down here to help me.

18
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:28,040
OK. So after parasites, these are parasites that occur on the outside of the body.

19
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:37,940
Thank you both for telling me. OK. And so ex-city scapularis.

20
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:44,720
We did not know that we even had this tick in the state of Michigan before Lyme disease occurred.

21
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,270
OK. This is the the the tick that transmits Lyme disease.

22
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:56,840
And if you have ever have any of you ever tried to identify ticks in a laboratory, anybody?

23
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,000
OK, so you have good. So you notice that much?

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,450
Yeah, yeah. Right there. Then the black outer shell on the outside is distinguishing them from other types of of ticks.

25
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,010
When they are engorged, when they are filled with blood from a nice meal, they get much, much larger.

26
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:22,300
You look and you think, Oh my gosh, how come that the tick doesn't burst?

27
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:29,650
OK, so this is a map of where ex-City scapularis existed between 1997 and 1996.

28
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:36,910
And if you look here in Michigan, the blue is reported to be scapularis, but there wasn't very much there.

29
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:46,210
OK, so here we have the territory for the city scapularis, which is also known as the black legged tick,

30
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:53,300
and it is now basically across the entire eastern and central part of almost all the all of the central part of the United States.

31
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:59,780
Now it's not getting into the western states yet, but it will.

32
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:08,570
So and then we have a comparison of two maps of Lyme disease, Lyme disease risk in Michigan in 2009 and in 2014.

33
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,110
And what you can see in 2009.

34
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:22,370
Well, it came from I came across Lake Michigan first, the bottom of Lake Michigan from Illinois and went up the west side of the state.

35
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:29,330
We do have a little bit up here in the Upper Peninsula, but not very much because it's really too cold for the ticks up there.

36
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:42,080
But you can see that in the last five years, the number of counties that have a known risk for Lyme disease because they are in the Americas,

37
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,780
the ticks there has grown, as has the number of counties with potential risk for Lyme disease.

38
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,330
It's unconfirmed so far.

39
00:04:50,330 --> 00:05:01,370
So here where you are down here in Washtenaw County, we still don't have any formally identified cases of Lyme disease in Washtenaw County.

40
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:07,280
But and this is as of 2014, it will spread.

41
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:14,290
It will spread. So here we have the 20 21 Lyme disease mask map, excuse me.

42
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:21,340
And you can see it has spread across southeastern Michigan, except for a couple of counties where this potential risk.

43
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:31,270
And as with many other tick borne diseases, as well as any other diseases that are easily spread by arthropods,

44
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:36,100
they spread very easily and pretty soon the entire state will be covered by these ticks.

45
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:43,840
When we have the ticks, we have a greater chance of Lyme disease, and Lyme disease is an interesting disease.

46
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,650
A lot of people claim to have had Lyme disease and have not actually had.

47
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:56,290
It has not been proven in the laboratory to prove it in the laboratory, we can.

48
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:02,500
Well, somebody said this sends a tick to the lab. They will identify the tick. But that doesn't say that tick has Lyme disease.

49
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,520
We now have very good molecular tests for Lyme disease,

50
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:19,080
as well as very good tests for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi that would confirm that a patient had or did not have one disease.

51
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:26,460
So you see Dr. Mary Grace to be riskier, she's actually a really good friend of mine.

52
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,860
She's of the emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases for the state of Michigan.

53
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,030
Tick season is here. Do everything that you can to prevent tick bites.

54
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,930
Use bug spray. If you don't like it, wash it off when you come inside.

55
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,830
But it's very important to use bug spray.

56
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:50,370
The state wants you to enjoy the outdoors in beautiful outdoors here in Michigan, but they don't want people to be getting sick.

57
00:06:50,370 --> 00:07:03,870
So anaplasmosis can also be spread by ticks, and those cases are increasing, particularly in the Upper Peninsula, but they're both.

58
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:08,760
Both anaplasmosis and Lyme disease are spread by the same tick.

59
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,730
And it's it's definitely has black legs.

60
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:18,990
So if you see a tick and it's got like black leg crawling on you, I would advise you to get it off really rapidly.

61
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:26,700
So the best way is is mayor, Gray said. Is this way to prevent tick borne diseases is to prevent the bite.

62
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:31,350
You don't get bit, you're not going to get tick borne diseases. It's as simple as that.

63
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,760
Remove the tick rapidly if it's attached to you, monitor your health.

64
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,240
And if you think you're coming down with symptoms, get tested or very.

65
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:46,080
As I said, there are very good tests for Lyme disease. Consult with your physician or your health care provider.

66
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,660
So and it takes about one or two weeks of incubation before people start feeling sick after a tick bite.

67
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,490
So here's just some information from last summer from the health department.

68
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:56,820
That's right.

69
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:07,680
So another tick that we have here in Michigan and derma center variable us, and this tick is actually much more common than the Lyme disease tick.

70
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:16,990
OK, so this is dermis, and I'm very fabulous. And it can transmit a number of diseases that easily.

71
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:25,480
This is not common for Lyme disease, but can transmit silicosis broken spotted fever, which we don't have much of in Michigan, if at all.

72
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:34,720
And tularemia. So it's not a good thing to have crawling around on you or to have gotten bit by.

73
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:42,730
So when you get one of these tick borne diseases, is there a susceptibility testing?

74
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:49,090
Do we need to do susceptibility testing for these diseases? And the answer is no, we don't.

75
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:57,250
For the most part, is the previous. For these diseases shown here, we generally don't grow the organism in the laboratory,

76
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,500
occasionally we will, but not not more than we do, not because they're not bacterial diseases.

77
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:10,390
And there are viral rickettsia and there are means to detect them that don't require growth in the laboratory.

78
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:18,220
But. There is no easily done susceptibility testing for these isolates.

79
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:24,310
OK. We know that people are overtreated. We know that people get antibiotics when they don't need it.

80
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:36,730
But at this point in time, we have not seen, at least, I don't believe have been reported any antimicrobial resistance for these diseases.

81
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:45,170
So but when a physician or a health care provider is says we've got a positive test for the diseases or Lyme disease,

82
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,000
whatever it is, they'll consider the health of the patient.

83
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,900
Any known drug resistance that the parasite might have, it will be published any toxicity of the drugs.

84
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:01,870
You don't want to give too much and make a person toxic. And how much follow up and generally public health.

85
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:14,510
The public health department is on top of this, and the infectious diseases physicians at any institution also will be on top of this.

86
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:20,360
So what do we use for therapy? Well, these are the common agents metronidazole, also known as flagyl.

87
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:28,250
And that is good on against various protozoan parasites. Albendazole in the band, all these are commonly used for helminth,

88
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:36,680
the worms and then if it's Plasmodium, which would be malaria, we can use for a plan or mefloquine.

89
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:44,500
I think methyl probably has a few somewhat fewer side effects than Kaufman, but neither are both can be.

90
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:53,090
It can be used to treat infections with Plasmodium species.

91
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,890
So the big thing for these diseases prevent them.

92
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:06,950
You don't have to worry about treatment if you can prevent them. So a lot of factors come in here personal hygiene, sexual behavior changes.

93
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:12,210
And I believe that up to your imagination, appropriate sanitation.

94
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,670
Well, that is a big one. And then appropriate cooking and water treatment.

95
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:24,680
And so if you're out camping and there's this beautiful stream running by your campsite and doesn't like anybody else has been there, I could.

96
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,200
It's the water is so clear I can drink. No, you cannot boil it first.

97
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:38,840
You don't want to acquire anything that another animal, whether it's human or another animal who has gotten into that water.

98
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:45,470
If you are traveling, I know a lot of public health, people travel to other countries, they they they work in other countries.

99
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,160
Please, please,

100
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:55,550
please know what the endemic diseases are in the country to which you are going and take along the appropriate prophylaxis to prevent any disease.

101
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:04,160
And then, of course, we want to prevent exposure. And one of the ways is don't get bitten by a bug use bug spray, if you can.

102
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,370
And then we a nationally, we monitor the blood supply for things like malaria.

103
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:19,880
Did somebody donate blood and then found out that they had malaria so that that's going on also?

104
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,860
Now, this was written by a friend of mine who's the head of Parasitology of a Mayo Clinic.

105
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,830
Unfortunately, she does not write these anymore.

106
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:36,320
She was writing a column and she published online creepy, dreadful, wonderful parasites, and she present a case that she pretty much well.

107
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,090
Sometimes they were made up and sometimes part of them. Part of the cases were made up.

108
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:48,890
But it was interesting. You can probably go online and still find creepy, dreadful, wonderful parasites if you want to chuckle.

109
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:54,080
There's a lot of good information in there. She is a top notch parasitologist.

110
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:02,950
And so I would say if you if you want to read up on them, look for this online.

111
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:09,310
OK. What is this?

112
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:18,340
This is in week two 98 submitted to mail again, the source of the specimen is found in stool.

113
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:23,910
What is it? Anybody want to make a guess?

114
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:35,180
How about fake? Somebody was sure they had a parasitic infection, they submitted that, no, it's not a parasite, it's fake.

115
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:43,980
OK. That's it for the end of parasitology. Now I'm going to have to pull up another talk.

116
00:13:43,980 --> 00:14:09,860
So. Dan there.

117
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:15,980
That one is. Yeah, that's the present one, but I don't have the college elections with me.

118
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:35,150
Can I do it from the previous year, the files? No.

119
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:47,940
So. OK, I have made a big mistake here because I thought we were doing all parasitology today.

120
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:54,280
You all you all are going to get out quite early today and we will probably run longer for the next lecture.

121
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,220
Well, we'll do a lot of my colleagues in the next lecture. OK, and I'm very sorry about that.

122
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:10,260
I keep the flash drive in a plastic case and I left it on my desk at home, so.

123
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:19,060
Yeah. Yeah. And so I'm very sorry about this, but you're getting out early today.

124
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:24,987
If this is done, yeah.
