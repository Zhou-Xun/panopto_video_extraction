1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,190
Okay. All right. Welcome back. Sorry for the slightly slow delay to today's class.

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,950
So amazingly, this is the second last lecture of this unit already, also Q4.

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:28,250
So just as a reminder, so lipid metabolism today, lipid transport tomorrow, Wednesday, Wednesday, and then review session on Monday as per last time.

4
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,589
If there are topics specifically learning impact is that you want to make sure that we cover email them to continue

5
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:42,030
on before Monday so we can make sure that we have content that covers that going to be session exam on on Wednesday.

6
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,220
And then we have like one lecture on protein catabolism and ethics here.

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,510
So that's like the menu and like getting ready for the next meeting.

8
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:59,140
Okay. So today we're going to start with the food of the day and we're going to present it from the.

9
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:14,610
If it happens with no. And everyone hear me?

10
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,530
Yeah. I just hadn't realized it.

11
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,090
So I will be presenting polenta. So if you're not familiar with polenta.

12
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,440
What is that? Well. It's fine.

13
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:42,730
And I'm going to tell you all about it. Following a brief history of touring to begin with.

14
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,240
And then we'll talk about other plant biology of corn a little bit,

15
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,310
and then we'll go through some differences between different types of dried milk corn products.

16
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,760
And I will give you a little bit of that nutrition information, some research, and then some way to enjoy it.

17
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:09,490
All right. So the history of corn. So corn is part of the genus Zia, which is a group of grasses and Muslim Americans.

18
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,100
So evolved from this type of grass impact.

19
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,860
And that's only around the thousand B.C.

20
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:28,299
And then it was cultivated and domesticated by humans and eventually brought to Europe in the 15th century by the Spanish.

21
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,600
And then during this period,

22
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:42,309
basically the Portuguese were taking over the world and brought it to Africa in the 16th century and in Asia in the 16th century.

23
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:49,880
And that kind of spread all over the place from there. So how.

24
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,730
Well, it's pretty much a big lump with knobs as as the corn says.

25
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:03,500
And so here you can see the silks on the corn and the actual ear of corn.

26
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:09,820
That's the female part of the plant. And then there's a tassel at the top, which is it's essentially the male part of the plant.

27
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,410
So that is how pollination is essentially done.

28
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,350
And then on the left here, you can see the different parts of the kernel.

29
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,410
So on the inside is the germ.

30
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:33,040
So I know in other lectures we talked about specifically in like the wheat portion that the germ functions taken out and then germinated.

31
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,160
That is also true for corn. So that is that portion there.

32
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,350
And that is the most lipid happy portion of the corn.

33
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:47,560
The kernel surrounding that is the analysis firm, and that is essentially where all the starch is in the kernel.

34
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,580
And then surrounding all of that is the hall, which is the fibrous part.

35
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:01,930
So this gives a little kind of rundown about how corn is a little bit different from many other plants.

36
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:10,510
So as opposed to most other plants, which are C3 plants, corn is a C4 plant, which essentially makes it extremely high yield.

37
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:19,140
And that is because it has this extra portion where photosystem synthesis occurs

38
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:27,410
that is separate from where the rest of the carbohydrate portion happens.

39
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:35,950
So basically it like up top that little metal film cell there, that is where all the photosynthesis is occurring.

40
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:48,520
And the main difference between this and C3 plants is that it is a reaction that is also promoted by toxin, which we have talked about a little bit.

41
00:04:48,970 --> 00:05:06,380
But that essentially makes it so when all this is occurs, this is consistently turning CO2 into oxygen rather than binding to oxygen instead of CO2.

42
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:16,480
So it's just more green. And polenta is one type of out corn that are many.

43
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,700
So I'm sure most of you are used to probably grits or cornmeal or masa,

44
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:30,070
which are all kind of popular in the U.S. and they're all kind of generally prepared as a porridge like dish,

45
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,060
but they can be used for many, many different things.

46
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,450
So what's the difference between all of these? So the main difference is really their cultural significance.

47
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:49,040
So what region of the world you're in kind of dictates how you refer to polenta or grits or cornmeal.

48
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,230
So you can see this image here on your right.

49
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,030
There's a few different types also vary in coarseness.

50
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:05,060
So how fine or how grainy the consistency is and then the type of processing.

51
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:13,190
So some of them could be germinated or there's also a process called negative mobilization,

52
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,389
which essentially removes the hall of the contents of the fibrous portion.

53
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,130
And we'll talk a little bit about that more later on. They also can vary by the type of corn.

54
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,430
So these are two different types that we'll talk about a little bit.

55
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,010
All right. So here are two different types of corn.

56
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,860
There's technically six different types of corn,

57
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,200
but there's two of them that are primarily used for dry milling, and that is dump corn and flint corn.

58
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,660
So the main difference here is essentially the amount of endosperm that is available.

59
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:53,790
And so the inner softer portion of the endosperm that is higher in antelope has been,

60
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,740
whereas in harder types of corn such as Flint, it's higher in AMLO's.

61
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:08,100
However, the content kind of varies between different species of corn and whether or not it's genetically modified or not as well.

62
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,480
And then the processing method also kind of dictate the proportions of the endosperm germ and whole.

63
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:33,620
So stone ground corn meal, which you'll often see in like health food stores and things, that is actually the full kernel without anything removed.

64
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:43,660
Some grapes and polenta are generally germinated or those actually remove the germ part, which is the most lipid.

65
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:50,389
And so that removes some of that. But if you do see like the little black bits and grits or polenta, that's actually the germ.

66
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:59,060
So that's the most liquid that is portion. And then for next migration, that is the removal of the hall.

67
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:07,700
Now the hall is mostly heavy cellulose and so in order to break that down, there's actually a process called maximization.

68
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,379
And what that is essentially the kernel is soaked in an alkaline solution.

69
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:18,170
Generally it's lime. And so that softens that all of the corn and then it's able to be removed.

70
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:31,410
So here it kind of breaks down the differences. So with the different types that we're primarily used to seeing in the U.S. and have grits and Mozart,

71
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,620
you can see that it's partially due to the type of corn some glutton doesn't really as flint and corn.

72
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:47,399
If you're in Italy it's always going to be out of the later audio file and then it could be white or yellow medium.

73
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:55,650
And of course, generally polenta is a little bit more coarse and grits and then it's typically Germany added grape is very similar.

74
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:05,010
It could be made by plant corn as well. However, in the US oftentimes it is that point for like more cheaper, more processed types of grits.

75
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:11,190
It's usually a bit finer and then it is also germinated masa.

76
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:16,889
The really the main difference here is that it's always formalized and dominated.

77
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,100
So pretty much always with Masa you have the whole.

78
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,390
Here's a rundown of the macronutrients. So this is from the USDA legacy data,

79
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:41,600
which is a little bit confusing because they don't separate by type of corn that's used or anything specific from that regard.

80
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,880
It also combines both mozza and grits and polenta into one.

81
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,820
So it's a little unclear, but it did say that it was germinated and enriched.

82
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:00,260
So this kind of gives you the rundown. It's very carbohydrate dense, mostly starches,

83
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:13,100
which composes 72% and can vary and AMLO's time looked at ratio generally flint corn is more AMLO's heavy that corn is more millet pectin.

84
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,360
Heavy fiber is also very dependent on processing.

85
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,940
So we talked about the next embolization. Depending on that process, there could be more or less fiber.

86
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,820
And then protein is about 10% of the kernel composition.

87
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:37,430
And then lipid, which is the germ is the remaining which is generally going to be lower for.

88
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:44,150
And so anything that's germinated. So if you get something that is stone ground, it will be just a little bit of lipid content there.

89
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,110
So micronutrients.

90
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:55,460
So the main thing about corn that you'll you'll see come up a lot is that it's high in carotenoids, which can be good for eye health.

91
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,020
And then it's also a fairly good source of choline, which we've talked about a little bit in class.

92
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:11,000
I can reduce LDL and then aid in lipid metabolism and then there's also a fair bit of folate.

93
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,830
Now, I'm assuming that this is actually because it was fortified.

94
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,520
However, it didn't specifically say that or not.

95
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:28,340
But generally speaking, from what I've read, folate is definitely one of the main things that they add in when they go enrich the product.

96
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:40,100
And that is partially because, especially for Bassa in a lot of Latin American communities, there's a lot more likeliness of low folate levels.

97
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:45,680
So that's something that they've recently started doing in the last ten years or so is is adding and folate.

98
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,730
Particularly for moms. So you talk about cars without talking about GM laws.

99
00:11:54,180 --> 00:12:03,360
So GMO corn is just as nutritious and also bio fortified to increase lutein and carotenoids.

100
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:11,070
However, there are a lot of environmental concerns with this, so it's related to like monoculture,

101
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:17,130
deforestation and biodiversity and also concerns regarding herbicide use.

102
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,840
So basically, one to modify it.

103
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:27,870
One of the main things that's done is it makes the plant resistant to herbicides, so they're able to then use those herbicides on that product.

104
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:36,540
And there has been some research that that that could cause a couple of different issues that we'll talk about in the next slide.

105
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:47,460
In Italy, however, as you can see by this very Italian manner, the main concern is mainly with the heritage issue.

106
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:59,430
So Italians are like very, very into ensuring that their crops are ancient, essentially, and pure from their ancient predecessors.

107
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:08,940
So basically that is their main concern is that the pollen will transfer from crop to crop and essentially ruin the heritage of their crop.

108
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:19,050
So that is kind of the main concern there. But now it's technically not nutritious.

109
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:30,450
So herbicide use, this is one study that that kind of showed that the use of herbicides can actually change the nutritional content in the corn.

110
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:36,719
So you might depending on the type of herbicide that's being used and if there are multiple herbicides being used,

111
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,400
they can react with the corn and actually create slight differences in the nutritional value.

112
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:50,249
So for instance, this study did show some differences in the protein content and then it essentially also

113
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:56,100
showed that there is a more monosaccharides in comparison to disaccharides in the corn.

114
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:08,310
So Emilio's the amla pectin ratio. So this is something that definitely varies by corn type and also by modification.

115
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:22,770
So here you can see in the graph on your left there is on the top that's waxy corn starch and then corn starch, which have little to no families.

116
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:28,860
And then at the bottom 50, there's 50, 60, 70 and 80.

117
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,530
That's all the percentage of the AMLO's content.

118
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:42,390
So as you can see with more AMLO's, you do get less increase, rapid increase in glucose, blood glucose.

119
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:49,740
And then this is the same for the figure on the right and, and the figure of the right.

120
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:59,580
So sorry on the left with an in vitro study which was on the digestibility of corn and then on the right was actually a dietary study.

121
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:07,290
So the study on the right enrolled 29 participants and half of them had normal insulin response

122
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:13,020
and then half had higher than normal insulin response or their high growth hyper insulin.

123
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,060
So if you're looking at this graph, I'm not sure how like to see this,

124
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:26,370
but also the farmers in white that are on your left hand side, those are all the limit.

125
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:33,660
And then on the right and black, those are all people that had normal insulin responses.

126
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:45,000
And so as you can see in both of those groups, AMLO packed in blood glucose response and insulin response was much higher than that of AMLO's.

127
00:15:50,810 --> 00:16:03,380
So Dan coin versus flip a coin. So this and so this is a similar study to that second study.

128
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,010
However,

129
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:14,240
this was a dietary study where they actually used a robust and they used a right that had different percentages of families are more impacted.

130
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:32,480
And so on this slide here, you can see that with the AMLO's there is a lower rapid increase in blood glucose and insulin response as well.

131
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:46,600
So the question is hired into our current unit is anything I'm allowed to alter fatty acid oxidation.

132
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,260
So there's been a couple of different studies done on this.

133
00:16:51,400 --> 00:17:00,040
One of the studies actually showed that there was a slight increase in triglycerides and or fatty acid oxidation,

134
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:06,260
but actually on the right here did show that unfortunately, we don't have a graph of it.

135
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:15,279
But then there's this also this study, which is now enrolled, 12 healthy adults,

136
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,430
and they were given four meals a week or four meals over the course of four weeks.

137
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:29,990
So they're four weeks apart and they had different RS content, which is resistant starch, essentially resistant starch, just harmless.

138
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:33,640
So it's less rapid, less rapidly digestible starch.

139
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:44,620
And these people were given a three day lead and diet with some macronutrient with the same macronutrients as the test diets.

140
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:56,440
And the analysis accounted for about 30% of the participants daily energy needs, and it was measured by indirect calorimetry prior to this study.

141
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:10,270
So the test diets were about 55% carbohydrate, and then they standardized with like 15%, 15 and 30% fat as a percentage of their total energy.

142
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:17,470
And all meals were matched for the dietary fiber content and liquid volume for all of these people.

143
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,180
And basically what they found is that it was essentially inconclusive.

144
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:28,600
However, those with an anomalous content of 5.4% there,

145
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:37,480
those people did have a slight increase or a significant increase in fatty acid acid oxidation,

146
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:46,720
and they were not totally sure what could have caused sort of the difference just in that one value.

147
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:55,719
But what they concluded is that it could be possible that the increase in fatty acid fatty acid oxidation for that group

148
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:02,770
in particular was due to an increase in circulating short chain fatty acids from the fermentation of the animals.

149
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:09,340
So that fermentation is one one that was fermented.

150
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:20,600
It could increase the inhibition of glycolysis and via those that acetate butyrate that was created.

151
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,880
So essentially inconclusive. But actually there will be more studies on this in the future.

152
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:37,360
So is polenta really healthier? There seems to be a lot of news out there that maybe polenta is better than grits.

153
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,520
And essentially, that's just not not really the case.

154
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:48,170
Oops. Sorry about that, though.

155
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:57,710
Because essentially because there is no standardization in the U.S. of the types of corn that is used for the whole entire breadstick,

156
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,910
kind of it's comparable. And then with one coin, it does tend to have a higher MLS content.

157
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,980
You could say well blended bags is always one point when France is not.

158
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:17,950
But in the U.S., technically Flint or technically polenta could be made with that corn and technically grits could be made with one corn

159
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,220
and the content of AMLO's enamel impact and can also be very different depending on the modification of that corn.

160
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:33,910
So there are actually a lot of dense corn that are specifically modified to increase the percentage of the animals in that corn.

161
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:44,300
There are some misconceptions also that are brought about about just by social cultural context as well.

162
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:51,640
So in the U.S., that has definitely been an issue where people generally see grits as being a

163
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:59,680
predominantly minority type food that is very prevalent across black cultures,

164
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:09,490
Latin America and indigenous cultures. And so that has definitely fed into people's outlook on the nutritional value of that as well.

165
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,760
And then in the US there's no standard type of milling process or corn type.

166
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,180
So the milling process especially that's not standardized.

167
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,500
Generally, if you see Masa, that's going to be something where the recall has been removed.

168
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:33,130
But in terms of the German ization, that is something that is not always consistent and could be different within grids or within.

169
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:40,120
So really, it's more so just you have to look at the details of the nutrition content for both of them that could be the same.

170
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,620
So ways to enjoy it. You can pretty much do anything with it.

171
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:50,710
So it's very diverse. You can boil it into like a porridge, like consistency, which is how we're kind of used to it.

172
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:58,240
It can be grilled, which is my favorite, are fried or baked in either a casserole or a cornbread.

173
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:02,230
And it goes good with pretty much everything. Oh, yeah.

174
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:16,560
Does anyone have any questions? Questions.

175
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:23,510
Like the study that used about like pesticide effects that was on sweet corn.

176
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,610
Did you find anything about, like, this lighter than corn administration?

177
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:34,640
Great question. I didn't find anything. Well, specific to corn meal from those corn.

178
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:39,290
However, there there has been other studies done on that corn and what corn.

179
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:43,550
And it's essentially the same result where it's just kind of dependent on the herbicide use,

180
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:51,530
but then different herbicide react, giving you this kind of fact, that is pretty consistent.

181
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:05,050
May I ask about the study, about the comparisons of the times and cause of also close macro response?

182
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:15,450
As fast as that studies are run random around or just kind of the observational studies to see which study you're talking about.

183
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,650
You mean for this work? That's the study?

184
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:29,590
Yes. So that's one. So we didn't actually specify if the high ambulance corn in this was linked or not.

185
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:39,639
However, from the reading, we can essentially gather that it's most likely flat or it did say that it was genetically modified,

186
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,000
but it seemed like it was a genetically modified version of a flat corn.

187
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:50,830
Sometimes a lot of times the research, unfortunately, very specific on laying out the specific type of corn used.

188
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:57,490
A lot of times they might imply the animal was content rather than like the species of farming.

189
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,120
That makes sense. Does that answer your question? I think that.

190
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:07,920
Okay, any other questions? Okay.

191
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:16,230
You don't. Right.

192
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,350
And I was talking to.

193
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:43,340
Well, yeah, I guess you could say that.

194
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:52,430
Okay. All right. So we're going to start today. Just like the fatty acids synthesis and triglyceride synthesis where there was two steps, right?

195
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:57,100
There was the noble lipid genesis, followed by triglycerides, purification for oxidation.

196
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:02,209
It's the same two steps just in reverse. Right. So when we think of fats breakdown, we have to do it in a few steps.

197
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:06,410
The first is the breakdown, the triglyceride, and then the second is to do something with the barrier.

198
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:11,440
So the process by which the triglyceride broken down is called whole pulses.

199
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:15,589
And so this largely occurs, but not exclusively in the left side.

200
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,560
It hurts the smaller side in the in the liver.

201
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:30,110
But I decided to specialize for mobilization of fat tissues and they are released through signaling, which is both pKa and glucocorticoid dependent.

202
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,000
So in the case of adrenaline, as we talked about in its analysis,

203
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,219
I do promote the release of fat and then those fatty acids can be used for energy, right?

204
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,740
So that's diverting those fats to the heart and muscle.

205
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:48,379
On the other hand, glucocorticoids, which are the chronic stress response hormone that also promotes lipolysis.

206
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:55,910
It does a slower because of glucocorticoids. It's primarily a transcriptional response and it does that by increasing the amounts primarily of ATG,

207
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,680
which is one of the two light pieces that break down triglycerides.

208
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,340
In both cases, this is restricted by by insulin, right?

209
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,900
So insulin prevents lipolysis, whereas adrenaline and glucocorticoids promote it.

210
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,689
So to kind of highlight this a little bit, I want to talk a little bit more about this study.

211
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,010
I've been talking about it in terms of the role of the classes.

212
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,250
So I'm going to start to tell you the answer and then I'm going to go through what some of the data looks like.

213
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,420
So we've talked there's a whole lecture about an overlap analysis, and that overlap just generally occurs when you have high glucose and high energy.

214
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:38,830
And that's because you have this big demand for some patients. And we know that when people overconsume carbohydrates, they accrete more fast.

215
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,049
Right. And for a long time, we thought that was because of de novo.

216
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:49,370
Look, just so you're taking those carbohydrates and you're converting those into triglycerides by the rate of fatty acid synthesis.

217
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:56,750
Right. But this study here, this isn't a new study, but this is, I think a pretty good study actually shows that that is actually incorrect.

218
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:03,110
The reason that you accrete fat mass when you have high carbohydrate diet is not because of the noble of Genesis.

219
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,850
It's because of sparing of parts when you have carbohydrate access.

220
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,600
So I'll walk you through the study and sort of what what this means.

221
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:18,200
So there's three groups here. There's a control group, and then there's two groups for carbohydrate, overfeeding,

222
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,910
the glucose in the super doses, it turns out, over a matter of minutes.

223
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,070
So there was an overfeeding where people were providing excessive carbohydrates here and here.

224
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:33,320
And you can see there was a big increase in the amount of fat that was start with the small increase, the amount of carbohydrate.

225
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:40,220
This would be of course mostly glycogen which in front of you, but there was an increase in the amount of fat that was in that person.

226
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:40,810
Well,

227
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:46,430
what they did in this study and this is very similar to the study I showed you where they do the carbohydrate repeating and there's fat accretion.

228
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:51,650
The difference in this study is they directly measured the rate of fatty acid to double that for Genesis.

229
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:58,790
And this see this little tiny piece right on the top here, that's the amount of the noble lipid genesis that contributed to the fat.

230
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,500
So they were able to use radio isotopes to figure out how much of this fat is actually deniable with the genesis.

231
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:12,290
And they found that actually it is not due to the, you know, blip genesis, this positive level, it's mostly due to you just stop burning fat.

232
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:19,399
The reason you're you have to imagine you're constantly worrying about all the time when you have high carbohydrate, you stop burning fat.

233
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,640
And we'll talk more in a couple of slides about the mechanisms for that.

234
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,079
But that's why fat levels increase, right? So you're just not using the fat in your body.

235
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,850
You turn off fat oxidation. And that's what most of the effect of fat accretion is.

236
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:36,440
The amount that the novel lipid genesis contributes is a very, very, very, very small effect.

237
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,010
If you go back to this, it was last classes notes.

238
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,510
Part of that is because the novel lipid genesis so energetically cost, right?

239
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,630
It was like 215 atpase per fatty acid, right?

240
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:52,190
So that's like 680 piece per per trimester, right? So it's very, very energetically costly.

241
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,460
So you generally don't do that to normal epigenetics. It's still important.

242
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,600
But quantitatively, in terms of the amount of fat when you overconsume carbohydrates,

243
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:05,540
it's actually not that it's mostly due to the fact that the sense okay,

244
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:12,379
so it's been a little while since we did one of these, so we're going to spend the next 15 minutes here or so doing one of these concept maps.

245
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,980
I think some of the slides are some of the slide is is turned off.

246
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:25,189
So we'll spend about 15 minutes on this again. So you know the drill and get in here first and then there's two groups later and again,

247
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:31,460
all circling around to try to help if you have any questions that I a commitment.

248
00:29:34,290 --> 00:30:23,170
I feel like I'm telling you this, but I'm not so sure about because it's not like I think the first question I what to know what I mean.

249
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,290
Oh, yes.

250
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:47,430
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

251
00:30:47,590 --> 00:31:04,400
Because if you do service, it's implications for all the schools.

252
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:11,260
And just this last one in the press conference.

253
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:21,220
So there's yeah. So there's two ways to design a solution.

254
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:29,650
So one thing is, I don't participate in this.

255
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:40,810
I think it's complicated. So when you have a couple hundred people, you're going to have this great plus part of it, right?

256
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:45,670
So it's like one speaker and then like three students.

257
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:55,470
Yeah. Yeah. They're very, very we were like, okay, issue.

258
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,400
And then we'll talk about now 71.

259
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:07,270
Yeah, you know, I think so. I think that helps because you will teach other.

260
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:23,660
Yeah. So even if I'm just talking, just, you know, like I'm so confused.

261
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,850
So this person, so to speak.

262
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:45,940
And then when I say like you put all of the rest of what you're saying, those are like this.

263
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:50,910
I mean, this is not very long duration.

264
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:57,690
And the second step is what you wanted in there.

265
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:13,560
You've got to get to the regulars. You need to know didn't do anything.

266
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:35,410
I just find it hard to realize, Oh, he's been asking me to more solutions.

267
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:51,850
Well, that happens. There's another part when I get to dance where it's going to turn when I'm on line.

268
00:33:53,320 --> 00:34:07,110
So when you're promoting the material with that, that's what he's going to get through it.

269
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:14,860
So it's not going, oh, oh, it's going to I mean, it will in the first place,

270
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:30,820
but it's not the of is kind of what I said, I don't know for example the cell and because like when I.

271
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,240
It's not like it's all about, you know, it.

272
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:42,699
I just. No, I'm just saying. Only works with.

273
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,290
Can't seem to indicate that. Yeah.

274
00:34:44,620 --> 00:35:01,239
So, so as you go through this makes it easier to write about trying to figure out what is wrong with oxen, which means a lot to me.

275
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:14,860
And in terms of, you know, reading plans that I'm pretty sure let's assume the way to maintain social distancing themselves.

276
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:21,040
Right. Well, I think it's hard to do.

277
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:40,870
Yeah. So it's you know, I know it's still cool.

278
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:51,639
And that's why it's so that's why I think I want to know how to win this thing.

279
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:57,460
There's no question asked into it.

280
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:05,949
Eventually. It wasn't easy since we always make 16, which is a long season.

281
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:14,260
The fourth person to ask that you think is a little I don't think they'll say, did you find it very easy?

282
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:23,910
Is that something that some companies like?

283
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:41,170
Yeah, definitely. And also, if you look at the struggle page where every morning, oh, shoot, when you do that.

284
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:53,770
So yeah, I like I guess it's easy to see what the truth is, whether or not they get to go round.

285
00:36:53,980 --> 00:37:06,760
And Olivia again, the one that we were executing once again, since then it's been able to go somewhere with much more success in 2016.

286
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:12,670
Yeah, I mean I was like, I'm trying to connect with where.

287
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:18,320
Yeah. I think that's what was supposed to take place later on.

288
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:22,360
I was actually we can't do that.

289
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:39,400
So I think I mean that isn't always surprising is dudes can I on the other side of that to us it's just

290
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:55,520
a whole lot like going back to the question that I realized there and it never transmission and I,

291
00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:23,830
you know, I just want to make sure that everybody else is that sorry I'm drawing they're

292
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:31,390
looking at the figures and they're just trying to like what exactly is on right now.

293
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,780
And I think that's right.

294
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:49,810
And so then if you show me, I'm like, oh, my goodness.

295
00:38:51,250 --> 00:39:08,889
Yeah, that's that's easy. But it's like somebody who is just like, that's what my friend here,

296
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:18,130
the diesel is like over time and he's I try to stress and that you and it seems like Andrew

297
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:29,290
was on one side and that's why I don't feel that way that when you have this this breakdown.

298
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:44,850
Send her back to the U.S. where this incident happened.

299
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:52,410
I am sure that work is the process.

300
00:39:53,190 --> 00:40:03,240
Like when glycerol is on the side of protein and almost everything here is happening in.

301
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:15,030
The only thing that is not an asset class is fatty acid oxygen and remains the energy source for us.

302
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:30,560
So maybe we should try this.

303
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:38,939
Yes. How is it not needed?

304
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,149
Finances? I guess would be. Okay.

305
00:40:42,150 --> 00:41:14,240
We'll spend one or two more minutes on this and then we'll move on to the rest of the short and long term history of science.

306
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:32,070
I would like to use the word challenge.

307
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:45,380
I would say you are right there with your family and friends.

308
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:55,430
You have to hear yourself so that if you want to be able to use them, they're involved with this.

309
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:07,790
Just add. Mistress Grace was suddenly very quiet.

310
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:13,430
So we presume we've all got everything on this list, on all of your diagrams, and there's no questions or concerns.

311
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:18,439
So, again, when you submit this, make sure you circle or highlight if you want sort of extra help or confused,

312
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,000
or you could figure out where to put one of these. Okay.

313
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:27,760
So I'm going to move on here a little bit to fatty acid oxidation.

314
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:33,140
So there's sort of two important initial steps to the fatty acid oxidation.

315
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:38,990
So the first step, and this is not thought to be highly regulated, is you need to activate the fatty acids.

316
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:45,020
So we're going to see this a lot. In fact, we've already seen it with a subtle way in terms of pyruvate,

317
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:52,340
but generally to break down a fatty acid substitute for many amino acids, you need to add a captivating groove to it.

318
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:55,969
So in the case of fatty acids, it's a colleague, right?

319
00:42:55,970 --> 00:43:01,790
So you are taking your fatty acid after it's been broken off from this premise, trying to transport it where it's being oxidized.

320
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:06,690
And then the first step is in this ATP dependent process, you add a Coke.

321
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,280
So to be clear, this is basal anywhere.

322
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:13,460
That means a sole is interchangeable with fatty acid, right?

323
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:19,070
It's not the same as a setup. And I will try very hard to clearly not establish pronunciation.

324
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:24,440
So that activation the fatty acid, that's the first important required step.

325
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:30,860
It's actually also the first important required step for fatty acid test verification into a triglyceride.

326
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:31,999
So in both cases,

327
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,100
the first thing you need to do is to add the co group to the fatty acid and then it's available for either oxidation or for triglyceride synthesis.

328
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:43,830
So probably that's why this step is not highly regulated, right?

329
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:48,290
Because it's not directional in one way or the other, right? This is the important first step that you have to do.

330
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:55,400
So it's important you can do it, but it's not regulated by, say, insulin or adrenaline, broccoli.

331
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,719
All of the regulation of fatty acid oxidation occurs at the transport.

332
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:06,140
So lose actually kind of interesting contrast to when we're talking about pyruvate of catabolism.

333
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:12,800
Remember, pyruvate gets into the mitochondria through this pyruvate transporter and we don't think that Pyruvate Transporter is regulated at all.

334
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:19,040
It's regulated all these other steps before and after that for the transport is not regulated right in the case fatty acids,

335
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:22,770
this is the regulatory step. Everything after this is kind of not required.

336
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:26,629
So you can kind of think of fatty acid oxidation is there's either a door in your

337
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:30,260
mitochondria that's opened a lot of fatty acids be oxidized or that door is closed.

338
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:36,110
Right. And that's the only thing that matters is the door. Once it gets in there, it's going to go off and get oxidized kind of whatever.

339
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:39,890
Normal, right? Right. Well, the key step is opening and closing of that door.

340
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,940
And that door is the carnitine transport system.

341
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:47,890
So what it's going to do is it's going to exchange this co group.

342
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,520
Remember, we just activated the fatty acid by adding the group for a carnitine.

343
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:52,760
Right?

344
00:44:52,760 --> 00:45:01,530
Carnitine is another molecule and it's now going to allow the transport of the basal carnitine from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix.

345
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:04,129
Once it's in there, the reaction is reversed.

346
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:10,400
So now you swap back the carnitine for the same CO and that's what's going to allow the patient for you to continue to be reactive.

347
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:14,689
So again, this is somewhat similar to the ATP citrate.

348
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:16,339
Why is citrate synthase step right?

349
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:23,690
Where in that case you take a citric acid and you turn it into a citrate, turn it back into a nice subtle quick right because of the transport.

350
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:29,300
So it turns out we don't have an asal co transporter but we do have an ASAL carnitine transporter.

351
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:33,500
Right. Nothing's called pickax or in this case which is called translocation.

352
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:36,500
So again, that's the key regulatory step.

353
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:43,459
Now it turns out this is not apparently important for the oxidation of short chain and medium chain fatty acids.

354
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:49,040
Right. So they apparently do not matter if there is active CPG within regulation.

355
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:54,950
And now again right now sometime people say, oh, it just magically gets across the membrane shortening medium chain fatty acids.

356
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:59,150
What's it been there and it's regulated again. My guess is that's probably not true.

357
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:02,840
There probably is a short chain and medium chain transporter. We just don't know what it is.

358
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,960
But what we do know is that it is not regulated.

359
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:10,760
Right, which means that if you have a short chain or medium chain fatty acid, it will always be oxidized.

360
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:15,500
Whether your body needs that a subtle way or not, it'll always be oxidized no matter what.

361
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:23,430
Right. And again, that's one of the reasons why medium chain fatty acids and short chain fatty acids are becoming so quick, very quickly.

362
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:26,440
And they can result in mutagenesis pretty rapidly.

363
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,760
Now, carnitine, because you've been to a health food store, you might see carnitine is sold as a supplement.

364
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:39,110
So this means some to me intuitive sense that you need carnitine in your body to be able to do this transport.

365
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:42,750
And if you don't have carnitine in your body, then you will not be able to oxidize.

366
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:51,970
And that is true. You do need to have carnitine to is not yet, but virtually everybody can make plenty of carnitine on their own.

367
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:59,300
In fact, there's not a single person that I know of that is well, they've ever been described that is unable to make Carnegie.

368
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:02,640
Right. So even though carnitine makes sense that it might help with fatty acid toxins.

369
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:05,569
There's actually no evidence that it helps because everybody,

370
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:12,830
virtually everybody has sufficient carnitine in their carnitine is very prevalent in things like meats and anything that comes from muscle tissue.

371
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:18,300
Right. So but even people who are on pure vegan diet, their carnitine levels tend to be pretty bright.

372
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:22,850
So there's not a lot of evidence that that particular supplement has as much of an effect.

373
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:26,240
So it's a little hard for me to to do my normal what if this doesn't work thing?

374
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:32,330
So the genetic deficiency here is actually not carnitine synthesis, it's actually carnitine transport.

375
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:37,400
So carnitine is largely made in your kidneys and then it's transported to your muscles.

376
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,980
And there are individuals who have defects in carnitine transit.

377
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:48,230
Right? So they can still make carnitine, but they just can't get it into into the muscle cells, particularly the heart and the muscle cells.

378
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:54,740
This is just the synthesis of carnitine to come from lysine and finding. These are three things that almost everybody should be repeated.

379
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:59,120
There's a bunch of steps that require vitamin C and Iron and vitamin D and niacin.

380
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:05,060
But as long as somebody is replete in all of those things, they can make carnitine on their rep.

381
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:08,389
Again, it's not limiting in non meat eaters.

382
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:13,310
There's no evidence of deficiencies in vegetarians, so therefore there no dry eyes associated with carnitine.

383
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:21,460
And again, if you look at the data of people who consume supplementation for the that the transport deficiencies led to the role

384
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:28,010
of genetic deficiency here it's reduced transport in cells so it's medium and it's rare one 67,000 people so rare,

385
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,600
but it's not so rare that if you worked as a clinical dietitian that you probably wouldn't come across somebody in your career.

386
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:36,410
Now, there's two big symptoms here. What is cardiomyopathy?

387
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:40,700
So that is effectively lack of fatty acid utilization in the heart tissue.

388
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:47,750
Heart tissue is a very avid user of fatty acids. In fact, most of the ATP generated in the heart is from fatty acid oxidation.

389
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:53,940
Right. So that's why this presents here, because as your heart doesn't have enough contractile ability, it builds more tissue, right?

390
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:58,580
Because it's saying, well, this isn't working lot better need more heart muscle. That's what cardiomyopathy is, right?

391
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:05,060
So it's growth of of the heart. They also hypo ketones give you that hypo key tonic hypoglycemia.

392
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,390
That's because they have low ketone bodies and low glucose. Right.

393
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:14,450
And again, part of that is because they don't have the energy to break down fatty acids in the liver, which is important for gluconeogenesis.

394
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:19,730
And also, since they're not breaking down fatty acids, they also don't have any ability to make ketone bodies.

395
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:24,270
So that's how these people present. So that's sort of what would happen if this not does not work.

396
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:31,460
Great. Okay. So you have this on your slide and the version on your slide does not look as cool as the version on my animated painting.

397
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,570
So you're going to see slide. There's like a bunch of axes.

398
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:38,030
I'm going to maybe go through this a little bit slowly because I think this animation really does help.

399
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:47,480
As I said, the most important regulatory step for both fatty acid synthesis and for fatty acid oxidation is this diagram here, right?

400
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:52,910
So you see a subtle point from off slides, which was a step we talked about last class.

401
00:49:53,060 --> 00:50:00,080
It converts acetyl quite to mobile. All right. If you're going on to make fatty acids and triglycerides, this is a positive regulatory step.

402
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,630
Right? So you go down this pathway right here.

403
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:10,720
However, at the same time, when you have a buildup of a little COA in the cytoplasm, that's what inhibits CPT, right?

404
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:16,010
So this is an important point. There is no direct regulation of the CBT one for the three different causes.

405
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,760
It's the most important dor for the mitochondria, but there's nothing like CBT.

406
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:23,600
One is phosphorylated by adrenaline or anything like that.

407
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:33,380
It's an indirect regulation through the levels of a little wiring which is now affected by the levels of or the activity of is easing.

408
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:40,190
And that's the part here. Okay. So the main reason you have this loop is that prevents you from oxidizing lipids

409
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,699
while you're on conditions where you're doing the donor of all the biogenesis.

410
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:49,040
Right? Again, it's the corollary to you're not going to undergo glycolysis y you undergo gluconeogenesis, right?

411
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:55,189
So that's why this loop kind of evolved in terms of how it's regulated.

412
00:50:55,190 --> 00:51:02,509
The regulatory step here for both of these processes is XY and so called adrenaline and energy needs.

413
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:06,500
They can inhibit XY. And so this gets a little confusing.

414
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:13,670
So if you inhibit HCC, you get less stimulated COA, which means you're now taking the brakes of CP one.

415
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,300
And so it's like a double negative. Negative regulation here will result in more activation of CP one.

416
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:27,390
And this occurs both with adrenaline and energy need, adrenaline by peak energy needs by EPA.

417
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:34,490
And once that becomes D braked here, that is going to allow for fatty acid oxidation.

418
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:38,600
And those ACL cones that you made are not going to go towards triglyceride synthesis.

419
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:48,100
So that's the first step here. So that's going to if you have insulin, for example,

420
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:56,500
that is going to promote more of a lot of away and less oxidation if you have adrenaline and you just want to decompress.

421
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:01,690
CBT one block triglyceride synthesis and cause more bang acid oxidation.

422
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:08,230
And so, like I said, I would definitely recommend trying to draw this out for yourself to try to convince yourself.

423
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:12,040
Adrenaline more fatty acid oxidation insulin less fatty acid.

424
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:19,290
So going back to my example from the beginning of each.

425
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:34,040
Yeah. Okay. So what I'm telling you here is what happens when you have high levels of insulin is not that you make more limits to know if you do,

426
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:40,590
but it's not that much what you do with your sparing your fat when you have high levels of carbohydrates.

427
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:44,880
Okay. So not for you, but two different ways by which insulin accomplishes this.

428
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:50,310
Right. Okay. So here's what you can cause the sparing of fat by two different mechanisms.

429
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:55,110
Okay. You want to transfer the gas on one or both of those mechanisms?

430
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:08,170
One of the mechanisms is using thing, right? So definitely one mechanism is going to be the suppression of Lipolysis, right?

431
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:14,680
So as you have high insulin, that's going to keep the triglycerides in your adipose tissue because you don't break down triglycerides,

432
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:18,100
you cannot transport triglycerides correctly by about a first issue.

433
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:25,360
You have to turn them into fat. So that's definitely one of them. So one big part of this fat accretion here is the suppression of the pulses.

434
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:31,450
And frankly, that just keeps fat in your in your adipose tissue sort of no matter what is that one mechanism.

435
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:34,600
So what's the other thing that insulin does in this?

436
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:39,910
One of the things I've heard today that would also result in more fat accretion.

437
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:51,570
Promotes the Milano coin, which will have regulatory effect on us.

438
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:55,650
Yeah, exactly. So insulin will also.

439
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:04,200
I don't have insulin on here, but insulin will also promote activation of HCC and that is going to promote the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation.

440
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:10,290
So what happens when you do high carbohydrate overfeeding and people accrete more fat if you

441
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:14,550
are suppressing lipolysis and at the same time you're also suppressing fatty acid oxidation.

442
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:22,049
Right? So that's why lipids are spare. Right. And again, this is the way the body adapts to there's an excess of a different macronutrient right now.

443
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:27,450
There's an excess of carbohydrates. I might as well save this fat for later because I have plenty of carbohydrates right now.

444
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:34,530
And again, this is similar to what we talked about with Harvard kinase, where when you have plenty of amino acids, you suppress lipolysis.

445
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:40,320
Right. And we won't be surprised here. We get to amino acid oxidation in the same kind of ways are going to kind of work.

446
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:47,820
Right. So you always spare the macronutrient that is limiting to preferentially burn the macronutrient that you have in excess.

447
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:57,910
All right. So that is sort of all the short term regulation of fatty acid oxidation in terms of long term regulation of fatty acid oxidation.

448
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:04,090
This is largely transcriptional and it's regulated by two somewhat poorly named, properly,

449
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:09,970
somewhat confusingly named transcription factors called P part alpha and P part of Delta.

450
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:16,270
So what these factors are is they detect high levels of fatty acids and they preferentially seem

451
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:21,930
to like polyunsaturated fatty acids and they promote the transcription of a bunch of these genes.

452
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:26,400
So proximal genes, which we'll talk about a minute, mitochondrial mate oxidation,

453
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:34,690
they promote the synthesis of more mitochondria and at the same time they suppress SRP, BP and some of the lipid genic genes we talked about.

454
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:41,589
So pars are are popular drug targets, right.

455
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:48,410
Because one theory is that if you can just increase somebody's rate of fatty acid oxidation, that might be beneficial for some.

456
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:51,340
In fact, some people have argued that if you increase fatty acid oxidation,

457
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:55,899
that might even cause weight loss in the way that sometimes you go on a treadmill and you go into the fat burning zone,

458
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,410
you're like, That's great, because I don't burn fat, right?

459
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,950
But literally, I've said a thousand times already, you need to be in a calorie, calorie deficit, right?

460
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:07,920
If you just induce fatty acid oxidation without being a calorie deficit, you're actually not going to lose any fat.

461
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:14,320
Right? That's not how that's not how calories. But what this might be particularly useful for is oxidizing fat.

462
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,819
We don't want that. Right.

463
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:24,100
So one idea is if you can come up with a drug that targets peppers and deliver to the liver, that could be a therapy for fatty liver disease.

464
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:28,030
Right. Because you're preferentially oxidizing fatty acids out of your liver.

465
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:33,309
Right. Ideally using that. So that is an area of active drug development.

466
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:39,549
People try a lot of different people are alpha activators in the liver and so far there's not

467
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:44,980
too much for use here because it turns out you burn the fatty acid and then you're replacing it.

468
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:51,549
Of these two signals, people are often people are delta are also increased in response to exercise.

469
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:54,850
Right. So we've talked before about the chronic adaptation of exercise.

470
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:59,860
One of these chronic adaptations is the activation of these people are alpha and delta.

471
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:05,100
And again, the idea here is that now makes your muscle more effective at burning fat, right?

472
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:11,920
Both by creating more mitochondria and then by transcription by increasing a bunch of these genes, including 61 and 72.

473
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:18,970
All right. So that's sort of the chronic regulating here. So where the P powers are sort of a lipid oxidation transcription factors.

474
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:27,229
Sorry, BP was the lipid synthesis. I don't know if you said this, but it's the papers are also found in your muscle.

475
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:30,160
And how would it help fatty liver disease, like how much to target?

476
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,550
Well, certain drugs must go to your liver right now because they're pharmacokinetics.

477
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,750
And it turns out Delta is both in both tissues.

478
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:40,840
But there's a little more Delta in muscle, a little more outline in liver,

479
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:45,969
but most of most of the way it works and it doesn't work right now, but like the way that people think going work is by targeting the drugs.

480
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:50,530
It's still circular. So theoretically, if they're using it for weight loss drug,

481
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:56,110
could you use it to target a receptor that's like found more frequently, like in adolescents, you know,

482
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:58,450
because so again,

483
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:04,510
what would happen is if you just told you what they just hold your muscle like I've got a magic trick and I'm going to make you burn fat, right?

484
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,809
It doesn't matter, because that fact when I get to your muscle, right?

485
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:11,950
Like the muscle can have as much fatty acid oxidation at once, but there's not much fat in your muscle.

486
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:15,010
Right? You're still dependent on the rest of your body transforming it,

487
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:21,280
and your body will transport it if your body if your liver or your liver adipose tissue needs that energy.

488
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,219
Right. And so this is the corollary to what I was saying.

489
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:28,660
If you might think that somebody who has high levels of the normal of a genesis might be more prone to obesity.

490
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:30,270
That is also not true, right?

491
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:35,710
Somebody is better at oxidizing and they might be a better endurance runner, for example, but they're going to be less prone to be obese.

492
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:39,460
Right. Because like I said, they're still not burning. They're still not necessarily unemployed.

493
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:43,810
They might just be using different fuels and different times. Okay.

494
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:50,110
So Peroxidation goes through sort of the reverse cycle that fatty acid synthase went through.

495
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:53,370
We want chemistry here. You don't need to worry about most, most of it.

496
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:57,940
The only two things I want to highlight here is you start with a fatty acid and present here.

497
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:04,570
This is a long chain saturated fatty acid. The first step is actually the introduction of a double bond here.

498
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:07,299
Right? So that's right here. So that's the first step.

499
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:14,110
And then you go on and then as you go through this process, you release out and a subtle CO which has two carbons right here, one here.

500
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:23,170
You generate some energy, you use up an appendage here and then you generate it and then you release the acetyl plant.

501
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:29,049
Therefore you go through the cycle every cycle you drop off to at some point at a time, right?

502
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:32,290
So every single cycle you'll burn up to a certain point, right?

503
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:38,620
So if you have a PALMITATE, which is a T 16, you go through the cycle seven times to to break that down.

504
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,880
So in general, puberty movies are oxidized a little bit faster.

505
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:46,420
As I said, short and medium chains are also oxidized much, much faster.

506
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:53,530
And again, that's more of a function of they're more effectively transported into the Punjab and they are directly transported straight to the liver.

507
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:57,910
Now, where this doesn't actually work is the very long chain fatty acids.

508
00:59:57,910 --> 00:59:59,830
So as we talked about, those are the pufas, right?

509
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:06,550
So the mega three omega six fatty acids, it turns out those are not oxidized primarily in the mitochondria, at least not at the start.

510
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:11,360
So they are oxidized in a different organelle, which is called a paroxysm, right?

511
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:14,740
That's actually what the P and p r stands for as truck systems.

512
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:19,510
So these are, it looks like very similar reactions here.

513
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:22,120
But there's two really kind of fundamental differences.

514
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:34,690
One is that instead of generating oxygen, so instead of generate any age, you're going to generate peroxide instead of ATP.

515
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:35,150
Right.

516
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:42,309
And since you generate peroxide, as we talked about, in the chemical phosphate that way, now you need to use catalase to get rid of that peroxide.

517
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:47,440
Right. Because you're not generating any age that can go through the electron transport chain.

518
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:51,430
You're actually not generating any energy when you oxidize a fatty acid in the process.

519
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,500
Right. So all it does is it breaks it down,

520
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:59,320
but it's not coupled to the electron transport chain because there isn't an effective electron transporting in the mitochondria.

521
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:08,560
So you can sort of think of a product as long as it's kind of cleaning out pufas, but it is not directly using it for energy producing purposes.

522
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:12,429
And so we don't know a lot about, for example,

523
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:17,860
when a fatty acid is going to be shown to be broken down in terms of approval, we know, again, this is highly regulated.

524
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:22,140
People by the whole proof levels have less proof of oxidation. So there is some sensing here.

525
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:24,610
So they don't know exactly what the mechanisms for this are.

526
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:31,750
In fact, the idea of studying proximal oxidation is relatively new and the regulation of that is is pretty new.

527
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:38,230
There is a defect. There's a defect for very long chain fatty acid, and that is called Zellweger's head.

528
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:44,200
And that is a center where you have a buildup of very long chain fatty acids and impairment of heart function.

529
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:48,730
I'll talk about that in a couple of slides. So that's one edge case where I keep a very, very long fatty acid.

530
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,700
So that will work. I think it's broken down.

531
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:59,500
What seems the most likely thing is it gets broken down to like around ac6 or so and then it can go to the mitochondria and get oxidized there.

532
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:04,360
Right. But again, that varies a little bit depending on conditions. Is a CPG one an active or not?

533
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:08,559
The other exception here is on chain fatty acids.

534
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:14,020
So sometimes even though we don't make them, we may consume a fatty acid that is a C 15 or a C 17.

535
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:21,820
So for example, cow's milk often has reasonable amounts of on chain fatty acids, and that's because they do fermentation of fatty acids in there.

536
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:26,500
Or the difference here is that since you end up, you're always going to end up with an odd number.

537
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:33,220
So when you get down to five instead of four beta oxidation, you would do more and then you end up with two stomach waves.

538
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:39,940
In this case, you're going to settle quite. And then a three carbon thing which is called Propionate, which is shown right here.

539
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:47,230
So we can do with probing. Okay. It turns out Propionate can be quickly converted into such a way away, which is a tissue is like intermediate.

540
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:49,570
So it is indeed and a chloride.

541
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:59,080
This whole process here especially this methyl will auto co a three that more or mutates down here requires vitamin B12.

542
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:04,299
Right. So one of the roles of vitamin B12 is to enable on chain fatty acid oxidation.

543
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:07,450
And as we'll talk about when we get to amino acid oxidation, many, many,

544
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:12,189
many amino acids turn out they metabolized to two probably not quite right so

545
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:16,690
it's important to for these so I mentioned a few of these disorders already.

546
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:21,490
I just want to introduce the idea of like how can we tell if somebody has some of these disorders?

547
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:29,709
So most in most countries, especially all across America, there's newborn screening of a lot of these genetic deficiencies.

548
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:34,390
Right. So there's lots of screening of every single baby that is born in America and in particular in Michigan.

549
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:38,260
All of these deficiencies are tested for at the newborn level.

550
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:42,970
Now, they're all pretty similar. And then in all cases, they're going to go to impairment of fatty acid.

551
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:49,420
Right. And you can see this is a whole bunch of genes we've talked about, including the CP one system and that.

552
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,680
And then the very long chain is of course, dehydrogenase.

553
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:56,640
So all of these cause some type of defect in fatty acid oxidation.

554
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:01,630
Right. So I have a question for you. Does that mean you should suggest that somebody should eat no fat at all?

555
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:04,680
If there was a baby that had a defective fatty acid oxidation.

556
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:15,530
Why not? Because we can't give them the chain fatty acids depending on where the mutation is.

557
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:19,260
Yeah, I mean, if they were down here, that medium chain probably wouldn't help here.

558
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:23,040
Yeah, you can give them other things. But what's different between somebody?

559
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:27,059
If I told you about somebody with our carbohydrate breakdown disorder and you think, well,

560
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:31,170
I should be on a ketogenic diet, what's the difference between fat and carbohydrates here?

561
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:35,250
So to do with the heart using fatty acids.

562
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,370
So part of it is because of that, the heart always likes to use fatty acids.

563
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,960
Again, if you have these deficiencies, though, quite often these deficiencies might also be in the heart.

564
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:47,550
A heart can use carbohydrates if it needs to. It just prefers to use fatty acids as a general rule.

565
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:59,100
And the other girls. Also because it may be using things like climate science.

566
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:04,450
So that's one problem, right? So if you do too many carbs, race, obesity is a risk factor for many of these diseases.

567
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:09,040
Right? Because no matter what you do, if you have too many carbohydrates, those will be turned into fatty acids, which you're going to talk about.

568
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:13,110
Yeah. Social studies. Exactly. That's the difference.

569
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,949
You still need the essential fatty acids, right?

570
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:19,570
So you can't be on a fat free diet because then you would be deficient in both omega three and omega six fatty acids.

571
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:25,430
You'd also very likely to be deficient in the fat soluble vitamins and K, right?

572
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:30,630
So you can go on a complete fat free diet. Nobody can go on a clean battery diet, but you do have to carefully monitor it.

573
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:30,780
Right.

574
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:37,640
So you probably want to get somebody a diet that was relatively high in Pufas and you probably want to monitor blood levels of these fatty acids,

575
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:43,180
make sure they don't get too high. And again, you want to avoid obesity would be a pretty bad for mobility co-morbidity.

576
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:51,280
But again, these are diagnosed quite early in life and therefore, if people can be nutritionally managed through of their life to avoid complications.

577
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:58,260
Okay. Last thing I want to talk about today is Key Genesis, which we've touched on a couple of times before.

578
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:05,419
So as a reminder, key to Genesis is the production of fetal bodies, you know, acetone sort of involved, as you are saying, Dr. Cox,

579
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:10,630
if you read the first few steps here of fatty acid break down or excess acetylcholine here,

580
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:15,190
they're all the same all the way down to here, which is where we would divert to make cholesterol.

581
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:21,280
Right. So if you remember from last past, the rate limiting step for cholesterol, biogenesis was a decoy reductase.

582
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:23,950
That would be where you take this and you start turning cholesterol.

583
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:29,950
But if you don't let's say you don't have a signal to make cholesterol, but you still have a lot of a subtle going building up.

584
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:36,520
Then you're going to break it down into these three breakdown paths. These are products BHP and a pseudo acetate, their inner convertible,

585
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:41,440
and then they can go back to become a subtle way and be used for energy in other tissues.

586
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:48,250
Acetone, for example, is a metabolic that once something becomes acetone, it can't be converted back into anything.

587
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:53,490
So acetone is just produced. And that's why sometimes people on a ketogenic diet have acetone smelling breath, right?

588
01:06:53,530 --> 01:07:00,790
Because it's a production of acetone. It turns out the vast majority quantitatively of the genesis occurs in the liver.

589
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:05,820
There's a small amount that occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, although we don't know why.

590
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:10,150
But if you looking out of the blood, it's almost all coming from the liver.

591
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:17,520
And the reason for that is that the liver can take the ketone bodies and convert them back into AC.

592
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:27,100
And so this enzyme right here, which which allows the conversion of the keto body's back into useful products here that exists in muscle,

593
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:30,700
brain, heart, most other cells but does not exist in the liver.

594
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,820
Right. Some liver can make ketone bodies we cannot use neutralize.

595
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:40,780
And again, this is the liver being broadly generous and allowing for to what is to go to other tissues.

596
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:46,210
Right. And again, this is most common in well, now it's most common in people who are on a ketogenic diet,

597
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:51,310
but historically with most common in people who have diabetic ketoacidosis.

598
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:55,779
And so when you have diabetic ketoacidosis, you have sort of two problems here.

599
01:07:55,780 --> 01:08:02,500
We've touched on this a little bit before. One is that you cannot stop the pot if you do not have insulin signaling.

600
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:06,160
As I said at the beginning, insulin signaling will suppress lipolysis.

601
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:10,590
So if you're type one or type two diabetic, you cannot stop Lipolysis.

602
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:15,129
So the particles are always sending out fatty acids, sort of an unrestrained matter, right?

603
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:20,080
Those fatty acids are going to the liver. That's the next spot. And the liver is trying to do something with those fatty acids.

604
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:24,250
Right. But then the liver is then saying, well, I don't need energy, I have plenty of energy,

605
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:28,150
so I don't need to go through the TCA cycle that will then convert it to ketone bodies.

606
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:32,320
Those ketone bodies can go off and and go off and be used in other people.

607
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:37,299
So diabetic ketoacidosis is a major, major, major complication of type one and type two diabetes.

608
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:41,350
It's usually accompanied by hypoglycemia and its root causes.

609
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:46,510
I couldn't find updated numbers here, but as of 2009, about 140,000 hospitalizations.

610
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:53,739
It's a major concern when people were becoming hypoglycemic or fast in terms of with their type one diabetic.

611
01:08:53,740 --> 01:09:00,820
Right. And this can result in short term things like vomiting and excessive urination and long term things such as comas and organ failure.

612
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:06,810
Right. So that's diabetic ketoacidosis that's a little bit different from nutritional ketosis, right?

613
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:10,540
The process is still the same, right? You still have an excessive fatty acid going to the liver.

614
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:15,010
You still are undergoing a lot of gluconeogenesis. You're still very hot operating the liver.

615
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:18,640
Can you be a slow cooker that is broken down from the fatty acid?

616
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:24,110
But the difference is in general now you're accompanied by broadly normal blood glucose levels, right?

617
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:29,470
Normal glucose levels. And there is no impairment of your insulin signaling because there's no impairment of your insulin signaling.

618
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:34,899
Those carry out those ketone bodies can be used pretty effectively, which is why even people who are in very,

619
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:39,160
very strong states of nutritional ketosis, there are levels of beta of video.

620
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:44,830
Hydroxybutyrate is still less than about three no more very, very, very high for somebody on a ketogenic diet.

621
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:49,809
Whereas if you look at somebody who's DKA, their levels might exceed 15, right?

622
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:51,880
So it's much, much, much, much higher. Right.

623
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:59,290
So originally when people started experimenting with ketogenic diet, the concern here was that they were going to get ketoacidosis.

624
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:04,900
And ketoacidosis is bad. They were getting more ketone bodies, but generally not a pathological type of ketoacidosis,

625
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:10,090
which is largely due to the acidification, less so due to the elevation of the ketone bodies.

626
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:16,240
Okay. And then just one last slide I have here. Just kind of go back to one of my general themes here.

627
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:21,280
We've talked a bunch in this class about some relatively metabolically inefficient processes.

628
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,509
So for example, the keto cycle.

629
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:31,120
MCCORRY Cycle, to go through that cycle where you sort of start and finish with the same thing, we're talking about six or 14 years for each cycle.

630
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,790
But if you think about lipid chances and beta oxidation,

631
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:38,320
if you undergo the normal lipid genesis to make a fatty acid and then turn around and burn it,

632
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:42,040
you're going to be in a net deficit of like 118 ATP, right?

633
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:46,270
So this is extremely metabolically inefficient to make and burn fatty acids.

634
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:56,830
If you think about ketosis and he tells us so again, imagine your liver is taking a a ketone body or a fatty acid turning it into a ketone body.

635
01:10:56,890 --> 01:11:00,030
That ketone body then gets used in muscle again. That's another piece of the cycle.

636
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:03,910
You start with a subtle way. You finish with a subtle going just in a different place.

637
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:09,249
Again, that's slightly inefficient, about the same in line with the gluconeogenesis and the like.

638
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:16,120
At Genesis, we factor into all of these processes where you're sort of having to do an extra transport step because some nutrient load is limiting,

639
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:20,920
tend to be hyper catabolic, tend to be generally slightly increasing your energy expenditure.

640
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,909
And if we're slightly better for your weight loss now for a long time people thought, well,

641
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:31,300
maybe this is the magic about a ketogenic diet, is that this increased energy that is associated with ketosis.

642
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:35,560
Maybe that's why people lose weight on a ketogenic diet and it seems totally plausible.

643
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:41,050
There is a slight increase of the basal metabolic rate for somebody who is in ketosis, but it's quite small.

644
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:47,350
It's about 150 calories per day. Right. It's certainly not enough to cause meaningful weight loss in the short or long term, maybe.

645
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:52,270
But in the short term, probably not. Right. So again, people lose way of on a ketogenic diet.

646
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:54,850
It's not necessarily because of energy expenditure increases.

647
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:59,800
It's almost always if they lose weight because they are able to restrict their energy intake somewhat.

648
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:05,690
That's all I have. Forbidden oxidation. We'll finish off this year with looking for an important index.
