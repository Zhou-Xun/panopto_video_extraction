1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
all right, so we are gonna jump into teams with canvas I've also enabled the live transcript.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I apologize. That was not on for those of you that were in the first session.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But you can now enable the live transcript in the zoom toolbar at the bottom, and we are recording this session.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Please feel free to post any questions you have in the chat and you can also feel free to chime in unmute your mic and ask questions at any time I that will just get picked up on the recording.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So i'm all right with that if you're all right with that

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So kind of our our agenda for this hour is we're gonna just talk about some navigation basics.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I want to make sure everyone's up on the same up to speed with some of the canvas basics.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We're gonna look at some of your personal account setting options.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We're gonna look at course navigation and we're gonna talk about grading.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If there are other topics that you're hoping i'll address, feel free to pop those in a chat in the chat, and i'd be happy to work that in so one of the first things I just want to cover

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:47,000
is finding canvas and this primarily is when you're in the classroom, because when you're on your laptop, you can bookmark it, and you have easy access to that, however, when you're in the classroom, your

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:01,000
bookmarks aren't there. so one of the tips I offer is go to you, Mishu, by accessing that quick links toolbar over on the right can.

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This is the second option, and so you missed outed is an easy url to remember. you can open a browser.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Go to that

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're then going to be asked to log in on the Web login, Page, you're gonna enter your U of M. unique name and password.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The same credentials you use to log into your email and and you're gonna authenticate with duo if requested, which when you're on a classroom computer is almost guaranteed.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So you'll want to have your cell phone with you or whatever device you have set up to authenticate

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Just a quick rundown. Once you log in you'll be on the canvas dashboard.

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The dashboard is made up of the left hand blue bar with the block em at the top.

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This blue bar is called the global navigation. and it's global, because it always remains there at the top of the dashboard is sort of a scrolling carousel.

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
These are tools and announcements that come from the campus level.

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:23,000
A lot of it, or things they want students to be able to know. So these aren't these often are not sp specific.

23
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:37,000
They're campus-wide information messages over on the right is usually a to-do listical summary of everything going on in all of the classes.

24
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You either teach or or are taking so in this this example there's a to do list coming up recent feedback and a link to see your grades.

25
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And it's sort of a great summary across all of your courses

26
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And then the dashboard is broken down between published courses and unpublished courses.

27
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So the courses that you are teaching may be under this unpublished list.

28
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If they, if they're still being updated and are not yet ready for students to access.

29
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If that for classes you're taking if they are not in your published courses list, then they are sitting in your instructors unpublished courses list while they complete getting things up to date.

30
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I wanna talk about some account settings that you can use, particularly as an instructor.

31
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You have the ability to set notifications because when you're in an instructor role.

32
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You're gonna get different notifications than when you're just in a student learner role. we'll look at how to upload your profile image, which I would encourage if you haven't done so yet particularly in an

33
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
instructor role that you go ahead and add that I want to talk briefly about

34
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Your name. How it appears in canvas there's a setting where you can apply your personal pronouns.

35
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
If you would like those to display next to your name and I want to show you a tool called Name Coach.

36
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So i'm going to jump over to my canvas dashboard, and you can access your account from the account. menu.

37
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's the top menu below the block hem and that will pop out a second menu.

38
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So notifications is the first option if I click on that You'll see that there are some things letting you know that you can modify your account level settings which would apply to any courses.

39
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You're in or teaching. Now, you can go in and make change notification changes for just specific courses, and we'll see that option in when we get inside.

40
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Of a course. But here's where you can set things globally across all of your courses, one thing I would highly recommend. do you modify in your when you're in an instructor role is to come in here to this

41
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:31,000
announcement created by you. So if you post any announcements in a course you'll get sort of a notification email the same way your students would get.

42
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And this can just be a helpful confirmation of did the that thing I post go out to the students or not, and this is a great way to confirm that.

43
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And this is not on by default, and so I would set it to notify immediately.

44
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Notifications can be changed at any time in fact, anytime. you get a notification from canvas.

45
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:05,000
There's a link to manage your notifications at the bottom and so all canvas users has this option to come in and make changes globally or on a course by course basis.

46
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So as the semester starts you may feel like some notifications, you're getting too many of, so maybe you don't want them to come immediately.

47
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You just want them to come because there's other options you want them to come.

48
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Get a daily summary. There may be some that you want a weekly summary of, or maybe you don't want any notifications at all at all.

49
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So as a staff member for me there's a lot of notifications.

50
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't need you know it's not my course but there are some announcements in particular should always be immediately, because that's one way that you as an instructor.

51
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And you as a student can be notified immediately if there's any changes to the course meeting that day in the left hand menu.

52
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm going to go down to the profile here's where you can upload your profile photo. You can update it.

53
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You can add one if you don't have one yet you can also edit your profile.

54
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If you want to write a short bio

55
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm gonna jump down to settings

56
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And my window is small, so it has collapsed to the bottom, I believe.

57
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Let me scroll all the way down i'm gonna see if I can adjust my screen size there.

58
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We go with just my screen size, so that I can find this button hiding over here.

59
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That says edit settings.

60
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And so I just wanted to note that you you can't modify your name, at least not here.

61
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Our Our name is managed through wolverine access and so if you don't like the way, your name up here here in canvas, you can go to wolverine access the personal information and you can set up

62
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:22,000
preferred name. That name gets pushed out to other university systems, such as canvas.

63
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Also zoom. if you don't like the way your name appears when you're in zoom meetings, you can change your preferred name in wolverine access so that's a tip that not everybody

64
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
is aware of. so you're officially in the now but I do want to point out that you can set personal pronouns.

65
00:09:44,000 --> 00:10:01,000
If you'd like to do that I don't know if you saw before on my profile, I have she her after my name, and so in every core Simon rolled in this appears after my name

66
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Gonna go back to edit settings and here's some options you can choose from, or you could set it to none.

67
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
If you don't, I want to do that if you make any changes click the update settings.

68
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm going to cancel because I didn't make any changes here

69
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Lower down in the account. Menu is the name coach recorder tool.

70
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I would encourage all of you to come in. If you have not yet done this, come in and record the pronunciation of your name.

71
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You can. Editor info record your name. Mine has a recording.

72
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Let me see if I can play it for you. Joanna Kovacovic.

73
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This recording will go out to all of the canvas sites that you're enrolled in each canvas site has a menu item titled name, coach, roder.

74
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And so what it does is it pulls in all the names of the students and instructors for that course, and we'll allow others in the class to listen to the pronunciation of your name

75
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Alright. So back on the dashboard when you go inside of a course.

76
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Let's look at the course navigation we once again. We still have that global navigation that's going to allow us to change what course we're in return to the dashboard access our account information.

77
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And these all are the courses will pop out so you can switch to a different course.

78
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
If you were a part of any groups in canvas, you can jump to those.

79
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The calendars where you can see any due dates for the courses that you're enrolled in, or that you're teaching inbox is a message tool within canvas, and there'll be notifications if you have any

80
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:33,000
messages here. If any students have messaged you through the course inbox Commons is a resources sharing tool across all canvas, users globally countrywide, within U. of M.

81
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:42,000
All of the above the help button here is how you can get help using canvas.

82
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's gonna direct you to some resources such as the university it department

83
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Some canvas guides on the web that provides some tutorial, and how to information.

84
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm also gonna share some of my favorite help resources when using canvas.

85
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:15,000
After this session later today, and then lastly, well-being is a tool that you can use yourself and encourage your students to access with the well-being tool kind of compiles all the well-being events and resources

86
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:27,000
across campus and puts them right here at your fingertips.

87
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Next is the course menu. and so this is going to be different, depending on what course you're in, and how that course is organized.

88
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So these menu items are going to be in different order.

89
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And typically we try to encourage prioritizing those in the order.

90
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That are most important for students putting them at the top.

91
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And then, as Frederick mentioned in our first session removing menu items that are not being used because it's that's one fewer thing that students have to go check and look in to see if they need

92
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:11,000
to use it. or need to do something. there some of these menu Items have a little icon next to it with an i and a slash.

93
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That means it's not yet visible to students and that could be either because it's been hidden from the menu, but it's still visible to you as an instructor, or there's nothing there yet so

94
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:40,000
announcements and assignments in this course means no announcements have been posted yet, but that will automatically become available Once the first announcement gets posted

95
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The center panel is going to be sort of the content area.

96
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So depending on which Menu item you're in it's going to display here, and then over on the right side are often some side panels. There's a lot of options here for instructors.

97
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That you may want to pay attention to, particularly on the home page, plus publishing the course.

98
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Is that the top importing course, content to some of these things that are beginning of semester items

99
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
There's a few things I wanna bring to your attention One of them is before we get into these core settings.

100
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:43,000
One thing I want to bring to your attention. is student view when you're in instructor in a course you kind of get all the options, and it's a lot and it looks very busy I wanna encourage, you to flip.

101
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Back and forth, using what canvas calls student view when I click that button.

102
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's basically going to switch me into a test student role and let me see what the course looks like. for students.

103
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
This becomes particularly important If students are telling you that they can't see an assignment.

104
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Because canvas has a concept of publishing, you know, on that homepage screenshot.

105
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
We saw the the course is either published or unpublished.

106
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That also goes for individual items within the course. So announcements assignments

107
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Any discussions when we create those we also have to publish them.

108
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So i'm gonna leave student view all of these items have a green check mark next to them, which means they're published.

109
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They should be visible to students. I unpublished them and go into student view

110
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's a little tricky because the simons page doesn't look the same for students as it does for instructors.

111
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It defaults to the student focus of when is this due But there's an option to show by type which will show those groups I set up as an instructor, and so notice I had a grade scope group in this practice

112
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:31,000
site, and it's not even visible because the assignments in it are not published

113
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Let me see if your course uses files.

114
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,000
These files must be published for students to access.

115
00:17:46,000 --> 00:18:05,000
If your site is organized by pages, the page has to be published, and if your course is organized by modules, those modules, those modules in the items within the modules must be published for students

116
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:19,000
to see them. Some of the nice thing about not yet publishing things in it allows you to go ahead and publish your course and let students in, even if maybe you're still making adjustments on a assignments materials things like

117
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
that So you want to help the instructor of the course.

118
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Stay on top of that and make sure things that the students should have access to are actually visible.

119
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And utilizing that student view. Button is a great way to do that.

120
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Any questions so far feel free to drop them in the chat.

121
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I have my chat are open so i'll be able to see those as they come in

122
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Some course settings that I thought might be helpful for you to know are setting a course grade scheme.

123
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
This would be, if you know, checking to see what it what constitutes an A A B, C.

124
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And if you want to enable that in your canvas site there is an option a option in canvas that will give a grade distribution for each assignment, and not all instructors want that to

125
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:36,000
show and so I just want to show you where that's kind of hiding, so that you can check it in your courses.

126
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The core settings. Option also has a little buried checkbox that will automatically filter your speed grader, which is what we use for grading submissions in canvas bisection.

127
00:19:48,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So if you're in a class with multiple sections and you are responsible for a specific section of grading, or maybe a couple of sections, you can set this up for easier filtering and speed greater and then I want to show you how

128
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:20,000
to modify that course, menu on the left, to remove items that aren't being used in the course, as we talked about making that a little easier for students to navigate, so they don't kind of have to hunt and peck

129
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:30,000
to find where the content is for the course

130
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
All right. The settings for the course are always the very last menu.

131
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Item on the left

132
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And there are tabs across the top with different items for you.

133
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm gonna scroll down to the the ones that I wanted to point out the large course here's the launch speed grader filtered by student group

134
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So you can enable that anytime you make changes on this page.

135
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You have to go down to the very bottom to update course details

136
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The grade scheme. If you want to look at and enable this course grade scheme, you can do that.

137
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And the main difference for this is that when you enable this and modify it to match what the core syllabus says it will display a letter grade in the grades area for the instructor where they see every student's

138
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
grade, and for the student on their personal grade summary page.

139
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So what it does, is it basically just means the student doesn't have to see their grade and then go check the syllabus to see where they fall.

140
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's automatically gonna show them their grade one thing That's a little deceiving with great and we're gonna talk a lot more about grading in canvas is that by default.

141
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Students. Any work that has not been submitted yet is not counted against the student.

142
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So so they're not counted as zeros just yet.

143
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So a student can think they're doing pretty good and then at the end of the term, when they get zeros are incomplete for all those assignments. it might tank their grade so just a bit of warning they may think they're

144
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:51,000
doing fine but really they haven't yet been penalized for the work. They haven't done yet, but i'll walk through this quickly.

145
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You would check the box to enable the course grading scheme, and then you would want to set the course grade scheme.

146
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:11,000
There is a default that's. applied automatically so you can compare this to see if this is accurate to what is in the course syllabus, or you can use the pencil icon.

147
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
To edit it and make it an adjustment, you know.

148
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Maybe the course offers an a plus. So I would use this pencil scheme and make an a plus

149
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And so it's going to adjust these all the way down, and you can decide whether you wanna save this make more changes or remove items.

150
00:23:46,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Sometimes you can use the x to remove some of these, and then you can give it a new name, so it could be

151
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And I can save that i'm gonna get a chance to review it, and can hit done

152
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And so now there's nothing visible happening here but as I work in the grade book.

153
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'll be able to see letter grades

154
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
A couple of items in the more options. Let me look great scheme.

155
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Okay. when I expand the course options, there are some that are of interest, some of them.

156
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Just reply, apply to you students using the discussion boards.

157
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But this hide grade distribution graphs from students.

158
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
You can decide with, along with the instructor whether you want to make that available or not.

159
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And I believe we had this checked in the template that got used to make all of the fall course copies, but it's it's worth double checking to make sure this checkbox.

160
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Didn't get removed again. You can click the update course details to save any changes you make on this page

161
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:40,000
To modify this course. Menu on the left you'll go to the navigation tab under the course settings.

162
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:48,000
This first block of tools is showing what is currently enabled, and the order of items.

163
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:04,000
You can click and drag, to rearrange these and put them in a different order, or you could click on the 3 dots in the in the item and disable them.

164
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Some of these are placed in by canvas themselves by default.

165
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Like i'm not using collaboration so I don't need those things like rubrics.

166
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:34,000
There's gonna show you Heaven there by default again. some of this. we've been able to manage with a template. But sometimes the template settings get overridden all of these down here are tools that can be

167
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
enabled in canvas, and so some of them are Sp.

168
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Ph. Some of them are university-wide tools, and some of them are tools that belong to other schools.

169
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
So you may not be able to enable all of these.

170
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Some require some licensing

171
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Let me see if there's a good example of something to turn on.

172
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So if discussions is not enabled and you plan to use discussion boards, you can come click on the 3 dots and enable this once.

173
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It's enabled it's going to be placed at the bottom of the list.

174
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And so if discussions is something you plan to use a lot, I would put it up here, higher up, in sort of the course content.

175
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
So we typically organize it as like announcements.

176
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Student announcements, course, content, and then grading, collaboration tools and grading at the bottom.

177
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Any changes. i'm gonna come all the way to the bottom and click, save once I save my changes are gonna be immediately applied over here

178
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
We talked briefly about the course grade disk distribution. but I want to briefly touch on this.

179
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,000
My learning analytics tool. This is something that has been developed by University, Michigan.

180
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It along with school information school of education, stakeholders to build some analytics for students, And I just want to touch briefly on this in cases is something that might be useful for your course.

181
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So when I click on that i've now sort of enabled it, and it's going to load my course data.

182
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:47,000
What it's going to allow me to do is set up an analytics and analytics.

183
00:28:47,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Hub sort of for your students so These are student facing analytics about their own performance as an instructor.

184
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,000
You'll have new analytics and other ways to see how the whole class is performing overall.

185
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
But students don't get a look into that and so this is a student facing resource.

186
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
One of the things they've created is a report on the number of resources accessed.

187
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
This is going to show them students who are performing well in the course.

188
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:44,000
If there are resources they've accessed that maybe I haven't accessed yet. articles that I haven't read yet this works best when you're accessing resources from the files area you don't have to be

189
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
going to the files area to view them. but if they're linked into modules, or a page.

190
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It will still count those items. What I mean is it won't count resources that are linking out to like web pages.

191
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:13,000
For instance, assignment planning this is gonna allow the student to sort of see a picture of how much all of the assignments are weighted, how much they're worth.

192
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:28,000
What kind of target grade they want to get for the class and solder It'll show them how well they need to perform on assignments in order to achieve their goal grade and then grade distribution.

193
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
This is somewhat similar to the canvas grade distribution.

194
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:46,000
But this is not going to be an option. for classes that are too small for privacy, and it doesn't sort of it doesn't identify any students, of course.

195
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:56,000
But definitely some tools worth looking at, and perhaps suggesting

196
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So I would be able to come in and enable one or more of these.

197
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So by hitting the star I could do resource, access, or assignment planning

198
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:25,000
After this has run. So just a quick plug for some student facing analytics

199
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:32,000
So let's talk about grading in canvas this is pretty important, and probably a a big part of your role.

200
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:41,000
There's 2 sort of aspect aspects to grading one is grading with speed grader, and the second one is managing the grade book.

201
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So let's see if I can pull up some examples here i'm going to go to my assignments

202
00:31:51,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Practicing grading is a great use of the student view tool, something that I do a lot in my practice.

203
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Course here is i'll create an assignment i'll then go into student view.

204
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'll go into an assignment see what it looks like from a student perspective, and then submit that assignment. and you can see I've I did a practice submission just yesterday. so that we could look at it today.

205
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And then I can click. leave student view in the lower right.

206
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And now I can access speed grader and practice grading that

207
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:47,000
So if you haven't tried that before, I do a lot of that, and then I can go back into student view to see what the feedback looks like from a student perspective.

208
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So previously. you may have seen this from one side and now you can kind of jump back and forth and see it from both sides and get some practice.

209
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
So i'm gonna go back just to walk through how I got to that speed greater link.

210
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I can locate the assignment that needs to be graded and click on it.

211
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,000
This is sort of the assignment information page. These were the instructions given to students.

212
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:19,000
The point value summary. What the submission type of what students need to upload along with their due date.

213
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:29,000
If there was a rubric for this course that was entered into canvas it would display here.

214
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I would encourage you to use this if there's any case where an instructor hands you a paper rubric, or, if they share a word, Doc style Rubric, in the instructions you might suggest adding it here into the

215
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:57,000
canvas assignment because it's going to allow you to click on those rubric items in order to grade, and that feedback's going to get to the students quicker.

216
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Then if you are filling out a word document and attaching it back to the student

217
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It's gonna be a little more seamless alright So once I am in the assignment information I want to grade over here in the left hand.

218
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I'm sorry the right hand panel I have a couple of options speed greater, or I could download submissions.

219
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:36,000
This may happen, you know, near the end of the term, or if a a semester is over, I could download all submissions and archive those as an instructor.

220
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
But we do grading in speed greater for the most part.

221
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So for this assignment students were supposed to upload a file.

222
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And so this student, I can see when they submitted canvas will now pull a word.

223
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Count. so if that's part of the criteria they're being scored on you'll get that information This item here.

224
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:10,000
We'll load it in the document viewer and then in order to download this.

225
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:19,000
There is a download arrow over here there's a pencil icon here, in case you need to change the status of this.

226
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So if I click this, you could mark it as late, for instance, or if if canvas flags an assignment as late.

227
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
But there's no penalty for this or you know why it was late.

228
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:42,000
They had technical issues and you're going to accept it you can switch it from late to none.

229
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
If a student didn't submit it's gonna just hang out there as a not submitted.

230
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
But you can also change it to excused. You can also do this in the grade book.

231
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:05,000
But, they added sort of this shortcut, so what I can do here is I can read the submission.

232
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I can leave notes in the submission, using the tools along the top.

233
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:17,000
So, for instance, this is our highlighter can enable the highlighter tool.

234
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I can set the highlighter color and I can highlight what I want to bring to the student's attention and leave a comment

235
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:52,000
If I had a rubric here, it would appear, and it would expand out so I could click and score the rubric

236
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I can give a grade

237
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
There were issues with this last semester. but yeah, refreshing should take care of it.

238
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Notice it still has my comments here, and it still has my score.

239
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I just entered, and then there is a comment box. If you leave in line feedback, I would encourage you particularly the first time to let students know

240
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Because this comment is really easy for students to see this comment is less easy for students to see.

241
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:56,000
But we'll take a quick look at that There is now, an option to reassign an assignment.

242
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I think I have to submit this comment. So if I had said see!

243
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Inline comments, revise and resubmit, I could basically send it back.

244
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:16,000
It would send a notification to the student that you have sort of a resubmit request.

245
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Speed grader has now added a comments library so If you find that there are some comments, some general comments you want to use over and over.

246
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You don't have to have a word document and copy and paste those anymore.

247
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:46,000
You can use the comment library

248
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Which is very nice. This is limited to just the user.

249
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
The session after this grade scope.

250
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
One nice thing about great scope is Comments are saved in a library for the whole assignment.

251
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And so the same comments can be used by multiple graders So that's just a bit of a teas to some of the nice features in grade scope

252
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:23,000
So now I can go use the arrows to go to the next student

253
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And review their content. So I left a comment in there so i'm gonna say what's

254
00:39:46,000 --> 00:40:03,000
That many use my comment. library, submit that, and Speed grader has opened in a new tab, so I can just close that tab

255
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I'm gonna take a moment and switch back to student view because I want to show you the visibility of that feedback.

256
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So I switch into student view and notice I have an alert that I have a new grade that's been posted.

257
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:27,000
If I go there it gives me this little dot here to show me which assignment has been updated.

258
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I now know I received a score 47 out of 50 and There's some comments here if I click on that. it expands it, and I can see the common great work.

259
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Please see comments in line. So how do I see those in line comments?

260
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I have to click on the assignment title and click view feedback.

261
00:40:49,000 --> 00:41:04,000
See it's now gives me a little button to See that we've been working to get sort of that visibility a little bit better getting canvas to make that more visible but it's a slow process I do

262
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:12,000
have a video that I can share. If you want to post that in your class on how students can see in line feedback.

263
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I'm gonna add that to my notes

264
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:39,000
So when i'm in here, I can see the comments I can make this bigger zoom in

265
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And I also have a download, button that's going to allow me to download a pdf copy of

266
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:57,000
My submission with the instructor's annotations

267
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Alright, i'm gonna leave student view and go back to instructor view.

268
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So that's a really quick look at using speed grader and there may be other things such as the rubric.

269
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
If that's being used one of the things I didn't touch on is that you can attach.

270
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:29,000
So if you do end up using a word document, rubric, you you can use this paper, Clip Icon, to attach it here back with a submission

271
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Let's talk about the grade book real quick in the left-hand navigation menu the grades button.

272
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:51,000
When you're a student it'll just show you a summary of your own grades, when you're in an instructor, you get sort of an excel spreadsheet looking layout of all student grades just a few

273
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:58,000
things. I can filter this by section. So section one section, 2, section 3.

274
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Some of your classes may be very big, and so this grade book may actually take a little time to load.

275
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And so you can do it by section. You can also

276
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:38,000
View. So I can filter my section I can filter by assignment groups where i'm only seeing exam assignments or exams, and it's going to collapse how many columns are here based on those

277
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:49,000
assignment groups I had, and when I say the assignment groups, I hit these little groups.

278
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I had assignments, grade, scope, participation, and exams.

279
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,000
You may have these organized into groups just for your own sort of organization.

280
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,000
The main purpose for using these groups is so that instructors can wait their grades.

281
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So maybe you know, homework assignments are worth 40% of the final grade.

282
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Exams are worth 50, and participation is worth 10 you would create these groups like this, and on the assignments page this 3 dot menu.

283
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
There's an assignment group's weight

284
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:51,000
So here's where you can kind of set that framework up to match your syllabus

285
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Hopefully, some of that would already be done by the time you get to the course.

286
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,000
But yeah, so feel free to take at these view, arrange by filter to make these things.

287
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,000
To make your view sort of a little bit more manageable.

288
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:20,000
You don't have to show unpublished assignments I have this setup, because sometimes it's a good visual clue to let you know of this assignments due dates coming up, and I don't even have it

289
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,000
published that's why students aren't submitting anything

290
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Each column has its own settings. that you can look at.

291
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
You can give a student's grades just by typing a score in.

292
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:52,000
So if it's a case where all students get full points I could go in one by one and just enter them.

293
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
But one feature is set, a default grade where everyone gets the same score.

294
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:08,000
If everyone's getting the full 11 points you can use default grade 11 points, and it'll apply it to all students.

295
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:16,000
So there's some really nice features like that when I click in a cell.

296
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:25,000
There's an option here for a pop-out tray So one thing about canvas is there's multiple ways to do this same things.

297
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:39,000
So we saw all of these features in speed greater, and in fact, I can even launch speed grader from here and make changes

298
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I want to touch on the settings gear over here on the far right.

299
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
This has some advanced gradebook settings, such as setting default, late policies.

300
00:46:51,000 --> 00:47:01,000
So this is, if across the board, you know your grade goes down for being late.

301
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:17,000
You can automatically apply deduction to late. submissions So you're in a little bit limited on how to do that, But you can spend some time working on that. and then that automatically. apply grade from missing missing

302
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
submissions. Remember what I said that it's not going to be counted against them by default.

303
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:30,000
But you can set that up

304
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:45,000
The great posting policy. This is really important. because by default unless it's been copied over from a previous semester Canvas is going to automatically Give those grades to students as you enter them it's going to

305
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
notify them. Hey! Your reflection paper grade has been entered.

306
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Hey? Your homework problem set has been graded. Go look at it.

307
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Sometimes we want to manually post grades you know maybe I want to go through everyone's reflection paper.

308
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Everyone's problem set before I release those grades this is much more common.

309
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:25,000
So I can manually post grades for all assignments for the whole semester, or I could go and set manually post grades on specific columns

310
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And then finally, one invites checkbox is to allow a final grade override.

311
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
So an instructor can get the total from the assignments.

312
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:44,000
But can also override that to a different grade.

313
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:51,000
If you make any changes here, you can apply these settings and notice all of my column headers.

314
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Now same manual.

315
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:09,000
So once. these scores once i've scored these papers I need to come to this column.

316
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Oh, so I I created these before this was hidden, so let me reset it.

317
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
So it already posted them, because that was my default.

318
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:31,000
But your columns if they're hidden will have this i icon, which means these grades are hidden from students, or there are some grades hidden from students, and you can come to this panel.

319
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:42,000
This menu and post the grades

320
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:53,000
So a lot of really great options here also note the message students who you can come here and send a reminder to all students who haven't submitted.

321
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Yet. So, instead of posting an announcement, saying if you haven't done your assignment yet.

322
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Don't forget to do it here's a direct message where you can sort of target students, and just let them know

323
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:17,000
So that's a brief whirlwind tour through canvas

324
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Any questions.

325
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I will say we are. Our objectional support team is here.

326
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:40,000
If you have questions or if there's something you're being asked to set up or do please consider reaching out, we would love to help you set up or execute

327
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Whatever your instructor is trying to create in the course our email is sp dot instruction at you, Mish Dot Edu and i'll also share this for help at you, Mishu.

328
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,000
This is the U of M. It department, and they support canvas as well.

329
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:06,000
So if there are questions, or if you're having technical issues with canvas, that is another resource.

330
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:17,000
They have some limited weekend hours whereas we don't, so that may be one time when you might wanna see if they are available to assist.

331
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:26,000
If you're running into issues over a weekend

332
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
So I want to thank you all for coming this session i'm gonna stop the recording.

333
00:51:31,000 --> 00:52:01,000
But i'm still willing to take questions the next session. is streamline grading with grade scope so i'll help you stick around for that, otherwise we will share the recording with you.
