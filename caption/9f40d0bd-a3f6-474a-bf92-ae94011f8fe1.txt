00:00:01,438 --> 00:00:07,509
Hello everyone, welcome again to the applying mediation analysis course

2
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:12,723
of the University of Michigan summer session in epidemiology.

3
00:00:12,723 --> 00:00:17,655
I hope you enjoyed listening to the review of

4
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:21,788
causal inference that I prepared and

5
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:26,988
today I will go through the first recording for

6
00:00:26,988 --> 00:00:29,670
the lecture of day one.

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,893
As I said that now in the email as well as in the syllabus,

8
00:00:34,893 --> 00:00:38,350
please listen to these recordings.

9
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:45,490
I think the lecture will be split it in about three recordings and

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:51,573
post any question or comment on the discussion board so

11
00:00:51,573 --> 00:00:58,337
that on the first day of the course we can have a Q&A session.

12
00:00:58,337 --> 00:01:02,967
Let's the first review what's the plan of the course.

13
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:06,862
We will first discussed concepts of mediation,

14
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:11,044
both traditional and counterfactual approaches.

15
00:01:11,044 --> 00:01:14,594
So this is the topic of the lecture today.

16
00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:20,331
We will then discuss what are the most commonly used parametric regression

17
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:26,632
approaches for causal mediation analysis under the counterfactual framework.

18
00:01:26,632 --> 00:01:31,778
Along with the statistical software available to

19
00:01:31,778 --> 00:01:37,299
implement these approaches either in data ae in SAS.

20
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:43,747
I will then discuss how mechanisms of mediation as well as interaction

21
00:01:43,747 --> 00:01:50,101
can be unified in the framework of causal effect, the composition.

22
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:54,544
And I will then propose and I really encourage you to use

23
00:01:54,544 --> 00:01:59,375
the sensitivity analysis approaches whenever you conduct

24
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:04,409
epidemiological investigation in observational studies.

25
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,636
To assess the validity of the of your findings in

26
00:02:08,636 --> 00:02:12,238
the instance of a measure confounding.

27
00:02:12,238 --> 00:02:19,028
I will then conclude the course discussing potential strategies and

28
00:02:19,028 --> 00:02:24,890
methods for mediation analysis with multiple mediators.

29
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,378
Let's get started with the first lecture

30
00:02:30,378 --> 00:02:36,342
on mediation concepts and identification.

31
00:02:36,342 --> 00:02:40,436
In this lecture, I would like to cover the following topics.

32
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:46,794
First, introduce traditional approaches to mediation analysis,

33
00:02:46,794 --> 00:02:52,165
understand their potential limitation and then motivate

34
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:58,097
the use of the counterfactual approach to mediation analysis.

35
00:02:58,097 --> 00:03:02,239
I will first give formal definitions of direct and

36
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,180
indirect effects under the potential outcome framework.

37
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,592
And then discuss non-parametric

38
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:16,157
identify ability conditions under

39
00:03:16,157 --> 00:03:21,184
which these effects can be recovered.

40
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:26,701
What are the questions of interest in mediation analysis?

41
00:03:26,701 --> 00:03:30,838
This directed at a cyclic graph effectively

42
00:03:30,838 --> 00:03:34,650
represents the question of mediation.

43
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,308
This is a very simple graph most likely too simple, but

44
00:03:39,308 --> 00:03:45,699
let's understand what are the main ingredients for mediation analysis.

45
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:51,392
We first need an exposure, a mediator and then outcome.

46
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:56,391
The exposure is the variable A, the mediator intermediate between

47
00:03:56,391 --> 00:04:00,613
the exposure and the outcome M, and the final outcome Y.

48
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:06,437
In this graph, we see that the effect of the exposure and

49
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:09,802
the outcome can operate through two pathways.

50
00:04:09,802 --> 00:04:15,774
One that is direct from A to Y not involved in the media and

51
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:21,620
this is our direct effect and the pathway that involves

52
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,359
the mediator that channels the effect of A through M.

53
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:31,595
This is the indirect effect.

54
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:36,447
The goal of mediation analysis is to be able to

55
00:04:36,447 --> 00:04:41,557
quantify the strength of these two potentially

56
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:45,774
co-currently operating pathways and

57
00:04:45,774 --> 00:04:50,006
understand the relative importance.

58
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:54,219
In this slide and basically saying [LAUGH] What I said before.

59
00:04:56,665 --> 00:05:01,979
I would like to introduce here an example of causal mediation

60
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:07,407
analysis in the setting of a lamb cancer epidemiology study.

61
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:13,227
I like this application because it has a lot of history in it.

62
00:05:13,227 --> 00:05:20,666
And this history dates back to the 1950s, when it wasn't clear at all yet

63
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:25,485
that smoking is a very toxicants for lung cancer.

64
00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:34,086
In particular, the person depicted in the photograph on the left, Fisher.

65
00:05:34,086 --> 00:05:38,497
A very famous statistician who was a smoker himself,

66
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:43,692
was really doubting evidence from epidemiological study that

67
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:48,997
there was indeed a true causal effect of smoking on lung cancer.

68
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:54,424
He was in particular hypothesising that this relationship between smoking and

69
00:05:54,424 --> 00:05:58,555
lung cancer was not really causal as depicted by this dog with

70
00:05:58,555 --> 00:06:01,557
a direct order from smoking to lung cancer.

71
00:06:01,557 --> 00:06:05,493
But instead potentially a confounded relationship, so

72
00:06:05,493 --> 00:06:10,661
immersed furious association, which is more represented by this graph.

73
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:15,938
Where smoking doesn't have a direct effect on land cancer,

74
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:23,290
but rather its association is channelled by a backdoor path involving a confounder.

75
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:28,121
Here in particular, Fisher was hypothesising than an unmeasured

76
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,715
confounder was a genetic variant.

77
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:35,800
That would predispose people to become addicted

78
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,630
to nicotine as well as predispose people to develop lung cancer.

79
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:47,558
This hypothesis of potential unmeasured confounding explaining

80
00:06:47,558 --> 00:06:52,222
the association between smoking and lung cancer was refuted by

81
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:56,447
the seminal work of Cornfield on sensitivity analysis.

82
00:06:56,447 --> 00:07:02,132
Who showed that such hypothetical genetic variant should

83
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:07,353
have had it realistically strong effect on smoking to

84
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:14,331
actually explain away all the effects that smoking has on land cancer.

85
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:19,949
So, for a long time, the hypothesis of Fisher of the existence

86
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:24,295
of a genetic variant, potentially confounding

87
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:29,395
the relationship of smoking lung cancer was a set aside.

88
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:34,437
However, recently genetic variants on

89
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:39,927
chromosome 15q25.1 were identified

90
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:44,672
to be associated both with the smoking

91
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:49,432
behaviour as well as with lung cancer.

92
00:07:49,432 --> 00:07:54,603
So, what happens if both statements are true that is truly

93
00:07:54,603 --> 00:08:00,315
smoking as a causal relationship with the outcome lung cancer?

94
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:03,027
So that there is an arrow from M to Y.

95
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:08,187
But also truly, there is such a genetic variant

96
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:14,374
that both causes lung cancer and as well as smoking.

97
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:18,511
So, combining these two evidences,

98
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:26,799
we come up with the mediation dog that we saw at the beginning of the lecture.

99
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:30,843
So, once this genetic variant was discovered,

100
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,711
new scientific questions arose.

101
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:39,882
In particular, if such a genetic variant is associated with smoking.

102
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:46,463
Now, in its theological questions arises as to whether the effect of the genetic

103
00:08:46,463 --> 00:08:52,393
variant or lung cancer operates primarily through smoking addiction.

104
00:08:52,393 --> 00:08:59,987
Or alternatively, through other pathways that are independent of smoking behaviour.

105
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:06,373
We will discuss during the live labs and furthermore in the next slides,

106
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:11,713
why it's important to ask this question about the mechanism

107
00:09:11,713 --> 00:09:17,591
through which a genetic variant causes a certain disease status.

108
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:23,255
This has important implications in prevention science.

109
00:09:23,255 --> 00:09:27,744
So, what are these studies that identify these genetic variants?

110
00:09:27,744 --> 00:09:33,813
In 2008, independent research groups identify these genetic variants

111
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:40,644
on chromosome 15q25.1 has been associated with increased risk of lung cancer.

112
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:45,707
Here, the citations and those the same variants were identified

113
00:09:45,707 --> 00:09:51,798
by other research groups has been associated with nicotine dependence.

114
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:56,575
Now there was debate as to whether the effect of lung cancer was direct or

115
00:09:56,575 --> 00:10:00,486
operated through pathways related to smoking behaviour.

116
00:10:00,486 --> 00:10:02,198
And the different scholars,

117
00:10:02,198 --> 00:10:05,701
different research groups made the different hypotheses.

118
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:11,248
Some studies and some investigators reported that the associations

119
00:10:11,248 --> 00:10:17,092
between the variance and lung cancer might have been primarily direct.

120
00:10:17,092 --> 00:10:21,666
But as others reported that they might have been indirect

121
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,436
through iniquity independence.

122
00:10:24,436 --> 00:10:30,356
And then other investigators hypothesised that instead of immediately mechanism,

123
00:10:30,356 --> 00:10:34,467
potentially an interactive mechanism between the gene and

124
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,192
the smoking behaviour were operating.

125
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:42,541
Whereby smokers who carried the genetic variant might

126
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:48,596
have been more vulnerable to the harmful effect of nicotine.

127
00:10:48,596 --> 00:10:52,114
So, how do we reconcile all these hypotheses?

128
00:10:52,114 --> 00:10:57,880
How do we quantify the role of mediating mechanisms?

129
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,778
Interactive mechanisms versus mechanisms that

130
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:06,249
are completely independent of the putative mediator?

131
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:12,987
Well, first, we need a formal mathematical definition of the causal effects.

132
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:16,376
We then need to understand what's the best study design and

133
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,302
what are the conditions and the type of variables.

134
00:11:19,302 --> 00:11:23,436
We need to collect in order to achieve the valid

135
00:11:23,436 --> 00:11:28,101
destination of these direct and indirect effects.

136
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:30,163
And all these strategies,

137
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:36,175
statistical modelling strategies need to account for potential complex data.

138
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:40,374
Such as non-continuous outcome or non-continuous mediator,

139
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:45,196
the presence of exposure mediator interactions or non-linear effects.

140
00:11:45,196 --> 00:11:50,273
And also challenges that are brought up by

141
00:11:50,273 --> 00:11:57,245
missing data due to study dropout or measurement error.

142
00:11:57,245 --> 00:12:03,062
So, a little bit of history about mediation analysis in the other

143
00:12:03,062 --> 00:12:08,774
fields of there are a little bit outside of causally influence,

144
00:12:08,774 --> 00:12:15,364
but who gave the first contributions to address questions of mediation?

145
00:12:15,364 --> 00:12:22,179
The first scholar who actually put forth a way a strategy to estimate direct and

146
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:26,836
in that effects is the geneticist the Sewall Wright.

147
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:32,307
Who is also the father of structural modelling,

148
00:12:32,307 --> 00:12:36,958
who in 1921 wrote this seminal paper

149
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,881
that walked us through the use of systems of

150
00:12:41,881 --> 00:12:46,690
linear equations to estimate pathways.

151
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,751
Baron and Kenny in 1986, effectively made popular

152
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:57,136
this linear structural modelling approach by Sewall Wright

153
00:12:57,136 --> 00:13:01,887
in the psychology and social sciences literature.

154
00:13:01,887 --> 00:13:09,313
And this paper by Baron and Kenny has been sighted now more than 60,000 times.

155
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:14,107
So it's extremely popular.

156
00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:18,493
The approaches that have been put forth in the biomedical and

157
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:24,008
the social sciences literature have been purely statistical approaches.

158
00:13:24,008 --> 00:13:31,198
That is, they were grounded on the definition of statistical models.

159
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:37,370
We have to wait on to the early 1990s, for scholars working in causal influence

160
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,944
in particular under the counterfactual framework for causal inference.

161
00:13:42,944 --> 00:13:47,700
To start thinking about how to formalise questions of mediation

162
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,700
using the potential outcome language.

163
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,320
And this is when the work of Robins and Greenland came in,

164
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,329
who has we will see throughout the course started off actually

165
00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:06,703
by being very sceptical about our ability to actually investigate pathways.

166
00:14:06,703 --> 00:14:11,876
And we in fact had to wait until 2001, when Judea Pearl was the first

167
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:17,584
one to recover identify ability conditions for direct and indirect effects.

168
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:19,107
So think about it.

169
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:24,405
Like there were definitions of these effects in the early 1990s,

170
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:28,191
which remained dormant for more than 10 years.

171
00:14:28,191 --> 00:14:32,163
Because after defining these effects,

172
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:36,719
it was unclear whether actually these effects

173
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:41,524
could have been learnt from the observed data.

174
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:45,660
So, let's-
