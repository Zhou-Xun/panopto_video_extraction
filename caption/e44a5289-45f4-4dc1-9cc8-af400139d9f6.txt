1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,470
Is everybody doing? November. Happy November. The weather's good.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,770
Enjoy it by sitting in this windowless room for an hour and a half.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:22,560
Okay. But today we're working our way through the evaluation component of occupational chemical exposures.

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:33,060
So we've been talking about, you know, the balls of gas and vapors, principles of aerosol sampling, gas for sampling, aerosols, bio monitoring.

5
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,960
So today we're going to talk about a little bit different ways of dealing with chemical exposures.

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,790
Some of it is a natural extension from some of what we talked about in my classes in Baker's lecture.

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,570
But it's it's using modeling for for evaluating hazards.

8
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,820
And then I think I talked about modeling. And after modeling, I have a little bit more on other approaches as well.

9
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,190
Just the kind of course theme for the next quiz is that the same format as the last quiz?

10
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,330
Mostly, I think I've added some true false into the mix.

11
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:20,550
But at home. Yeah. Same. Same set up, I think, you know, I'll give you a window of time to sign in and start.

12
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:29,160
And like with before, you know, you can use your materials, but if you study it, know the materials work and stuff,

13
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:35,700
it's going to be much more time efficient for you because there will be some problems that align with the problem sets.

14
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:44,660
So more calculations than last time. But yeah, we can talk a little bit more on Thursday about that.

15
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,340
The other questions about that. Yeah. I'm just wondering if it could be possible for you to pose the key to the first problem?

16
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,710
Yeah, that's my plan. There's still one outstanding problem that I'm trying to work out.

17
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,510
But yeah, the plan for both problems is to have that available to you.

18
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,350
Prior to were you able to get your scores and the feedback from the greater good.

19
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:17,160
I think next year it would be nice if we were able to submit our Excel document as our work.

20
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,350
Okay, just like it's hard.

21
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:26,640
It's kind of annoying to do All in Excel and you click the cell and you see the work and then have to rewrite the work on the problem set.

22
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,950
Did you tried to submit Excel in the canvas or you just.

23
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:41,010
I submitted my excel as a PDF, but then for each heading because I didn't know we can submit the Excel docket for each heading again.

24
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,120
It was like mass times volume and each one then one consciousness once as volume.

25
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,629
And she marked me down. But that's fine. We can talk again.

26
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:55,010
These are we can talk if you want. So this is supporting documentation, so it's fine.

27
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,020
I understand there's yeah. There's incompatibility issues there.

28
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,230
So that wasn't intentional. But thank you.

29
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:07,740
Noted. And yeah, I'm happy to talk about it if you'd like that for sure.

30
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,470
Any other questions? Constructive feedback?

31
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,110
Suggestions. All right.

32
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,810
So you actually were tied with Miley on Thursday, all talking about some more stats application,

33
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:31,000
sort of how it fits in with everything we've talked about this unit. And then next week will be the quiz, which we'll talk more about on Thursday.

34
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:43,969
Okay. So I'm going to talk about modeling and then some additional surrogate approaches,

35
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:49,400
which is basically kind of going back to our anticipation recognition steps and trying

36
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,050
to get the most out of those if we can't collect samples like we've been talking about.

37
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,790
So for the modeling portion, we're gonna talk about introduction and why you might want to use it.

38
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,679
Different types. There's some references.

39
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,830
If anybody really wants to know more about this and some of the more complicated extensions for these builds up.

40
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:17,840
There's also some cool software out there you can probably track down through various sources that are going to be some examples of some of

41
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:26,930
the more basic types of models and give you a sense of when you might somebody might use these and why and talk about the different ones.

42
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:34,400
And then, like I said, we're going to end with a few slides on other ways to to estimate exposure that we haven't quite talked about.

43
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:42,960
So some definitions when it comes to modeling. So an exposure model basically using, you know,

44
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:49,060
properties of the chemical environment and some math to try to estimate or predict

45
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:55,360
concentrations at a given point in time or over a period of time for a person,

46
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:03,730
for a space. There's all kinds of applications for doing this, and there's different types of models of how we categorize them.

47
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,550
You have deterministic models, which is basically we know this input, that input.

48
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:18,520
When you put these in the equation, we get one answer out back to us by deterministic models might use some chemical properties,

49
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:27,100
physical properties, things like that. So some of the stuff we'll talk about today are some examples of a deterministic model.

50
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,270
And it's just kind of a general guesstimate, you can say for some of these inputs.

51
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:42,550
So you should know when you do a deterministic model that there's almost 100% chance that the number you get back is not going to be the right number.

52
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,470
But hopefully it'll be something that you can start with to try to narrow down.

53
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,120
On the flip side, we have probabilistic models, so this is where the input parameters,

54
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:58,990
instead of a single value that you're putting in as your inputs, you're putting in of distribution of what it might be.

55
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,470
So it could take the form of the normal distribution, a skewed distribution, a flat function,

56
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,360
and then you run a bunch of iterations and what you'll get instead of a single number as your estimate,

57
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,020
it'll be a distribution of your estimate that would have a central tendency.

58
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,640
You can use a range of if that's of interest for your application.

59
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,879
So these are the two basic these are good for, you know, the quick screening, the deterministic,

60
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,360
the probabilistic are much more common these days for, you know, if you're actually going to apply it to risk assessment or risk.

61
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,750
So there's a lot of reasons you might use models and maybe a lot of reasons you might not use models.

62
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,380
But we'll talk about why first.

63
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:51,640
So to gain insights into the determinants of exposure. So if you know how exposure work, you have these equations that describe exposure,

64
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,649
you can tinker with those inputs and see, you know, if that chemical changes to something else,

65
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:02,200
how is that going to change the expected exposure or the temperature or some of these variables

66
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:08,860
that we've been talking about that you can see what would happen if that were to take place.

67
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,770
With things like airflow. Retrospective exposure assessment.

68
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,180
This is huge because obviously you can't yet go back in time.

69
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:25,630
I think there's still working on that somewhere. Right now. You need to use something.

70
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,679
So we'll talk in the in the lecture, some of some more general ways.

71
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,720
But modeling is a big approach for that. So, you know, if you get us.

72
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:44,690
An OSHA citation, for example, on something that happened prior and the processes of change that you don't have exposure measurements.

73
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:50,810
You might need to try to model what happened. Models are also being in court cases, people looking for.

74
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:57,700
You know, monetary settlements and things like that.

75
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,980
With regards to previous exposures or diseases that they think are caused by earlier exposures,

76
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:08,080
a lot of times we use these models to try to estimate what kind of exposure was experienced.

77
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,460
Accidents and incidents. So this is big.

78
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:19,290
You know, if you have a big spill, there's been some environmental things that we talk about first, very first class.

79
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,389
Why those big environmental accidents? They still do studies to this day onto those populations.

80
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,810
And because they weren't there at the time to measure exposure times,

81
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:35,310
they're using models to try to estimate what the exposure was right after it happened and then the years following.

82
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,510
You can do the same within a with a facility on the occupational side, current future exposure levels.

83
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,720
So, you know, if you have an operation and you want to know how likely you are to be above the oh yeah, that's a good one.

84
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,830
Exposure potential of different operations. Again, if you're going to change a process, change the materials coming in.

85
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:05,760
Models might help with that. Same with controlling exposure and then finally helping you decide where to monitor.

86
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,110
So using models to figure out what the worst case scenarios might be.

87
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:18,780
Similarly, expose groups that we've we've mentioned we'll talk about Thursday and finally professional judgments.

88
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:25,500
So a lot of times in this field, the industrial industrial hygienists will walk in and be like, oh, I've got experience with this.

89
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,160
I'm guessing the exposure is going to be around this. And you see that a lot.

90
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,620
And you see litigation. You see it in epidemiology studies and other places.

91
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:41,459
But if you can use a model to kind of substantiate what they're they're saying that they think this is happening,

92
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,600
that that makes a big difference because anybody use exposure models.

93
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,910
I hope you do. If you did, problems that were on the paper hazard index does count as well.

94
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,220
But okay, some cautionary notes. I like this.

95
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,890
This saying is this very good. All models are wrong, but some are useful.

96
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,270
And that's my boss, who was a famous statistician.

97
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:16,590
So keep that in mind when you use the models. But they're inherently wrong most of the time.

98
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:25,480
But and that's because, you know, how good our input values, how deterministic are that based on how we're using them.

99
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:30,370
They can't capture some of the variability and some of the you know,

100
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,500
there's a lot of variables that can occur for an exposure scenario and it's hard to account for all.

101
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:42,840
But then we know that exposure varies by time and space a lot, and it's hard to account for that mathematically four times.

102
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:49,420
So just keep those in mind. And uncertainty is a huge plays a huge role in this.

103
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:53,530
So uncertainty is basically what we don't know. And sometimes if you don't know what you don't know,

104
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:59,170
that's that's where trouble is because you might have think you have more certainty in your estimate,

105
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:05,260
but you might not have included a whole range of variables that are important for that scenario.

106
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,010
And you know, a lot of models might overestimate exposure.

107
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,120
A lot of the screening ones we'll talk about today, you know, overestimates exposure.

108
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,590
And that's fine if you're using those.

109
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:22,260
Is this a problematic thing that we need to follow up on or not if you know what's going to overexpose or overestimate,

110
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,850
if anything, and at least that's a conservative worst case study,

111
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,999
which one to watch out for is underestimating exposure,

112
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,270
because then you can have a false sense of security and not follow up on something that could actually be a problem.

113
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,990
And, you know, knowing what models are and what those biases tend to be, this is also important.

114
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,540
This is a fairly recent paper talking about.

115
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:57,440
So there's people that actually study models, study expert judgment and study the relationship between the two.

116
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,179
One is is wrong. So he's at Hopkins now, I believe.

117
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:07,250
But, you know, they did they were able to show that, you know, judgment alone.

118
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:13,650
A lot of times it isn't all that accurate. But when they're able to use judgment along with modeling, they got much more accurate.

119
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,730
So that's another application here is to help.

120
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,630
Like you mentioned, some of those expert judgments get better.

121
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,930
I remember one study they did was talking about I don't know if I talked about this on Thursday,

122
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:34,280
but they had a bunch of, you know, industrial hygiene professionals or experts even look at a log,

123
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:41,839
normal distribution and try to have them estimate what the geometric mean or the 95th percentile is just from looking at the distribution.

124
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:49,700
And they actually didn't do very well. And that's the type of test that they might use of expert judgment and porcelain applications we talked about.

125
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:58,220
So some interesting stuff. For sure. So some exposure models that we'll talk.

126
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:04,350
So here's some common ones. And they get increasingly complex going down this model.

127
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,180
One is the saturation model for vapors. This is what we've already done.

128
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:15,350
This is what we did in the Gas Can Vapors lecture, talking about the scenario where all the vapor evaporates.

129
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,240
That's simply just mass over volume of the space, right? We didn't take into account airflow or anything.

130
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:28,760
Also, it's the looking at it in the case that you don't have everything about for the saturation model.

131
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:36,320
What's the other example we talked about? But we know that this often will overestimate exposure because not accounting for any sort of air flow.

132
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,630
So that's, again, a quick and easy screening method.

133
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:48,250
Next, we have box models. This can be used for any of these types of their contaminants.

134
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:55,910
And there's several variations and extensions of these. But it comes down to kind of a mass balance concept,

135
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:03,500
where then you have some assumptions on top that mass balance to accommodate features of the scenario within a space.

136
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:09,049
And we'll talk about some of these. But you have, you know, some sort of generation rate, some sort of inflation rate.

137
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,890
You can account for how much mixing is in the space.

138
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,349
There's also back pressure models from up near field, far field.

139
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,890
You mentioned all that and another application.

140
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:27,620
So these I've used these as well in there. They can be useful as long as again, you know, the limitations.

141
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:34,640
And then finally a dispersion models these we see a lot more in an environment, not occupational environmental settings.

142
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:41,720
So plume modeling. So you have a stack of an industrial complex, some things coming out of that stack,

143
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:47,780
and you can model where it's going based on wind parameters, temperature parameters, things like that.

144
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,740
But there are applications within occupational health as well for this.

145
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,720
But it keeps trying to get more at the spatial and temporal.

146
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,360
Levels of what's how a plume disperses over that space over time.

147
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,750
So we'll come back to the C dispersion models again later in a few weeks.

148
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:21,430
Okay. I mentioned leaving references. So there's a lot of work that's been done on this and that's some of these folks,

149
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,020
you know, they think about this a lot and they just keep making things more.

150
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,500
They keep building in more extensions for more complex scenarios.

151
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:36,640
So, you know, if you find yourself in a situation where you using models and some of the basic ones we're covering here aren't going to cut it,

152
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:42,730
just know that there's places you can go to get more complex, have lots of things that go.

153
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:53,540
A lot of them with the Industrial Hygiene American Industrial Hygiene Association does fall through while this work of their their committees.

154
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,920
I would have to say that number two is my problem. Oh, yeah.

155
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,870
Yeah. All right. So, you know, when I was a very small undergrad, so.

156
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:09,630
Oh, that's very good. All right, well, let's see.

157
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:14,150
So a lot of the examples we talk about come from those top two references on previous slide.

158
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,740
So again, that saturation model we talked about, this, too, is just a quick reminder.

159
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:25,760
We could calculate concentration maximum was equal to that partial pressure over our total pressure times of the year.

160
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:31,490
And the partial pressure we showed was can be equivalent to that vapor pressure, right?

161
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:38,060
So that's where we were able to use our old law to do the paper hazard ratio paper.

162
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:48,230
And again, we showed with that table you can link it with a single air monitoring result and extrapolate from there within that mixture.

163
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,480
So that's an example of your saturation model.

164
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:56,480
We had the person who knocked over a bottle, one of those examples, and it turned out they were overexposed.

165
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,860
So there are some various things you can do with that, but again, it's going to tend to overestimate.

166
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:08,920
The situation, which is fine for for many applications. Next is the box model.

167
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,690
Oh, my goodness.

168
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:24,390
So again, based on a mass balance approach and some pretty bold assumptions with regards to generation rate, ventilation rate, and there's adults.

169
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,880
Okay. So I mentioned the assumptions.

170
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:38,090
So for the box model, here are some of our assumptions that make it more doable.

171
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,139
Um, so one is the constant generation rate of a containment.

172
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,350
So, so you have a process, um, a bottle of.

173
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:57,200
A volatile chemical, something that's generating the chemical concern that's going to be 30 milligrams per minute.

174
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:04,370
This is a big one. Perfect instantaneous mixing, which is a bit of a stretch.

175
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:09,079
So that means you're going to have super high turbulent air in the in the space to make it.

176
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,219
So something that's coming from that source is immediately evenly dispersed.

177
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,190
So that's kind of a overly bold assumption.

178
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:22,610
But, you know, you can you can use that to know where that bias lies depending on what you're trying to get at.

179
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:27,700
So we'll come back to that one uniform concentration throughout the whole room.

180
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,660
So that's assuming, again, that perfect mixing, that the concentration of the sources here,

181
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:37,010
it's saying the concentration in the back corner over there is going to be exactly the same as, you know, right here.

182
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:44,060
Again, probably not going to be true. But but that's that's how all these go.

183
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:50,190
And then you're. Ventilation assumptions.

184
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:58,049
So the only busi of constant pressure, air pressure in the room are gaining air.

185
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:03,300
Losing air overall. Result in a negative or positive pressure situation.

186
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:11,670
So it's not too bad. So the cautions, it's going to tend to underestimate the source.

187
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:17,790
So again, if we had a source right here, you think my exposure is going to be more than the years in the back row?

188
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,370
Probably. But with some of these models, if you don't account for that, it's going to assume equal concentrations.

189
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:32,040
So it tends to be okay for people who are ten foot or more from the source or okay as that generation stops.

190
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:39,190
I'll do an example of when you might use that. So here's our box.

191
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,180
This is a room. And.

192
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,450
Q Is there ventilation rate that's cubic meters per minute?

193
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:55,080
And again, it's going to be equal. So constant pressure. So our airflow in is equal to our airflow.

194
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:04,230
We have the room volume, which is V cubic meters and then the generation rate of the chemical concern at some place within that room.

195
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,880
That is a known entity that you can put into units of milligram per minute.

196
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:16,530
So again, the units are important here if you have to transform those to get them to cancel out in these types of equations.

197
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,160
So we usually want to know if we have those parameters.

198
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:28,410
What is the concentration of the chemical in that space at a given time?

199
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:39,390
So you can calculate that based on those parameters. And that concentration again, is going to be our mass over volume over here.

200
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:46,260
So what is the concentration? Then you can compare that with I know we'll or whatever you want to do with it.

201
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,490
As we mentioned, this is based on this balance principle. So this is how these equations are derived.

202
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,960
So you have your mass generated from this red box here plus here,

203
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:05,500
any mass of that same chemical coming into the room with that air flow in your background.

204
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,540
It's going to be equal to the mass that's accumulated throughout that.

205
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:18,230
Plus the mass is being exhausted. And you can solve that out to this differential equation.

206
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:25,520
The different the change in mass or the change in time is equal to the volume times, the change in concentration, the change in time.

207
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,530
So based on that mass balance, you can drive this equation.

208
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:41,580
And don't worry, I'm not going to make you do calculus. It's been a while for me as well, so we can solve this out with some more assumptions.

209
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:45,220
So the change of mass in time becomes the.

210
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,090
What's trapped in the room and what's leaving there. So there's two potential pathways.

211
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,900
And like we talked about with talks, coconut modeling.

212
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:02,560
You know, you have your outgoing air or your excretion versus sinks or storage in the case of toxic economics.

213
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,520
For a lot of these models, we're assuming we're not assuming there are things.

214
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:13,419
But of course, there are times when depending on the chemical and its properties,

215
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:18,490
that things are going to be a big deal, you know, walls, carpet, etc.

216
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,840
So for these, we're going to assume no sinks for the most part, for the basic ones.

217
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:30,870
They do have extensions that can account. So that's the ventilation loss is the only mechanism out.

218
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,049
So that's this part of equations. They're changing. So which time is equal to the ventilation rate?

219
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,930
How? Airflow out times the concentration in the room.

220
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:50,030
And then on the other side of the equation, remember generation point, the G generation raid and then the passive income here,

221
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:57,470
which again is going to be that air for many times the concentration that exists outside of the room that's being brought in.

222
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,990
And you can set those equal to each other and then you finally get this equation at the bottom.

223
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:14,060
That still is not how we want to solve it, but you have that there long term view of what's room zero for that trapped air.

224
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:18,590
A lot of times we'll also assume zero for the concentration of air coming into the space.

225
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:26,839
So. So we're taking that last equation on the last slide and our assumptions.

226
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,850
And No. Six constant low generation rate, an incoming concentration of zero.

227
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:36,580
So we have clean air coming in the room and then the initial concentration there was zero.

228
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,210
So we're starting at zero. Constant generation rate and clean air coming in.

229
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:48,800
You a lot of air coming out gives us our equation that you'll see a lot of in this simple box model.

230
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,570
So that's where we can calculate concentration in a given time.

231
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,770
If we said we want to do is equal to our generation rate over that airflow.

232
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:05,360
Remember, the airflow in is equal airflow. So it's just one number times one minus E to the negative.

233
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:12,500
Q over volume times time plus our concentration coming in times E to the airflow to volume.

234
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,720
That's not so.

235
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:23,480
It looks complicated, but it's pretty easy to plug the numbers in and it gives you what you want to know, which is that concentration of given time.

236
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:31,490
After a while, this t value, the time value is going to get high enough that this is going to zero out.

237
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,250
A couple of these terms will zero out.

238
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:43,280
So once you reach that, that means you've reached a steady state in the space for a given generation rate and for a given air flow.

239
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:48,170
So once you've reached steady state after that time period for a given scenario,

240
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:54,070
it simplifies to a steady state concentration of what your generation rate over that airflow.

241
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:03,300
I know you guys are tired, but is that making some sense by going through or is this just the generation rate is.

242
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,740
Low. That's just a zap from the problem.

243
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:17,570
Just so it's not kind of this adding to the airbags in some way.

244
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:23,270
So it's not throwing off the whole physics of the room. So in most cases, it's kind of a given.

245
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,170
But yeah, good question. So it's steady state.

246
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:33,350
So some some applications of problems you'd want to know steady state.

247
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:37,940
But other times you'd want to know what a given point in time that maybe it hasn't reached steady state yet.

248
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,630
So while it's easy to calculate that steady state, it may not be the most conservative estimate of exposure.

249
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:50,360
Like with that vapor hazard instant index, that was very conservative.

250
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,470
So we can make air airflow here.

251
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,940
You have to just be aware if the person is closer to that source.

252
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,160
It's likely to be a higher exposure than what you're calculating.

253
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:10,210
So that's just one piece you want to keep in mind for that steady state concentration.

254
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,720
Seven average over the entire space. Okay.

255
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:27,070
So this is probably best done with with examples. So here's one where we consider a well-mixed room, a volume of 200 cubic meters in mechanically,

256
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:36,130
mechanically ventilated area of 20 cubic meters per minute. Note that this is very useful in indoor air quality type of applications.

257
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:43,510
When we talk about air changes per hour, so like with COVID, they upped ventilation rates in spaces,

258
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:47,170
including our buildings, and they maximize these air changes per hour.

259
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:55,720
That's simply the ratio of our airflow rate over the room volume, and that's how many times that there is on average change out per hour.

260
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:07,180
So that's just effect. So in this case, based on our flow rate and our room volume, this comes out to an exchange rate of six.

261
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,200
In any event, for example, we're assuming that incoming air,

262
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:18,549
the starting concentration in the room of this chemical is zero and that the

263
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:23,800
generation we can begin at time zero at a rate of 1000 milligrams per minute.

264
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:30,310
So we can plug that into the equation and it will look like this.

265
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:38,140
So it's like the inverse of our. First order to great.

266
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:48,469
So you have a generation rate that's going to build rapidly and then over time it's going to reach that steady state concentration at 60 Minutes.

267
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:53,060
In this case, it reaches steady state. But you can use it less than 60 minutes.

268
00:27:53,060 --> 00:28:00,290
You plug into that equation, you can find where that concentration is at that given time on average of the space.

269
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:09,310
So in this case, by 60 minutes it reached a steady state value of 50 milligrams per cubic meter.

270
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:18,070
If you use that equation and then the squeeze as this tea gets closer and closer to 60.

271
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:26,700
This term becomes smaller and smaller. Closer to zero. And then you'd get just that G over.

272
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,480
Q which in this case was 200 over 23.

273
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:38,670
It's all right. 50.

274
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:49,680
That makes sense. Good. All right.

275
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,650
So we can continue. There's some other things we can do here.

276
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:58,530
So what if we had a case where the room had already been contaminated, but the source was done being generated?

277
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:04,740
So this is an example where somebody noticed a spilled bottle to clean it up or kept a bottle.

278
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,500
A process stopped. I use this in non occupational settings.

279
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:16,960
Playing with cigaret smoke a cigaret as it's burning the other generation and it stops.

280
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:27,340
What you can do with that is then the energy term goes to zero and you solve for t or concentration at a given time this way,

281
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:36,420
that term, that can help for a number of things. How long does it take to reduce the concentration to some level that you're targeting like an oil,

282
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,470
an occupational exposure limit or something like that?

283
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:49,990
Or how much of a how big of a cue, how much floor would you need in a given amount of time to drop that to an acceptable level?

284
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,260
So there's a couple of ways you can go after this to make it useful.

285
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:02,480
So if we returned to our world, we would assume that our initial concentration was at steady state 50.

286
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,170
So that maximum, if that generation is turned off,

287
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:14,400
how long would it take to reduce our concentration to five milligrams per liter cubic meter of energy?

288
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:23,590
Use this to solve for t and you could do this by entering into the equation which.

289
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:37,320
Again is the first order elimination. And you can visualize on the curve as well as calculated.

290
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:46,130
That's about 23 minutes in this case. So again, if you manipulate some of these variables, you know, if you increase that flow rate,

291
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:53,780
it's going to decrease the amount of time it takes to to clear that out and vice versa.

292
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:06,320
Questions so far. And again, the mixing is not perfect.

293
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:17,700
What's going to happen here? Because insurance would be higher.

294
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:23,219
Could be. Depends on where the receiver is that you're interested in or you know,

295
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:31,440
maybe a bolus of the contaminant gets taken out sooner or later, depending on where it's positioned with the outflow.

296
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:38,490
So there's a lot of things that could happen that could change this exact curve or a particular concentration within that space.

297
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:47,490
But yeah, again, that mixing assumption is kind of a big one that we have to we have to sort of live with and know the implications.

298
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:54,460
Okay. So we're mixed.

299
00:31:54,490 --> 00:32:00,880
We're perfect. Instantaneous mixing cannot be assumed. You can add in a mixing factor that's going to account for that.

300
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:09,970
So like we were just talking about, typically it's going to result in less efficient elimination of that of that contaminant.

301
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:17,560
So this M factor can't be instituted to basically as a weighting factor for your air flow rate.

302
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,950
So that's the impact of the mixing factor going to be defined as the fraction of air that mixes completely

303
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:30,220
and is estimated by generally a contaminant in a room and then monitoring the decay concentration all time.

304
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:40,620
So the plow line versus, you know, the slope from which the impactor can be fired, probably more than eight,

305
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:48,400
but typically in the range of point three, 3 to 1, and basically just serves a waiting factor for that.

306
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:53,720
Q So if you were able to calculate that.

307
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:07,860
Another indoor air quality application for this I recall we use these tracer gas heat generated put a concentration of a tracer gas and you

308
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:16,560
can measure it at different parts of the building and you can plot these decay curves and then calculate the flow rate in the building.

309
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:21,600
That's one way of indirectly measuring your air exchanges.

310
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:43,860
So this is one text. I apologize. So again, without that mixing factor, we might be underestimating the amount of content that's moving around.

311
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:50,849
And it's going to depend on where the location is of that intake and how the flow of air

312
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:56,729
is in relation to where the the chemicals being generated and all kinds of other things.

313
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:02,969
So what you end up with is sort of an effective volume of your room where you have probably higher

314
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:09,750
concentrations and then that sort of more active airflow zone where it's going to have lower concentrations.

315
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:14,700
So this is a way you can use that mixing factor to maybe get a more realistic,

316
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:22,320
not quite as underestimated exposure for the effective volume part of that space.

317
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:34,280
So that's that's the main point on this slide. And it's leading up to another concept here.

318
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:40,519
And that concept is our dual zone box model.

319
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,479
So this is another application of the box.

320
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,790
Once we had that, what I just said was the simple box model.

321
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:55,069
You can add on the mixing factor as a weighting factor for your imperfect mixing, but probably a more common method for getting out.

322
00:34:55,070 --> 00:35:01,760
That is this two zone model. We have a near field and a far field in your space.

323
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,840
So you have again that constant generation rate where you're going to have an imaginary near field around that speed,

324
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,320
that generation location, and that's your near field.

325
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:21,770
And the rest of the room is considered your far field, which then allows for different concentrations to be estimated because we, as we talked about,

326
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:26,660
you can't really assume instant mixing right there by the source,

327
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:40,070
but we do still have to assume instant mixing within each zone and then some other assumptions about how much air is flowing between the two zones.

328
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:47,300
But typically what the what you'll have obviously is that near fields going to have a higher concentration than that far field.

329
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:54,590
And this becomes important in occupational settings because usually people are working close to the source of a chemical being generated.

330
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,890
So that gives you a much better estimate that's closer to the source within about ten feet, four feet.

331
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:06,350
And that far field estimate is kind of similar to what we talked about with this simple box, but.

332
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,900
Okay. So in this case, similar set up here,

333
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:26,030
we just have the two fields designated here with this pink dotted line and that beta coefficient is the amount of airflow between the two fields.

334
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:31,400
The near field, in the far field that are or other factors are the same.

335
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:39,270
So how do you determine what is in the field, in the far field, like in a problem?

336
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:44,340
What it say this is you wouldn't say this is the near field.

337
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,880
Yeah, it might be. I think it's user defined but has to be within a certain range.

338
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:57,270
That's why they designate ten feet. And it might depend on the generation rate as well.

339
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:02,430
So it's. Yeah. And you'll see it. It looks a little messy.

340
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,430
I need to do it in practice, but we'll get there.

341
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:12,360
Just a second. Total volume, then, is the sum of that near field volume in the far field volume.

342
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,860
Ventilation rate is the same, generation's the same. It's just assumed to be near field.

343
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:21,420
And then again, that vertical is going to be less than your overall Q rate.

344
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,870
It's just hard to know the differences between the two zones.

345
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:31,820
So then you can calculate either near field or far field concentration for a given time.

346
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:37,000
Four steps down. One that makes sense. All right.

347
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,120
And this is what it looks like. So it's messy. I'm not going to.

348
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:52,310
Okay, so you look at this, I will say I will have you do this on the promise that this is just for tell you how it's done.

349
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:56,540
Our examples, I think, are going to be limited to the simple, simple box.

350
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,999
But, you know, it looks weird, but it actually once you start pulling in the numbers,

351
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,400
it's all the same stuff just repeated on various parts of the equation.

352
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,540
The only difference is, is lambda values. So you have to calculate lambda values first.

353
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:19,310
Lambda one, lambda two down here with all these variables that we had,

354
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:23,840
and then you plug those variables plus the lambda values into your equations to

355
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,970
solve for either your near field at a given time or your far field at a given time.

356
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:38,660
So it looks really weird, looks like something you don't want to do, and I won't make you do it, but it's not as bad as it looks.

357
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:47,180
You want to enter this function into itself. And I think, again, this is just to illustrate to you the difference.

358
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:56,860
So the company wants to either. That's not that difficult of those two lambda values or negative numbers.

359
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,520
And we'll go to zero as time increases. Then you'll end up with a steady state situation as well.

360
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:09,100
So that's near field concentration, steady state, similar to what we talked about before.

361
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:16,300
We have generation right over your total air flow plus generation rate over your air flow from the near field to the far field.

362
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:25,629
And that is where the steady state condition is reached in the same for the far field,

363
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,630
but as we talked about, that's more similar to the simple box model.

364
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:36,090
So it's just simply your generation, the Q there. All right.

365
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,780
So as an illustration, again, I'm not going to have you do this, but I just want to show you how it's applied.

366
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:48,569
Consider a room volume 200 meters again at 20 cubic meters per minute of air

367
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:53,550
flow point source emitting at a rate of one gram per minute near field zone,

368
00:39:54,330 --> 00:40:00,960
we're assuming here is one cubic meter and the air flow between the zones is five cubic meters per minute.

369
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:04,440
So that gives us all the variables we need right there.

370
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:09,940
So I'm not going to have you calculate this, but we can look at figure three here.

371
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:16,650
So this is from that. Again, the first of those two references listed several sites ago.

372
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:27,330
But this illustrates, you know, the the curve over time for your far field down here in the far field.

373
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:37,590
Steady state still isn't reached in this case after 20 minutes is 50 milligrams per cubic meter versus your near field.

374
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:47,640
You see this very rapid increase because that near field was only one cubic meter and it starts to level off ultimately to a steady state of 250.

375
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:55,540
No gas per cubic meter. So that's just to illustrate how vastly different in the simple box model,

376
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:03,370
if you don't account for your zones and you have a person close to the source, you really want to potentially think about the two zone model.

377
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:18,440
So again, the near field rapidly increases and Mozart after about one minute and gradually retains its steady state value.

378
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,690
And then the far field is much more gradual and a much lower steady state concentration.

379
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,930
So if the rumor were all mixed, what would you expect? How might that impact?

380
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,560
This is a more well room.

381
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:43,270
Because together. Yeah, it'd probably make the two zones more or less two.

382
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:45,929
They're not quite as different and that can be done.

383
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:55,050
You know, if you're also if you're near a field with a larger area, that better value between zones was greater things like that.

384
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:01,080
Just look at the equation. I mean, some of these variables will tell you how it's going to impact.

385
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:08,780
The main takeaway here is simple box model may not account for the increased exposure.

386
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:11,960
The near field is going to be much higher in a lot of cases than your far field.

387
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:21,660
And. Ethical standards, and that can change based on some of those some of those values like flow rate and rates.

388
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:30,779
So again, the first reference several slides ago has a lot more explanation on these and some more examples

389
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,860
if you're interested or you find yourself in a situation in your future where you like.

390
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,730
I remember this being introduced at one point. You better remember how to do it.

391
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,600
It's done. You can find those references here.

392
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:50,060
Use these models trying to think back to some other applications.

393
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,910
The School of Art and Design is was called here on campus.

394
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:59,550
Art. Design. Anyway, like stamps.

395
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:04,580
Yeah. Where is the art studios? On North Campus, anyway.

396
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:11,510
So this is kind of a long story, but I got to tell you guys, you guys got me, okay?

397
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,240
Right. So let's see. So a long time ago, there was something I don't know if you guys have heard in the department,

398
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:21,590
a few professors who have since retired got something called the Michigan Dioxin Study.

399
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:28,200
They were researching dioxin contamination throughout the O.C. River Basin.

400
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:33,410
It was funded by Dow Chemical, which in itself had some of controversy surrounding it.

401
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:38,419
But anyway, so they had populations living in this river basin.

402
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:43,719
And then. Control or comparison populations that were from Michigan, but not in that region,

403
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:52,000
to see how much that pollution from the known source was impacting things and they had some cool.

404
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,650
Part of it was that they were they found some very high peak levels among the vegetables

405
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:04,780
and they then were able to go in and investigate why are some of these people so high,

406
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,910
especially if they're in that control group?

407
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:15,040
And one common thing they found among a few of them was that they work with pottery in their spare time as a hobby.

408
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:25,160
And it turns out certain types of clay from certain regions can be naturally contaminated with dioxins called ball play and Kentucky.

409
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:33,700
And so that led to a side study that I was brought in to work on with where they wanted to look at how big of a problem is this?

410
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:39,520
You know, I had kids at the time at school, in art class doing clay thing.

411
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:45,070
This could be a really big issue with everyone working. The play is exposed.

412
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:53,320
So the other thing they found with with some of these people was that the the highest person had actually the kiln in their basement.

413
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,550
There are two kilns in their basement.

414
00:44:55,210 --> 00:45:04,580
So they're wondering, is it the firing process and the aerosolization and Balkanization that is leading to this high school?

415
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,600
So as part of this side study, one involved a bio monitoring component.

416
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,590
The other piece was, we're going to go up to the School of Art and Design, go to their ceramics lab.

417
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:28,390
They call the lab studio to do a bunch of runs where we measure the amount of dioxin in the clay fired up in the kiln, measured after measure the air.

418
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:35,760
But then to know what to do, we have to have an estimate of what kind of sampler do we need.

419
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:38,920
We don't know what kind of expected concentrations we're going to have in the space.

420
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:46,660
So I actually used some of these modeling approaches to estimate what the concentration

421
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:51,190
would be during that firing process based on an assumption of what was in there.

422
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:58,610
We had a measured content. And how much we thought might be released over the course of the firing.

423
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:06,260
It's been. That's why some really nice figures using this and we got in our.

424
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:13,029
Went with a something like a I think we with a four liter per minute sampling rate did some firing but

425
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:18,650
some samples sounds like we're going to have more than enough air volume for this limit of detection.

426
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:26,470
Water samples came back zero. So the modeling was, you know, again, it's a worst case scenario.

427
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:33,490
So then what we did was we ended up orienting a high volume sampler because the ones here were in use elsewhere.

428
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:41,800
So we so we rented some they were like 300 liters per minute, which is basically creating its own air changes in the space.

429
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,570
And those came back as basically zero as well.

430
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:52,860
So anybody want to guess what is happening?

431
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:59,220
Goal. Ultimately, that could be what was happening.

432
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:09,360
But the reason we weren't able to measure an error after some digging in the deep digging in the literature from.

433
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:18,950
Waste some waste incineration literature found that dioxins do actually break down

434
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:21,800
at a certain temperature and that temperature was being exceeded in these kilns.

435
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,740
So basically, it's turning into something else before we are able to measure it.

436
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:28,580
So in order to, you know, help us to conclude that maybe having a kiln,

437
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:33,379
depending on the temperatures used, wasn't the main problem in that case, it could have been,

438
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:37,460
you know, maybe you have over cubicles or something working on a part of a wet,

439
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:41,030
you know, some of those other considerations are handed about, like you said.

440
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:50,030
So anyway, a long winded story to say that I used the box model and it turns out I didn't

441
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:54,580
account for the chemical completely being destroyed before you measure it.

442
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:58,950
So I thought it was going to be super awesome in an application for this plant,

443
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:03,379
but it turns out I'm very glad it wasn't measured because that would have been a huge

444
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,730
public health issue that would have had to change a lot of things that people did.

445
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:12,050
That was a main round of exposure for the general population.

446
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:17,990
But anyway, so small was helpful. Just that one detail we didn't think about.

447
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:23,000
Okay, so here's another example.

448
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:27,710
A client 473 milliliters.

449
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:35,780
So this might be more like what you'd see in the problem set were 73 milliliters.

450
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:41,380
PC is using a small underground volt line of 16.3 liters the bulk of the industry,

451
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:48,160
and therefore blowing 17 cubic meters per minute of it here, three volts.

452
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:51,860
So that tells us our initial container, incoming concentrations zero.

453
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:58,910
And then it gives us our total liquid density and that's per milliliter.

454
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:05,720
It's used to clean equipment over the course of one hour and the entire point point evaporates in a fairly steady state.

455
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:10,759
So if we didn't have any ventilation, we could use our previous ones. We did in the last problem to solve this.

456
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:15,530
But because we have some airflow, we need to add that in.

457
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:24,320
So initial concentration is zero. We want to estimate the peak concentration that develops in the vault to see if it's above the ceiling limit.

458
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:28,720
You know, this dangerous situation of 43, 60 milligrams per cubic meter.

459
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:35,150
We want to see, you know, in this scenario, are we expecting a peak concentration greater than this number?

460
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:43,190
So in a room volume, oh, that's the first example.

461
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,820
Such. All right. So we'll consider that first example and I'll read you the second example.

462
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:59,989
The chlorine gas leak occurs at the bottom of 200 cubic meters, which receives 20 cubic meters per minute by air leveling.

463
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:03,020
The room ends 100 ppm when that leak is sealed.

464
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:08,510
So that's going to be our beginning concentration. Several fans are turned on to mix the air.

465
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:19,339
We don't know how long it will take that ventilation system to clear the concentration down to a level of 0.5 people at the time.

466
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,590
We do average exposure, one as of writing at this point.

467
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:31,040
So on time it's let's take like 5 minutes, work with people next to you if you want and see see what you come up with.

468
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:38,280
On Mondays. And if you don't get all the way done, that's fine.

469
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:58,090
We'll talk through. All right, let's do let's do sample problem one first.

470
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:01,870
Let's do one and then we'll talk about the answer. Then we can do two. How about that?

471
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:11,140
So the first step is to figure out what those variables are that we need correct for our box model.

472
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:44,240
Yes. You talk to each other. Easier to work alone.

473
00:52:50,150 --> 00:54:26,830
Just. You guys ready to talk about this one?

474
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:34,060
Yeah. All right. Oh, yeah.

475
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:37,940
Between. There's some more slides here that I'm not gonna talk about. Okay.

476
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:42,000
So the answer to one of the.

477
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:47,940
Probably the toughest part of this one. Yeah. As long as you can relate everything to the variables we talked about.

478
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:57,870
And the equation is thinking about when that highest concentration is going to occur, because it starts at 60 Minutes is when it's done generating.

479
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:02,250
And that 60 Minutes is going to be where it will be at its highest concentration.

480
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:09,389
So this is a situation in the home extreme of the constant emission rate and we have r, v,

481
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:19,410
r Q and we can find G by using that density that was given the times,

482
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:25,680
the mass or the volume sorry of the, the chemical divided by the number of minutes.

483
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:36,030
So that evaporate over the course of 60 minutes. We're so we concentrate and that mass per time is that four, 73 times 30 and 40 over 60.

484
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:46,410
So that gives us a generation rate of 10,564 milligrams per minute and we can enter that into our equation up here.

485
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:57,119
So our curies is 1.04 and G over Q is 621 but 621 they're 1.04.

486
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:03,700
They're 1.04. They're. And that's what I'd generally look like.

487
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:17,230
But here's something else. So 60 Minutes, all the kids evaporated and really talked about this and basically reporting into this equation.

488
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:28,540
And we come up with it turns out it's the steady state concentration of 621 milligrams per cubic meter.

489
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:39,530
Is the max. So I'm a little confused as to what's the difference between the answer on the previous slide compared to that answer.

490
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:48,170
This isn't the answer yet. This is just how the terms of this equation.

491
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,250
So if you put in 60 here, does this term go to zero?

492
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:58,130
So your answer would be 621. That's the that's the difference.

493
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,969
Yeah, that's kind of. So you can solve it to disagree. Yeah, you can solve it two ways.

494
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:06,740
And if it's out long enough, this is going to be a zero term to denote steady state anyway.

495
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:16,220
But if, say, it was 30 minutes, then it wouldn't be steady state yet it would add to your your turn there.

496
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:25,190
Why would you zero on that? The t not zero two would be 64 one hour when you enter 60.

497
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:29,329
And here you have this this term will become zero.

498
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:33,440
So it becomes 621 times one, which is your steady state.

499
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,990
So you can solve it using the full equation.

500
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:47,800
Or if you're bold and assume steady state, then but save the safe way of you to solve it using the full equation,

501
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:52,360
which those would be zero down terms and you'd get 621,

502
00:57:53,170 --> 00:58:02,020
which in this case is good because it's well below our ceiling limit as well as the other time.

503
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:06,000
We have average limits for this TCA chemical as of 1990.

504
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:12,970
And again, you can do things like calculate the error change, rate your changes per hour.

505
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:19,120
Things like that. So make sense.

506
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:26,820
Any questions? All right.

507
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:36,570
Again. Our second example was the 200 cubic meter room.

508
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:46,080
20 cubic meters per minute of their CO2 was in the room at 100 ppm when the source could shut off.

509
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:55,200
And now there's no more generation. We want to know how long does it take to get that down 2.5 and make it so it's safe to enter that space.

510
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:10,220
So this one is just a different way of looking at the equation we're going to solve for T instead, and we don't have that generation rate anymore.

511
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:19,520
So the generation rate is zero. And so we have our concentration at a given time is equal to initial concentration times.

512
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,510
E to give equal over volume times time.

513
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,410
And we have all of these variables except for time.

514
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:37,520
So we have our concentration, our second concentration of interest point five, our beginning concentration of 100 airflow of 20 room volume of 200.

515
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:42,230
And then we can solve for two from there. Divide by 100 on each side.

516
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:51,140
Take the natural log on each side. And that solves our to come up with 53 minutes to.

517
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:58,490
Get that concentration down from 102.5 given those that were going flow rate.

518
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:06,280
So that's very similar to something we did last time, right, with half.

519
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:13,720
Calculating how much it takes to clear a certain amount of chemical given a Half-Life or whatever,

520
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:19,990
then you know, as a thing and as you can plot it and visualize the answer.

521
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:28,330
This is not actually the same problem because we started at 100, but you get the idea you could play.

522
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:34,000
This is not the same plot. So that makes sense.

523
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:38,770
So we're just trying to give you a sense of different applications for these things.

524
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,830
Same equation, what different things you can do with it, see how much it increases, how fast,

525
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:48,160
what that steady state is, how long it takes to get down to a certain concentration.

526
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:56,800
I skipped over some slides that were read only. These are just again talking about other models you can do.

527
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,780
Mass balance model turning to emission factors, different ways.

528
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:06,100
Think about generation rate, generation rate from a pool of constant area.

529
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:12,080
This is a super ugly equation. It hurts me to look at it even worse.

530
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:17,559
This one from a horses says if you had a spill. There are ways to solve these types of problems.

531
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,770
But in the interest of time, just know it through their companies.

532
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:26,410
Okay, so box models, again, they have a lot of different applications.

533
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:32,320
As long as you know the limitations that are inaccurate inherently.

534
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:37,990
But again, if you approach it as knowing what those limitations are, they can be helpful.

535
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:47,700
Just a reminder. Have a few extra slides here. So what if you can't measure?

536
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:55,970
You can't take an air sample. You're limited and limited on your your model.

537
01:01:56,020 --> 01:02:02,130
You don't know where to hit your input variables for modeling. So that takes us back to sometimes you just have very little information to work with

538
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:06,120
since takes us all the way back to it is one of the factors we talk about with.

539
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:14,960
Recognition and anticipation that you might have to go back to some of those factors to provide your best estimate for exposure.

540
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:20,620
So this could be retrospectively very common in epidemiology studies.

541
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:27,200
You need to go back and try to assign exposure to different groups litigation again, and there's different ways to go at it.

542
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:31,030
We talk about very briefly here.

543
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:38,590
So, again, these are a lot of the same types of information we wanted to collect in our initial anticipation and recognition steps.

544
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:47,380
So industry job titles, things like that that you can then, you know, at the beginning we were bright eyed saying,

545
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:53,350
okay, we just want to identify with the harmful jobs are so we can go out and measure the exposure with our equipment.

546
01:02:53,860 --> 01:03:03,669
But if you're going back in time, you might have to actually just use that job descriptor and details of that job to either estimate

547
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:10,570
what that is just based on process variables or what you can find in health hazard evaluations,

548
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:17,350
literature, research studies, things like that to try to piece together what the exposure might have been.

549
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:27,650
Again, this is a lot of the same information we talked about before. What kinds of materials are being used?

550
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:32,340
How much? How are they being used? What kind of exposure controls are in place?

551
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:38,940
And this is on the back side where we're trying to use that to itself, estimate the exposure.

552
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:44,280
You can also use job specific questionnaires for people who used to have a

553
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:49,140
job or a job that was different in the past to try to bring some information.

554
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:55,780
And a lot of this will go into the same place where then somebody has to make that

555
01:03:55,780 --> 01:04:00,670
decision of what is all this information that's related to some sort of exposure level?

556
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:05,020
Was it above or below an occupational exposure limit? 40 years ago, for example.

557
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:14,480
So you could see how a lot of hair could be introduced. One way to try to make sense of this is to come up with what's called a job exposure matrix.

558
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:20,120
That's basically just trying to organize the process where you have different types of jobs and tasks

559
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:30,410
and either quantitatively or qualitatively assign exposures to the various tasks to agents of interest.

560
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:38,720
So this could be, you know, on a continuous scale, but more likely it might be on a categorical scale like the low exposure,

561
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,610
medium exposure, high exposure for this time frame in this particular job.

562
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:52,370
Based on the information I have access to. And this is a way to make it more uniform across all jobs, tests and time frames.

563
01:04:53,600 --> 01:05:01,040
So this is used a lot in epidemiology studies retrospectively when trying to look at occupational exposures.

564
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:13,250
Here's a very basic example. So this would be an example of a multi industry type of study looking at, say, mortality related to workplace exposures.

565
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:20,060
In this case, they all kinds of different parts of sectors and jobs within each of those sectors.

566
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:27,260
And they're interested in this part of the exposure matrix. Let's go on now to any type of harmful exposure.

567
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:31,700
But here we have herbicides, buildings. You would dust, as you would expect.

568
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:40,130
You know, a farmer has a high rating for your herbicide and sort of medium for your well,

569
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,740
you would say do a lot of different things throughout the day,

570
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:49,550
whereas somebody in construction, a carpenter or wood dust exposure and low on herbicides.

571
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:59,210
So this is a qualitative. In this case, what I've seen people, you know, if you have less different industries to think about,

572
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:07,450
less jobs and less exposures, sometimes you can get much more detailed with more quantitative, continuous values for these.

573
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:10,700
But this is just to give you a sense of how this is done.

574
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:18,140
Then you can use this as your exposure variable in an epidemiologist health outcome of interest.

575
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:21,410
But again, you have to know how this is done.

576
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:28,790
A lot of times you'll read a occupational epidemiologist, you'll see an industrial hygienist assign exposures to that.

577
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:32,870
And that's a big piece. Right. But sometimes that's as much detail as you get.

578
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:38,750
So you'd like to know ideally a lot more detail on what access and information they have,

579
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:44,120
access to what process they use to come up with these assignments of exposure.

580
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:49,710
This for it goes hand-in-hand with expert evaluation.

581
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:57,149
Sometimes that expert evaluation is what takes all that body of information and designates these cells

582
01:06:57,150 --> 01:07:04,710
in a job exposure matrix or is giving an opinion on a legal case where overexposure was claimed.

583
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:08,969
But for that, you have to have some knowledge of the processes.

584
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:13,740
Use the chemicals used for setting exposure controls in place.

585
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:18,560
Things like that. Some people, you know, are known for this.

586
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:28,100
That's what all they do is this type of work. And, you know, you can get a reputation of being, you know,

587
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:34,390
someone who may over underestimate exposure consistently that could be useful for certain parties.

588
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:40,280
Right. So just know that for a certain situations,

589
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:49,790
it's probably better to have somebody who knows that particular type of work as well and maybe involve additional types of.

590
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:54,280
Expertise when coming up with the process for assigning exposures.

591
01:07:55,090 --> 01:08:00,969
So this is used very commonly, like I said, retrospective occupational setting, not much environmental, environmental.

592
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:04,330
You're much more likely to see fancier models and things like that.

593
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:13,150
So, you know, ideally you'd have some models, maybe they could help you in this process, fill out that job exposure matrix and other things.

594
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:22,780
Another way to do it is to have two blinded experts, have them do the same task, not talk to each other and see how well they agree.

595
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:25,209
That might be another way to do it.

596
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:35,670
So different forms of quality control you might be able to build in to this for, you know, your epidemiology study or whatever it might be.

597
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:45,940
That's right. So I guess I've got a summary slide. But modeling always wrong, sometimes useful.

598
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:51,219
The input variables hugely important. You've probably heard garbage.

599
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:53,860
Any calls? Garbage out. It's another record I usually put up.

600
01:08:55,060 --> 01:09:00,340
But just knowing the strengths, limitations of particular model and how it's being applied is important.

601
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:05,140
If you know it's going to overestimate. That might be good for a screening to make sure you're not above a certain level.

602
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:11,320
But no, if you're underestimating addiction, you want to know that that's a possibility if that's the case.

603
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:17,020
Questions on modeling or expert evaluation.

604
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:27,350
All right. So next time, we'll talk a little bit more on statistical applications and then we'll work our way out of the occupational unit.

605
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:32,400
And later, next week, starting. Broader environment.

606
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:37,520
And we'll talk a little bit more about the quiz on Thursday. Details.

607
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:41,390
All right. Thank you all. Good afternoon.

608
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:48,860
That.
