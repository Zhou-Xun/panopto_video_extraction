00:00:05,568 --> 00:00:09,883
Hi, my name is Carrie Karvonen-Gutierrez,
and we're sitting here in the Center for

2
00:00:09,883 --> 00:00:13,371
Midlife Science Research Clinic here
in the School of Public Health at

3
00:00:13,371 --> 00:00:15,470
the University of Michigan.

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,070
This machine that you're taking a look
at is called a bone densitometer or

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,010
a DEXA machine, and
we use it with our research participants

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,680
where we measure the bone density
of the women in our study.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,730
The reason we measure their bone
density is to understand their risk for

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,170
fracture and
how their bones are changing over time.

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,333
Bones is a important measure for
us in terms of research

10
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:40,481
because we're interested in fractures and
risk of falls as women age.

11
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:43,100
But to understand how
bones change over time,

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,864
we need to understand what
bones are made out of.

13
00:00:45,864 --> 00:00:48,942
Bone is a tissue and
is made of specific cells.

14
00:00:48,942 --> 00:00:53,794
And so for us to understand how that's
related to women's health and aging,

15
00:00:53,794 --> 00:00:59,104
we need to understand how bone cells form,
change, and are made in the life course.

16
00:00:59,104 --> 00:01:01,925
In this module,
we're going to jump more into cells, and

17
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:06,764
understand how they're relevant for
health and aging.

18
00:01:06,764 --> 00:01:09,200
Cells are the basic unit of life.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,645
Every living thing no matter how large or
small, is made up of cells.

20
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:19,527
Cells are amazing in their complexity,
yet their simplicity, as they're able

21
00:01:19,527 --> 00:01:23,641
to perform the basic functions
necessary for each cell to survive.

22
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:27,273
In this session, we are gonna learn
about the basic structure and

23
00:01:27,273 --> 00:01:30,994
organization of cells.

24
00:01:30,994 --> 00:01:35,320
The smallest independent
living thing is a cell.

25
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,230
And we can think of cells then
as the building blocks of life.

26
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:44,413
As we think about the ways in which cells
are organized and specialized in our body,

27
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:49,004
lets think about the ways in which
something more familiar is organized,

28
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:50,952
like the structure of a house.

29
00:01:50,952 --> 00:01:55,910
To build a house we need individual
bricks, boards, pipes, and

30
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:00,507
shingles, and all of those
are organized in a specific way so

31
00:02:00,507 --> 00:02:03,408
that we can serve a specific purpose.

32
00:02:03,408 --> 00:02:06,208
For example, bricks might be organized to

33
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:12,080
build the exterior wall of the house
to provide protection and structure.

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,231
No one brick alone will protect you
from the rain or the cold outside,

35
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:19,167
but when we organize all
those bricks together,

36
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:23,551
a wall can be built that would then
provide that structure and function.

37
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:26,030
Our body works the same way.

38
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,646
Cells serve as the building materials and
organization within our body.

39
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:35,551
Cells organize together to form tissues
which then provide a specific and

40
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:37,220
specialized function.

41
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,104
There's four tissue types in our body,
muscle, nervous, epithelials,

42
00:02:42,104 --> 00:02:44,620
and connective tissue.

43
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,339
Each of them have a specialized function.

44
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:52,520
For example, the function of muscle is
to support the body and enable movement.

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,492
No house would be comfortable or
useful with only exterior brick walls.

46
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:59,500
Nobody would wanna live in
a house with just walls.

47
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,437
Similarly, our body requires more
sophisticated levels of organization

48
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:05,621
beyond tissues.

49
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:06,797
Organs are two or

50
00:03:06,797 --> 00:03:12,175
more tissue types that work together
to work to perform a similar function.

51
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:17,038
Using our house analogy now, the function
that we're interested in providing might

52
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:19,550
be structural protection to the elements.

53
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,990
We don't wanna get wet or rained on or
cold from the snow outside.

54
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,804
Thus, the exterior walls, the windows and

55
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:31,291
the roof together might be thought of
as an organ that works together to

56
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:35,566
perform this common function of
keeping us safe, warm, and dry.

57
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:37,920
In our body, we have many organs.

58
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,834
One of the most widely known and
appreciated organs is our heart.

59
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:44,900
The function of our heart is to
move blood throughout the body.

60
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,495
And to do this, it requires muscle tissue,

61
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:50,382
because the chambers of
our heart are muscular.

62
00:03:50,382 --> 00:03:51,321
Nervous tissue,

63
00:03:51,321 --> 00:03:55,145
because the electrical signaling
within the heart triggers it to pump.

64
00:03:55,145 --> 00:03:58,776
And epithelial tissue,
which lines the heart itself and

65
00:03:58,776 --> 00:04:03,703
our organs within our cavity there,
to prevent friction as the heart beats.

66
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:08,510
All of this works in a coordinated
fashion to allow the heart to

67
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,368
perform the function.

68
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,977
To be able to survive
comfortably in our house,

69
00:04:12,977 --> 00:04:16,830
we need more than just shelter
from the external environment.

70
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,703
We need things like sanitation and
temperature regulation and security,

71
00:04:21,703 --> 00:04:23,416
among many other things.

72
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,893
The ways in which a home serves
these needs is through systems,

73
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:31,369
like our sewage system, our heating and
cooling system, our security system.

74
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:34,823
Each of these systems is
made of interrelated parts.

75
00:04:34,823 --> 00:04:38,829
All of which work together to
achieve that specific function.

76
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:42,789
So for example, our heating and
cooling system includes our furnace,

77
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:46,520
our air conditioner, our windows,
our chimney, our duct work.

78
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,425
All of that works together in a
coordinated way to keep us warm when it's

79
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,484
cold and cool when it's hot.

80
00:04:53,484 --> 00:04:56,956
Similarly, our body is
organized into systems.

81
00:04:56,956 --> 00:04:59,484
Systems are organizations of organs

82
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:04,057
that work together to perform
functions necessary for survival.

83
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:06,081
We know that the heart is an organ, but

84
00:05:06,081 --> 00:05:08,939
it's organized within
the cardiovascular system.

85
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:12,800
Alone, the heart can't provide
nutrients and oxygen to our body.

86
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,959
It can pump, but it requires blood
to carry oxygen to tissues, and

87
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,720
to carry cellular waste away from tissues.

88
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,021
It requires blood vessels to serve as
the transport system for that blood.

89
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:30,595
The organization of our body from
cells to systems is amazingly complex.

90
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:35,540
We've learned how cells are organized in
to tissues, how tissues are organized

91
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,560
into organs, and how organs
are organized into systems, so that that

92
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,112
provides the structure and a function
needed for our body to maintain health.
