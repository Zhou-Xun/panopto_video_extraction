1
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:26,740
Okay. Good morning, everyone. So let's briefly look at the previous lecture.

2
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,270
So we had a node on, uh,

3
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:46,950
sigma algebras and we found that there is no such thing as a sigma algebra where we can list the sense indexed by natural numbers.

4
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,610
So that was sigma algebra can be represented as a sequence of sense.

5
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,590
And we had an argument due to come to that.

6
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,020
So if the sigma algebra has infinitely many elements, it is not comfortable collection.

7
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:16,110
Then we. And with that, we kind of finish the topic on what Algebras and Sigma Algebras are.

8
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:28,000
And then we defined. So we are kind of defining analogies that we had in calculus for different types of stuff.

9
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,710
And we were its sequences and their limits last time.

10
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:43,410
But this time we defined it for sense. So we defined what the limits of sense are and define an equivalent.

11
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:51,540
So in the calculus, we had limits, superior and limit in theory, which is when we take either the maximum,

12
00:01:52,110 --> 00:02:01,110
the infinite or the supreme of the tail and then consider the limits of that thing as AM goes to infinity.

13
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,380
So this was defined in calculus as a limits view and limit, respectively.

14
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:18,180
And with the SATs, we adopted a definition for sequences of sets that are either increasing or decreasing.

15
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:29,220
And the limits superior sets was defined as just infinitely many events happening as a collection of omegas,

16
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,180
which light up an infinite number of events in the sequence.

17
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:44,780
Uh, and the limits inferior was where eventually for and large enough, the entail of the sequences all lighted up.

18
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,540
Right. So all the events in the table are happening.

19
00:02:51,420 --> 00:03:04,530
We also I also hinted on the correspondence between the calculus way of defining things versus, uh, the things and match theory for sequences of sets.

20
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:16,230
And it was said it's, if you consider indicator functions, um, and use indicator functions instead of the sense themselves.

21
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,350
So again, a calculus sequence of zeros and ones.

22
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:27,620
And it's one of your homework problems to actually show that there is a 1 to 1 correspondence between, uh,

23
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:37,560
the definitions of limit superior to the theory of four such sequences of indicator functions and for the sequences of sets.

24
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,030
Right. There's one example in the homework.

25
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,310
I think it's the last problem. Uh, what else?

26
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,510
And last thing we mentioned is that.

27
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,629
So if we have a disjoint collection of sets,

28
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:09,930
then so both the limits superior and the limit inferior of this sequence of disjoint sets are actually empty because at most one set is happening.

29
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:16,350
So for any army in the capital Omega, it can belong to one of them by definition.

30
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:22,410
Okay. And so piling up on that example.

31
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,010
So we consider I don't remember if I've already given this definition.

32
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,060
So that's a partition of Omega.

33
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:53,570
And the idea of it is that, well, I have let's say my capital Omega right here, and I'm cutting it into pieces, let's say, like this.

34
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:03,350
And those pieces I call sets say this is a sad and.

35
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,720
Or I or AK or whatever.

36
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,650
And so the thing about the piece is, so if I cut it, they're going to be disjoint.

37
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,060
So we say a disjointed collection.

38
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,660
We're a collection of disjoint sets. What sequence?

39
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:38,110
Either way. Much of it is joined.

40
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:53,420
So it's. I so accountable collection right where it goes from one to am.

41
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:06,550
And such that. The Union of all of them.

42
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:18,720
Makes up the middle. Then such a collection we call a partition.

43
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:40,810
Uh, politician. Not way they go. Okay.

44
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:48,049
That was just a note in passing. Okay.

45
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,480
So if we look back at what we had so far,

46
00:06:50,660 --> 00:07:00,140
we basically defined events where defines the Capital Omega as a collection of all possible elementary events.

47
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:10,340
We looked at the events as subsets of that Omega, and then we defined operations on them and made it so,

48
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:16,490
uh, and consist of collections that are closed with respect to those operations, including countable ones.

49
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:23,120
So this and at this point we arrived at the thing we called measurable space.

50
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:39,810
And so that was a combination of the army does somehow define and I see my algebra built on it.

51
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:57,270
And in the main for that pair, there's indirectly hints that this that at this point where it's ready for introduction of a measure,

52
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,710
we also defined what general measures are. Right.

53
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,060
So I would just borrow the definition from measure theory.

54
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,080
And they were, uh, not negative.

55
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,620
Um, measure of an empty set was a zero.

56
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:38,430
And we had countable objectivity. That means for any partition of omega.

57
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:48,110
The the measure of the Union is, uh, uh, some of the measures.

58
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:59,310
That's what. Manager of the union I from one to the end and then could be infinitely large.

59
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:09,230
These are some I want to. Managers of the office.

60
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:21,150
That was the general one. Right. So what I'm about to do is tweak this definition a little bit to get the probability measured.

61
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:33,040
The only difference, seemingly inconsequential, is to require that the measure of the full omega is actually one that's normalization.

62
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:38,350
And as we will see, this one actually leads to an interesting result,

63
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:49,420
that probability measures are continuous and this normalization condition plays an important role in the proof of that thing.

64
00:09:52,140 --> 00:10:15,060
Okay. So probability. So it's it's a thing that takes a sap and puts in the correspondence with the sap.

65
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:19,890
Uh, a real number on, uh, well.

66
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,040
So let's just do a01 interval for it.

67
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:36,470
So it's a subset of real numbers such that.

68
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:46,440
And then there are three axioms of probability. Some are directly borrowed from the measure theory.

69
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,470
And the normalization thing is unique.

70
00:10:50,580 --> 00:11:03,750
So the first one is that the probability of any a of any event is going to be greater than zero for any A in the sigma algebra.

71
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,990
Right. So at this point, we have we already have the probability space, right?

72
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,170
So we have the Omega and we have the F.

73
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:24,470
Given. The not the problem, the miserable space where it's when there is a probability to it.

74
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:33,540
We will call it probability space. That's same as for general measures.

75
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,239
And the second one is a unique axiom.

76
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:44,080
That's the normalization. So if I take, uh, probability of the Omega, we'll get a one.

77
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,190
And then the third one is counter intuitive.

78
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,260
So later on we will see that this is not the only way to define it.

79
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:23,630
So it could have been defined in a somewhat different way because there are basically if and only if statements regarding these axioms.

80
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,320
So they could be combined in a somewhat different way.

81
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:37,430
For example, instead of countable activity, we can require the finite entity reader and continue reading.

82
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,550
And in this context, one would define it like that.

83
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:48,950
So the continuity will be a consequence of it.

84
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,440
Okay. And it's defined in the same way.

85
00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:04,520
Right. So if I take a probability of a union and from one generally to infinity, could be a finite set, of course.

86
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:12,000
And if it's finite, then it's just the entity within not a comfortable one.

87
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:24,110
Finite activity. And from one to infinity probability of the events like that.

88
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,450
And this is for any politician a.

89
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:44,090
And from one to infinity of capital on the.

90
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,510
So we referred to the definition of the position on our.

91
00:13:52,900 --> 00:14:00,550
So in other ways, it's sort of an interchangeable operation, right, of the Union of sets and,

92
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:06,940
uh, the probability measure, except that the union becomes the sum.

93
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,110
And by the way, it's a one you may have heard.

94
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:24,210
And I actually used these arithmetic notation for operations on sets, like plus for the union and times for the intersection.

95
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:31,170
So we could do it here as well. Okay.

96
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:43,360
So let's look at properties. Or a probability that's defined like that.

97
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:50,710
So right now we basically try to forget everything we have on probabilities before six of one stuff.

98
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,670
Yeah, we're only allowed to use 1 to 3.

99
00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:02,290
And the goal is to quickly gather all the properties we're used to for the probability.

100
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,909
So let's start with, uh, so with the measures, right.

101
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:13,020
So a measure of an empty set, the zero probability of an empty event is also going to be zero.

102
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:20,320
So how do we show that? So let's show that probability of an empty thing is zero.

103
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,530
Uh, just using 1 to 3. Um.

104
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:36,060
So. We can say that Omega right is a union of an empty sat and omega.

105
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:46,770
And then use a dtv t to say that the probability of ami go.

106
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:58,890
On the one hand, this is a one right by the axiom two at the same time by Axiom three.

107
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,350
So that's a two by three.

108
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:16,050
We have that. It has to be additive. So that's the probability of an empty set, plus the probability of Omega, as I apparently have a position.

109
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:27,349
And so then I have an equation for the probability of an empty symptom.

110
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,510
That's zero, right? This one, this guy is equal to one as well.

111
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:52,290
So this empty square is just the end of proof symbol.

112
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:59,950
Okay, so then. So I don't see anything about compliments in the axioms.

113
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,980
So let's do the compliment thing.

114
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:14,280
So let's show that the probability of a compliment is actually one minus the probability of a, let's say, same thing.

115
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:25,680
We work through the partition, so we say that we can partition the army into two sets of partition with two elements.

116
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,300
So the A itself and the complement of eight and the army go.

117
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:43,150
Then I can again say that and take the probability on both parts.

118
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:54,870
So the first one is going to be one. The second one is going to be of a loss by two or three.

119
00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:06,920
Right. Three. I will have P of A with the bar and I'm just going to solve it for again for p e of the bar.

120
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,680
And that's going to end up the one minus the of it.

121
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:29,200
So we're kind of working through the low hanging fruit of the. So it's potentially more complicated.

122
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,940
Examples. So three.

123
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,490
Let's do formula. Of total probability.

124
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:59,860
So for the formula of total probability. So I want to consider the probability of some event.

125
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:09,809
Let's say a, b. And I want to represent it is in terms of a petition.

126
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:14,460
So let's say this is my FORMIGA. This is my B.

127
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:25,800
And I have a petition of Army girls, so I basically slice the pie into pieces, right.

128
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:29,950
And then I assemble B from the resulting pieces.

129
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,420
So this is my first one. This is my second one.

130
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:48,549
This is my third one. Okay. So I appeal to this Venn diagram to be able to say that I can represent the is a union from one generally to infinity.

131
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:57,010
You could also be a finite statement of and intersections.

132
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,970
B So these are the pieces that I shaded.

133
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:10,940
So they are those intersections. Okay.

134
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:17,280
And, uh, so a m is a partition in this context.

135
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,700
State capital, Orlando. Right.

136
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:33,600
So and at this point, I basically use probability on both sides of the equation above.

137
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:43,139
Then I'll have the probability of B if I have a position can be represented as a sum and generally

138
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:54,210
two infinity probabilities of the pieces of B as they intersect with the elements of the position.

139
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,580
And this is what's known as the formula of total probability.

140
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:27,190
A very useful thing, by the way. If you are doing modeling and we will have variations of that formula, this is the simplest way to to give a formula.

141
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:33,129
We will have them for random variables. We will have different consequences.

142
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:40,750
We will have formulas of total probability for the expectations, including when they are random variables and so on.

143
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,510
This is just the six or one level formula.

144
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,650
Okay. Now let's do some immediate corollaries.

145
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,310
Of the formula. So the first one is that.

146
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:18,690
So if I have A that's part of B, then the probability of E is going to be less equal than probability of B.

147
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:31,790
So how do we show that we can consider a politician using a complement?

148
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:59,320
A complement of capital omega and then use the formula of total probability to provide B is the probability of the the section B

149
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:13,570
was probability a complement and the section B right so straight formula of total probability with a number of elements being two.

150
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:20,320
And then so because a is a subset of B.

151
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:28,960
This is equal to probability of e rates.

152
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,300
And this guy is a probability is greater equals zero.

153
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:47,280
And so as a result, I do get that the probability of E must be smaller equals the probability of B.

154
00:23:54,350 --> 00:24:04,130
And then another kind of low hanging fruit is that the probability of any event is going to be less or equal one.

155
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:16,430
And this is a consequence of me taking, uh, b is as the full on at the.

156
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:24,470
And I will have one on the left and, or one on the right of way looking at the inequality.

157
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,970
We'll keep them. So what is it?

158
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:43,160
So I have three. Let's say the cut of all the trees will be for.

159
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,930
Let's say you're going to have property number five just to give it a number.

160
00:24:53,250 --> 00:25:07,860
So if I take from the ability of a union with a B, then this is going to be a less equal ability of A plus probability of B.

161
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:16,200
And that's when I have a situation. This is.

162
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:29,710
Let's see. This is be. So if I just sum up the probability of A and B, so that shaded area, the intersection of A and B will be summed up twice.

163
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:41,170
And this is what makes up the inequality. So we will later on write an explicit formula for what the last part of that inequality is.

164
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,210
But at this point, I will just say that.

165
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,610
So I'll take probability of A plus probability of B,

166
00:25:52,900 --> 00:26:03,370
and I will use a formula of total probability with a complement as a partition on the second on the P of B.

167
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:08,200
So my P of A is going to be the same.

168
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,640
And then I will have the probability of.

169
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:26,490
He complemented the section with a b. Last probability of any intersection with the B.

170
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:58,620
Okay. And. So if I look at, let's say this guy right again, it's helpful to look at the Venn diagram.

171
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:04,589
So I'm taking the full E plus what's in the B that's not part of V,

172
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:15,810
so that's the probability of a union with the B, and this guy is something that's agreed to equals zero.

173
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,310
And so I get my inequality.

174
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:32,190
And let's say as a six. Um.

175
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,900
I will take these. I'll give a general formula.

176
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:46,760
So if I have a probability of a union high from one to P and he I.

177
00:27:49,540 --> 00:28:08,860
I can actually write it will spell it out is the sum of K from one, two and minus one, two, k plus one and then probability of the intersection.

178
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,570
I for one, took a.

179
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,160
So you can take an equals one. Yeah.

180
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:29,910
And that will give you the, the formulas that we considered above.

181
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:41,120
And so what you see is that there will be alternations, alternating terms.

182
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:49,790
Right. So if I take an equals two, that would be a formula that takes the full A, plus the full B,

183
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:57,920
and then subtract the intersection between A and B that shows up twice in my son to get the this result.

184
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:07,820
And from then on, you can just use induction on this formula and use this argument with just two pieces to show that

185
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:14,030
for any given and it would follow that it works four and plus one and the whole thing will work.

186
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:28,260
Okay. So I promised you to discuss continuity.

187
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:32,380
So let's do that. But first, we need to define it.

188
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:46,530
And let's start with the definition that we had in calculus for the continuity.

189
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,660
And there are multiple ones.

190
00:29:49,800 --> 00:30:00,250
So one is when you use the epsilon delta language and the one that's that's more useful for us is the one that's done through sequences.

191
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:11,980
Uh. So that means let's say F of something, F of x, right is a function.

192
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:27,880
And so in calculus, we understand the function as something that takes an X and puts it in correspondence with a real number.

193
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,150
Only one real number, right?

194
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:41,860
So that could be, uh, X and Y that, uh, give the same real number when we act on them by the function but not the other way around.

195
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:50,090
So there are no, we are not considering functions with multiple values to them, although they do exist in mathematics.

196
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:55,209
So for those of you who have a complex variable, uh, calculus,

197
00:30:55,210 --> 00:31:00,220
so you would know with its functions like logarithm, for example, a multiple value there.

198
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:09,610
Okay. And, uh, so we say that we have a point x let's say.

199
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:17,740
That's a real number. And we want to define, uh.

200
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,810
Uh. What does it mean? That function F is continuous at x.

201
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:41,620
That just means that. So this sequence based definition, then for any sequence, I'd say I'm.

202
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:56,280
Of real numbers. Such that this sequence has a limit of X as M goes to infinity.

203
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:04,620
The induced sequence. A function of it is.

204
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:17,220
Therefore Lexan has a limits and that limit is F of x.

205
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:31,570
So if we want to write it in terms of limits, that would mean that for any second sex and.

206
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:52,810
Such that the limits of X and X as m goes to infinity, the limit as m goes to infinity of half of x and is going to be half of the limits.

207
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:03,770
All right. And this is just a different way to write the previous line.

208
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:11,480
But you see the essence of continuity, namely, it is that the limit and the F are interchangeable.

209
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:23,750
In this context and this. Our exchangeable.

210
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:37,320
Of course, there are the differences, as I said, Fred.

211
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:43,470
So the Epsilon Delta language would mean that. So for any epsilon greater than zero,

212
00:33:44,580 --> 00:34:00,840
I can find the delta that will be dependent on the epsilon so that when I take any numbers in the delta vicinity of the X,

213
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:13,200
then this will induce my function numbers, the corresponding function numbers that will be apart from each other by no more than the epsilon.

214
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:36,870
Okay. And then we can define now looking at the calculus definition and explicitly the last statements that we can exchange the limit of the function.

215
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:42,480
We can take a page from here and define continuity of a measure.

216
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:48,740
So we would say that. A measure.

217
00:34:53,020 --> 00:35:01,770
New is continuous. When?

218
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:15,490
The measure of sun sets, sequence of sets B and is limits and goes to infinity.

219
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,500
We will go to the measure of the D where.

220
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:32,450
This is for any sequence B and B such that these actually the limits.

221
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:38,300
I said it was to infinity. I've been.

222
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,850
So we could again write it in the exchangeable form.

223
00:35:52,970 --> 00:36:10,130
We can say that the limit new B and as and goes to infinity is new of the limits goes to infinity of B, right.

224
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:17,520
That's just an equivalent way to write this stuff above.

225
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:27,150
Now let's now. And this is for any measure new, including the probability.

226
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:43,000
And in this context, just a reminder so we can see the limits of SATs when B is either increasing or decreasing.

227
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:56,880
So we do not consider these statements in a broader context because we don't need to.

228
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,970
Okay. So now the interesting theorem.

229
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:12,180
So let's say I have a p. Uh, there's a probability measure.

230
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:28,950
So it's a function from a set of cells into a number of zero one satisfying axioms.

231
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:37,590
One, two, three. Then we can say that finite in the TVT.

232
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,750
And then Genuity.

233
00:37:53,430 --> 00:38:05,120
So this whole thing. Is going to be equivalent to the Axiom three, which is countable in DTG.

234
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:28,130
So this shows a number of things.

235
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:35,630
So first of all, we can say that we could have replaced Countable a DVD by another axiom or a couple of them.

236
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,470
Uh uh. The finite entity meeting and required continues in.

237
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:52,580
Um, and on the other hand, it's all it also shows that the axioms as they stand now when we define probability,

238
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:58,340
they actually imply continuity, which is an interesting consequence of them.

239
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:07,480
That's by no means evident. So let's do the proof.

240
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:40,160
And let's start with sufficiency. Well, necessity.

241
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,860
I always. And she knows these, too.

242
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,910
So I want to show that countable activity.

243
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:04,480
Implies, well, fine identity with you, which is the trivial path, right?

244
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:27,790
And continuity. Now, I guess whether it's sufficiency or, uh, necessity depends on how we write the two statements in the equivalence.

245
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:34,340
Right. Let's call it sufficiency. Okay.

246
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:43,880
So let's say I have been as a sequence.

247
00:40:49,020 --> 00:41:01,980
Of decreasing sets. And this is how it looks like, right?

248
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:07,230
So each side is part of the previous one and eventually they have a limit.

249
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:12,239
That's the shaded area. Right.

250
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:26,309
And then the set I start with is let's say A, B, and then the next one will be the plus one that's part of B, some sort of violence or one weight.

251
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:34,560
And the goal is now to rewrite the B in is a union of the bagels that this sequence forms.

252
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,920
So I would say that this is a B, which is the middle, right?

253
00:41:40,500 --> 00:42:05,190
That's the limits union with the disjoint sets K from and to infinity c k where C keys are intersection of key with B key plus one complement.

254
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:11,430
Right. So if you visualize it, uh, that would mean that.

255
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,940
So the sense be there circles, right field circles in the picture.

256
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,010
Uh, so if you take and they are nested within each other.

257
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:32,129
Right? So if you take the next one, it's going to be smaller. So you take the previous circle and then the complement of the next one.

258
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:45,000
So that makes um, kind of a strip that remains a very go in by definition of these intersections.

259
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,480
So they're not going to intersect with each other. That was bagels.

260
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:55,290
So I basically have a partition of, uh, view this way.

261
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:19,510
Defined in the same way as we defined partitions of Omega. So then on a partition I can use the countable activity.

262
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:38,180
Then I can write. The probability of B is B of B plus some k from an to infinity probabilities of c k.

263
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:45,590
Right. And there's nothing to subtract from from it because they are all disjoint.

264
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,660
And this is accountable to the G.

265
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:09,210
That implies this. And then so the left part is a probability.

266
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:17,650
So this whole thing is less or equal one, and that's a consequence of normalization.

267
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:34,390
And here is the interesting thing. So we can make a note from calculus and you.

268
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:54,910
About sequences. Not from not from sequences, but more precisely from serious great Survivor series.

269
00:44:56,050 --> 00:45:03,550
Let's say I have some K from one to infinity.

270
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:12,330
Excuse. And let's say this series converges, right?

271
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:17,970
So there's some opportunity which is less, uh, than infinity.

272
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:32,000
So I have a convergent series. So what can you say about the behavior of the tail?

273
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:39,670
So the damn tale of the summer.

274
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:48,850
So we define it in a similar way as we define tables of sequences, except that we now have the song.

275
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:54,040
So that would be okay from end to infinity.

276
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:59,890
Exactly. So if my series converges.

277
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:04,270
What can we say about the behavior of such tales as M Goes to Infinity?

278
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:19,900
They go to zero rates. And the way to remember it is if you consider Taylor series rates a lot of them are Taylor's is.

279
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:27,450
So then the two right here is just the remain the term of the Taylor series.

280
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:36,340
Right. So if you keep adding members to it, it will give you the converging sum, right?

281
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,459
So example would be. So if you take an exponent, right?

282
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:48,520
So it would be so the next day would be let's say x2k over k factorial in the sum from one to infinity,

283
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,450
from zero to infinity, that would make it E to x, right?

284
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,510
And probably this is how the calculator computes.

285
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:05,530
This function just takes members of the series and, uh, until something digit starts changing.

286
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:16,420
Okay. So the reason why I bring this up is that I do have an empty well of a certain series of there.

287
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:24,610
And that's this term. Right. And I know that it's a converging series because of the normalization,

288
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:30,820
because I know the whole thing is less than one, and then the first term is also less than one.

289
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:35,710
And my series from them to infinity is less than one.

290
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:46,420
Right. And if I increase the M because it's a converging series, then this guy will go to zero.

291
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:52,360
This calculus fact is in goes to infinity.

292
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:12,630
And as a result from this whole thing, I will have that P of B and now that my second term goes to zero, will go to P of B.

293
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:20,180
His and girls rights. And that's what we wanted to show.

294
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,950
So now let's. Let's prove the other way around.

295
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:48,530
Call it necessity. You can, uh, switch the necessity and sufficiency or good sense, depending on how you see the beginning of this year.

296
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:52,999
And so what do we need to show?

297
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:13,470
So we have finite the DTV here. Which means that they can only use things like this up to a finite number, not up to infinity.

298
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:21,090
Whenever I have a partition, but I do have continuity next to it.

299
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:34,650
And I need to show that these two imply accountable and the TV.

300
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:54,000
So this is neat to show. Okay.

301
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:57,600
So we'll start with with, uh, uh, partition.

302
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:08,130
Right. So let's say, uh, I have a and so I just want to write, uh, what we want to get, uh.

303
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:19,420
So is a partition of Omega. And accountability.

304
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:24,970
The treaty would mean that I can write something like this.

305
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:32,070
So I'm running out of tools.

306
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:58,150
So one union and from one to something.

307
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:05,620
So union of eight ends and accountability a.t would mean that this union is up to infinity.

308
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:14,900
You and I can exchange the probability of the union into a sum of probabilities.

309
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:32,270
Like that. And so the countable activity would mean that my limits to the union and to the sum are infinitely large.

310
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:41,480
And what is given to me that I can use that this is true whenever my limit is finite.

311
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:45,260
So let's say I have an AM. Is that limit?

312
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:50,090
So then this is a given to me by the statement on the left.

313
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,920
Right. So this is countable entity which not countable, finite.

314
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:11,980
Right. But nobody prevents me from writing.

315
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,260
That's the union from one to infinity.

316
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:23,290
And the U.S. is a union up to M plus.

317
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:30,140
The remainder of that thing plus means it's.

318
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:38,700
It's a union, right? I'm plus one to infinity.

319
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:44,430
Yeah, right. So I can split it at the.

320
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,540
Now because my aims are disjoint.

321
00:52:53,980 --> 00:53:02,230
So I have unions that have non intersecting aims, so they will be disjoint too.

322
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:08,950
So these two sets as a whole, right? So they don't have an intersection.

323
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:18,829
Because he is a politician. Right.

324
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:35,570
And I have two of them. Right. So it's finite. Then I can write that the probability of the left part and from one to infinity and is actually.

325
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,870
So for the first one I can use finite NDTV keys so I can write that as a sum.

326
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:55,620
This is by firelight. TVT.

327
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:01,920
So the fact that I can write them is sum of two terms is again, finite.

328
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,070
And you. So it's this thing in this thing.

329
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:20,900
Right. But then the last term, I can not exchange the unions because it's countable union and I'm not allowed to do that.

330
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:24,560
This is what we want to prove a fact about it.

331
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:31,590
But what we can say is that this piece in between.

332
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:38,090
So this is b am and they are decreasing sense.

333
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:44,330
Right. Uh, with em.

334
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:54,560
Uh, with him. Right. Because I'm taking less and less.

335
00:54:54,580 --> 00:55:08,060
It's the union. Okay.

336
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,850
Where the m is is just the union from M plus one to infinity then.

337
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:25,730
So if I consider limits of those, the EMS is, uh, m goes to infinity.

338
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:36,170
So by definition. So the limit of decreasing sets would be, uh, accountable intersection and from one to infinity at.

339
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:48,980
And I can spell out what this means by using my formula for the beam.

340
00:55:49,010 --> 00:56:00,710
So it's intersection m from one to infinity and then beam is a union and from then plus one to infinity a m.

341
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:12,160
And you can tell me what that reminds you of. That's a definition for limits superior.

342
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,070
Is in goes to the scene of the sequence.

343
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:25,660
He. And at this point, we recall that he and there was a partition of army.

344
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,430
So these are disjoint sets.

345
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:36,280
We had an example in the last lecture that leave at superior limit and here of sequence of destroying sense is actually an empty one.

346
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:44,070
So that's nothing. Okay.

347
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:51,150
And then we know that the probability of nothing is zero over an empty set.

348
00:56:52,560 --> 00:57:04,620
So then I return back to the formula and we can say that the probability of a limit is m goes to infinity.

349
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:15,030
B am. So that's the probability of an empty sample, and that's a zero.

350
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,970
And then so I have continued to write.

351
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:35,970
So this is where we started to find out that the DVT and continue it here.

352
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,400
So I can replace limits of sets by the limits.

353
00:57:46,790 --> 00:58:07,520
Ingenuity is given. And this in turn means that if I look at the formula, I head above that the limit is goes to infinity.

354
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:13,280
Probability of b m is actually zero.

355
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:25,830
And from here we go to limit.

356
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:36,640
And. In these.

357
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:45,520
Fights we have that the last term actually goes to zero when I go to the limit.

358
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:51,760
So that would make the countable and the DVD.

359
00:58:57,390 --> 00:59:02,550
Yes. It's. Yeah.

360
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:11,050
Right as time goes to infinity. The probability of the union from one to infinity.

361
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:18,150
And is this some? From one to infinity.

362
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:28,230
E And that means. The TV.

363
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:44,200
Was established. And that's the end of it.

364
00:59:47,600 --> 01:05:48,100
Time for a five minute break. Okay.

365
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:56,920
Shall we continue? So let's summarize what we have.

366
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:01,440
And by the way, the. The continuity of the probability.

367
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:07,290
Yeah. So you can see where it's.

368
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:23,230
Proof of sufficiency. No.

369
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:27,280
Well, is the sufficiency understand?

370
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:36,590
Is this implying this right? So if you have countable A.D that means and activity works for any number, including infinity.

371
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:40,460
And that includes finite. So that's the trivial part of it. Right.

372
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:46,150
I think to call it the sufficiency, we need to switch these to.

373
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:58,670
Right. But it doesn't matter. Yeah. Oh, they're not the.

374
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:05,270
Oh, you're talking about the case or case. The case are nested, right?

375
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:09,140
That's because I wanted to consider the limits. Because my.

376
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:16,349
I'm not considering limits. Yes, yes, you can.

377
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:20,040
But all we need is a nest of ones.

378
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:24,600
Either either decreasing or increasing. That's where we consider limits.

379
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:34,830
We just don't need anything else, because otherwise this kind of a housekeeping load to dropping this assumption,

380
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:47,670
that would simply increase the length of the arguments. Okay.

381
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:54,660
So let's let's summarize so we can now give a very important definition.

382
01:07:54,990 --> 01:08:04,200
And by the way, so continuities actually are a very useful tool for proofs because it means that

383
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:11,580
you can show something for the finite number of sets using finite data and so on,

384
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:20,570
and then go to a limit to extend your statement to infinite since infinite unions.

385
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:30,960
Right? So the definition now so we now can say, fine, let's see where the probability space is.

386
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:43,090
Uh, so you will see this a lot in, uh, uh, rigorous papers, right?

387
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:46,760
They all start with the definition of a probability space for the problem.

388
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:50,770
And sometimes they are very complicated. Right.

389
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:58,940
So that's a triple. So we had measurable space. That was just I mean, the hand of sigma algebra built on some of Omega.

390
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:05,270
And then now we have a measure that we can measure our measurable space with.

391
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:10,520
Uh, that's the key. And some properties to it.

392
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:16,430
So that's the triple we're considering now.

393
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:21,740
Um, you can know the difference with six on one.

394
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:28,280
Right. Uh, because here I have the omega, the sigma algebra and the p, right?

395
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:34,950
And let's say my probability metric could be, uh, derived from a normal distribution, let's say.

396
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:37,970
Right. But I haven't defined the variables yet.

397
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:46,910
So there's a little bit of a difference between how you look at random variables and six or one and how you look at them here.

398
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:56,390
Right. So you will define them, uh, uh, as, as just a way to address sets in the sigma algebra.

399
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:03,380
Yep. Uh, but, uh, everything is actually already given by the probability space.

400
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:11,450
Everything that we need. So let's refresh the construction of the probability space.

401
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:34,970
Okay. So it went with a number of steps, right?

402
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:44,450
So we first defined the elementary events and the union of all of them and that was the capital omega them.

403
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:49,350
So we defined events that are not elementary,

404
01:10:49,920 --> 01:11:02,430
so they were subsets of Omega and we defined collections that were closed with respect to finite operations of union intersection and complement.

405
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:07,260
And that was an algebra then.

406
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:11,310
So in the third step we expanded.

407
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:22,070
The algebra into. Sigma algebra.

408
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:32,270
By requiring their countable operations of union.

409
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:36,600
The sections and complements are also inside the collection.

410
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:47,380
And then finally we define the measure on that sigma algebra.

411
01:11:53,200 --> 01:12:02,610
With its axioms. On the subsets that are elements of.

412
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:11,950
Right. So it is a subset of our media, but it's an element of the F, right?

413
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:16,670
So there's an important distinction here. Okay.

414
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:27,740
And this is how it typically happens when you're working with a particular problem and you define a probability space.

415
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:35,270
Now, there's one thing missing here to kind of give us some comfort.

416
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:40,730
Namely, uh, well, we did expand the probability.

417
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:50,540
We defined the probability on an algebra, right, uh, at the beginning of this construction.

418
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:58,250
And then we're not sure whether the expansion to a sigma algebra will keep the probability unique.

419
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:07,940
So that's a technical issue. And there's a theory into that that says that in this construction.

420
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:21,350
He's p. He's uniquely.

421
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:39,840
Defined on a. On events in the E then it is also.

422
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:53,250
Uniquely defined. On the F.

423
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:07,000
That is, build some eight. So to say that this is generated by subsets of the.

424
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:13,800
And that theorem has a name.

425
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:28,140
We won't prove it. So there's the name of a great mathematician whose name is hard to pronounce.

426

Courtesy of Dori.

427
01:14:54,430 --> 01:15:05,290
Because it's not always the case that you define something in a simpler world and then expand that simple world, a world into a more complicated one.

428
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:09,730
Then sometimes things become not unique. Not in this case.

429
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:18,820
And you can sense intuitively that this is a consequence of the continuity of probability as a measure in the end.

430
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:31,390
I probably won't give any formal stuff on how uniquely is defined.

431
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:37,150
So we think of uniquely defined meaning that.

432
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:41,650
So for any a in the collection.

433
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:58,930
Uh. That's right. And so we say that two measures are the same and will interpret this symbol as uniform equality.

434
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:09,660
On. What's a F?

435
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:31,400
Is. Yuan of E for the same e is the same as to leave whenever my E goes over elements or they have.

436
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:48,050
And you probably still remember inequality, uniform inequalities in calculus.

437
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:51,109
So when you want to say that two functions are the same,

438
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:58,550
that that means when the value of the argument there is function one is equal to function two.

439
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:14,340
Okay. So let's let's just define a random variable that's going to be the end for today.

440
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:27,360
Or at least do something to lead into this definition.

441
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:32,690
So when the variable will be a certain function of Omega.

442
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:39,090
So there's nothing mysterious to it. So we consider.

443
01:17:41,470 --> 01:17:51,190
Functions of army. The. And let's say acts of army go right.

444
01:17:51,640 --> 01:18:04,900
And that means I take Army girl from the capital and I go and I put it in correspondence using a function X with generally a real number.

445
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:25,330
And so we want to consider X is real valued and that will include the categorical variable if you want them also in the same thing.

446
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:31,960
But we would have to number the categories and consider the category number is the value of and the variable.

447
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:39,850
So the reason I want to do that is that I don't want to say that the expectations don't exist for categorical variables, right?

448
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:47,890
So I don't want to know categories with the numeric meaning then I don't know how to take expectations of such random variables.

449
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:52,420
So in this course, the expectation will always exist.

450
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:59,590
Well, not always exist, at least not because of the categorical nature of the variables.

451
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:24,920
Okay. And. I already said that x that when the variables are functions of Iomega and they're also way to address the elements in the Sigma algebra.

452
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:29,900
So I'm taking my probability space, measurable space, right.

453
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:36,500
I don't need probability at this point. So that would be Omega in the F, right.

454
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:45,980
And I can also consider a barrel sigma algebra built on, uh, on the R.

455
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:59,150
Built on open internal. You are right.

456
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:17,290
And R is the range of x. So I have a sigma algebra built on the f on the one hand and I have another one.

457
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:20,560
The barrel that built in the range of x.

458
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:31,810
Um, and what, when the variable is supposed to do is to build the correspondence between subsets of the branch sigma algebra and subsets in the.

459
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:44,080
So X will be the random variable if we can have.

460
01:20:47,060 --> 01:21:03,280
Her correspondence. Between the from the burial and the.

461
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:07,960
From the of.

462
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:24,310
So X will be a connection that supports, uh, subsets elements of B in correspondence with elements of the F and we'll talk more about it next time.
