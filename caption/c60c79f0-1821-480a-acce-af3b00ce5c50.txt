1
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,940
Hey, good morning, folks.

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:17,160
Just really quickly before we get going, I wanted to give an update on Professor Joliette generally concerned right when he didn't show it.

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,909
It's not like him to miss something like that.

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,480
I thought something serious might have been going on. The good news is it wasn't.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:33,540
I was in a zoom meeting with him yesterday morning and he was profusely apologetic and wanted to relay the apologies to the class.

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,130
He did offer to follow up with anybody who has questions about the material, about his perspectives, you know, whatever it might be.

7
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,959
There's already been a student who's had a nice exchange with him, and he promises to be as responsive as possible.

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,120
So please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I can I can connect or you can reach out to him directly.

9
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,530
Okay. We do have our guest lecture here this morning.

10
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:07,260
We're happy to have Professor Meeker back to talk about an area again, really close expertize.

11
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,069
And his experience is that you can give a little bit of an overview of,

12
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:19,860
but also share some of the latest of what's going on around biomarkers and biological monitoring.

13
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,760
And conveniently, it's always these lectures that being around Halloween,

14
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,560
which I think there are some, some nice opportunities to to make some connections with maybe plants.

15
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,540
Anyway, Professor MUGAR, thank you so much. And good morning, everybody.

16
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,940
I didn't know not showing up was an option. Glad to be here.

17
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,660
So if you were here as ever, worked with biomarkers. Is never as ever.

18
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,790
Okay. It's early. Nobody.

19
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:59,790
Has anybody ever taken part in a bio monitoring study? I've worked with bio indicators.

20
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,240
Okay. Anyone else? Has anyone ever had a COVID test?

21
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,950
Sure. All right. So that's that.

22
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:18,330
That could be defined as a biomarker, right? It's an indicator, depending on the type of test, whether you've been infected.

23
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,470
That's one example, not one that I'm going to cover today,

24
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,500
but it's trying to get you thinking about how broad this area can be, depending on how you define it.

25
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:39,330
So the outline for today is going to talk about some definitions and types of uses, advantages and disadvantages.

26
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:46,500
Very important to understand because it is something that we think in any given situation.

27
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,210
All let's let's just do some bio monitoring. Let's cut to the chase.

28
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,700
But as we'll see, that's not always the best way to go. So interpretation issues.

29
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:08,339
And then I'll give some examples of ongoing efforts. And as time allows, with the cover of use of basic case study examples, your learning objectives,

30
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,230
I'm not going to read these to you or for you to consider as we go through today.

31
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,310
All right. So back to our exposure to disease.

32
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:32,459
Continue repricing various examples of this or presentations of this where we have or or exposure could be from a variety of of sources, pathways,

33
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:39,270
etc., leading to an internal dose that may that insurance costs a biologically effective dose,

34
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,350
early biological effect and ultimately clinical disease.

35
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:53,160
So we want to understand that. And if we can understand that, that helps us potentially prevent that disease from occurring.

36
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:02,670
At the bottom here, I think you've seen this. They still see this one earlier in the term, we think about measuring exposure.

37
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:12,900
We have a lot of different methods that we can apply and a lot of times biomarkers find their way at the top of these lists as the,

38
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:19,620
you know, the gold standard. Perhaps the best way to measure exposure above things like, you know,

39
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:25,470
just measuring the air only or location, proximity to a source, things like that.

40
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,180
But then putting this in the context with what you've been learning throughout the semester,

41
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:43,840
we have all of our different approaches to mentioning, you know, all of them are very useful for student applications.

42
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,030
Sometimes it's all you can get access to if we're talking like retrospective or prospective in the future.

43
00:04:51,880 --> 00:05:05,080
But you have to look at security on your own before the familiar try.

44
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,880
Yeah, that's right.

45
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:17,710
I suppose the point right here is what we're talking about today, obviously, which falls under direct methods or exposure assessment.

46
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:28,240
So with that, there is the biomarker world is a very broad universe of things that can be applied and measured.

47
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,470
So we just quickly talk about different types.

48
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,960
So the first one and the focus primarily today is the biomarker of exposure.

49
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:47,740
And I mentioned COVID earlier, but for the most part today I want to focus on chemicals because that's where we it very regularly in this field.

50
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:57,490
So biomarker exposure is chemical metabolite, a product of an interaction between a chemical and some target molecule or so in the human body.

51
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,649
That itself is a fairly broad definition. But again, when we're talking about exposure,

52
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:13,780
we're usually tying it to some sort of agent of concern or biomarker of effect like biochemical physiologic behavioral.

53
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:26,110
So that's that's also making a very broad definition for other alteration, alteration leading to or associated with impairment or disease.

54
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,050
So we'll come back to that in a minute.

55
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:37,330
But also biomarkers, susceptibility indicator of inherent or acquired ability of the organism to respond to the challenge of a chemical.

56
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,110
And then finally putting this together by monitoring.

57
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:52,300
It's just sort of the act of measuring biomarkers maybe as part of a systematic program that we'll get to later or part of a study,

58
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:59,020
things like that, or in response to a pandemic and so on and so forth.

59
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,840
So those are just some basic definitions.

60
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:11,110
So if we overlay those definitions on the exposure to disease continuum, you can see where these biomarkers come in.

61
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,340
It can be very useful in informing those those steps.

62
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:23,080
So at the top here we have a biomarker of exposure so that further toward disease we get biomarker of effect.

63
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:30,400
And then biomarker susceptibility may play a role in anywhere in between any of these steps.

64
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,310
So. Who can name a an example of a biomarker of exposure.

65
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,610
Besides, we've already mentioned we would think of something.

66
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,120
Yeah. Chickpea was a biomarker of pesticide.

67
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,900
Right. In other words, we can control.

68
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,480
Very calm, wise boy. But, you know, that's one that we'll touch on throughout today.

69
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:10,020
But there's there's many out there. What about a biomarker of effect?

70
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:23,960
You mentioned the biomarker affect. Think about any tests they run when you go to the doctor, any special tests they order.

71
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,100
You know, for something like prostate cancer is a common one.

72
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,560
Hormone levels. Good cholesterol.

73
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:40,870
Good cholesterol. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Because it's a it's getting at something that might be related to disease risk.

74
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,090
Right. So that might fall.

75
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,920
You know, it's not quite clinical disease. So it's going on here somewhere.

76
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,250
So, yeah, there's there's a lot of biomarkers, in fact, ranging from, you know, the disease itself,

77
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:00,910
the observation to a little bit further upstream where you have consciously altered structure function.

78
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:05,169
That's what I use in my research a lot. Early effect, I mentioned biomarkers.

79
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:12,010
We look at things like cytokines for inflammation, response, oxidative stress, things like that.

80
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:20,860
Biologically effective dose is a tricky one, so that's always the goal that we want to get at to really have an accurate

81
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,570
measure of exposure of a person to experiences that's very personalized to them.

82
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,640
That gets us as close as we can on the exposure side to that link with disease.

83
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:37,470
But in practice it's very, very difficult to get that. Sometimes we can measure it at the target organ.

84
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:45,999
In the case of some things, they might form a DNA addict, a protein addition product with the chemical itself.

85
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,290
So it's but that's rare that we're able to get that level of detail, biomarker of susceptibility.

86
00:09:53,290 --> 00:10:03,130
Any thoughts on what biomarker susceptibility might be an example like genetic testing?

87
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:16,089
Yeah. Yeah. So genetics, so something like genotype or gene expression, anything that's sort of individual specific and that comes into play.

88
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:23,230
You know, I mentioned DNA and some people are going to be more likely to form those given the same amount of exposure as someone else.

89
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:31,120
So the further down we get, the more and more individualized we might be getting because of those internal factors that are unique to each of us.

90
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:44,020
There's others as well. But, you know, genetics is is a big one. Epigenomics as well as a potential that can vary depending on your perspective.

91
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:53,590
It could be a biomarker effect, could be susceptibility, or even some people are applying it as a marker of exposure as well.

92
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:01,630
So that's our biomarker types with our disease continuum.

93
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,030
So I put this slide together a couple of years ago and I'm not sure I like it, but I'm going to use it anyway.

94
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,250
Just kind of thinking about how we got here with with biomarkers.

95
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,339
So it goes all the way back to like the 1400s.

96
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:23,380
They had something called your Ross copy where people would bring in a urine sample and have one of these doctors back then,

97
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:28,870
you know, kind of look at it like it's consistency, smell it, maybe even taste it.

98
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,790
And they could diagnose things like diabetes and things like that.

99
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:39,490
So that's a very primitive form in my view of biomarkers.

100
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,430
If you zoom out, you know, I guess it's kind of depend on perspective.

101
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,760
But if you think about eco toxicology as a form of biomarker, a canary in the coal mine,

102
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,320
that's a biological response that's indicating exposure that they used to use in mines.

103
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:11,360
Again, a fairly primitive Rachel Carson's book, Silent Spring, details a lot of impacts of persistent pesticides on wildlife.

104
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:18,880
So they were able to measure those chemicals in wildlife and the effects they were having that I consider, you know,

105
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:25,880
a general type of biomarker that led to us becoming more concerned about what could be happening in humans as well.

106
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:35,660
Human to human, direct human measurements of blood that I mentioned that goes back to early 1900s, late 1800s.

107
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,330
They've been looking for that for a long time. Other I think this might be mercury.

108
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,770
High levels of mercury in the workplace back in the 1920s.

109
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:56,090
Those elements, they were able early on to figure out how to quantify those in biological fluids moving forward.

110
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,920
Non occupational type of training of the Olympics.

111
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:09,710
They were so very high tech doping the anti doping testing that they do to prevent the use of steroids and things like that.

112
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:21,830
And now we're applying it to all kinds of bio medical uses and it just keeps expanding what we're able to look at.

113
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,690
So we have, you know, genomics was mentioned metabolomics, proteomics,

114
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,100
these are all things that are measured that represent something that's going on in the body.

115
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:39,980
So it's it's been coming off a huge wealth of data that we're still trying to figure out what it means and how to deal with it.

116
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:48,230
And then to the last exposition. So I think you've probably introduced this term already in the course,

117
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,930
but that's trying to think about what is the totality of exposure throughout the life course.

118
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,930
You know, from it, from every possible source and pathway and biomarker is obviously a huge role in that.

119
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:11,390
So it's just giving a little bit more context to what we're thinking about here when we deal with biomarkers.

120
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:18,890
People like to always make the point or give the caveat that there are some limitations here.

121
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:24,980
So one way to do this is show that how environmental illness works.

122
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,480
So basically you can have you can't have environmental illness without an exposure.

123
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,750
However, because you measure exposure does not necessarily equal harm.

124
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:42,320
So that's something that they're very careful about when they set out to do a bio monitoring study, for example.

125
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,250
Just because it's there doesn't it doesn't necessarily mean it's causing harm.

126
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,830
Although myself, I have a lot of synthetic chemicals in my body that I'm not super happy about.

127
00:14:53,580 --> 00:15:00,030
But, you know, unfortunately, that's part of our our current state of affairs.

128
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:06,200
Pretty much unavoidable for certain things. And.

129
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,799
So again, putting this into context, we have a lot of different sources.

130
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:20,240
We need to think about both manmade and natural, which leads to some sort of potential exposure outside the body.

131
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,130
And what we a lot of times are interested in, what is absorbed by the body was the internal.

132
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,350
So I like this figure. I don't even remember where I got it. But this is from a workplace environment.

133
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:41,120
And on the x axis here, we have a chemical xylene that was measured in there among a group of workers.

134
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:47,600
On the y axis, we have a biomarker for xylene in urine called methyl pure gas.

135
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:55,490
So if this was a good biomarker of xylene exposure, would we expect this graph to look like.

136
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,980
Yeah. A little more agreement, right? Maybe a higher R-squared value there.

137
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:12,580
Meaning it's, you know, X and Y are more highly linearly correlated.

138
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,050
So we're not necessarily seeing that Y.

139
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:26,570
You guys think of some reasons why that might be, why not all these dots fit on that line.

140
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:31,840
How come for this worker, you know, way down here, for this worker, it's way up here.

141
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,570
There's a lot of right answers here.

142
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:43,910
It could also be exposed at home in addition to the work exposed outside of the area that was being mentioned at work.

143
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,700
Yeah. There's the kidney function. Yeah.

144
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:58,780
Something internal, maybe leading to a difference in how for a given amount of air exposure, it's processed and excreted as a.

145
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:07,570
The about route of exposure.

146
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:15,680
There might get I mean that your information but what if they're working with the satellite with their hands on their skin

147
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:23,100
so they have a lot of animal contact that might ruin that correlation between the air concentration and the urinary levels,

148
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:31,740
right. And so on and on. There's a lot of reasons why that that agreement would not be perfect.

149
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,260
So that's something to think about.

150
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:41,850
So this is an example of, you know, an occupational setting is where you have your best chance of detecting a nice correlation because,

151
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:46,680
I mean, typically you have a very direct source because of the higher concentrations.

152
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:55,620
So, you know, if it's typical occupational setting and you get out to non occupational community settings, it can be a lot more complicated.

153
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:02,040
So you have a lot of different potential sources of exposure, different pathways and routes.

154
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,200
That's going to be very difficult to account for and then trying to estimate someone's overall exposure.

155
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:17,340
So that's where biomarkers can really play. A key role is trying to have an aggregate estimate of all these routes and pathways.

156
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,860
You know, an example, we use a lot in our field as well because it's probably the most well-studied chemical out there.

157
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,420
And here's just an old figure showing, you know,

158
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:38,110
a kid playing with a toy in their kitchen and all the different ways in which that might make it to that child through their water,

159
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:46,750
dust, things like that. So you could try to measure each one of those media and try to come up with a model aggregate estimate.

160
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,560
Or you could look at something like whether.

161
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:03,810
So again, we have this absorption accounts for all these routes, but we also need to know what's happening once it gets in the body.

162
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:12,090
We can't just go around collecting a blood sample just without knowing much about how the chemical is metabolized.

163
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,310
We really need to know more about that before you can apply some of these biomarkers.

164
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:23,220
So that's where knowledge about the metabolic transformation comes in, because once it makes sense in the body,

165
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:30,090
it might be stored, who might be eliminated might be some combination of both on different timescales.

166
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:38,610
So this is called the toxicant kinetics, sometimes referred to as pharmacokinetics, more in the pharmacology field.

167
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:49,620
So this is a little bit more detail picture of what might be happening for a given chemical.

168
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:57,810
You have your right of exposure here at the top ingestion of the GI tract in which the lung dermal to the skin.

169
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,750
And this also illustrates that route of exposure can be very important for a lot of things.

170
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:14,820
Different health effects might might occur from the different exposure, different severity of toxicity, because you might be, you know,

171
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,850
if you're exposed dermal and mix it straight to the bloodstream,

172
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:27,150
it might be bypassing very important metabolic processes before making it to certain enzymes that can process the chemical.

173
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:41,220
So, you know, it's complicated, but it gets in the circulation and depending on the chemical properties of its its persistence,

174
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:46,680
things like that, it's going to make its way somewhere. Sometimes it passes straight through.

175
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,390
So we know, again, what we've been able to characterize quite well.

176
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,090
There is a certain percentage, if it's ingested, goes straight through one other, not all of it does.

177
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:06,150
Some does get absorbed through to attract it into the bloodstream and then might make it in the case of lead,

178
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:13,500
a lot of it gets stored in the bone, actually. Cadmium, on the other hand, a lot of that gets stored in the kidney.

179
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:23,390
So and persistent pesticides like DDT that's going to be stored in the fatty tissue.

180
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,520
So the properties of the chemical can dictate where it's going to be, how long it's going to stay there,

181
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:35,520
and when it does get excreted, where it's most likely to be excreted.

182
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:41,280
And in what form is it impact compounds or is it a metabolite of that?

183
00:21:46,940 --> 00:22:00,170
Here's one I've never used before. Tears. I always like to joke that this type of thing can feel terrible to get approval anyway.

184
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,950
So we use we do use urine a lot, a lot, a lot.

185
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,240
And we'll cover some of that here with it. Any questions on that?

186
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:16,910
You guys love these days or start when you get to class when what is daylight savings?

187
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,060
And this weekend, next? The following week. And one more week.

188
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,430
Yeah. All right.

189
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:36,030
So like I said, you can measure chemicals or the metabolites potentially in a lot of different matrices or measure your different terms for this.

190
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,230
On the left is four of the most common, two most common by far, blood and urine.

191
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,230
But we'll discuss hair and nails as well.

192
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:50,700
Different types of studies might be specialized and you might have access to different things or a reason to study different types of things.

193
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,889
So in studies of young children, sometimes we think about what's in the breastmilk.

194
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:05,730
That's their main source of of of food. Sometimes expel their teeth is an interesting one and touch on a little bit.

195
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:11,550
And then in the maternal fetal interface, we interested in a lot of different things.

196
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:19,709
I mentioned some things get stored in adipose some things and there's methods to measure bone as well.

197
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:24,480
So there is really a long list of things to look at.

198
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:33,150
But again, you're going to want to know what it means, how they get their hormones and be able to apply it to what we're talking about.

199
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,850
So just to put on some of the more common ones.

200
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:50,370
So you're the reason we like to use urine because it's easier to collect compared to there is a subset of the population that just is flat out no.

201
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,620
When you say can we take a blood draw, you. Some people just they just don't want to do it.

202
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:03,840
So that excludes of, you know, a proportion of potential population if you're doing epidemiology study that lead to selection bias and okay,

203
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,730
so your insurance will be easier to collect and you can usually collect a lot of it.

204
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:19,260
So some of our analytical methods, you know, it relies on having enough volume to get good detection calls, some disadvantages of urine.

205
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,450
Sometimes we're sometimes we can measure the parent on an ear,

206
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:35,730
maybe with something to make it more hydrophilic, like on either sulfate is attached to it.

207
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,140
Sometimes it is the parent chemical, especially talking about something like elements.

208
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,610
But a lot of times we're stuck with metabolite, so to speak.

209
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:55,080
What was mentioned before this metabolite purifies and provides methyl, which is fine in a lot of cases.

210
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,750
One way in which metabolite is actually a benefit is something like the last phase of phthalates.

211
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:07,290
And if you're trying to measure the parent compounds, you have all kinds of opportunity for contamination of that sample.

212
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,340
So you don't even know where that phthalate is coming from.

213
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,410
But if you're using a metabolite that's not formed in the environment, then,

214
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:20,010
you know, it's at least coming from the body and it's not due to contamination.

215
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:27,090
Another concern with using metabolites, if it's not specific to the chemical of interest,

216
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:32,250
if there's multiple chemicals that get metabolized to the same compound,

217
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:41,400
then you sort of lose that specificity of what is the agent sometimes within a class.

218
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:51,120
So like organophosphate pesticides, there's diagonal uncle phosphate metabolites that represent a group of both of those.

219
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,790
So it narrows it down. But if you want to get more specific, you might need to find a more specific metabolite.

220
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,980
Same with pyrethrum it pesticides.

221
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:09,710
Another challenge with urine is that depending on how much water people take and how active they are, the dilution of that sample is going to vary.

222
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:15,420
So it's very clear urine. It's going to underestimate that concentration.

223
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,350
Whereas if somebody is dehydrated, it's really going to concentrate that chemical.

224
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:29,900
So we try to use methods to account for that. When you when you collect your sample, can have an impact on what you find.

225
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:34,630
So you need to think about that before you go out and collect here.

226
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:44,300
And how you're going to do that first morning is good because you get typically a good several hours of collection, a nice sample.

227
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:48,680
But what we're limited to a lot of times is a spot sample. Just when can we get a sample?

228
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:57,290
And that's where we have to really think about how to account for that pollution. There are people who've really tried to give this 24 hour sample.

229
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,490
That's that would be the ideal Olympic gold standard, because then,

230
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:07,610
you know exactly how much is being secreted by the body over the course of a day, whereas you can't really do that with other.

231
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:13,460
However, as you might expect people to participate in, that is a challenge.

232
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:22,470
How many of you would participate in a study that asks you to carry this around with you all day and every time you say, you know, it's that stuff.

233
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:27,620
And people, they are able to get to do that. You know, maybe they offer them some money.

234
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:34,280
They might not go about their day as they usually would. Right. And I just stay home that day and not be exposed to what they're usually exposed to.

235
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:37,820
So that might throw it off as well. So there's some government challenges with that.

236
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,979
So, you know, if we have if we're stuck with either a first morning or spot,

237
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:49,310
which we usually are, we look at maybe creatine, which is a chemical that's excreted.

238
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:57,380
The muscle metabolism is thought to be constant that you can include with your measurement.

239
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:08,450
Same with specific gravity. There's other methods about, you know, exactly how much body was excreted and what time prior they had, plus the restroom.

240
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:15,110
You might be able to calculate some somethings there. So it's just one of those downsides to urine that we're always kind of struggling with.

241
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:21,650
The other most common type of sample is blood.

242
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:30,860
So again, it is here by the Times, which measure the parent company for well known metabolites and blood.

243
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:36,799
So and it's maybe more relevant to what could be delivered to a target organ of

244
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:43,400
interest because it's in circulation and all those dilution issues I talked about,

245
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:54,740
you don't really have that with with one pregnancy, you get some plasma expansion, but it's nowhere near as big of an issue as some of the challenges.

246
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,370
I mentioned disadvantages here.

247
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:04,040
Like I said, people don't like needles like young children.

248
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,420
You can get very much volume if you can get anything at all. So that's that's a struggle.

249
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:15,980
Another big one is if you're interested in something that's that's non persistent, that gets metabolized rapidly.

250
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,920
That blood sample may not be very representative of of exposure at all.

251
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:26,089
It could be just like a snapshot that it's metabolized rapidly.

252
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:31,040
That variability is going to be quite high. So that can be a challenge as well.

253
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,730
You also need to know what kind of what form and what's happening in what fraction.

254
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:45,290
There's some things that whole blood before blood samples is things like blood and other metals,

255
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:50,900
which kind of measure the whole blood versus plasma serum.

256
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,560
That's where a lot of our chemicals might be measured.

257
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:02,810
We have methods for fats and either one, but they're slightly different because it's a slightly you have the clotting factors still in the plasma.

258
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,270
I have a ton of red blood cells. I don't want to do it in my freezer.

259
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,920
It has idea of what we know because we separate out the sample.

260
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,450
I don't like throwing anything away. You can ask my wife. I never thought I could.

261
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:24,110
So we have these red blood stream blood cells that, you know, some people have use for blood, but then you have a correction factor.

262
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:30,740
So we're sort of you showed there white blood cells.

263
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,010
That's where you can get the DNA sample.

264
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:42,530
Sometimes you need a preservative. You don't know what that preservative is and make sure it's not in order to tell it of interest.

265
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:47,320
Things like that. Lipophilic compounds.

266
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:56,200
So if you're measuring something like DDT, PCBs, PBDEs, the flame retardants fire, those are lipophilic.

267
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,850
So you can kind of like with creatine and urine samples,

268
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:10,690
you want to adjust for that somehow because blood samples with more with the higher levels of.

269
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:15,530
Something a lot of people are working on is driverless bots.

270
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:29,630
So that could have a lot of good applications because the needles used are not to be as invasive once people seem to be easy to collect and store.

271
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:34,820
For for newborns, there's a lot of these that are used to do all kinds of stuff.

272
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:40,640
It's just that it's challenging to be able to accurately measure some of these things on such a small sample.

273
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:49,290
It's something that hasn't been thought maybe, you know, totally appropriate, but that's something people are actually working.

274
00:31:52,390 --> 00:32:01,570
The questions on what? Exhaled.

275
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:07,960
Breath is another one of four certain types of chemicals like CS.

276
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:14,860
This one also is not pretty noninvasive to collect and you can do a lot of repeated samples in short amount of time.

277
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:22,810
So that's a limitation of urine. Obviously you can't producing or anything over a given frequency and blood.

278
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:27,220
People don't like to be poked once, let alone multiple times.

279
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,290
That's good. Some disadvantages we don't know exactly.

280
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:42,880
These methods aren't as commonly used, so it's not as standardized as some of the other media we've talked about.

281
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:47,709
And, you know, what is it representing as far as portions of the lump?

282
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,920
You have this space in the upper airways versus the alveolar.

283
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,540
How do you teach that apart? Is that important for your application?

284
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:00,100
So it's something to think about and then got to methodology.

285
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:05,710
They're not a standardized, so different people do different things. Can you compare those across efforts?

286
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:15,930
It's another question, but it is it is an option. That's when I'll talk about hair and nails.

287
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,060
So I guess it depends on who you ask, whether it's invasive or not.

288
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:31,200
You know, if somebody has a lot of hair to get from the back where you notice that it's gone underneath.

289
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,540
But obviously, some people are going to be less amenable.

290
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:42,780
You take a chunk of their hair, right? Can be very cost effective.

291
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,680
I need really a pair of scissors to put it in.

292
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:57,890
The really cool thing about hair is once you collected the closer to the scalp you are, the more recent the time of exposure.

293
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:03,600
Once you can go out on that hair because different periods of exposure maybe up to two months.

294
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:12,960
So that's the real promise of hair that a lot of us are trying to figure out how to do that in a reliable way over time.

295
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:25,320
Obviously, that's limited. If people don't have long hair on the population, you might be looking at some other challenges external contamination.

296
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:31,860
So hair dyes, hair products, just as you go about your day and there's things settling on your hair.

297
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:36,900
This is another one kind of like with breath. There's not a lot of standardized methods.

298
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,709
There's academic labs out there that will measure it and report it.

299
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:45,960
And then, you know, at the end of it, someone else wants to attempt to make their own method.

300
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:50,160
So it's not as widely done as blood and urine.

301
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,680
Things that are persistent as well.

302
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:08,160
Some sample collection protocol challenges, where to cut, how much length, and there are individual differences in hair structure,

303
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:14,470
things like that that would need to be still figured out to really apply this method broadly.

304
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,450
I mentioned toenails as well.

305
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:29,320
That has some promise, but not chemistry as excited about that one pair because it's more challenging matrix to work with and.

306
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:37,790
No standing on like I asked my daughters for their toenails.

307
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:42,679
It's in the way they paid their toenails right in that paint on the toenails.

308
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,690
Might make the sample not very good anyway. So there's some challenges.

309
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:58,070
So like I said, those are just some of the main ones we're using. There's all kinds of other ones you can think about.

310
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:04,620
This is a small table. I apologize, but I like the summary of different matrices.

311
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:11,080
This is for. This was written as part of the study of children.

312
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:18,340
They do put a all on here, but it talks about how the samples collected, whether they feel it's invasive enough or not,

313
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:24,040
and then what life stages it might be most applicable for or feasible for.

314
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,060
So again, there's a lot of different possibilities there.

315
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:34,910
Trees is another kind of cool one that people are thinking about.

316
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:41,290
So it's easy to collect. Typically, if you can work out a deal with the tooth fairy, right?

317
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:50,540
You get that. And then because the Tea Party leaders that were formed during fetal development and infant development, again,

318
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:56,930
you might be able to measure different layers within that tooth to get a tiny component to your pure exposure measure as well.

319
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,700
So that's a little more involved.

320
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:05,690
People are still working on the methods, but that one is another one where people are researchers are pretty excited about it.

321
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:13,390
Okay. So let's switch gears to why are we using biomarkers?

322
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:20,140
There's some main categories here. So clinically, you might use biomarkers.

323
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:27,970
Research, that's where I live, these biomarkers all the time for research, public health.

324
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:33,670
You can think about my early example of common sense and then policy.

325
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,950
You know, biometric approaches that can be either descriptive or risk based.

326
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:51,690
Descriptive is more about that early indicator of who's exposed, what kind of exposure levels are we are we seeing in a population?

327
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:59,190
And is that going to be a concern that the more risk based you might build it to look at it as causes that

328
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:05,660
line up with the dose response curve and use it in an epidemiologist to look at associations with the health.

329
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:10,200
Okay. So there's a lot of different applications here.

330
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,040
This is just a little bit more detail along those same lines.

331
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:23,270
Scoping and screening stats and trends is one that's really been useful in recent years.

332
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,300
I'll mention the study in a little bit.

333
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:35,370
It has, over a course of a couple of decades, will measure biomarkers in a subset of the population, and you can see if things are going up or down.

334
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,680
We're talking about chemicals that can be related to policy and can be related to

335
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:45,680
just trends in its manufacturing and use trends and what people's activities are.

336
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:50,030
So that's a useful application.

337
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:57,400
I mentioned exposure and health research epidemiologist. A big one also mentioned pharmacokinetics.

338
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,340
So you need to know how the chemicals metabolize.

339
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:10,390
And then finally, risk assessment. So some overall advantages of biomarkers.

340
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:18,100
I've touched on some of these, but, you know, it confirms absorption in the body and it does that better than our other approaches.

341
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:22,330
It is a quantitative with quantitative way to verify that.

342
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:32,350
And it's it's great overall in pathways that things are getting very good or we have very low limits on detection.

343
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:36,430
So sensitivity is getting better all the time with our equipment.

344
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:45,300
It's very useful when you use other methods of exposure assessment that might not be as invasive or expensive.

345
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:50,340
So you have air monitoring, exposure modeling.

346
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:56,310
If you couple that with a biomarker to validate what you predicted based on your other methods.

347
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:06,830
That can be very powerful. I mentioned exposure trends, very useful application and also examples of health interventions.

348
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:14,330
It can be a very powerful tool for that as well. On the limitations side, it's great for internal dose,

349
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:20,210
but if that's all you have is that number of say what blood or whatever it might be, you don't know it.

350
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:25,990
So you really want some additional information to be able to know about sources, routes.

351
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:35,600
A lot of times, you know, with with bio monitoring becoming more popular for a lot of things.

352
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:43,520
We don't know what that means, what the number means. So that becomes an issue when you talk about communicating with communities and participants.

353
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:48,750
You have to make sure your laboratory methods are good contamination.

354
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:52,910
Other things are always a concern. Reference levels might be lacking.

355
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,560
It's sort of along the lines of the toxic dose concern.

356
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:03,420
And again, a lot of these we just don't know enough about maybe don't know enough about the toxicity, kinetics, things like that.

357
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:17,240
So there are limitations. So what we ideally have is biomarkers and other approaches that get at that entire disease continuum.

358
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:26,450
So you have, you know, measures of air pollution, air exposure or air concentrations, measures of dust concentrations, water.

359
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:33,440
You have a biomarker of internal dose, a biomarker of biologically effective dose, and so on and so forth.

360
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:41,090
So you can really define that pathway and that would allow you to not only make better associations with the disease,

361
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,350
but also to go back and look at how do we prevent exposure.

362
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:55,180
We know how people are being mostly exposed. This is really tragic.

363
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:59,050
This is more just. And that's why I said this.

364
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,709
The National Academies put on by a monitoring.

365
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:07,870
I just thought it was a nice flow chart of if you were to do a biomarker monitoring study,

366
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:15,549
this sort of stuff, you have a hypothesis, population selection, select your your biomarkers.

367
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,200
So that's a big piece in and of itself.

368
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:28,779
You have to look at cost sensitivity, some of the quality assurance types of things and how do you enroll participants and consent them.

369
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,320
That's a big deal. Sample collection processing.

370
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,160
You might store it for a while and then analyze it in the lab.

371
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,900
Then you have your data, how you're going to analyze that data, and then what do you do with those results?

372
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:49,000
So this is just kind of a nice reference to think about how that all works, but we don't really have time today to go into each of these.

373
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:57,870
Details. So a bit more on methodological issues.

374
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:05,880
So an analytical technique that might be helpful is to measure a specific biomarker you want to you don't want to look at if that matches your needs.

375
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:15,450
As far as I mentioned, sensitivity price, things like that want to prevent contamination.

376
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:22,740
I mentioned Ali's great thing about Hollywood tabloids is they're not you know, we've had labs, flame retardants.

377
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:27,180
I measure PBDEs where it's in the dust.

378
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:34,140
And unless you're in a cleaner environment, you're going to have some contamination of those samples by the PCBs.

379
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,510
That's just a fact of life.

380
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:47,280
We're working with the CDC lab and NSF International, looking at personal care, product samples of parabens and things like that.

381
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:56,899
And they had to institute a rule where the lab technicians weren't allowed to wear things like deodorant because it was throwing off some of the,

382
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:09,460
you know, some of the results. You know, some of this is pretty intuitive, but you need to know why you're studying interest in the chemical.

383
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:16,350
And picking the right methods. And then knowing as much as you can about it before the poor.

384
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:24,300
So as I mentioned, the technology is getting so good.

385
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:29,700
You see, you know, parts per trillion, parts per quadrillion.

386
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:39,150
Just to give you a sense of how broad and how wide of the difference in scale, we're talking about for different types of biomarkers.

387
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:44,940
So here's just some context, a different some common classes of things that might be measured.

388
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:51,719
So pages, combustion byproducts that we're interested in that might be measured in grams per

389
00:44:51,720 --> 00:45:00,209
liter and urine contains a cigaret smoke metabolite and the organophosphates.

390
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:04,230
We've mentioned that you see they have different types of units.

391
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:11,070
Well, the this one's always just kind of annoying in a way, I would say,

392
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:16,980
because we'll measure a bunch of metals in a panel and it'll come back as like micrograms per liter.

393
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:23,250
But then for lead, because somebody at some point in history decided it has to be in micrograms per deciliter,

394
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:26,940
we have to account for that and change it up.

395
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:34,709
But this is just to give you a sense of, you know, here we have nanograms per gram, pico grams per gram.

396
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:38,280
So that gives you a sense of scale, how much is is present.

397
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:43,170
And that's going to relate also to toxicity or potency.

398
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:50,160
Just because one is in Pico grams doesn't mean it's less of a concern than something that's in micrograms because as we know,

399
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,360
dioxin is it's certain forms of dioxin are highly potent or toxic.

400
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:06,370
I mentioned sensitivity. You just want to make sure that nothing you choose lines up with what you're expecting to report.

401
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:12,940
So in the workplace, as we talk about in this class, you're expecting higher levels of a chemical if they're working.

402
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,000
So that might allow you to use maybe a less expensive method.

403
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:19,940
But you try to apply that method in a community setting.

404
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:27,650
Nothing worse than doing this, having a really great sample collection effort, getting the consents,

405
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:35,050
getting the protocol down, sending the sample still out, getting your results back in there, all not detected.

406
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:40,489
That's just really I mean, it's great for public health potentially if your it was good enough.

407
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:49,670
But as far as being able to make use of the data, that means there was probably something didn't feel right when you're designing your effort.

408
00:46:55,370 --> 00:47:04,470
Half-Life is another really important concept here. So a lot of chemicals we talk about are processed very rapidly, metabolize rapidly.

409
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:11,180
Certain types of pesticides are metabolized rapidly.

410
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:18,650
So, you know, this is what that profile might look like in your given biomarker.

411
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:24,530
At any point in time, it's going to represent something. So that first one is.

412
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:32,819
This is your. So this is a hypothetical exposure. Say this for this purpose.

413
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:38,640
Let's say it's just there is only. Ventilation is the only route of interest.

414
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:45,870
So this is the actual exposure. This one here, it has a half life of one day.

415
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:56,960
So this is out to 400 days, little over a year. If you mention metrics, this exposure over the course of a year in a biomarker with half life,

416
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:00,900
one day it's going to temper that variability a little bit.

417
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:07,950
If that half life is one month, you see it gets a little bit more temperate, not quite as variable.

418
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:12,330
And then for one year, you see some accumulation starting to happen.

419
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:20,189
So that's going to, you know, if you put the sample as part of your effort and you get a result that you need to know

420
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:24,930
about the half pathway because you don't know if you're up against something like this,

421
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:26,660
like this or like this.

422
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:33,060
And that can make a huge difference in how you can apply and make conclusions about what you're measuring and what you're associating it with.

423
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:46,780
That doesn't makes sense. All right. And this takes me back to, you know,

424
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:54,969
why sometimes we don't like that biomarker is where a non persistent chemical might be out of the

425
00:48:54,970 --> 00:49:01,210
blood so fast from a single exposure episode that you don't know where on the slope you're falling.

426
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:06,040
When you collect the sample, you want it to be a little bit more tempered, at least one.

427
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:09,100
My purpose is epidemiology something like this.

428
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:13,600
In epidemiology as a minor, you have no idea what it means to be useless.

429
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:17,770
So you want something that's going to be a little bit more tempered to be able to relate to your outcome.

430
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:24,970
This is possible to see on a wider video, but that's a urine.

431
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:33,790
So that gives us a little bit more stability in our measurement typically, and it's going to vary depending on the country.

432
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:43,450
But there's some work trying to look at different types of adults as well that might help extend that or increase that reliability over time.

433
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:50,790
Enough marker. So.

434
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,550
Back to this communication. So when we measure these, we get our results.

435
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:03,880
They're not all zero. So next is who gets the results and why?

436
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:13,180
If you just give that number back to somebody, most often they're not going be able to make use of it at all.

437
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:17,110
This part is going to alarm them and they're not going to do it.

438
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:25,000
So you want to put it in the context of of everything you have information on and to make sure it's reasonable.

439
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:33,730
This becomes an issue, unrealistic expectations about what will be done with results.

440
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:38,979
I have a study of pregnant women where we actually report back,

441
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:45,040
but because of the lag time between when we collect the sample, are able to analyze it and make sense of the data.

442
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:52,810
They're not pregnant anymore. So it's it's tough to report back and say you were highly exposed crazy.

443
00:50:54,910 --> 00:51:03,450
Here's what you could do in order to reduce your exposure. And we talked about why they're not always transformed.

444
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:10,270
These next few slides are just giving some context for various common biomarkers

445
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:14,740
and how that information might be used more like in a community or clinical sense.

446
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,960
They're always useful in exposure, science and epidemiology research.

447
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:26,170
But when you talk about broader uses, this is where it gets a little more gray as far as how far do you go?

448
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:35,740
So blood red is the best one out. There's very specific guidelines on how much lead is considered acceptable and what is of concern.

449
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,260
But for a lot of these other ones, we just don't know.

450
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:46,570
So we're we're stuck kind of sitting here and tend to be maybe higher than a lot of people in your exposure.

451
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,490
We think this is how people are primarily exposed and that's kind of wishy washy.

452
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:58,750
So not super helpful all the time. This is just more clinically focused slide.

453
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:06,850
I will read these two. Along those same lines we have led, which we know a lot about and the other ones we're just not quite sure what to do with.

454
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:11,870
So what we're stuck with is usually just reporting back.

455
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:21,650
How does their results fit within the distribution of other people in that same study or other people in the general population?

456
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:27,980
Things like that. And if they're, you know, if they're low on that distribution, they can feel somewhat comforted usually.

457
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:32,030
But they're not they're not sticking know.

458
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,840
But if they come back as one of the highest, then you really want to look into what are they doing at work and at home?

459
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:46,640
What are their activities like? How might that be happening that they have higher levels than almost everyone else.

460
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:54,260
So in that sense, it can be. Here's an example of a report back.

461
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:57,980
I think this is a California study looking at flame retardants.

462
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:07,970
This is the current best practices for an A research setting that we do when we talk about reporting back our results to participants.

463
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:15,409
We give them, you know, understandable information about what the chemical is, where they're found,

464
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:24,660
how they're exposed, and how their level compares with other people in the study or near there.

465
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:33,139
And again, if it's there in with the low end of the distribution, it's good.

466
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:36,620
And if they're high, then we tend to think about why that is.

467
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:48,140
We do a similar thing in the study in Puerto Rico. So it's the English version of a phone app that we have where we talk to people about what it is,

468
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:56,180
where we think people might be exposed, and then we compare their levels with the rest of the people in the study.

469
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:00,200
We see them at three times during pregnancy. So that's what these are.

470
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:05,989
So if they have, you know, if their number one is way up here, they might think about early pregnancy.

471
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:10,940
What are they doing differently that may have led to more exposure and help for the future?

472
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:13,639
So again, it's not perfect.

473
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:24,020
It's not really a clinical tool, but it might be useful for people to think about some of their product use behavior and decision.

474
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,790
You again to biomarkers. We have to think about ethical issues as well.

475
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:36,200
So you need people's consent to do this, obviously.

476
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:42,710
But you need to explain what what you're doing and why be able to get that consent.

477
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:49,070
Genetic material materials gets gets complicated.

478
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:55,850
A lot of people don't want that to be stored and used at a future time without knowing exactly what that future use might be.

479
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:02,930
And, you know, the different communities of interest,

480
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:10,910
marginalized communities have to be very careful that you're not just using them as guinea pigs and things like that.

481
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:16,880
So it's very important that this is all well thought out in partnership with the

482
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:24,650
community of interest and with known goals in mind and actions taken when you do that.

483
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,320
All right. So some bio monitoring efforts.

484
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:43,770
So various countries have have large scale bio monitoring efforts that I want to highlight here in the U.S., the main one.

485
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:49,890
These are some historical ones. The main one that I suppose is plans like you guys have been introduced here.

486
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,330
Okay. So that's enhancement.

487
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:58,260
In Europe, they have a lot of different efforts as well.

488
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:05,490
Canada also and Asia has instituted some at this point as well.

489
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:12,910
So and AIDS began in the 1970s, starting in the 1990s.

490
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:22,890
I believe they would take a subset of that about 2000 or so participants every two years cycle and do some bio monitoring for various things.

491
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:27,390
It started with just like LED, but it's since progressed to, you know,

492
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:34,810
several hundred chemicals now that they measure in various years and they separate by various demographics.

493
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,710
And the cool thing is you can actually download and use this data,

494
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:44,440
and we've used it to look at associations with other things measured in it and other datasets.

495
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:53,290
So that's that's been pretty interesting. So here's a table looking at the emission of carbon.

496
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:56,770
So this is methyl paraben. I don't know if you guys know much about parabens.

497
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:05,050
I'm just going to give you a minute to look at this, if you can see it well enough and ask if you have any general observations.

498
00:57:07,210 --> 00:58:02,210
I apologize if the text is too small. All right.

499
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:09,649
So this is showing us is we have vertically here the different ways they can break up the data.

500
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:14,389
And there are general tables that I mentioned across horizontally.

501
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:22,760
We have different points in the distribution for that exposure and the yellow bar is the geometric mean.

502
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:29,390
So a good estimate of central tendency for log normal data, which exposure data tends to be.

503
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:33,590
So do we see any differences of interest here?

504
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:39,140
Yeah, there seems to be a pretty significant difference between males and females,

505
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:44,040
but then also between black people, white people and Mexican Americans.

506
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:48,680
So this is one of those that really just just stands out when you look at it.

507
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:54,500
So females about three times higher central tendency than the males.

508
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:02,590
Why do you think that is? And be like preservatives and cosmetics.

509
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:06,820
Yeah. So parabens are used quite a lot in cosmetics. They have other applications as well.

510
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:14,379
But you know, just if you had to guess again, biomarker, you don't know where the source is unless you have additional information.

511
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:18,670
But just thinking about those trends, yeah, that might be within cosmetics.

512
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:24,940
Similarly, you have very stark differences by ethnicity.

513
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:30,580
Again, we don't know. That's the major limitation of the biomarker.

514
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:34,150
This at least gives us a starting point to look at why is that happening?

515
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:43,060
Are certain groups using different types of products, more products that should be addressed with education and other interventions?

516
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:50,140
So ultimately, policy, that's a lot of times in our field, the ultimate goal is to inform,

517
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:55,480
get enough of this out to inform policy, because that's going to be the most effective way to reduce exposure.

518
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:00,940
You don't want to be relying on individuals to make decisions to reconsider exposure all the time.

519
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:05,470
Sometimes it has to be, you know what, maybe we don't need as much of that chemical.

520
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:14,420
So that's just. There's also the sample size for non-Hispanic whites is much larger than.

521
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:23,460
Yeah. Yeah. So that's there's a lot behind the sampling strategy, for instance.

522
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:33,240
And they tried to relate that and their results this be weighted by some of those stratification efforts that they have by these subgroups.

523
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:41,360
So they try to get you know, they sample very carefully trying to get enough sample size with each of these subgroups.

524
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:50,370
But it's not always. Then they're very careful in how they present it.

525
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:58,109
So going back to the beginning of the lecture today, you know, talking about just because you're exposed that there's an adverse health effects.

526
01:00:58,110 --> 01:00:59,639
So they are very careful in the wording.

527
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:09,500
So I thought it was interesting to show that because they're saying just because you have that person in your urine does not mean its health effects.

528
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:14,070
People are still trying to figure it out. So that's something they're careful about.

529
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:19,950
This one's even smaller text. This is brand new. They just redid their website.

530
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:29,399
So I don't care. They actually have an interactive table that you can go to and pick out which chemicals are specifically interested,

531
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,400
and it'll produce that distribution table for you.

532
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:40,380
Okay, but this is just all the different classes of chemicals or different chemical panels that they measure in certain years.

533
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:51,630
So that's tobacco, chemicals, disinfection byproducts, flame retardants, various types of pesticides throughout here PBDEs,

534
01:01:52,170 --> 01:02:00,130
PCBs, dioxins, metals, phthalates, phytoestrogens, agents, viruses and so forth.

535
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:04,350
So again, they keep adding. Sometimes they take away.

536
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:08,940
So there's panels that they've measured that comes back and it's all non detect.

537
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:12,120
So then they don't, they don't do that one again because these are very expensive.

538
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:17,250
So that's why you see different years to have different panels.

539
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:29,730
But again, it can be very interesting to look at. You know, you guys have seen like the PBS trends 1999, very high, especially for PFOA,

540
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:37,710
and it goes down because that's when the alarm was sounded here we can detect this and everyone's what it we should do something about it.

541
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:48,160
So it was time trends can be very. So that's environmental.

542
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:55,720
Well, Mark, just a quick note on occupational applications of biomarkers within the age threshold,

543
01:02:55,720 --> 01:03:00,220
limit values that they do in addition to airborne levels.

544
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:04,120
There are guidelines, health based guidelines, not legally enforceable.

545
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,110
For some chemicals, they also have biological exposure indices.

546
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:12,010
So not for as many chemicals. We only have it for about 50.

547
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:19,140
But this is for instances where skin absorption is a concern.

548
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:28,810
Other relative exposure besides air. And if there's a good biomarker to assess that or you have things like personal protective equipment,

549
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:37,960
you want to make sure it's effective in a highly hazardous situation, using a biomarker can be effective as well.

550
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:49,720
Non occupational exposures and before and after types of of comparisons before and after a ventilation system was installed for example.

551
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,180
So you have a lot of uses.

552
01:03:53,020 --> 01:04:03,550
And in that book though, the sample list of the chemical concern that correlates to one that has a time weighted average error level.

553
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,330
And then for that, I'll tell you what you're measuring and what matrix.

554
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:17,680
So phenol, it's been all urine agencies, different metabolites in urine, silver and blood, tetrachloride, ethylene and blood.

555
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:23,980
So to tell you that the chemical in the matrix, then I'll tell you when to sample.

556
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:29,110
So a lot of them will say end of shift. Some said some say it doesn't matter.

557
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,580
And that's for very highly persistent chemicals.

558
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:39,580
It'll say they'll just say discretionary, some say beginning of week, end of week, things like that.

559
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:43,210
They'll tell you what the level is that you want to watch out for.

560
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,680
Then they'll have some notations on how to interpret it.

561
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:57,040
So background is just background and also common not want to find this and Q and thus means that material is not specific to that chemical.

562
01:04:57,550 --> 01:05:11,130
Something to be careful. It's just a table explaining some of those sampling times that it tells you and it gives guidelines on how to do that.

563
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:20,190
So when you compare something like Deadheads to something like the ACG API,

564
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:26,730
just another illustration of how occupational exposures vary from community or environmental.

565
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:34,319
So this is an older table, but I thought it was kind of neat because you don't see that crossover between

566
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:38,820
the two and further into becomes important also when you talk about toxicology,

567
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:42,670
knowing how much to dose in your studies.

568
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:52,020
So you have cadmium here. The BPI is five micrograms per gram and that's only about 5% of the enhanced median value.

569
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,040
But if you look at the NHANES 95th percentile, you're about 20%.

570
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:00,030
So that means the general population proportionately to the general population,

571
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:07,620
is getting a fairly high amount of cadmium exposure compared to what we know is harmful in occupational setting.

572
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:18,330
And when you think about, you know, a 24 hour duration versus an eight hour work shoot, that's something that should be investigated for cadmium,

573
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:25,260
but it's somewhat similar and with mercury and a couple of pesticides there on the bottom.

574
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:30,270
So interesting to think about that comparison.

575
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:35,080
So you see this. Two at the bottom.

576
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:44,470
Occupational exposures are so way, way, way higher than what's detected in the general population, which, you know, I know which is good or bad.

577
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:50,620
Right. So always good to be able to put things into a broader context like this.

578
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:56,570
Were just a bit of time, let them breeze through a couple of case studies.

579
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:59,990
So here's one that you see all the time in public health for good reason.

580
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:06,380
Led right on took a little time but they showed time.

581
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:11,080
Trends of what? When they took that out of gasoline.

582
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:15,180
You see this very steep decline in population levels one.

583
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:22,020
So that you know, this is good of any type of data.

584
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:28,230
Even better type of data is show a decrease in actual disease correlated with the policy.

585
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:34,260
But you can show a biomarker change with policy extremely effective way of communicating that.

586
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:40,180
Another example is smoking.

587
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:46,750
So you guys are too young to remember the time when I walk into Applebee's and it's just like wildfire smoke everywhere, right?

588
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:52,930
I can remember the airplanes when I was in Iraq, but used to be everywhere.

589
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:57,940
So then they started making more and more rules about where people got smoke,

590
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:04,420
a lot more educational efforts to get people to quit smoking and if not quit smoking, quit smoking around their families and friends.

591
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:17,170
So a lot of data like this, the past you're showing, you know, these policies before and after is a mentality of nicotine.

592
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:24,400
And you can show that as very again, very powerful way to look at the effectiveness of policy measures.

593
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:38,920
So DDT was highlighted in the Silent Spring book.

594
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:44,630
So they banned it in most countries in the seventies.

595
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:48,590
And these are breast milk samples and other time trends showing after that ban.

596
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:59,180
Very persistent chemical. It took a while, but you can see that that really did lead to much lower biomarker levels of DDT over.

597
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:02,600
Similarly, if you look at PBDEs, the flame retardants,

598
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:11,290
they started to be used about that same time and you see the same curve going upward in breast milk as well.

599
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:19,100
So these type trends are useful for showing effectiveness of policy, but also it can sound the alarm on, oh,

600
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:25,100
maybe we should not keep adding more and more of these chemicals to the products because

601
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:29,210
they are also persistent and we don't know what they might be doing toxicological.

602
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:36,620
And then there's a lot of other applications as well.

603
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:45,020
Here's one using a carboxyl hemoglobin measure, as well as one hydroxy iron,

604
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:51,950
which is a metabolite a page to look at before and after types of cooking stoves in Mexico.

605
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:58,250
They didn't show much better measures of those biomarkers after this intervention,

606
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:04,760
but that's not necessarily a policy intervention or an educational or clinical intervention.

607
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:11,930
But you can use biomarkers to look for on the research side.

608
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,890
Here's an example with computer fats, which we've mentioned a few times today.

609
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:21,650
TCP, why not in the urine?

610
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:31,250
You can measure it and then you can associate that with various health effects, such as your boss's adverse neurodevelopment in children.

611
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:38,990
So this is just one that looked at sort of biomarkers and birth outcomes, but there's been subsequent studies to look at.

612
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:50,600
Neurodevelopmental measures. This one, they actually measured in blood. But there's subsequent studies that measured the metabolite in urine as well.

613
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:56,720
Another interesting thing about phosphate pesticides, we think about biomarkers of susceptibility.

614
01:10:57,260 --> 01:11:05,360
There's something called Coeur oxidase. That's an enzyme that people vary in the expression of this, people with high levels of paradox.

615
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:13,579
These are real variables for people to detoxify the or b phosphate sites compared to people with lower expression of that.

616
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:17,570
So that's another interesting biomarker of susceptibility to.

617
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,700
Here's an interesting conundrum.

618
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:32,380
So if groups like the Environmental Working Group still do these sort of anecdotal studies, here's an older one where they went out,

619
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:40,270
tested a bunch of just a handful of babies and found, of course, hundreds of chemicals in Post-it notes.

620
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:44,230
Right. So that sounds the alarm. So that's good and bad, right?

621
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,270
It's good in that it raises awareness,

622
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:56,560
but can be bad if it alarms people to the point of not dealing with other risk factors or maybe not prioritizing those risks appropriately.

623
01:11:56,650 --> 01:12:07,660
But an interesting way to go about it, very useful technique is to have the whole set of approaches to do this.

624
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:14,990
So it's an interesting way to think about. All right.

625
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:23,330
So hopefully, as I have conveyed to you, understanding exposure is key to the learning.

626
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:27,770
So biomarkers can play a huge role in that, if done appropriately.

627
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:37,790
And if you can couple that with environmental monitoring can be very powerful from an exposure source and prevention view represents internal dose.

628
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:44,750
But you also got to be careful of the utility of a specific biomarker for your particular application.

629
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:49,850
So thank you all. Let me know if you have any questions.

630
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:56,970
So much of. You don't have any questions.

631
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,290
It's not dark anymore. That's right. Hey, look, the sun came up in the meantime.

632
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:20,180
All right. Have a great rest of your day, folks. And thank you for your ideas and.
