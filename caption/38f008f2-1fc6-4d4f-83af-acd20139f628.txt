1
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,240
Hey. This is Matthew Zawistowski.

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,080
In this lecture, we'll
return to the MPLS dataset,

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,300
this time with an ion using

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,000
a mixed effect regression
model to formally

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,400
test for a difference
in reading test scores

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,355
between advantaged and
disadvantaged students.

7
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:28,890
We'll also compare those
results to those from

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,290
a standard linear
regression model to

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,509
understand how
ignoring correlation

10
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,770
can impact our results.

11
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,675
As a reminder, in
previous lectures,

12
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:41,300
we have already fit
a random intercept

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,615
mixed defect regression
model to the MPLS data.

14
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:46,740
Recall that this
model accounted for

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,415
the within subject
correlation of test scores,

16
00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:52,130
assuming a common slope
among all students,

17
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,930
and provided strong evidence for

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,660
an increase in reading
test scores over time.

19
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,910
In this lecture, we'll build on

20
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,655
this model to examine
group effects.

21
00:01:01,655 --> 00:01:04,760
The primary group difference
we have examined in

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,280
the MPLS data is
reading test scores

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,225
between advantaged and
disadvantaged students.

24
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:12,020
Visually, it appears that

25
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,359
the test scores for
advantaged students

26
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:16,280
appeared to be higher as a whole

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,500
than the scores of
disadvantaged students,

28
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,090
but we have not yet formally

29
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,795
tested this using a
statistical model.

30
00:01:22,795 --> 00:01:26,210
We'll fit both the standard
linear regression model and

31
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,340
a mixed effect
regression model to

32
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,564
test for group effects
and compare the results.

33
00:01:31,564 --> 00:01:34,040
Let's first ignore
the correlation

34
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,350
and pretend that test
scores are all independent,

35
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,515
like from a
cross-sectional study.

36
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,520
We would test for a
difference in mean

37
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,340
test scores accounting
for grade level by

38
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,770
the inclusion of a
regression parameter for

39
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,660
the binary variable indicating

40
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,540
whether a student has a
disadvantaged background.

41
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,200
This is the model and
corresponding R code for

42
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,210
a standard linear regression with

43
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,220
parameters for both grade
and being disadvantaged.

44
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,500
The Beta_2 term is interpreted
as the difference in

45
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,935
intercept between a disadvantaged
and advantaged student.

46
00:02:06,935 --> 00:02:09,575
It's the term we would
use for inference

47
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:10,970
regarding the group effect of

48
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,490
student background
on test scores.

49
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,740
Here's the output when we fit

50
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,990
this model to the MPLS data.

51
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,850
We see that the fitted value for

52
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,595
Beta_2 is approximately
negative 19,

53
00:02:22,595 --> 00:02:24,770
indicating a mean
test score that is

54
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,129
19 points lower among
disadvantaged students.

55
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:30,590
There is very strong
evidence to reject

56
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,780
the null hypothesis
of no difference

57
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,370
between the groups based on

58
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,030
a p-value of approximately
2e to the minus six.

59
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,640
This analysis is of course flawed

60
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,685
because we know that the test
scores are not independent.

61
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:45,335
What's not clear though,

62
00:02:45,335 --> 00:02:48,280
is how exactly are
inferences flawed?

63
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,575
To determine how the
independence violation

64
00:02:51,575 --> 00:02:53,105
affects inference,

65
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:55,490
we'll properly analyze
these data with

66
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,540
a mixed effect model and
compare the results.

67
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,760
Just as we added the regression
parameter to indicate

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,210
disadvantaged students to the
standard regression model,

69
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,680
we can similarly add

70
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,940
the same parameter to

71
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,415
the random intercept
mixed effect model.

72
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:12,830
Note that this group
effect term is

73
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,675
a fixed effect parameter

74
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:16,955
and its interpretation
is the same.

75
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:19,940
It's the difference in
mean reading score between

76
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,040
a disadvantage and
advantage student

77
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,025
at a fixed grade level.

78
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:27,500
The random intercept terms
are what differentiate

79
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,390
the mixed effect regression model

80
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,310
from the standard
regression model,

81
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,690
and account for the correlation

82
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,580
between student test scores.

83
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,130
Remember that we
typically do not estimate

84
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,560
the individual random
intercept terms,

85
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,980
just the variance or standard
deviation of these terms.

86
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,640
That estimate is needed
to perform inference.

87
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,435
Here is the R command to
fit the random intercept

88
00:03:50,435 --> 00:03:51,710
mixed model with

89
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,770
group effect parameter for
disadvantaged students.

90
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,620
This model is fit by
simply adding the risk to

91
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,075
binary variable to the list
of fixed effect terms.

92
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:04,415
Here's the corresponding
output for the fitted model.

93
00:04:04,415 --> 00:04:06,890
Note that Beta_2,
the difference in

94
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,000
mean test score among

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,330
disadvantaged students
is again negative,

96
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,315
negative 20.37 to be precise,

97
00:04:13,315 --> 00:04:15,620
and very similar
to the estimate of

98
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,225
that same parameter from the
standard regression model.

99
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,470
We can also see estimates for

100
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,810
the random components
of the mixed model.

101
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,020
Note that the variation
between students is much

102
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,250
larger than the variation

103
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,635
of measurements within students.

104
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:32,930
Now let's compare inference for

105
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,229
the risk parameter
between these two models.

106
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:38,510
We'll grab the summary table of

107
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,760
corresponding fixed
effect parameters

108
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,760
from each model for
closer inspection.

109
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,070
Remember that the Elmer function

110
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,930
does not produce a p-value for

111
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,790
the mixed model wall test

112
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,225
because its behavior
is not clear.

113
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,040
We can still compared
the t-statistics to get

114
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,555
a rough idea as to how

115
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:59,314
inference differs
between the models.

116
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:02,720
First, note that the
actual parameter estimates

117
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,970
are quite similar
between the two methods,

118
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,445
something we've previously seen.

119
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:09,710
But the standard errors of

120
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,645
those estimates are
quite different.

121
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,920
Again, this is due to

122
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,785
the partitioning of variation
in the mixed model.

123
00:05:15,785 --> 00:05:18,800
Specifically, we see
that the standard error

124
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,890
for the grade parameter gets
smaller for the mixed model,

125
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,395
similar to what we observe prior.

126
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:27,080
However, the standard
error for the risk group

127
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,545
parameter actually gets
larger in the mixed model.

128
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:33,170
As a result, the magnitude of

129
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,185
the t-statistic increases
for the great effect,

130
00:05:36,185 --> 00:05:38,450
but decreases for
the risk effect in

131
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,260
the mixed model.
What does this mean?

132
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,030
It means that when the
correlation in the data is

133
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,555
properly modeled using a mixed
effect regression model,

134
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,820
the statistical evidence
for a difference

135
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,249
in scores by grade
is more significant,

136
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:54,710
but the evidence for a
difference in being from

137
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,910
a disadvantaged background
is less significant.

138
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,350
That's not to say that
there's no evidence

139
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,540
for a difference between
the risk groups.

140
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,705
A t-statistic of negative
three is still extreme,

141
00:06:05,705 --> 00:06:07,370
but it's not as extreme as

142
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,875
under the standard
regression model.

143
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:13,100
The reasoning for the
change in inference can

144
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,775
actually be seen through a
visualization of the data.

145
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:19,340
On the left, we are visualizing

146
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,415
the MPLS data, ignoring
the correlation.

147
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,575
That is, incorrectly assuming

148
00:06:24,575 --> 00:06:26,680
each test score is independent.

149
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,850
On the right, our spaghetti plot

150
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,830
shows the more accurate
way to visualize

151
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,020
this data with connecting lines

152
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,070
indicating repeated measures
on the same samples.

153
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,685
We need to think about how

154
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:39,590
each regression technique views

155
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,765
individual outcome measurements.

156
00:06:41,765 --> 00:06:46,165
For example, take a look at
the eight circle test scores.

157
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:49,325
The linear regression model
thinks that these are all

158
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,215
independent scores coming from

159
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:53,825
eight different
disadvantaged students.

160
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:56,030
If we consider each score as

161
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,115
an independent piece
of information,

162
00:06:58,115 --> 00:07:00,380
it certainly does
seem like a lot of

163
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,500
disadvantaged students have
much lower test scores,

164
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,120
but this is not the correct way

165
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,070
to think about these data.

166
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,110
The more accurate way to

167
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,985
interpret these eight test scores

168
00:07:10,985 --> 00:07:12,650
is to realize that they actually

169
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,405
come from only two students,

170
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:16,340
not eight different students,

171
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,960
and those two students
tend to have lower scores.

172
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,680
In terms of evidence of

173
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,959
a difference in scores
between the groups,

174
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,840
the mixed model correctly
accounts for the fact that

175
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,805
those eight lower test scores

176
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:31,909
really only represent two
independent students.

177
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,590
This makes a big difference in

178
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,165
how we interpret these data.

179
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:38,555
It should help your intuition
for why, in this case,

180
00:07:38,555 --> 00:07:40,460
the evidence for
a group effect is

181
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,015
less extreme in the mixed model.

182
00:07:43,015 --> 00:07:45,350
Now that we've seen
how to test for

183
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,170
group differences using
mixed effect models,

184
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,595
let's incorporate

185
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:52,520
another common elements
of regression analysis,

186
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,450
the inclusion of additional
explanatory variables.

187
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,570
Even if our primary
research interests relates

188
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,389
to differences in test scores
due to risk background,

189
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:04,115
we would still want
to account for

190
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:06,875
other variables that might
affect reading scores.

191
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,770
For example, we might
want to account for or

192
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,280
control for a student's
gender and attendance record.

193
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,500
In standard linear regression,

194
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,390
you would do this
by simply adding

195
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,490
regression parameters to a model

196
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,635
containing your
variables of interest.

197
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:24,880
We can do the exact same
thing for mixed models.

198
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,990
In this case, I can add

199
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,470
fixed effect terms for
gender and attendance to our

200
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,215
existing random
intercept mixed model

201
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:36,955
already containing grade in
risk group fixed effects.

202
00:08:36,955 --> 00:08:39,500
Student Gender and
attendance are simply

203
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,790
added to the list of fixed
effects in the R code.

204
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,260
In this specific example,

205
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,290
we see that adding these two
variables to the model has

206
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,540
little impact on
the effect estimate

207
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,880
for the risk variable.

208
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,810
So, they're likely
not confounding

209
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,810
the relationship between risk
group and students score.

210
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,690
A more thorough model
fitting analysis would be

211
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,400
required to determine if

212
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,275
they should be
retained in the model,

213
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:06,200
but that's a topic
for another day.

214
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,110
If you remember back
to our primary goals

215
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,420
for longitudinal data analysis,

216
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,090
the second goal was
to identify between

217
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,275
subject differences that
impact the outcome.

218
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:20,800
A common example of this
is group differences.

219
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,360
We looked at risk background as

220
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,200
an example group in the MPLS
data-set in this lecture.

221
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,380
We examined the effect
of risk group by adding

222
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,450
a fixed effect term to indicate

223
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,920
disadvantaged students to

224
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,065
the random intercept mixed model.

225
00:09:36,065 --> 00:09:38,345
This is similar to
how we would add

226
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,700
a regression parameter
for a variable of

227
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,565
interest to a standard
linear regression model.

228
00:09:43,565 --> 00:09:46,610
In our example, we saw
that the results can be

229
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,415
quite different between the
two modeling techniques,

230
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:52,220
further underscoring the
importance of properly

231
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,459
accounting for correlation
in repeated measures data.
