2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:11,323
In this segment, we're gonna talk about
three key terms in describing disease in

3
00:00:11,323 --> 00:00:15,115
population, endemic,
epidemic, and pandemic.

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:20,505
These three terms actually talk about
the occurrence of disease in population,

5
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:22,960
and they're very sort
of context dependent.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,325
So the context being time,
being geography because,

7
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:31,825
for instance, the definition of
endemic really is the usual occurrence

8
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:35,550
of a disease within
a given geographical area.

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,350
So, for instance, what is endemic in,
for instance, Michigan maybe

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,220
very different than what's endemic in
Florida, or Costa Rica, or Russia.

11
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,664
And so that whole definition about what is
the actual natural occurrence of disease

12
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:56,968
is what allows us to define epidemic,
which is where the occurrence of disease.

13
00:00:56,968 --> 00:01:01,864
And usually it's infectious disease,
but it doesn't have to be, is above,

14
00:01:01,864 --> 00:01:04,650
in excess of the normal levels.

15
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,960
So, for instance, while there's some
malaria in Costa Rico, if there was

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,050
a whole big outbreak, somebody could
say there was an epidemic of malaria.

17
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,450
Whereas in Michigan,
because there's no endemic malaria,

18
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,940
just even a couple of cases would mean
that we would have an epidemic of malaria.

19
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,760
The last key term is pandemic, so

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,500
this is a worldwide epidemic
that's affecting an exceptionally

21
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,960
large proportion of people across many
countries and usually continents.

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,210
How do we know if something is
an outbreak or an epidemic?

23
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,630
Well, we have to start by actually
understanding, what is endemic?

24
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,320
What is the usual occurrence?

25
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,050
To get that information, public health
has worked with epidemiologists to set up

26
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,760
surveillance systems.

27
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,980
So, for instance, Departments of Health
will usually work with local clinics,

28
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,630
hospitals, or
other sort of parts of the health system,

29
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,900
could be actually insurance companies, for
that matter, to actually look at how much

30
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,740
disease is regularly occurring
from infectious diseases,

31
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:18,670
common chronic diseases, or even sort of
severe things like accidents and injuries.

32
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,530
Once that sort of baseline is established,

33
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,250
there can be sort of levels of
sort of inquiry to understand more

34
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,950
specifically around the endemic
levels that are happening.

35
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,720
So, for instance, looking at hospital
discharge records, mortality records,

36
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,910
maybe looking at cancer registries,
birth defects registries.

37
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,390
These are natural ways for

38
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,460
us in a population to find
what is this baseline level.

39
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,350
If all else fails and
there's not local data,

40
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:52,330
we can also use the estimates from a
larger sort of segment of the population.

41
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,070
So maybe a county doesn't have its
endemic estimates, but the state will.

42
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,700
And maybe if a state doesn't,
well then their region might.

43
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,260
And this is the way in which
epidemiological information collected in

44
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,860
one space actually informs our
definitions of endemic and epidemic.

45
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,650
One of the last times that we had
a dangerous pandemic in this country

46
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,530
was in 1918.

47
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,010
When the Spanish flu came across
the country, and killed millions and

48
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,480
millions of individuals, but
it wasn't just in this country.

49
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,560
Worldwide, it created a sort of chaos
that actually killed millions of people

50
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,340
much more so than any other flu in
its predecessor sort of decades.

51
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,620
In the graph here, what we have is
actually an illustration of the endemic

52
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,440
actual estimates of flu mortalities.

53
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,060
And what you can see is this huge
spike in this 1918 corridor,

54
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:57,060
that actually defines this epidemic and
this pandemic peak in the population.

55
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,250
How would you know if
there's a pandemic going on?

56
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,770
Well, there are worldwide agencies like
the World Health Organization that has

57
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:09,840
created a whole signal, call it staging.

58
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,700
So that individuals in local,
state, and federal agencies

59
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:21,150
know where we are in terms of
the pandemic, I'll call it alert system.

60
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,497
The last time that this was
really activated was in 2009,

61
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:29,678
when the WHO started to get
signals of a global pandemic that

62
00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:32,035
was underway started in Mexico.

63
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:36,195
And as the cases of the H1N1,
at that point in time,

64
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:41,281
thought to be very deadly started
to move into the United States,

65
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,690
and then across to other countries.

66
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:50,590
The wave of information actually
moved the WHO alert system

67
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,660
up to its highest max level where
the Southern Hemisphere was

68
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:01,030
seeing this H1N1 flu on top
of the regular flu strains.

69
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,010
The Northern Hemisphere was seeing
these H1N1 flu in summer months,

70
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,250
when we don't typically have flu.

71
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,210
Over 70 countries within about two to
three months all had reported cases.

72
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:21,810
And so that was one of the signatures of
the pandemic that went worldwide in 2009.

73
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,910
There are many different aspects of
collecting that information in order for

74
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,560
a body like the World Health Organization
to make those calls.

75
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,470
And what I have sort of illustrated
here are all the different partners.

76
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,192
And that goes everything from
the country's offices that are pulling

77
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:46,074
information into the WHO all the way
to the media, to the laboratories,

78
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:49,195
and to the other sort of
health ministries that

79
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:55,307
are providing a worldwide view
of the spread of the disease.
