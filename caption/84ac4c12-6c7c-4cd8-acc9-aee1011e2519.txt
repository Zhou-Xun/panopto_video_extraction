1
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,020
Now we'll move from
abstract archetypes of

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,215
approaches to three
specific proposals.

3
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:16,390
No one proposal has gained

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,145
traction in the
Republican Party,

5
00:00:18,145 --> 00:00:19,870
so we will use a proposal called

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,850
healthcare choices
as an indicator

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,635
of some conservative ideas

8
00:00:23,635 --> 00:00:25,990
to reform the healthcare system.

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,970
Democrats are generally split

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,410
between proposals building on

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,080
the ACA and
single-payer proposals

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,700
under the heading
Medicare for all.

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,080
The healthcare choices
proposal was developed by

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,959
a group of conservative
health policy experts.

15
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:44,505
The word choices is key to
understanding the approach.

16
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:47,300
This proposal provides
greater flexibility for

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,300
states, insurers, and enrollees.

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,120
States would receive block
grants and could keep

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,525
ACA like systems or
develop alternatives.

20
00:00:56,525 --> 00:00:59,810
Coverage requirements and
rating restrictions on

21
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,900
age or preexisting conditions
would be loosened.

22
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,825
Catastrophic and short-term
plans would be allowed,

23
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:07,160
and plans with health savings

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,780
accounts will be encouraged.

25
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,300
The ACA's essential
health benefits would no

26
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,030
longer be required to be
covered by all plans.

27
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,920
The drafters expect some states

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,390
to use targeted subsidies and

29
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,280
reinsurance to cover high risks

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,425
without pulling them
with low risks,

31
00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:24,990
and to convert Medicaid
to private options.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,380
The Center for
Health and Economy

33
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,800
analyze the healthcare
choices plan.

34
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,630
They concluded
that would lead to

35
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,384
some decrease in premiums,

36
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:36,905
a small decrease in
Federal spending,

37
00:01:36,905 --> 00:01:40,449
keep the number of people
insured approximately constant,

38
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:42,680
and higher out-of-pocket
obligations would

39
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,110
imply a reduction in
financial access to care.

40
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,915
The ACA started by building
on existing coverage sources,

41
00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:53,645
primarily maintaining
employer sponsored coverage,

42
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:55,190
and expanding eligibility for

43
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,465
Medicaid to cover all
low-income adults.

44
00:01:58,465 --> 00:02:01,430
It then reformed the
non-group market by offering

45
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,085
subsidized and somewhat
standardized plans with

46
00:02:04,085 --> 00:02:08,315
preexisting conditions protections
and required benefits.

47
00:02:08,315 --> 00:02:11,480
Initial efforts to build
on the ACA include

48
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,390
restoring some original
provisions that had been removed,

49
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,980
like cost-sharing reductions,

50
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,230
subsidies, and outreach efforts.

51
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,969
In addition, the
American Rescue Plan

52
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:23,450
increase the Federal share
of funding for states adding

53
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,750
Medicaid expansions and
increase subsidies and reduce

54
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,805
the percent of income cap on
premiums for 2021 and 2022.

55
00:02:31,805 --> 00:02:33,560
Broader efforts to build on

56
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,840
the ACA would extend
and broaden subsidies

57
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,760
permanently and possibly at

58
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,285
a public option plan to
compete with private plans.

59
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:43,730
Medicare for all proposals would

60
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,475
restructure healthcare
financing more fundamentally,

61
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:48,290
by replacing employer provided

62
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,330
non-group and Medicaid
coverage with

63
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,160
a single-payer system based on

64
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,590
traditional Medicare
fee for service.

65
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,420
Point of care
cost-sharing would be

66
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,045
eliminated or
substantially curtailed.

67
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,865
The private delivery
system would be retained,

68
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:03,110
making that aspect of

69
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,480
the system more like
Canada than the UK.

70
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,340
The CBO analyze the
financial effects

71
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,840
of Medicare for all.

72
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,660
Relative to current law in 2030,

73
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,190
Federal spending would increase

74
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,800
by 1.5-3 trillion dollars.

75
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,810
Total national health
expenditures would

76
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,580
change in the reduction of a

77
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,470
0.7 trillion dollar decline

78
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,945
to a 0.3 trillion
dollar increase.

79
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:29,330
Where it would fall in
these ranges depends on

80
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,645
assumptions that CBO made on
three aspects of the plan.

81
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,270
First, would provider
payments be similar to

82
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,370
current Medicare rates versus

83
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,595
a payer weighted
average of rates?

84
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,945
Second, how much cost-sharing
would be retained?

85
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:46,520
Some versus non except for
small prescription co-pays.

86
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,740
Third, would the system
include coverage

87
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,660
for long-term services
and supports.

88
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,260
The CBO concluded that

89
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,705
the primary sources
of savings would be

90
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:59,240
0.5 trillion dollars
lower provider payments

91
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,800
if Medicare rates were used,

92
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,475
and 0.4 trillion lower
administrative costs.

93
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:06,620
The primary source of added cost

94
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,640
would be the higher use of

95
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,270
care as patients respond to
lower out-of-pocket prices,

96
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,680
which would increase spending

97
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,220
by 0.2-2.7 trillion dollars.

98
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,370
However, supply was assumed
to be insufficient to

99
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,460
meet all demand due to
lower payment rates,

100
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,000
which both limits the increase
in spending and raises

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,085
the possibility of
increased waiting times

102
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:30,545
or other restrictions on access.

103
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:33,290
The challenge of policy
reform is illustrated

104
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,900
by the case of Medicare
prescription coverage.

105
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,020
After much debate, prescription
coverage was left out of

106
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,560
the 1965 legislation that
established Medicare.

107
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,110
Private insurance coverage
for prescriptions

108
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,840
had become nearly
universal by the 1970s,

109
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,880
but Medicare beneficiaries
had to wait until

110
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,030
2003 for a prescription
plan to be passed,

111
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,940
and 2006 for it to
be implemented.

112
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,340
Barriers to earlier
passage included

113
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,830
divided government,
budget deficits,

114
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,590
ideological differences,
and drug companies

115
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,060
resisting the Federal government

116
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,460
gaining power to control prices.

117
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,250
Previous attempts to add
prescription coverage were

118
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,525
often tied to other legislation
for failed to pass.

119
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:16,540
The final legislation
had limited benefits and

120
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,570
a very confusing structure
that made the bill very

121
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,100
unpopular among the public

122
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,515
and among seniors
when it passed.

123
00:05:23,515 --> 00:05:25,600
Some benefits enhancements were

124
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,070
passed as part of the ACA in

125
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,070
2010 and phased in over
a number of years.

126
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,690
To summarize what we've
learned about health reform,

127
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,400
fundamental policy changes in

128
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,790
healthcare financing require
an historic opportunity.

129
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,530
The ACA passed after

130
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,935
failed attempts going back to
the Truman administration.

131
00:05:44,935 --> 00:05:46,900
Private changes can evolve

132
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,670
much more quickly and flexibly,

133
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,800
for example, prescription
drug coverage,

134
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,850
but lack universality.

135
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,770
Proposed approaches differ
on many dimensions,

136
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,520
but a crucial one is choosing
to build incrementally on

137
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,300
the existing system versus
fundamental restructuring.

138
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,790
Finally, navigating any approach

139
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,415
requires keen understanding
of the interests,

140
00:06:07,415 --> 00:06:12,309
incentives, hopes, and fears
of all affected actors.
