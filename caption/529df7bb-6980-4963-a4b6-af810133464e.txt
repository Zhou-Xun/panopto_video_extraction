1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,850
And you think mean maybe.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:13,890
You know I'm living in Germany and.

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,820
Okay I. Exclusive.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:35,230
Nichols And. I was shouting down the corridor.

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,120
Welcome. Welcome to method five 6460.

6
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,390
Public Health 460. With a mix up here. Loads of it.

7
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:50,020
Classes rolled into one. Don't blame me by my predecessor, but welcome nonetheless.

8
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,670
And Happy New Year. My name is Alex Rickert.

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,069
As you probably gathered, I'm not like Russian friends. I'm not faking my accent.

10
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,030
I am from England. So bear with me.

11
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,530
I apologize, as most British people do for everything, especially our accents.

12
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,139
If you can't understand what I'm saying or I talk too fast, raise your hand.

13
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,250
I won't be offended. I just say, I don't recall you going too fast.

14
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:23,350
He said, I'll be back and I'll be sure. But that being that's a couple of housekeeping things right up front.

15
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:33,530
The canvass sites, there's multiple canvass sites for every 564 average for 60, for public health for 60.

16
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:42,280
I'm going to speak to the administration tomorrow and make sure we're okay with everything being put on one canvas,

17
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,930
because it's not going be a nightmare for me to keep tracking across different canvas sites for one class.

18
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,680
Of course, you all meet in the same room and go the same topics.

19
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,340
Does that sound like some of you? Okay.

20
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,480
The other bits is I'll make sure that we clear the decks.

21
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,880
There is the class has been changed over the years.

22
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:09,310
Originally it was a 560. Then it's been more integrated into the force 60 with elements of 560,

23
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:17,320
562 do it makes sense for 60 equity, for 60 public health for 60 essentially the same that makes sense.

24
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,070
The big difference between 564, 65, 60.

25
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:28,390
There is an additional essay to do. I'll get to that in a little while and it builds upon concepts that I introduced in here.

26
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:36,010
Does that make sense? Okay, so first up, who is this guy with the funky accent at the front of the class talking to you?

27
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,139
And why should you be talking to us about this topic?

28
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:46,780
Area Pathogenicity Micro, which is causing disease, public health implications, treatment of antimicrobials, all this kind of stuff.

29
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,620
So I figured I would do an introduction and then a spoiler alert.

30
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,780
I'm going to ask you all to tell me about yourself. I will put it this way.

31
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,870
I have a philosophy for teaching that is in line, I think, very well with diversity, equity and inclusion.

32
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,770
And although we don't have a round table in here, I wish we did.

33
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:12,219
We would all sit around the table if there was one. And I like to be a bit like my upbringing.

34
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,340
I was actually born and raised in Cornwall, England.

35
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,209
If you don't Cornwall, England as you can Google. It is famous because King Arthur is.

36
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:23,920
That would be King Arthur. Have a nice round table with all is nice you all are nice.

37
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,809
And the idea is they all equally contributed.

38
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,820
Everyone was treated the same and everybody's opinion is valued and everyone was respectful to each other.

39
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,290
And I want to uphold that in here. Okay. There are no daft questions.

40
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,570
There were no daft answers, but everyone should be. Obviously think of a subject matter and getting involved.

41
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,400
I love discussions. I love I'm a chatterbox. I love talking about loads of stuff.

42
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,270
Would take you to these cool topics, baby. Sometimes you ask me questions, I won't know the answer, but I'll go find out for you.

43
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,579
And similarly, somebody else might know the answer to what somebody else doesn't know and vice versa.

44
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:05,830
So be open to discussion. And where does this all come from?

45
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,320
Is from my part is because it will be so why teaching the class?

46
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:17,680
Why in teaching in the style of the background now he was born in Devon slash Cornwall and England,

47
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:23,560
right in the coastline actually, and it's very famous for the Moors.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,620
King Arthur definition custard actually doing custard.

49
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,580
You love custard and out things like that, interesting food.

50
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:42,880
But anyway, so then I went on to do my bachelors at this really cool place, but like the Hogwarts and Harry Potter.

51
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,960
So you've got this cool building here. It's a gothic architecture.

52
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:54,610
That's the University of Birmingham. I did a Bachelors in Biological Sciences specifically focusing on microbiology and immunology.

53
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:02,469
Then I decided got fed up with microbes, as I said that I actually that I allowed inside of microbes and immunology and decided to take a

54
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,549
break and then go into applied genetics because molecular biology was all brand new then cool.

55
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,880
Right? So I went on and did a master's in Quantitative Genetics,

56
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:19,719
which is basically things like looking at the height of plants or looking how much a toxin the plant can produce.

57
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,020
In this case, it was focusing on foxglove.

58
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:34,150
Actually, it was interesting story behind that at the time. And potatoes and genetics and understanding what traits are divided by certain genes.

59
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:42,160
And then during that time, eating tissue culture works. That's an interesting aspect, what we'll be covering later on tissue culture work.

60
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:49,660
And I kept getting bacterial contamination. So to try to implant tissue work, it doesn't take days, it takes weeks and months.

61
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,090
And of course, you got one bacterium in there, you're contaminated, you're done your cut.

62
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:59,920
So I actually being lucky in there was now confident with that.

63
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,080
And so I said, you know what, you can't beat them, join them.

64
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:08,380
So I then went on to do a Ph.D. and another Gothic kind of cool institution, University of Manchester,

65
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:15,430
and that was in microbiology, and that was actually looking at freshwater bacteria and how they form biofilms.

66
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,120
First interaction. Question How do you do a biofilms on here?

67
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:25,480
One, two, three, four, five. Q Okay, that way, if you don't know, I would go further into that later.

68
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:31,930
Well, um, so that was looking at how bacteria stick to surfaces and cause problems.

69
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,180
First, obvious one thing in here, first joke of the day, if you will.

70
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:45,640
I know I'm British. I am more akin to Austin Powers than I am to James Bond when we're saying to is my teeth.

71
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:51,460
Yes, they're not willing to leave them. But the point is, I do have them to back off.

72
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:59,950
I hate to tell you this, you all do, too. And dental plaque is a biofilm assemblage of bacteria on a surface.

73
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:07,630
And as you probably heard in the press or the news and in other classes, it can cause tooth decay and it can cause gum disease.

74
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,909
And so I was very much interested in how biofilms formed in the mouth and elsewhere.

75
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:22,690
And that's my Ph.D. I then went from microbiology into pharmacy, so I joined the pharmacy department as a postdoc and doing drug delivery and design.

76
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,240
And we're looking at ways to control biofilms using antimicrobials.

77
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,470
And that was funded actually with an American company, SC Johnson.

78
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,640
They're doing some working. Have bathrooms to better control them.

79
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,260
Fantastic. I should mention before I go to you for the story.

80
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,959
This was at work and Peter Gilbert's lab. Peter Gilbert was a professor at the University of Manchester.

81
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:54,530
He sat in there longer with us. And I just want to say that some of this work since got this lecture, some of this information,

82
00:07:54,530 --> 00:08:00,650
me telling you, is based of some of his findings and saying to other professors,

83
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,040
I think my bosses over the years and I really should be saying and management to

84
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,280
them have seen a lot is because I've been standing on the shoulders of giants.

85
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,780
They were huge. They were mammoth in that they would be this big time.

86
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:20,559
And the second big thing I worked with was talking about a nationalist use of how Paul CONAN Granda was the one,

87
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,850
the first people to show the bacteria microcosms of social.

88
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:33,350
They're not solitary teammates in life. They actually can interact with each other physically and chemically and coordinate their behavior.

89
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:43,010
How cool is that that they can kind of, for a better word, talk to each other for microbial handshakes, agree to do things together, blows your mind.

90
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,989
And that's actually one of the things that he was one of the leaders here. So I worked with him for a while.

91
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:55,060
That was some dental practice that arose from the Dental Institute and the government in the NIH so that an ecology group access

92
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:02,930
biology at State University in New York was looking at ecological interactions and biofilm development and chronic rooms,

93
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,569
also stuff like that. And then really great phone call with Betsy Foxman.

94
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:16,790
Professor Foxman here and after a few interviews and presentations, came here to join the epidemiology department.

95
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:25,099
So in sure, microbiology, immunology, pharmacology, if you will, ecology, epidemiology,

96
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:32,690
lots of colleges there at the linear link between all of this is understanding how bacteria can cause problems,

97
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:39,050
especially diseases, and thinking about commensal bacteria that don't cause disease.

98
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,340
Pathogenic bacteria do cause disease and time they sort together.

99
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,620
And this class reflects that.

100
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:55,940
Okay, so that's the guys in front of you from my own diploma and chunk of a few seconds and that of my lab research upstairs,

101
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:02,990
we have over 70 research and review papers that such an underestimate and patents funding from federal state society,

102
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:09,080
corporate sponsors, corporate sponsors, things like SC Johnson, Procter and Gamble, people, people like that,

103
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:15,260
and multilevel research strategy with applied focus on bias control trying to prevent pathogens existing.

104
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:20,000
Why biofilms? Because bathrooms where most microorganisms exist.

105
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:28,340
Okay, estimates between 60 and 99% of bacteria worldwide live in bathrooms and it's floating about in the air surfaces.

106
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,050
How I mean, you guys are walking, talking biofilms.

107
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,139
I hate to tell you. I've seen that later on. And it's not a criticism.

108
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:41,480
I'm a walking, talking biofilm. This big number of bacteria in your body and a number of your own cells,

109
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,190
that is roughly the same, slightly more or less in favor of the bacteria that they cool.

110
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,320
So with that, that's me in a nutshell.

111
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,540
You would like to get first stuff over here, go for it.

112
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:03,530
So I guess the thing that pissing me off in, I'm going to focus science research into what we have assume in fact if you want one.

113
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:09,379
So my name is Ben. I am in the dental school.

114
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,640
I'm doing a dual degree. This is my second year.

115
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:26,299
My science research interest is kind of bone specific type tissue regeneration and collagen cross-linking broadly.

116
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,140
But I think I'd like to do academia.

117
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:37,130
It's a long road, so I haven't really made the decision yet, but I'd like to do some sort of professorship maybe.

118
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:43,069
In fact, I'm from Atlanta.

119
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,700
I don't know if that's really all that fun, but that's a back CBCs that.

120
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,909
Yeah. Yeah. All right, then.

121
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,270
Nice to meet you. Hi, guys. I'm Sarah.

122
00:11:53,630 --> 00:12:00,290
I'm a senior and public health program via after graduation.

123
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:05,840
I want to apply to school and I want to focus in oncology.

124
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:12,950
You a fun fact. I was born blue eyes, but now another green chest.

125
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:18,140
You have a second person to talk about my to change. So was Emily in the class?

126
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,360
I did the same thing in the other class for introductions.

127
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:29,569
And somebody else said that fun fact that I kind of James Gibbons I could go to fact Q and ask question maybe 701.

128
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,630
I'm more and I'm also in the East.

129
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,299
A little program here in my science.

130
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:41,300
Insurance is like women's health for all these career paths.

131
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:47,670
I'm headed to med school next year. And then a fun fact is that for the cello, what's next?

132
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:55,560
Me, the marathon. I'm working on my bachelor's in microbiome.

133
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,930
I'm really interested in infectious diseases, and that's the reality for career.

134
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:08,280
Probably something like research and labs and fun facts.

135
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:15,960
I grew up in Chicago, went to the same high school. So there's a chance the rapper.

136
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,000
You are dating me now? Yeah, AQAP, right?

137
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:25,040
Yeah. Yeah, welcome.

138
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,610
So I'm actually welcome again because you might not pass muster.

139
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,890
Yeah. Goodbye. My name is Peter.

140
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:41,850
I am a senior in the public out here so that the circumstances and vaccine effectiveness necessary.

141
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,580
And I plan to be a physician in the future. That's right.

142
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:57,150
Yeah. Okay. I work in an office where I'm in a B.S. program.

143
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,940
Pretty much my research consistent, but mostly clinical.

144
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:12,210
Like, I've done a lot of research and I it's a lot and a fun fact.

145
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:24,360
Oh gosh, it's been a while since I've done this, but if you give me any country, I'd probably go as a challenge.

146
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:30,240
And a lot of people are very welcome.

147
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,280
Hello, my name is my name is David. But I go by nurse for short.

148
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:44,550
My focus is off of public health program of science or know I'm going to med school for next year.

149
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:50,280
I'm interested in cardiology specifically to talk about some of the policies,

150
00:14:50,280 --> 00:15:02,490
like in a lot of community sometimes about the ideas that I have currently presented that it's not wow, but welcome.

151
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:16,380
I'm very I like many others and also with all the student sites across, I'm interested in infectious diseases, specifically antimicrobial resistance.

152
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:24,509
I do research in pulmonary clinical care labs, so a lot of micro immunology stem career paths.

153
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:30,329
I'm interested in epidemiology, maybe medicine, maybe a policy now and then.

154
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:39,450
A fun fact. I love this show Survivor, so if anyone else likes to talk to me, you actually welcome.

155
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,690
I'm Emma. I'm in the public health program.

156
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,530
I'm interested in nutrition and exercise.

157
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:58,920
I'm doing research right now with a professor, his work in biology in relation to diet and exercise and breast cancer.

158
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,030
So that's definitely something I'm interested in for for your part,

159
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:10,350
to go back to what I want to do that fun fact, I used to be a cheerleader so I can do a backflip.

160
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,030
Just not here. Welcome.

161
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,950
I'm Alex, also a senior. He has a public health program.

162
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,670
I do research and it's on like triple negative breast cancer and preventing metastasis,

163
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,190
hoping to the physician maybe integrate public health into that.

164
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:40,769
And fun fact is that we were contacted on one I really kind of quite I don't

165
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,730
know what happens and I just have one I that that description in the year 2020.

166
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,270
Wow oh that's a cool fun fact. I'm Francis.

167
00:16:51,270 --> 00:17:00,149
I'm also a senior in the undergraduate program and my science and research interests, largely women's health related.

168
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:04,080
I do research and the Virginia Department of Medicine,

169
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,880
but I also working and have been lab here doing various features in it's food

170
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:17,160
companies that score on milk a lot of the vaccine efficacy which is cool.

171
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:24,120
I also wanted to be a physician and I knew that after some chapters for sure and like skiing a little

172
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:32,400
probably and then like fun fact is my actual dream job is to be the lead singer of a rock band.

173
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,670
But that would. Actually, I saw you last night.

174
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:42,640
Relapsed. I was not on your knee. That was wonderful.

175
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,790
We did not. I will pass them. There's another girl with more curly hair.

176
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,169
I just thought, especially when I'm going to sexual as well. And that was a continuation.

177
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,470
I was like, so. So I'm sure I'll see you. Yeah, you probably me that.

178
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,360
And by the way, just so we're clear, if anyone's had an interest in the research,

179
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:03,229
it goes on in my lab or just sent me an email or took me to the class.

180
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:07,280
What happens? Should you be allowed to go through some really cool stuff happening on the fifth floor, which I think you've seen?

181
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:15,679
So I have an idea, like we have chocolate PCR as we have synthetic stuff we have in my lab look like these really cool

182
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:24,319
microscopes imaging 3D and actually can track things every time in 3D and a micron level 3D printers.

183
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,229
I mean, come on, 3D printers are cool if you're interested just anything more happy to send you around but going to want

184
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:36,590
to do remake that this class is just think of everyone's access to these how diverse we are right.

185
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:43,880
I mean school of dentistry we've got graduate students, undergraduate students, all different backgrounds.

186
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:50,930
And one thing I'm gonna try and do is try and make this class as accessible and as understandable as possible.

187
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,680
Okay? If you struggle any parts, the parts in the class,

188
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:01,940
just email me or country after class and say I don't stand or even during, you know, major has a different standard.

189
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:07,489
Don't be afraid to face me. Do that. Okay? We're all friends and we're all colleagues.

190
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:11,240
We are all respectful of each other. I want us to be.

191
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,140
And if I stop talking about things that really confuses you, let me know.

192
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:21,470
There will be a few topics that will probably confuse you, silly.

193
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:29,660
So for example, Ivette, who's head of Ivette in here, see, I that is a technique that sort of ruined it for you,

194
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,350
but basically it can be used in the lab and it even confuses me at times.

195
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:37,070
So it's a kind of a way of like it's like a Rubik's cube of thinking.

196
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:45,130
Does it make sense? And if you haven't got that good microbial background, which is the background, please reach out and I'll help you.

197
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,880
If I am aware of emails, at least two of you the 311 issue.

198
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:58,640
I'm not too sure how much microbiology was in 311 and I don't know because obviously I took this class over how that works.

199
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:03,530
But if you struggle, let me know and I will be absolutely here to help.

200
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:08,810
Okay. And of course, you can gauge the class during the first few weeks.

201
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:14,030
I'm hoping you've already gauged kind of what kind of attitude I have and the kind of things I'm looking for.

202
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:21,740
There is a lot of information in this class that I would tell you the papers and the majority of papers I'll put up for the quad reading,

203
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:28,070
just read them. But I won't generally refer to them in the midterms and quizzes unless I say so.

204
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,090
Okay. But do we do we still have the old member of the class?

205
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:41,630
But I try to cover everything as best as I can, and the main focus of all the classes will be on the lectures.

206
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,540
That's my main focus, as I say. Otherwise, maybe it's a topic area or or quiz or something like that.

207
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:55,879
Okay, let's get into the meeting bones in the class. But before I do, I will try to get to what we just discussed about what different backgrounds.

208
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,440
What do you see? Shout it out. Duck, duck.

209
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,020
A rabbit, rabbit. As you say you should.

210
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,190
A rabbit is a rabbit, is a duck and is a rabbit, depending on which way you look at it.

211
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:16,219
And my point is here that there that when we think about things that we draw

212
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:21,230
upon our past experiences and we should acknowledge those in any way or form,

213
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,629
but then think about how that is crafted.

214
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:32,960
Your opinions of things and this is conflict is a psychological gestalt and it remains actually to nothing we can have as a picture,

215
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,500
which I should mention here just out a physical, biological or psychological,

216
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:44,690
symbolic configuration or pattern of elements so unified as a whole and its properties going be derived from the simple summation of its parts.

217
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:49,010
And that is that my version of I just don't like picture.

218
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:55,630
What do you see? There's a person, right?

219
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:02,740
But actually, if you look really closely, you realize the person is made up of individual composed, not human cells, but of bacterial cells.

220
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:09,850
So when I think of periodontal disease, when I think of chronic wounds, when I think of gum disease or infectious disease and things of that too,

221
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,700
like salmonella or Vibrio infections, I'm thinking of the microorganisms and the like organs,

222
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,290
how they interact with each other and the host individually and collectively.

223
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:30,670
It is ridiculously complex and I only wanted to the classic reason give you an is to give you an insight into some of those things that are happening.

224
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,469
Okay. We will be going in depth and some things like molecular mechanisms.

225
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,650
What is a family? What is a paleo? What types of paleo are there?

226
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:48,160
All these kind of things. But then if you want to delve in it further, I will give you the papers is on required reading is one of the required ones.

227
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,570
But I don't want you to go totally off the deep end.

228
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:58,570
I'm very aware that this class is slowly evolving to be a good blend for 6560.

229
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:11,980
It was originally when I first got it during COVID the class not cover it yourself, but it was more geared towards 560 going to more balanced.

230
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:17,770
And also it was originally way more heavy than this on molecular.

231
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:24,090
I'm trying to pull that back as well. I want to be more breadth and depth back in the bit.

232
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:31,360
That makes sense. The person that taught it before me, he let me know it was Karl Marx, Professor Karl Marx between the 36 years.

233
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,680
So I've got big groups to fill.

234
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,930
But I would tell you right now that this slide deck is 63 slides.

235
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:44,620
When you look at that, don't freak out. You get to a six week slide and one lecture.

236
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:49,180
No, I drag a lecture across multiple lecture deck.

237
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,870
Multiple lectures oftentimes. Okay. And I'll go at the pace.

238
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:56,070
Yes. Is there somewhere I can find the slide deck on?

239
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:02,080
Is it up for when it should be my source of resources?

240
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:06,160
Oh, so yes, if you're to be source, that's how I do it.

241
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:14,290
So basically one that you to use the use the resources of all the slides into,

242
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,980
I think you should be populated with little tabs, somewhat of tabular headers.

243
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:22,900
Yes. I'm not a suave and sophisticated is using all these other tools on canvas.

244
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,560
I focus more on the content and want to be more personal as well.

245
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,270
So actually in some instances I'll hand out hard copies to you things that that is old school.

246
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:36,850
But it actually I could put it I'm rebelling against COVID.

247
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:42,100
What I mean by that is I did not like the fact that we were so stuck in our own homes.

248
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,520
Listening to zooms isn't as cool. It could be in here.

249
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:55,900
You know, this is just like to be round people talking about things, sharing hard copies of things, especially things to mention as well.

250
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:01,930
I'm encouraging if we do, we did a midterm and we did a quiz or two, then that would be in person as well.

251
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,460
And you can raise your hand, you can ask questions, be more interactive. Okay.

252
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:09,009
I am hoping that COVID obviously won't come back.

253
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:14,410
And if it does, you obviously have to adhere to the rules. I mean, I'm digressing, so let's keep track of this.

254
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,470
So the class would be all about me.

255
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:27,400
I love this picture because we're going to talk about the mouth, the throat, the trachea, the get your genital stuff.

256
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:33,640
We can be talking about wounds. We can actually talk about the environments around as well.

257
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:39,190
So what is around us? But how can that influence and cause disease and cause problems?

258
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:45,700
Okay. But I'm trying to pull the disease back a little bit and tie it also to what we realized in the last decade,

259
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,930
especially the last five years, really pushing. And that is the microbiome.

260
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:59,140
When it looks and causes disease, it also has to take on other contenders, specifically the microbes that are already on you.

261
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:03,400
Right. And that wasn't in the previous commerce class.

262
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:10,089
I'm too liberal about that. So. Okay, any questions that pique your interest?

263
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:10,690
I hope I have.

264
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:22,090
And there's all sorts of things in the works from Scientific American in music around and just have a microbiome, you'll find zillions of links.

265
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,710
And this is just a space that points back at some of things that we're covering, you know,

266
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:34,480
skin, huge tracts, stomach, mouth or cavity potential black, white kind of stuff.

267
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,249
So to so you guys are lucky.

268
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,400
Last year, the course time was at eight in the morning.

269
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,569
So I begged Jim Gordon pleaded with anybody.

270
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:53,070
You know, my point is that we have a discussion and this year I managed to get moved to the afternoon says at this time okay for everyone that.

271
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,360
Their problems. Do you need to leave early?

272
00:26:55,510 --> 00:27:05,800
Any excuse that no way to finish usually tend to 5 minutes before the end of the time so people can zip up to the classes.

273
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:14,470
Actually, sometimes even a bit earlier than that, again. And I have office hours as well.

274
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:18,150
And you tend to be on Fridays, but I always have time Monday as well.

275
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:22,989
So happy to zoom or to chat. Assessment will be quizzes individual.

276
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,150
Take the midterm exam room with some papers.

277
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:31,410
I'll get started a few minutes and then class discussion to me is super important to be able to attend classes.

278
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:36,130
Please discuss with me because I will be noticing who's here, who's not here.

279
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:40,180
And it's really important as part of the learning process.

280
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:44,650
And it's fun. Okay. Okay.

281
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,720
And then papers will be PDFs.

282
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:55,540
There's no course textbook content, which is more up to date information or stuff that's really focused on the facts that we have said,

283
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:02,589
boy, to textbook, you know, try to say I want it to be keep it kind of fresh, put some real stuff in, show you what's going on.

284
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:07,630
And if you don't understand having the papers and if you do, if you should understand a to me, that kind of thing.

285
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,800
Okay. Okay.

286
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,639
So course description, microbial structures.

287
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,350
I love that phrase that actually wasn't me. That was called Mars Microbial Structures.

288
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:27,340
And the relation to basic mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis, structure, function and genetics of bacteria, toxins,

289
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:35,230
host resistance and immunity little immunity Abdul that back a little bit more favor now more microbiome and the microbial

290
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:43,120
structures that being the microbiome and then discussions of pathogenic organisms have major public health importance

291
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:51,219
diseases cause and that epidemiologic we won't be doing much in viruses of sesame on bacteria actually manage to creep in a

292
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:57,400
little bit on yeasts as well in fungi because fungi and bacteria can interact with each other and do interesting things.

293
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:03,040
So of course what we mean by structures or structures can be a physical thing,

294
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:09,100
but it can be also some kind of way you think about things and how they can be linked together in some way.

295
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,880
So for example, if you think of a structure to think of as a biofilm, but also as an interactive structure,

296
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:23,080
who is with what in that biofilm sort of blow your mind very quickly, give an idea of what I'm getting at and we will be covering this kind of thing.

297
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:35,880
If you put the word aggregation into oh, you can see it looks weird again.

298
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:41,290
Now, I cut you a minute when you get this.

299
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:48,370
What does that really mean? Well, it really shows it is. Yes.

300
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,720
And you have been to the surface.

301
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,690
You have organisms attached to the surface of the other ones flying to other ones.

302
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:04,940
Right. You see that and network. And it's a collaboration that is really important because the upper organisms are the ones that cause disease.

303
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:13,730
The lower ones are the ones that promote health. So that's why not even realizing it, we are brushing your teeth for trying to remove the toxins.

304
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:19,370
Now, would it be cool if we could develop new strategies to try and help do colonizing the first place

305
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:24,230
and understanding how they cause disease to interacting with each other and with the host?

306
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,610
That's an example of what we think about structures that makes sense.

307
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:39,110
I'll do that for you again.

308
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:52,840
As President. Good time mechanisms.

309
00:30:52,840 --> 00:31:01,450
So how do these little tiny single cells do that and how they cause disease intracellular

310
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:07,750
extracellular sync of hybrid mechanism to do both toxins versus anti toxins.

311
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:14,890
So can I put antitoxin as an interesting story because bacteria actually use

312
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:19,840
antitoxin and toxins on themselves and recover a little bit of that as well.

313
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:25,360
It makes sense when you get that acquired resistance versus intrinsic resistance.

314
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,470
Acquired means you gain the resistance from somewhere else. Intrinsic means you had it all the time.

315
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,050
Right. And different types of immunity. So we'll cover that a little bit.

316
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:42,760
Don't go into huge debts. The previous stuff, like said, we went into all these and kinds of meetings to a cascade complement, that kind of stuff.

317
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:48,280
I don't want to go there. I've got a seen that is more where I don't know.

318
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:55,030
This would be the previous class that we used to be linked to. This one went on to be more about the microorganisms themselves.

319
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,930
So what do you think? That sounds good to you. Okay.

320
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,970
The goals of this class, of course, are to have students gaining.

321
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,600
You will gain a basic and in some instances advanced understanding the kinds of virulence factors,

322
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,320
things that cause disease used by pathogenic bacteria.

323
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:19,870
So bacteria that cause disease and how we discovered to study those traits,

324
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:26,469
how they do it and how we can make use of this knowledge for treatment and prevention.

325
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:34,090
And I've beefed that bit up as well. So only one of you is my other class, the bits of that that will actually be spreading into here,

326
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,980
because I think as a school of public health, I'd actually be interested in a few of you for being doctors.

327
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,750
It would be kind of cool explained to you some practice as well, tying together some of this stuff.

328
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,560
So near the end, I'm going to cover a bit more about antimicrobials.

329
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:53,440
That sounds reasonable to you. Now, to stress this point, the syllabus is organic.

330
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,870
Okay. So I skip forward and it goes in here quickly.

331
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,840
I'll go back. It's organic, all these topics, but I just put those down.

332
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:09,640
Okay. This will kind of interest me. But if we end up where we want to focus more on bathrooms and knocking the topic out, we can do that.

333
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,530
I say knock it out. Actually find the statement as they got it way down.

334
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:21,189
Okay. I'm going to finish a few things here that may not be as interesting to some people,

335
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:24,720
like extracellular proteases, but I still think it's important to talk about.

336
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:28,390
So I won't go back a little. I'm doing other things that depending on where we go.

337
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,650
Okay. This is the way that is going. Okay.

338
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:40,480
It worked well in the previous years. I will happily divulge just go to my good scores in previous years for having this this approach.

339
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:46,440
I really want to go to where you all as young scientists of slightly older boys and a baby.

340
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:50,230
Young scientists and learners want to go with this.

341
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:57,060
That makes sense. But this is my core structure, and I would like to try and stick that as close as we can.

342
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:04,960
We also one level of time, but I can't imagine we would lose maybe one one topic area or maybe one to be integrated in or something like that.

343
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,310
But this is what I'd like to do. Is any of this worry anybody?

344
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:19,090
If any of this is anything of particular interest, shout if you think some is calling this not anything like an idea.

345
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,960
I like the antimicrobial resistance. Okay. Okay.

346
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,560
Antimicrobial resistance. You might do anything else.

347
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,300
You just sit here. The genomic replacement.

348
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:38,240
So I would tell you what a super cool kind of bit of a mind bender, but it's super cool.

349
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:47,420
I think could really enjoy that. Any other thoughts? Invasion invasions takes.

350
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,810
It takes. That's can be pretty cool as well. Yeah, I think we had some fun with that one.

351
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:56,840
Any other thoughts or something like this? I don't even remember what it was like a while new.

352
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:01,580
Cool. So before 1796, remember from microbiome and not quite remember.

353
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:10,370
So that's perfect. So from sensing is the active player or just produce molecules that help detect each other molecule reach a certain level?

354
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:14,390
Just about anyone can reach certain levels. It can tell them we'll do like a trigger.

355
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:18,630
Okay. I don't have analogies. Like I'm I don't do it.

356
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:23,450
I really want to do it now, but it's really, really fun. So great, great, great thoughts.

357
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:29,960
Okay. Um, I actually like the, my two obviously biofilms don't want pathogenesis.

358
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:34,100
So a whole section of biofilms here and of course sensing Italian.

359
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,479
But also I do like the x axis band as well is kind of cool.

360
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,180
We see these microcosms tumbling and then find like a dog in a field trying to use their sensory apparatus,

361
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,570
then find the direction to go to find nutrients, whatever it may be.

362
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:56,120
So they have do this. Yeah, I know not everyone is here today.

363
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:03,050
I mean, we still traveling back, so I leave this open for the got any concerns?

364
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:07,720
But this is the first this the first day, first week really it was go back a bit.

365
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:12,680
So there's some core competency essentially of this class.

366
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:18,160
Right. And this is a comes but I was also brought into my thoughts as well understand the

367
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,290
role played by bacteria to help in to say that's going to be obviously a big thing.

368
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:26,479
Right that's the big overarching and to understand how genetic transfer mechanism

369
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,890
can lead to bacteria with increased virulence and antibiotic resistance,

370
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,070
that's a kind of a cool topic area right now.

371
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:48,620
I mean I was it last year I think they will have Neisseria gonorrhea you can kind of guess was associated with why that actually looks like the is

372
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:59,030
now cause antibiotic resistance to the drug of last resort in the words if you get a particular type of that organism it's actually kind of disease.

373
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:06,440
You could actually get it treated very easily at all because it's now resistant to all the antibiotics you could possibly get to go to it.

374
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:13,489
And that's happening for a lot of microorganisms and from a anti-microbial standpoint as well.

375
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:18,510
And from a hospital standpoint, it's getting worse because no,

376
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,280
this wouldn't have big problems as far as, first of all, oversubscription poor stewardship.

377
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:28,219
But also companies don't want to do it anymore. So companies don't want to make antibiotics.

378
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:37,500
Why? Easier to make is more profitable to make informed decisions because the continuous

379
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:42,140
and taking that was an antibiotic is in situ several times in your life.

380
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:45,750
Yeah, that's actually pretty close to that.

381
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:54,230
Um, I'm, I'm guessing that because of the rate of antibiotic resistance, it's increasing so quickly that, like, you think that we can do it.

382
00:37:54,870 --> 00:38:00,540
I can see brainwave between you two going on here. We have all I could say all the same thing here.

383
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,010
That's exactly it. Basically, it's cheaper to make some.

384
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,370
It lasts for longer. And the chronic conditions.

385
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:12,600
And why would you make antibiotic antibiotics now but goes to becoming so resistant?

386
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,690
You had a product that lasted for ten years, wi fi, maybe even three.

387
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:23,010
What's the point? So the companies are very much moving towards, you know, treating migraines or,

388
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,340
you know, other kinds of interesting medicines, but not so much for antibiotics.

389
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:37,290
Okay. So that's a big thing. That's what the bulb is in helping them understand how bacterial toxins.

390
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:44,190
Oops, I got the job done. Is it possible to use genetic engineering for advertisement?

391
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:52,950
Yes. So you can look at genes where you have transposons and transposons.

392
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,210
So these are bits of do this is going to cook you right next to you.

393
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,020
There's actually DNA that can jump from position to position to position.

394
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:11,430
Okay. Again, I think if I stuck in too high brow, I want you guys to let me know because I want to make sure this fits effectively what happened.

395
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:18,649
But I'm aware that we hope to backtrack. But basically DNA can jump from position to some position and also can make circular,

396
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:26,640
like can be the form of plasmid, the bacterium that can actually allow for to carry extra resistances.

397
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,960
But when it's in the transpose, it jumps and takes to place in the DNA, you can actually jump into the middle of a gene and knock it out, disrupt it.

398
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:42,809
Right. I'm assuming that everyone's got some kind of level of genetics in here that makes sense that promoters and how the DNA at GC,

399
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:49,680
what kind of stuff why and the special abilities where everyone's like a little bit of microbiology fundamental basics, right.

400
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,090
So okay if you haven't, let me know my little advice.

401
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:58,230
You have two voices. You're like, What are you going to say?

402
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:07,110
First off, I collect mouthwashes from all around the world. You should see every university what you see in it.

403
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:16,440
The other thing is I collect books and I get books going all the way back to the 1800s of microbiology, biology, stuff like that.

404
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:22,170
And so my office looks like literally, literally about just like a book about what's going on.

405
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,930
There's just books everywhere, something really old.

406
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,550
And one telling you this is because if you don't understand something, I'm going to put a book for it.

407
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:38,790
So, you know, genetics, toxins, whatever it might be, I can get you a bit of background information to help complement what you're learning.

408
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:48,600
Don't be afraid to ask. So. Okay, then understand public health approaches to preventing bacterial disease.

409
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:55,049
So anti-microbial is a big thing here. I am going to take some things, my other classics and it brings in the Higgs.

410
00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:00,270
I think it's hiding beautifully and actually adapting in a class to fill in the blank and

411
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:04,860
understand how antimicrobials kill bacteria and how bacteria become resistant to them,

412
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:08,250
the actual mechanisms and the selection pressures, that kind of stuff.

413
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:15,540
So really, if I could do X, I'd give a big broad catchment area, then I start doing a little bit too deep.

414
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:24,950
I'll try and limit myself. And of course, you know, we will go go through this as well as we can.

415
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,740
I'm actually looking forward to this. Okay. So grading assessment.

416
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,919
So there's Epic 560 and public health for 60.

417
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,530
This is not me that came up with this. This is Kamala's. Again, he has used the same process.

418
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,940
So basically it comes down to a points thing said. So that's why it looks slightly different.

419
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,850
And the reason why I think it's different is because I 60 has two papers involved.

420
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:55,049
Right. So let's try let's start at five, 650 6560.

421
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:01,410
So it's a typo. You design two papers as opposed to you all have one extra piece of work that makes sense.

422
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:07,290
So it skews, messes up this sort of the percentage allocations, but that's basically what we're looking at.

423
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:12,340
Okay. Any concerns about this? Okay.

424
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:21,970
Hope so. The homework quizzes we usually have at 3 to 4 and I try to gauge it too I think would be cool as we go through progress.

425
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:25,840
So I might say to you, I took this class, this neighborhood quiz on this.

426
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,380
That makes sense. I will give you lots of advance warning.

427
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:38,139
You know, like a week or two weeks notice. I'm not that kind of person and I will also try to mix it up.

428
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,990
So we'll do so. For example, I've got one on motivation.

429
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:51,400
It's actually really fun. I'm getting like a fool cooking it so cool. It's using bacterial toxins to treat other diseases.

430
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,630
So it actually comes from ranked in my history.

431
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,320
I told you, I came from the NIH was at the NIH. There was a lab across the corridor.

432
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,439
Jason was his name. He was a technician in there.

433
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:08,740
I knew the professor and Steve Steve Lab that he's taking anthrax toxin and guess what he's doing with it?

434
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:18,980
He's killing cancer cells with it. So he's actually engineering anthrax to go into your body,

435
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:26,420
produce the toxin that actually recognizes and binds to cancer cells to then kill those cells and know the cells.

436
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:35,330
How cool is that? So the paper is actually the criticism that I give you a paper, you take it home, you write something, you don't send it to me.

437
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:43,250
That kind of stuff, which you think is kind of sweet as I'm going through, but I think you'll enjoy it.

438
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:48,980
Okay. Academic honesty. Simply post.

439
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:54,320
Just stick to. Don't plagiarize. Don't obviously cheat.

440
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,280
It's not worth it. It really is not.

441
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:05,150
So it is quite a silly promise for everyone involved. So if you've got any concern, just be open to.

442
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:10,980
I got this text from a paper, but I don't know how to explain it better than they actually said.

443
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,340
How can I make sure they quote it correctly?

444
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:21,050
So those who disagree, I say I'm more than happy to help it out to explain to you how to reference something.

445
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:25,220
Correct me if you have a quote, 20 minutes of things, diagrams.

446
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:28,970
I don't know if a few of you already said you're interested in going to research.

447
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:36,650
That's a huge thing nowadays. Copyright. I'm happy to sit down with you, but I will do thinking about it as we get closer to doing papers,

448
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:41,030
I'm more than happy to sit down and talk about issues and how do you properly reference things?

449
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:46,820
People. I didn't see that trading when I was an undergraduate.

450
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:52,760
Anyway, I got to a level, but I think now times are changing so it's good to have information.

451
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,390
Happy to help with that as well. Okay.

452
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,600
And then homework. Okay, homework. So essentially I'm in late.

453
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,970
You didn't tell me why I have to do something about it.

454
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:12,080
But if you are sick, if you can't do something, just let me know and I'll be like, That's fine by me.

455
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:19,340
If you if you think you've got COVID or you've got RSV or you're your family crisis, just let me know.

456
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:23,700
I'll keep it in confidence, you know, and great.

457
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:27,860
And be and we can adapt accordingly.

458
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:31,190
Okay. Um, I think it's nice.

459
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:35,030
It's not a super huge like 70 person class, so we should be pretty cool.

460
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:40,100
Okay. I'm also very aware that you might get overcome with other work.

461
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:47,490
And again, I'm all ears, so I'm more than happy to help and take into consideration people like to quiz in the same day and that kind of stuff.

462
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:51,400
Oh, that reminds me as well, the midterm and things like that.

463
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:58,250
And we can move that date around a little bit. So once we get closer to it, I might say, okay, is this date still happening with everyone?

464
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,680
Logically, can I say, yes, we're good with it.

465
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:07,960
But if it's not and it's like, Oh no, these other classes need to have on the same day, I'm happy to be okay.

466
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:14,030
Anyways, I know that's what I want to say is we've all come in from different schools,

467
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:17,810
different levels and trying to be accommodated, accommodate as best as I can.

468
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:22,820
Okay, well, I see. So we've done that.

469
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:27,050
Now it's time to the accommodation as well and think about things.

470
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:34,520
I actually really like diversity inclusion because actually represents part of my research.

471
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:39,530
I'm very big on community, community and my causes in it.

472
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:44,690
But I think of biofilms is microbial cities like the place you are going with this.

473
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:48,530
So those are typically multi species bathrooms.

474
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:54,020
Different always comes from different places, different abilities, different perspectives, if you will.

475
00:46:54,350 --> 00:47:00,230
Different excuse about different cultures and.

476
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:09,930
How we work together. Okay. And I give you us not only as walking, talking bathrooms, but a community of bathrooms within the bathroom.

477
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:14,350
What I'm trying to say. I'm making the fun of this is that we should be respect for each other,

478
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:22,570
where we should be working together for a common goal to do well in this class and understanding the core concepts and we are developing.

479
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,930
I'm hoping your enthusiasm for the subject matter. Okay.

480
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,410
And I we want to help you develop that.

481
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,880
I think it will really help you based on what you told me, for your future careers as well.

482
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:43,450
And that comes not only from me just thinking about this class, but also from my background, where, as you know, there's a lot of colleges in there.

483
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:52,450
Right. So I think it's always good to have an Indian be, say, a jack of all trades.

484
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:57,790
You know, basically all have be basically you have a bit of an image of.

485
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:01,479
So that's where I like that to happen.

486
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:09,940
And then, hey, I want to be a safe, accepting, kind, considerate environment for us that have that how that sounded.

487
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,740
So and I am more than happy, you know,

488
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,060
to be if you ask questions and I don't understand to basically try and figure it out and the

489
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:22,989
people in the here to see if we can figure things out and be accepting and be open to saying,

490
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:28,240
I don't know, be open to saying I'm not too sure and be accepting that everyone has different perspectives on things.

491
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:33,010
Okay. Any questions? Okay.

492
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:42,580
STU Well, well-being and accommodations, obviously, if you have any accommodations, just let me know and we can figure that out.

493
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:48,370
What I will ask is by next week, get things sent to me as soon as I can and start planning things.

494
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:56,639
That's always a good time to midterms. You know, if people need to have accommodations and I obviously keep obviously working with

495
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,990
people that need this sort of things and well-being I should of this bit as well.

496
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,440
It's a crazy world out there has been for a good few years.

497
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:13,450
There's some stuff happening in this world that it just boggles my brain and makes me very sad that it be things my European bit now,

498
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:25,020
my Ukraine was happening, that it be COVID, all these terrible things and obviously ever working so hard, family and so forth.

499
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:29,080
If things are going wrong for you, you're not on your own.

500
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:33,370
Okay. Certainly is affecting your work.

501
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:40,300
Reach out to me and more than I'm here or is. And also there are resources on campus as well.

502
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:43,900
So put this in here and don't be afraid to ask.

503
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:51,220
And we all go through tough times. You know, you've all been there and, you know.

504
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:58,030
So please feel free to reach out and reach out to the that the wellness groups on campus as well.

505
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:03,010
Any questions? Okay.

506
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:08,860
So I put the what intermediate level questions, intermediate and level of microbiology.

507
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:16,270
I'm where some of you there may be some teaching on that area, there might be some biology.

508
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:24,010
But obviously I'm thinking that if you're struggling, you should identify pretty quickly and I can help.

509
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,760
Okay. I'm not entirely.

510
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:34,450
I said a couple of you have said the classes, the 311, wasn't it. How many of you did not take that class task?

511
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:37,650
So three of you. Okay. So you're not.

512
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:42,450
Don't worry. We're going to figure this one out. I understand it wasn't done last year.

513
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:47,200
Something is going to go. What happens to me now? You got canceled in the last year.

514
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,010
It just wasn't. Okay. So I spoke to Jillian.

515
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,610
I think I've corresponded with all of you. I think some some have some.

516
00:50:54,820 --> 00:51:01,210
So and I also went into the pharmacy pharmacy Super ten, so you might have less as well.

517
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:02,980
We're all coming from different angles.

518
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:09,819
I'm trying I'm going to study mixes up a little bit so there'll be bits that you struggle potentially with struggle, challenge.

519
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:16,380
You'll be challenged with some other age. You could be like, Oh yeah, I got this dental microbiology play a bit more of that example.

520
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,219
When we talk about toxins, you may be in this trouble, public health issues, you might be stronger on that.

521
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:25,150
Page 47 try to say here. So what I'm trying to say, we won't introduce.

522
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:28,330
We all know it's a diverse group. We'll try to figure this one out.

523
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:32,260
Okay. But my understanding is you need this class for next year.

524
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,350
I might as well just tie together that of of prerequisites.

525
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:40,959
How does it tie counties and by sort of a British.

526
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,220
I didn't finish Daniel this but. Jillian The Congo. Jillian Yeah.

527
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:49,240
Yeah. So she was helping out with that. So you can give it a thumbs up.

528
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:54,970
Let me know if you struggle. Okay. And then microbial physiology and what is this?

529
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:58,960
So I'm guessing everyone is Marcellas, the hippo membrane, that kind of stuff.

530
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,670
And then microbial genetics, obviously similar to humans nested.

531
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:10,720
There's some really interesting elements that are different. I've taken the human element out of this microbial and it's headed down a little bit.

532
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,690
And then biochemistry carries infectious diseases. Really, these can be swapping in and out.

533
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:20,530
Basically, that makes sense and trying to breath in there.

534
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:29,590
And that's what I'm going to try and go with this. So is it any concerns, weaknesses or concerns about anything right now?

535
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,460
Okay. All right. Okay.

536
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:42,410
So we asked for you. Let's go through. Some basic gent was torn apart for, what, 15 minutes?

537
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:48,590
Yeah. Just get some words out there. My grandfather always said to me, no, the glossary.

538
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,839
Okay. Remember, that is if you're not situation the words. Regardless, this gets Coleman White in white man.

539
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,330
Look him up. Okay, so we're going to test these words together.

540
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:04,010
Colonization, colonization, ability and in the microbial world to invade and multiply within the host.

541
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:12,710
Fiction portray disease. When an invading microbe does damage to the host that we say, it causes disease.

542
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:18,919
So just start slowly build up and then we'll then then crash back down again and build back up again.

543
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:23,240
This idea of these classes going to try and do it, especially like an infection.

544
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:30,320
This is sometimes used to mean colonization and sometimes used to mean disease.

545
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:36,320
Okay. If you're a doctor, a medical doctor, you probably mean disease.

546
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:42,230
Okay. Okay. Um, and if you're a microbial ecologist.

547
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:48,050
Yeah, more colonization. You've got it back. But it's arguable.

548
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:52,310
Okay. Basically, it means you've got a pathogen that is causing problems.

549
00:53:53,020 --> 00:54:01,700
It gets funky because guess what? In all your mouths right now, you've got a bacterium that will cause gum disease and eventually lead to your gum.

550
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:05,900
Your teeth falling out. But it's not doing it.

551
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:12,650
Now, I know it's only a six day swim to four, six, eight and 12.

552
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:16,280
Yeah, about 7 to 8 of you will have teeth getting walking.

553
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:21,830
I mean, these are current strategies because that always will develop and become stronger over time.

554
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:25,240
These numbers will increase to take a stronger size.

555
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:30,110
Its numbers will increase to other organisms, which will have a greater effect because your immune system can't keep it down.

556
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:40,160
Right. So you could argue you are infected right now, but you also could argue you're not because you haven't got any disease going to this.

557
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:45,650
So it's kind of a tricky subject, tricky word. I don't mind how you use the word infection very bluntly.

558
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:52,190
It's as long as you define it in some way or form. Totally fine. Any questions on that?

559
00:54:54,130 --> 00:55:00,440
No, no. This is a quiz and there's lots of words on here, but if you read it, it'll make sense.

560
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:06,860
So I'm just going to read it for a minute and I'm going to talk about it. Said what is balanced pathogenicity.

561
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:12,110
This is a really important thing is to look at it and explain it.

562
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:26,430
It's actually very simple, but lots of words get carried away. Then with an extended recession.

563
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:59,710
Is that your face going to soften? And this one slide sums up two papers, by the way.

564
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,640
Should I go it? Okay.

565
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:19,170
So badass gen pathogenicity, generally successful microbial parasites compounds.

566
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:27,150
I think that basically takes things away from the host tend to take what they need from the infected host without causing too much damage.

567
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:33,750
Okay. So back to that thing, the amount of poison penalties he's put from gingivitis.

568
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:42,390
Cool name, by the way, or for most in your life, Sanjay, how important a game, isn't it, to get like a magical spell?

569
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:50,759
Anyway, the point is that it's it doesn't want to cause too much damage because it exposes the host to lose all their teeth.

570
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:54,810
How they're going to eat. They could die. Right. Extreme scenario.

571
00:56:55,050 --> 00:57:02,790
There's other works that I guess in a minute. But most organisms that are living in our bodies that cause disease actually don't.

572
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:08,790
There's no benefit to killing your wife, because if they kill you, what's going to fix that organism?

573
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,990
Right. It's like a sinking ship. Okay.

574
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:19,080
If you if you get on board a ship and you decide a pocket full of holes, it's going to is going to drown the ship and drown you.

575
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:24,750
So there's a selection questionnaire for people, not plug holes.

576
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:29,160
We should apply to not holding ships, the Centers for Microorganisms.

577
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:34,560
And a classic example here, using has no effect on reality.

578
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:40,290
So the classic example here is actually utilize urinary tract infections.

579
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,880
That happens in men and women. More towards women, especially now with age.

580
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:51,810
But how does it actually happen? In some instances, it's e coli or E coli does it causes some problems?

581
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:58,500
I'll get this later in the class and it went away in mice causing problems when do analyze causes and problems when doing it.

582
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,580
And it's all about trying to succeed and spread around the, you know, tract, the bladder.

583
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,180
Okay. So it doesn't want to kill you.

584
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:12,120
It hides from your immune immune system and breaks out.

585
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:20,880
And he wants to the same happiness for issues as beneficial microbes that pathogenic ones and mean kind of like this this balance moves all the time.

586
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:32,700
Okay. And basically microbes is becoming sort of attuned to having a good way of being for better word, better words, better parasites.

587
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:38,070
Okay. Because it makes there's no evolutionary advantage to killing the host.

588
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:46,440
Okay. So so prevention is too crippling or raises fatality rates.

589
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:51,680
There will be a reduction in numbers of the host species and consequently numbers of the microorganisms.

590
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:57,990
Thus, although some bacterial species cause disease and the majority of those infected, most are comparatively harmless,

591
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:05,400
either causing no disease like parent disease right in the early stages or only a small population of those infected.

592
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:12,970
So for example, with content with a second genetic identification here, there's an organ even better names than from gingivitis.

593
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:18,270
This is a mouthful. My daughter is seven years old and she always asks me to say it because she thinks it's magical.

594
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:23,700
And so I guess right now, at time of bacillus aggregating back to X, how do I see ten common times?

595
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:29,940
It's a tongue twister, especially with the longest named organisms out there, and it causes juvenile periodontitis.

596
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:34,350
So general population gingivitis does, but only a small population of children.

597
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:39,900
Okay. So it's good because right now it's not good at all.

598
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:42,120
It's terrible. But the point is, it's good what it does,

599
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:49,230
because it basically gets every cause disease in every small subset of the population in the system all the time.

600
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:53,370
That makes sense. Have you heard that before?

601
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:57,280
No. Just quick question, Chris. Fellows class.

602
00:59:57,570 --> 01:00:01,830
Yeah. So you probably avoid that always and say, but anyway.

603
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:09,690
Yeah, of course we. Well. Okay. So well-established infectious species generally have a that is pathogenicity,

604
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:15,660
causing minimal damage compatible with entry, multiplication and discharge from the host.

605
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:21,510
In other words, when it goes in and it's there and it leaves, it's not causing much damage, much worse.

606
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:24,840
But it's just that it can come in. It can go. Doesn't do much.

607
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:33,870
I should also note caveat there or else little reminder that bacteria can on its own these

608
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:38,790
other ones that your host is good to get into some next lecture hope full of wonderful,

609
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:42,690
wonderful diversity of organisms. Okay. Okay.

610
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:49,420
And there's a paper hit I'm going to upload and again, emphasizing you don't have to read it, but it is really piques her interest in you.

611
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:55,860
Whenever I know a cup of coffee or cookie and will stay up late night brains concepts of them have a read of that.

612
01:00:55,860 --> 01:01:01,110
And actually I was saying as boring as you found interesting but I'm saying it's common is things that really get your your thoughts going.

613
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:07,880
There's an alternative to this, though, and that is that actually there are some organisms that do.

614
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:11,260
Not adopt a balanced pathogenicity act, if you will.

615
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:16,840
Okay. What I mean by that is there are some that remain extremely, very good.

616
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:20,740
It's my way of saying extremely good, and it's usually contingent.

617
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:27,460
You see, if that transmission dynamics and epidemiology coming in now are such that they're

618
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:34,330
typically efficiently transmitted to a new host prior or in spite of a death of the host.

619
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:37,550
In the words the death, the host won't impact it. It doesn't matter.

620
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:43,660
So two examples. If severe pestis was associated with anyone.

621
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:48,580
Plague. Plague. Craig, you don't want to play just me.

622
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:54,400
It was big. It was big in the Middle Ages and wiped out a certain amount of people.

623
01:01:54,700 --> 01:02:02,590
It was one in four before. One in five population was wiped out and it was all down to this flea.

624
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:05,980
And the three carries this bacterium you see near pestis.

625
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,640
So it just happened, the three bites, it got transferred.

626
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:15,390
And in humans it killed humans. But it's home, if you will, indigenous place.

627
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:19,660
It's basically it's naturally occurring within the flea.

628
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:23,860
So it's just that A is taking it.

629
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:29,230
But it didn't have it happened so quickly and it happened. They didn't really didn't really adapt, if you will.

630
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,700
The hosts don't intend to do so, basically.

631
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:37,870
So that's one instance. The other one. So the hope is in the flea.

632
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:44,140
The other one is the home is in the soil. So this is anthrax, bacillus anthracis.

633
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:53,120
Bacillus anthracis can form spores just like the spores that can hide for actually hundreds.

634
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:56,420
That's 100 definitely ten, 50 decades, maybe a hundred decades.

635
01:02:57,970 --> 01:03:07,540
And when the animal dies from it, it pours, the ground decomposes, the bacteria go into the soil.

636
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:11,440
They hibernate until another animal comes along, start chomping on the infected grass.

637
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,180
It gets infected all over again. This is part of a cycle.

638
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:22,030
So does it matter that it kills the host? No. But this part of the cycle, does it make sense?

639
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:27,590
Okay. Am I going too fast as this? Cool.

640
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:37,170
Yeah. The question is playing that lead to the fleet itself or is it just that becomes just epic to us.

641
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:42,049
So it's got to balance packages to the fleet and that is home especially.

642
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:46,410
I think they were hoping that, but not to us. And the fleet doesn't know that.

643
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:52,350
It just wants to bite people by animals and things like that. So.

644
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:58,030
The question is questions 5 minutes.

645
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:06,310
Virulence factors these attributes properties the bacteria that allow it to overcome the host events and causes.

646
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:11,350
These are things the bacteria can do or produce or something.

647
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:18,580
Does that make sense? I do not know where to invade to make a building scratch with something that it does or it can produce.

648
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:26,080
So the various factors of this according to who here?

649
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:31,850
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They tell you that they always come down. It produces toxins.

650
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:36,190
That's a business factor. It's able to form really stupidly thick biofilms.

651
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:40,750
That's another virulence factor, a factor that allows it to cause disease.

652
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,379
So makes sense. And it can be a bacterium.

653
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:50,260
It can be it can be related to the the other thing that it produces.

654
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:51,670
Okay.

655
01:04:52,720 --> 01:05:05,740
Now, I put here the expression of various factors often should be regulated by the bacteria, this ability to produce toxins, ability to form biofilms.

656
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:13,790
Now, here's a little twist to that story. I use this word and invented verbatim.

657
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:18,910
Just the use of user points that was used doesn't actually mean this bacteria are not stupid.

658
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:26,320
What I mean by that is obviously there's no intelligence that we're trying to say is there is a recognition

659
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:32,380
of the environment they are in and they will do their thing depending upon the environmental conditions.

660
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:37,300
So if you grow pseudomonas with your nose in the lab,

661
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:45,340
it won't form the same kind of biofilms and won't produce the same kinds of toxins that it would do if you put it in someone's love sewage,

662
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:52,830
which you know, causes cystic fibrosis, which it kills individuals probably associated and cause and kills individuals cystic fibrosis.

663
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:56,210
It also is the one that causes chronic wounds as well.

664
01:05:56,230 --> 01:06:06,880
So if you get that in your skin, even within that, it'll start forming a thick goo and you wouldn't want it to be there for weeks, months, years.

665
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:22,480
Okay, we'll cover it at that time. To give you an idea who's heard of Christopher Reeve when he was Batman us super close.

666
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:28,130
Batman. Superman, right? Christopher Reeve was the Vision 80.

667
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:42,210
He was the start of the whole DC Universe high volume movie, but DC Universe Story and Bush's Weakness Kryptonite.

668
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:49,240
So in the sequence, the story, well, the twist, the story is kind of sad, but it pushes the point for this class.

669
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:57,580
Christopher Reeve kind of riding accident, broke his back, was paralyzed, and he survived by a decade, I think about a decade ago.

670
01:06:58,270 --> 01:07:01,270
And he died in chronic wounds. He was paralyzed.

671
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:08,050
He had to keep this pressure. It's things that basically we sit down, we actually can't move back to numbers and grow up.

672
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:16,570
And essentially there's there's biofilms that's formed of pseudomonas which makes and broke the skin barrier spread around his body and killed him.

673
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:21,780
There's actually a paper there, I'm mad that says, but Superman's Kryptonite.

674
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:31,150
And it's all about making awareness of how microorganisms can change their expression and cause these terrible diseases if given the opportunity.

675
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:36,100
So in the lab they haven't really got the opportunity. But anyway, that environment, they have more.

676
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:39,370
So it makes sense. That's why I put that bullet point in there.

677
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,850
So we're having great things in the lab isn't always the same as being in the house.

678
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:47,679
I mentioned I bet early on that's one of things we try to do to actually mimic the

679
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:57,579
host of that kind of cool thing to interest thus pathogenic bacteria grown outside

680
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:01,690
the host of the misplaced very different phenotypes when they are in the in the host

681
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:10,030
otherwise it actually has no it's something as well I should mention that biofilms.

682
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:14,680
This is what listing down here is, by the way, the image in 3D.

683
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:25,030
This is a scene in which my lab and my socks hang a little bit now into the hospital of I'm going to go into medicine assay for of very severe use.

684
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:35,200
If we finish it, we will. Although normal host defenses are adequate to control, many organs are very low virulence immunocompromised patients,

685
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:46,090
whether that be cancer treatment or injury or with another disease, are freely infected by virtually non pathogenic organisms.

686
01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:52,240
Okay. So relatively speaking of the relative merits of that organism because the disease is low.

687
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:55,690
But. The individual's immune system is terribly shot.

688
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:59,980
So these are normally not considered pathogens of becoming pathogens.

689
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:03,070
Does that make sense? Classic example.

690
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:11,180
Again, don't remember these organisms names and just really cool words and thoughts by finger bonus and that Sartorius finger bonus post.

691
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:21,590
Willis These are freshwater organisms. The if you drink it every day, it will be in the water at about 10 to 5, 10 to 5 cells per meal.

692
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:29,830
So many problems. But if you are really sick, they could potentially cause problems.

693
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:35,170
Okay. That's why, for example, has been really interesting or pictures here.

694
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:42,820
You use more text down there, opportunistic pathogens in which to me showerhead biofilms there's time to realize that.

695
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:46,660
So I live medica citizen here now.

696
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,380
But you do love your showers and I have I love my boss.

697
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:54,490
I would argue bath is more healthy than a shower. Why is what do you do when you go to shower?

698
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:59,170
You turn the tap on. All is fluid comes out full of bacteria.

699
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:02,120
What do you do. Hello. Has a lovely behind every shower. Right.

700
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:07,540
Are you inhaling those organisms and that's where they're are now concerned in the hospital environment.

701
01:10:08,110 --> 01:10:09,849
I can't be an example myself in the shower,

702
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:18,190
but now you got my point is that you've got this situation whereby these organs can be exposed to you shouldn't really

703
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:23,860
cause disease are immunosuppressed it will cause disease not only in the shower is going to show me the pictures.

704
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:34,390
You've also got this situation whereby simple surfaces, infected microcosms and as a patient or is that a doctor or a nurse or a health practitioner?

705
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:38,290
You touch that the transfer of the patient, they can be in trouble.

706
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:47,350
Okay. And really, that's why you have things like this scattered around the building, that sort of code, similar concerns, but also in hospitals.

707
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:51,530
Okay, this is contains but certainly ammonium compounds that you think I did yesterday.

708
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:54,470
And in a class I say similar.

709
01:10:54,900 --> 01:11:04,480
So when an organism which causes infection say it always in which causes an infection, when a breakdown of normal, the defensive occur occurs.

710
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:11,470
We refer to this an opportunistic pathogen. It doesn't cause disease and unless is given the opportunity.

711
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,420
Okay. Any questions?

712
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:24,290
William Black said he was like one minute shy of 10 to 3:00.

713
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:29,480
She finished that today. Yeah. And what is people going?

714
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:37,009
I said, we're going to have as much as I can. I think the next lecture slated to be on June 22.

715
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:44,990
So we're pleased to finish or just nearly finished the slide deck, the next lecture, maybe a lecture hall, but we'll keep on going.

716
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:48,650
How nice to talk to you first. Okay.

717
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:54,440
Yeah. All right. Well, thanks, folks. And, well, have a lovely weekend.
