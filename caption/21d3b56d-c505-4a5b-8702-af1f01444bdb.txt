1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,470
My name is Christine and this interview is with Jason Glick.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,660
Yeah. So let's begin. So what?

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,260
Why are you interested in this position? Well,

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,020
I'm interested in this position because I'd like to start my career off at a place that has excellent safety culture and kind

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,450
of doing my research on the company and also talking with various folks who have had positions in the company in the past.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,840
I think that this will be an excellent start to my career.

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:34,410
I'm interested in becoming a certified industrial hygienist, you know, probably from two years down the road when I am eligible to take the exam.

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,350
And I think being in a workplace that has such excellent safety culture and can expose me to a variety

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,350
of different elements and hazards and fiscal agents that affect the workers and being able to

10
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:52,530
work in that situation where I can evaluate those hazards and implement necessary controls and also

11
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,320
do a lot of analytical tasks focused on evaluating the hazards I think will be very important.

12
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,180
So that's why I'm interested in this position.

13
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,710
As you know, it would be a great learning opportunity for myself and I think I can contribute a lot to the company.

14
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,890
Okay, awesome. And what are some of your strengths and weaknesses? Well, my strengths.

15
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,570
So I think I have a really good technical acumen.

16
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,909
You know, in the past, you know, I've taught courses at the University of Michigan just on professionalism and public health.

17
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:25,139
But also I feel like I've done a great job when I was an M.D. and led a PowerPoint presentation

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:33,960
and a Global Health one session that focus specifically on Bayesian decision analysis.

19
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,550
I'm currently registered that decision specialist through the air,

20
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,560
and I think I do have a good technical acumen when it comes to analyzing data, but also when it comes to sampling.

21
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,139
Before I came back to the University of Michigan, I spent two years as an industrial H.A. where, you know,

22
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,630
it was boots on the ground evaluation of hazards during renovation abatement and demolition projects.

23
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:02,640
So I was really in charge and tasked with overseeing occupational health and safety with construction workers right out of college.

24
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:09,210
And I think it was great experience and I think that's some of my greatest strengths is just the sampling and the data analysis side of things.

25
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:17,510
As far as weaknesses go, I think, you know, it's kind of a work in progress, you know, with, you know, just kind of being self-aware with everything.

26
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,450
You know, I think my emotional intelligence has grown over the years.

27
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,549
You know, I've kind of seen how when I first joined the workforce, I could be very passive aggressive.

28
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,880
And I want to communicate with folks, especially when there's a problem, an account, just like,

29
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,870
you know, my teeth and bite down, you know, just trying to, you know, work through these issues.

30
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,469
But I've come to learn that, you know, this is something I'm still working on, you know?

31
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,890
And I think, you know, I have improved a lot in terms of emotional intelligence.

32
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:47,670
But one thing that I think I do need to improve on is just kind of celebrating the victories that, you know, kind of are present within the workplace.

33
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,839
I think it's just so easy to get this habit of thinking about what's next.

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,979
You know, like after you can complete a project, you know, what are we going to do now?

35
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:02,879
What's next? There's not much time that I spend kind of reflecting upon, you know, the victories, you know, that we've had in the workplace.

36
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,070
And I think that's something I'd like to work on.

37
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:11,790
My minister was just kind of taking the time to have a reflective attitude and kind of work on past experiences.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,380
I'm awesome. And why should we hire you over the other applicants?

39
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,610
You know, I think my experience is really what kind of ties everything together, you know,

40
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,390
having two years of work experience before going back to college, in addition to,

41
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,990
you know, working at having over the summer in a manufacturing setting.

42
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:33,420
I think it applies perfectly here. So I think, you know, I kind of have the upper edge, you know,

43
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,930
just like the different certifications I've had in a different way and the wide array of experiences that I've had in the past.

44
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,110
I think that's what kind of gives me the upper edge and the upper hand.

45
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,580
And also, you know, with this master's degree combined with like the technical acumen,

46
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:53,610
I'm sure my references can definitely vouch for all my experience and, you know, all of my knowledge kind of surrounding workplace hazards.

47
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:59,370
I think I'm a perfect fit for this position. Awesome. Well, it was nice speaking with you and getting to know you work.

48
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,380
Thank you so much.
