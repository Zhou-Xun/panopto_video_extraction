1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:07,580
Living in a particular painting puts me in a certain frame of mind to kind of create the behaviors I want,

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:16,500
which there is absolutely no expectation that we're going to be places.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,960
I was really, really lucky. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I just feel so good up at that time.

4
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:41,880
It's like there's a time when I was like, Oh, and now she looks like.

5
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,920
So I think I was reading it.

6
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,200
Oh, that's a that's a dress up for, for next year now.

7
00:00:49,230 --> 00:01:03,590
Oh, sorry. I don't know. I find that everyone, I think accepting the exact thing that you want.

8
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:13,410
Would you dress up as much as you want?

9
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:19,350
I want to be sure that it was a set of kinds of considerations.

10
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:41,210
The harder one for me. Another line that the government is ultimately going to do anything.

11
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,290
Interesting. Thank you for sharing that with me myself.

12
00:01:51,090 --> 00:02:05,890
This is a perfect man. I would certainly like to know where she comes.

13
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,940
Is it good to see you?

14
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:29,330
Well, obviously that's the case now.

15
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:38,360
And I have to tell you, I think sometimes I think that's what I was.

16
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:45,270
I felt this way before, like watching them anywhere.

17
00:02:45,740 --> 00:03:01,410
Yeah, but it's a very funny.

18
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:13,440
Yeah. I think we need to go back to my hero.

19
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,490
Oh, they're all gone by.

20
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:31,410
It's like a lot of our vision.

21
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:42,100
30 or 40. I just have a few more people coming inside.

22
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:51,540
So Thursday is workshop day and brand new, your whole draft of your decision?

23
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,970
Any questions as you started thinking about it? I was thinking about it, etc.

24
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,790
Topics that you're like, Well, could I do this? Could I do that? If you're on the fence, I'm happy to have that conversation.

25
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,310
Questions about what's needed, questions about what's not needed. You can come on up.

26
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:24,590
I need advice. Back to table at the table is going to be more than the most important thing of what you create.

27
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:37,040
Make sure to bring risks. It's not all of those features all under the table don't separate them.

28
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:45,770
And you're integrated into one of two.

29
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,360
You don't have to do much set up, but you do need to do a little bit of setup again.

30
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:58,650
Again, the mindset of what you're thinking about here is imagine this is the take home summary thing that you just had the discussion for.

31
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,930
So like with the intro could be, you know, as we discussed today,

32
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:10,200
you have a choice between five stuff set up the basic choices, lead them into the table.

33
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,660
You don't have to do a whole lot of of summary.

34
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:22,370
I'm not asking you to do what you would do in a full goes, but it does include things like a values clarification exercise to go there if you want.

35
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:34,480
But that's not the critical piece for. Make sure to break apart the dimensions of the choice.

36
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:45,760
So don't organize around the pros and cons, organize around measured risks and features.

37
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,610
How often do you need to take this or how long will your recovery be? Or What's the chance of success?

38
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:58,860
Or What's the chance of headaches like that level? You've got several good templates to work from.

39
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:11,210
I know what I'm talking about that let me know if I get one of the templates I gave you is the APA neuritis decision aid tool thing,

40
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,250
which violates one of the rules I just said for a very specific reason.

41
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:23,300
So if you look at the table on it, it lumps all the side effects of steroids in one row.

42
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,580
Normally I'm saying don't ever do that. Why can't that one get away with it?

43
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,300
What's the choice? Literally.

44
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,440
What's the choice there? You're right. No steroids.

45
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:47,680
The side effects of no steroids. There are no side effects of not doing something.

46
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:52,270
But that's the only reason you can get away with doing that in that case.

47
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,710
If this was an A versus B in which there were multiple there were side effects on both sides.

48
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:03,850
You could not do that. But you've got to be able to look on a given road to facilitate the comparisons.

49
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:14,370
I've talked with people about a variety of different choices. One, happy to talk with people about what you're considering.

50
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:26,550
But again, just narrow it down to two things. Don't get sucked into the three or four second comment, if I can take any other questions on this.

51
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:33,510
Yeah. When it sounds like the table may have embedded graphics or like refer to graphics on other pages.

52
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:46,800
So the question of graphics, um. In the broader set of possibilities of what you might do, it is possible to embed graphics and tables.

53
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,110
It is rarely done because of space constraints.

54
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:58,730
You read one page of the paper about a couple of weeks ago in which there was embedded graphics, and that's basically what happens.

55
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:10,070
That's unusual. Usually, I would say you refer out to focusing graphics on the situation to make a specific mode.

56
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,660
These are the numbers that you most want somebody to focus on.

57
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:20,760
It's difficult to give people graphics for all their options times ten or 12 things like being.

58
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:28,450
This assignment is not really about graphics if it makes sense to put them in.

59
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:35,650
That's fine. I'm more focusing on your ability to gather all the information together in that summary.

60
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:45,710
If you're pulling data from a specific study, how do you feel about like the citations that you don't?

61
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,460
I have given you permission to make up the numbers.

62
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:55,640
I'm assuming that you are using references to make your understanding what the relevant dimensions are.

63
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,640
Plausibility is what, etc.

64
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,680
But I'm not drawing a distinction between whether you know that this number is right or not, or which study you're using, etc.

65
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,500
This is an assignment about information organization, not information accuracy.

66
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,470
In a real world decision making.

67
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:24,830
You usually have a reference page at the end of the whole document, citing the sources that you're giving for your information.

68
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,240
And you would probably note the way in which you may have had to.

69
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:38,990
For lack of a better term massage the data. So. You have a clinical trial.

70
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,460
A clinical trial only has a certain number of people with a certain age range or a racial background.

71
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,060
You're creating race, you know, estimates based upon that.

72
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,470
You're manipulating that data to try to adjust for factors.

73
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,110
You know, almost all decision AIDS are not literally reporting exactly what was done in the trial.

74
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:03,020
They are the best estimate the authors could create of what the risks or what the benefits are.

75
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,940
So that's why there are author documents that you are actually using.

76
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:17,750
Making a judgment call in terms of what numbers are different patients. Other questions arise.

77
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:32,909
But again, reading bring copy copies because, you know, ideally, I want to see essentially good first drafts, maybe things that need to be tweaked,

78
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,950
but don't be halfway done because you'll get a lot better feedback when people can see the whole set of stuff.

79
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,460
And I will be circulating a lot about that.

80
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,870
And what I hope you'll find is it'll be really interesting to see the different problems if you are working

81
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:53,550
on in the ways in which this same kind of template format needs to be adapted from one context to another.

82
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,750
That's the other purpose of this assignment. All right.

83
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,990
So today is sort of the last big discussion day about this.

84
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,950
Trade offs and decision making, etc.

85
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:14,700
And there's sort of three broad topics that I brought up here, although we canvased between them and two other factors.

86
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:21,330
One is screening tests and the broader questions associated with do you get screened or not?

87
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:27,660
And How do we think about policy? What is the issue of genetics and the role of information?

88
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:34,110
When do we want that information? Whether or not all that information? And what is the role of particularly race?

89
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,599
But we can talk about this in the context of many other variables,

90
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:48,959
and we will see the ways in which these socially constructed variables either should or should not be incorporated in our estimates of risk,

91
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,790
in the way in which we talk about certain characteristics, all of which are not easy choices.

92
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:03,300
Like, I want to lay this right out from the start. There's no obvious answers for most of these, so feel free to have a different perspective for me.

93
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:10,650
Have a different perspective than some of your fellow students. These are all cutting edge questions that we wrestle with in this field.

94
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:16,120
And I wanted to get us here so that we can think through what we what do we feel about these kinds of issues.

95
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:28,750
To start, however, Ariel, you were talking in your museum about an experience you had in terms of screening.

96
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,389
And I think I remember it was your dad who was sort of like, wait, why are you doing this?

97
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:39,280
And and let's start there, because that's the conversation that many people are having about different types of screening.

98
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:46,540
Yeah. So I was going to get screened for cervical cancer or my doctor recommended it.

99
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,950
And my dad, who's also a doctor, he's a pediatrician.

100
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,479
Under his like school of thought. He was like questioning, like, why are you doing a screening?

101
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,809
Like, that's not really necessary for someone your age.

102
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:06,440
It's not really recommended as well. Okay. But my doctor recommended it and so.

103
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,500
That was like the first somewhere, like had this like weird dichotomy of like questioning my dad,

104
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,340
who usually I just, like, listen to for medical advice and like my own doctor.

105
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,240
And, um, and then I got the screening, but.

106
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:29,769
I didn't realize that there was like differences in the medical fields about whether or not I should be in that screening at my age and everything.

107
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:35,440
So. So what was the story that you heard from your father in terms of why you wouldn't be screened?

108
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,160
What was the argument that you took away from that conversation?

109
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:50,169
I took away that, like based on like what research he had heard about screening for cervical cancer.

110
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:56,550
It wasn't necessary at my age and that like it wasn't really a risk to me at my or like that.

111
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,740
It was unnecessary to get the greeting at my age because of how unlikely it would be.

112
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,649
So the mental model here and this is why I'm probing this mental model here is that we have

113
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:13,170
an association between the age of the patient and the likelihood of cancer developing.

114
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,420
And that when we're talking about younger patients, that it's not that I can't help them,

115
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:25,410
but that is sufficiently unlikely to happen, then it doesn't seem worth it to screen for it.

116
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,240
Now, I'm going to be extreme here for a moment because I think it's a bit worth acknowledging this.

117
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,020
If screening costs nothing, had no side effects, had no time burdens.

118
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:47,410
Why would you ever not scream? The argument against screening for younger people.

119
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,460
Is a resource argument. It's a burden argument.

120
00:14:54,010 --> 00:15:01,309
It's as. It is not worth as long as the probability gets really unlike small.

121
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,490
So it's unlikely that you're going to get a true positive hit.

122
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:13,670
Then. You don't scream because it's too much work, is too much effort, etc.

123
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:19,310
And the second piece of the argument is we're not that good.

124
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,930
Let's put it bluntly, we're not that good in our tests.

125
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:29,869
So if you screened any really young because it's so really unlikely that you

126
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,470
would actually be having cancer or whatever it is that we're screening for.

127
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,540
The odds that the positive result somebody gets is a false positive and that also has its

128
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,680
own sets of problems associated with it are high enough that we don't want to do that.

129
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:55,470
But I want to acknowledge right from the start of this conversation, there are people your age who have cervical cancer.

130
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:06,300
They exist. You can find them. And if they happened to have their cancer caught through screening, their lives may be made better for that.

131
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,660
So when we don't scream. Those people are harmed.

132
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:20,660
The problem is we can't find them. So that's the heart of the problem here,

133
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:26,540
is that you can't find easily you can't know who is the ones you've got to find versus who is the ones you don't have to find.

134
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,880
So. Let's keep talking about this.

135
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,750
So, Emily Johnson.

136
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,060
Yeah, you were talking about breast cancer screening and different racial rates of it.

137
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,420
Mm hmm. And I thought this was an interesting point to bring up at this point.

138
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:53,990
Yeah. So in my hometown, there's, like, an increased rate of, like, breast cancer and women.

139
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,729
And a lot of people are like, oh, my gosh, that's a lot of breast cancer.

140
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:05,180
Like, why looking for something in the water? And it's because it's like a wealthier town.

141
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:14,840
And these women have increased access to screenings and so they're catching a lot of smaller cases earlier.

142
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:22,639
And so I was just, like, thinking about, like. Like, Oh, my gosh, they caught like so much.

143
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,030
But like, how many other women, like, are getting like, false positives?

144
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,900
And that's just like a lot of screenings. Yeah. So notice that.

145
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,759
You don't know how many false positives there is to talk about those.

146
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:43,010
Very. And even worse than that, what we really don't know is how many of those women.

147
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:49,230
Have found answers. Things that we have labeled cancer.

148
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:57,740
Let me be really precise here. That would not have grown, would not have killed them, that would not needed to have been found.

149
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:04,880
In other words, had they not had the mammogram, they were their lives would have proceeded without impact.

150
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:13,640
We never know that because we can't do the counterfactual of, Hey, I found this person.

151
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:22,720
And I know that, you know, we can't tell whether that person's cancer is going to grow kill versus sit there and not.

152
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:30,460
And while this is pretty true in breast cancer, the cancer for which this is super salient is prostate cancer.

153
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:38,900
Prostate cancer. Most prostate cancers, not all, tend to grow very slowly.

154
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:45,370
Basically what I've heard is if you take the autopsy of an 80 year old man,

155
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,950
odds are if you go hunting in their prostate, you will find prostate cancer regardless of what they diet.

156
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,500
Pretty much everybody gets some degree.

157
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:06,190
But and it does kill some men, but way fewer than those who actually have it because the cancer is growing so slowly, etc.

158
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:13,530
So the question of do you have cancer is not the same as will your cancer grow with your cancer end up affecting your health?

159
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,270
So. Do you screen for it?

160
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,260
Isn't just a question of changing your survival.

161
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,540
It's a question of changing your identity.

162
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:36,830
Once you get a mammogram, once you get a positive biopsy for prostate cancer, etc., you are a cancer survivor from that moment.

163
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,700
You go to the American Cancer Society or other cancer advocacy organizations, they are very explicit about this.

164
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,030
You are a cancer survivor from the moment you are diagnosed.

165
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,250
So we change some of his identity when we screen somebody and give them a positive result.

166
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:07,680
That. Okay. So the hardest thing I asked you to read was the Welch article about epidemiological signatures.

167
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,420
But I want to touch upon that article because it makes a really important point.

168
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:24,430
The main point it tries to make is if we look historically at the patterns of this

169
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:33,160
sort of cancer patterns of diagnosis versus mortality for different cancers,

170
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:42,129
you end up with a lot of different patterns that really are some patterns where we

171
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:47,890
find stuff we treated and people get better and mortality goes down as we find more.

172
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:53,620
But there are also cancers where we find a lot more of it.

173
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,830
And mortality doesn't change a bit. Thyroid cancer comes to mind as a as an example of this.

174
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,000
You find lots of thyroid cancers. We change mortality?

175
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:11,040
Not much, if anything. So what's the purpose?

176
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,580
Of finding these cancers if we're not actually rooting the mortality needle.

177
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:24,560
You get to spend a lot of money. We get to give people lots of therapy. Is it worth screening for thyroid cancer?

178
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,110
And in fact, you can see geographic distribution differences.

179
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:35,770
And remember, off the top of my head, I believe South Korea in particular screens for thyroid cancer on a regular basis.

180
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,970
Incidence rates in South Korea are huge for thyroid cancer mortality.

181
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:50,890
So why are we doing it? What should we be doing? Which goes back to the question I asked at the beginning.

182
00:21:53,750 --> 00:22:04,790
What is the purpose of screening? I push this this idea in this class because public health.

183
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:11,670
Tends to be had a sort of narrative of screaming is a good thing.

184
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:18,629
We want to get as many people screened as possible, and I don't want to minimize that.

185
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,670
There are absolutely populations for whom screening absolutely makes a huge difference

186
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,080
and that there are disparities upon populations in terms of who get screening.

187
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:33,240
There are real, substantial and important to address, and I'm not in any way arguing that.

188
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:39,460
The benefit, for example, of getting your first pool and osteopenia at age 50 or 45.

189
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:44,860
Now, I guess because they are the changes is huge. Absolutely huge.

190
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:52,510
Not only because you document whether or not you have cancer at that point in time, but because colonoscopy.

191
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:02,360
Is its own risk predictive prediction tool. If you have a colonoscopy at age 50.

192
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:09,979
And you don't find any polyps. No evidence of any growth.

193
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:21,049
Anything even approaching half your future risk of developing colon cancer is way lower than it is.

194
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:25,610
If you have that first colonoscopy and you see anything, cancer, polyp, whatever.

195
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:33,560
And in fact, in a number of European countries, the cancer screening guidelines differ from the U.S.

196
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:43,850
Those countries. If you go for your first colonoscopy at age 50 and you have no evidence of cancer, you're not going home, don't come back.

197
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:53,629
You're done. It's a very different model that says that it was screening test isn't about do you have

198
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,720
cancer now it's about predicting whether you're going to have cancer in the future.

199
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,390
We distinguish between the people who need to come back for further screening versus those who don't.

200
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,440
That's hugely valuable. There's no question of the effectiveness of that type of screening.

201
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,300
But when we reel it back, like, why are we doing colonoscopies on 30 year olds?

202
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:22,530
Part of the problem, the aerial product? Well, there aren't that many people who are having cancer that early.

203
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,180
Could. Without having.

204
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:34,200
So keep on going on this theme, Emma.

205
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,420
Yeah. No, not. Not you other Emma.

206
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:46,290
Yes. You were talking about ADHD and screening for the issue in the ways in which

207
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:51,850
they're disparate from disparities in the way in which we screen for ADHD. That's another conversation we need to bring up here.

208
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,350
Yeah. So it's like a lot like girls versus boys, kind of boys.

209
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:01,579
And to be over screened and overdiagnosed from the beginning and then girls don't

210
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:06,620
get recognized until like they're adults or their early twenties or whatever,

211
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:15,950
and until they're under screening because of the way those symptoms and like present themselves and the two different sexes.

212
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:23,629
And so yeah, kind of stuff like that, how we do it because they also need different treatment maybe.

213
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:31,820
And so, so part of the reason I wanted to bring up this example is it's worth making sure we talk about.

214
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:40,839
Screening as a thing you do at a particular point in time, not based upon the symptoms, just based upon, okay,

215
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:47,710
you've turned 50 or you've been a certain point in your in your development type of stuff versus what you're talking about,

216
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:59,590
which at what point do we allow someone's health or symptoms or behavior, etc., to trigger a, hey, we should check whether or not you have this.

217
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:05,170
So ADHD falls into that that domain depression falls into that span.

218
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:14,079
Oh yeah. Issues often fall into that space in terms of people get screened for cardiac arrhythmias

219
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,030
and things like that based upon symptoms and characteristics rather than based upon,

220
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,630
okay, you're 50, we're going to do X cancer.

221
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,770
We tend to be using age based screening structures.

222
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:33,580
You start screening at age. Yeah, I think about different guidelines.

223
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,830
Sometimes there's different cutoff points. But if you want to talk about, say, colorectal cancer.

224
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:44,160
You're going to start screening at 50, maybe 45. What?

225
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:50,670
When you had. You may know she is there in it.

226
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:59,330
That's a better feminist question. When? When should you stop screening for colorectal cancer, if ever?

227
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:09,070
If I know what the guideline is. It's age 75 or if your life expectancy is less than ten years and it's correct.

228
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:16,090
Now I'm going to have a little side conversation about the two different choices that you just brought up.

229
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:21,850
What's the difference between those two and what does it say about the way in which we think about risk?

230
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,710
So if you stop screening at age 75. First of all, I just want to ask this question.

231
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,660
How many of you knew that there even was an end point?

232
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:38,880
You did anybody anywhere like. Not sure they had ever been told that.

233
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:47,100
What am I going to get myself out of? One of my biggest pet peeves about the way in which cancer screening is discussed

234
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,480
in the United States is that most of the messaging is all about starting,

235
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,840
and we never actually tell people, you're going to stop at some point.

236
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,890
I have, I know multiple research projects that have gone and talked to older adults about stopping screening.

237
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:08,900
And you tend to get one of two responses either.

238
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:19,780
All good. I never have to go through that again. Or B, how dare you take this thing away from me that is saving my life?

239
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:25,630
Moral outrage. What?

240
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:33,510
Because that's the message that we have often told people is this screening will save your life.

241
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:38,340
This screening will save your life. The screening will save your life. We have not talked about the potential risks of it.

242
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,500
And if we're talking about something like pornography, where you're going to go under sedation,

243
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,240
where you have a possibility of perforating your bowel. There are real risks there.

244
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:57,150
So what's the difference between stopping screening at age 75 versus life expectancy?

245
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:06,320
Who gets screened and who doesn't? So if you stop at age 75 that says you don't care whether or not somebody has

246
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:11,150
got multiple health conditions and is likely to die within a year or two,

247
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,130
or they're in super great health and are still running and might live another 15 years.

248
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,940
What's the benefit of screening? You find the cancer?

249
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,100
Even if you find a cancer, it's going to take years for it to actually kill you.

250
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:32,520
So if your life expectancy is short for other reasons, you essentially get no benefit from catching the cancer.

251
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:44,190
I happened to be working with a doctoral student here in Fiji whose research project is people,

252
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:49,950
both clinicians and patients attitudes about life expectancy as a guide for cancer screening.

253
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,409
And what she's finding is that both sides, both clinicians and patients,

254
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:59,420
have a lot of variance in terms of whether they understand the idea that life expectancy

255
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,260
should influence whether or not to screen and whether they're even willing to talk about it.

256
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:14,090
But it's the same thing as the opposite side. Yes, I can find a 40 year old who would benefit from having a mammogram.

257
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:22,500
But we don't have to do that. Yes. I can find an 80 year old who would benefit from having a colonoscopy.

258
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:29,780
But not all. And so then the question becomes, how do we how do we break that choice down?

259
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:41,430
All right. I want to go next. Let's at least finish up this thought, Cindy.

260
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:49,409
I know you were talking in your musing about tensions you were feeling between sort of over screening and public health messaging.

261
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:52,350
And we've touched upon that a little bit. But did you want to add anything more on that?

262
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:57,090
Yeah, I was just thinking like I like I feel like with all our public health messaging,

263
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,130
we just kind of like everyone should do this, like because there's so many barriers to screening.

264
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:09,170
It's not like you're not going to have messaging out there. That's like this mammogram could cause discomfort, but you should do it anyway.

265
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,620
Like they're going to have they're going to be like, we should get. I mean, that's all I worry about when we start, like,

266
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:17,700
messaging about giving people a choice that's going to be even more barriers and like, less screening.

267
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:22,540
And it was a hard. Like to be in my head.

268
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:33,390
So you. I asked you all this. There's an important tension here.

269
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,930
Does anybody think that a or all Muscovy is comfortable?

270
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:48,530
No. So it's not like. We think that there are.

271
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:57,020
People are happy to be doing this, but there may be emotions associated with it and positive ones, and that's a good thing.

272
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:05,060
But there certainly are negatives to. Why are we afraid of acknowledging that this?

273
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,840
There's a real answer to this, but I think it's worth most wrestling.

274
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:19,170
Why are we afraid of acknowledging that screaming is a trade off and not an unambiguous, obvious win?

275
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:30,240
Yeah. I mean, think about this a whole class, but do you think at some point screening just becomes a way to get people into the doctor?

276
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:40,910
And especially people would go to the doctor otherwise, you know, you need a mandatory reason to bring them in.

277
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:47,569
Maybe. Although honestly, at the current point in time, I suspect it works more often the other way that people know that they do for screening

278
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:51,070
and they don't want to have that conversation with their doctor and they're afraid of it. So they don't know.

279
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,320
They don't get other kinds of preventive health stuff as a result.

280
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:57,980
Right. I mean, the causality could work in either direction here.

281
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:10,790
But if it's really the case and it is a tradeoff, of course you're going to face some risk by having that's what you're going to face,

282
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,630
certainly some discomfort from having that mammogram, etc.

283
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:22,840
If the village that are we undermining the public health message of this is a good thing to do.

284
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,260
I can see this both ways. I have my own personal thoughts, but I'm actually curious what you guys.

285
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,350
Yeah, I know. It's like undermining the public health message.

286
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,750
I do think that like just speaking from personal experience,

287
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:44,639
like I don't think I was like well trained or like I'm not well equipped to have those conversations because I think,

288
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:50,820
like so much of medical training is teaching the algorithm and like telling people you need the screening.

289
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:56,010
And like maybe we had like two or three conversations about like, you know, prostate cancer specifically.

290
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:00,480
And then we talked about like the comparison between prostate cancer screening and mammography.

291
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:04,350
But at the end of the day, like no one's changing their clinical practice based off of that.

292
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:08,850
And I think there's so much emotion and so much like anecdotal evidence from seeing patients

293
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:13,530
who have successes through screening that like that keeps reinforcing that behavior.

294
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,950
And then you you do end up feeling very strongly a certain way.

295
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:25,439
And it's kind of hard to have like that very balanced conversation with a patient when you kind of have your own feelings and perspectives on it,

296
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,290
which I know isn't correct, but I think that happens a lot.

297
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:34,560
So first of all, let's acknowledge what you're describing, like the stories that are there.

298
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:42,010
Is the person you screen who find something who has it removed or treated?

299
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:47,140
Who then lives a positive life? You have lots of positive associations with that story.

300
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:55,889
They're easy to find. What we don't see is the people who go through all of that burden of treatment but

301
00:34:55,890 --> 00:35:00,000
never needed to because you can't tell whether they need to be treated or not.

302
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:08,640
What we don't see is the people who is the burden of the people who go through all of that screening and have nothing happened to them.

303
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,910
So that that exists. But it's hard to pin down.

304
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:19,410
So over screening, it's really hard to feel a lot of emotion about.

305
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,430
Like it's easy to feel emotion about the screening stuff that finds people in science problems.

306
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,220
It's hard to feel emotions about screening that was unnecessary.

307
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,120
Acceptance of the cumulative burden, which is part of the reason why.

308
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:44,810
Had you read that letter from the epidemiologist about her frustration, about feeling like she had been pressured into screening?

309
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:51,780
Throughout her life, despite knowing the science about the limitations of the benefits of screen.

310
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:59,079
You know, that's not a naive perspective that somebody who actually understood the science and

311
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,190
still because of this of the way in which this plays out in our health care system,

312
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,730
ended up being screened for things literally that she didn't want to be screened for.

313
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:14,379
That specifically mentioned the three that happened in the Southwest Reservation where

314
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:20,740
they're screening for bloodwork on this and then they use their blood sample return testing.

315
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:28,270
It says yes, got out. Yeah, it's 99 and three and there's two.

316
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,459
I mean, there's there's so many layers to this.

317
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:38,470
Like there are clearly missed cases of misuse of data collected for one purpose, then reused for another.

318
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:46,299
This is certainly one of them. There's been lots of discussions around the use of the blood spots collected for newborn

319
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:51,970
screening and the ways in which that data is being used or not used for its original purposes,

320
00:36:54,220 --> 00:37:03,010
to the point in which some states have had to destroy vast databases of blood spots that were collected,

321
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:09,550
essentially that for without clear disclosure of the purposes to which they were going to be used.

322
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:19,389
I don't want to minimize that, but I also want to separate from it in the sense that the real heart of the problem,

323
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:24,670
I think I want to wrestle with today is it's not that I don't know when my doctor says to me,

324
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,490
Hey, do you want to have a prostate screening antigen test?

325
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:38,590
Why it is that they're doing I have my father developed prostate cancer at 69 or something like that, which is not early but certainly salient.

326
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:49,210
I have some degree of family risk. I also know how poor PSA screening is as a in terms of sensitivity.

327
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:54,240
And thus far I have chosen not to get screened.

328
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,610
And until this technology changes, I don't think I'm going to change my mind on.

329
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:12,050
And I know. Then at some point I may get diagnosed and have the experience of knowing, well, what if I had gotten screened and got this early?

330
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,220
That is the risk that I run by taking this pathway.

331
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,150
And I'm telling this story because I want to acknowledge that we don't like regret.

332
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:32,440
There's a lot of decision making that is about regret, avoidance and screening plays into this.

333
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,420
Like, it's easy to say, Well, I'll just deal with the short term burden.

334
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,600
At least this way I know I will have done everything possible.

335
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:48,500
Like I'm using that word very intentionally because that's usually the way it comes out. But there is a burden.

336
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,400
And if it's not, if you don't feel it on an individual level,

337
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:57,859
ask yourself how many billions or trillions of dollars get spent every year on

338
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,860
cancer screening in the U.S. and what we could do with some of that other money.

339
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:09,669
Because it's a lot of money. And this is the tradeoff.

340
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,999
Like different countries may draw the line to different places.

341
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:22,570
And essentially, except in a societal level, certain types of people developing things that might have otherwise been caught in exchange for.

342
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:27,770
The resources redirection of the effort.

343
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,850
Away from screen into other things. And whether we think about that.

344
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:41,010
That's the problem of screening. And I don't think there's any simple answer to this.

345
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:48,690
I gave you that paper by Gill Welch about you have to gamble with your health, which will come back to at the end.

346
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:54,060
Intentionally. I mean, I'm being provocative because I want you. That's not the language we usually talk.

347
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:58,710
I know he is like, hey, yeah, let's, let's, let's play a game.

348
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,700
It's the cancer screening game. Let's roll the dice and see what happens.

349
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:08,760
No, that's not the way we talk about this stuff. And yet.

350
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,710
We're really doing is we're choosing between a pathway of.

351
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:19,470
More testing, more chances of false positives, more chance chances of doing things we didn't need to do.

352
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:26,229
Versus. Avoiding all of that and the potential for regret, the potential for wondering,

353
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:29,920
could we have prevented something that would have been addressed had we looked for.

354
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:38,049
You are going to have to make your own choices. My choices.

355
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:42,640
Thus far, I have been very proactive in terms of colorectal cancer screening.

356
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:45,580
I do not anticipate doing prostate cancer screening.

357
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:55,180
And I and there's a little piece of me that's like, man, you're going to kill yourself someday if that comes back to bite you.

358
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:05,620
But that's where I am at the moment. I do want to add before we move on, I do want to say on this topic, I do want to come back to this issue of age.

359
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:14,879
You brought up the sometimes it's based on age based guidelines that now many of the guidelines are moving towards,

360
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,190
basically saying it should be based on life expectancy.

361
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:29,340
What I wish existed in the public health discussions of cancer screening, but as far as I can tell, pretty much does not.

362
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,200
I wish that when we started talking to people about, say, colon cancer screening.

363
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:42,469
Instead of saying, Hey, you're a FIFO, you should go get screened. We would say, hey, you're 50.

364
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:45,740
You've entered the age window when screening is recommended.

365
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:55,420
Why is that different? Because by saying it as a window, it implies that there's an end.

366
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:08,400
I would love to run a 30 year clinical trial in which we randomized people to different ways of talking about pornography when they're 50.

367
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:11,790
And then we measured what they did 25 or 30 years later.

368
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:19,330
And how they felt about whether they should be continuing the screening or not. It's impossible to say.

369
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:28,660
But from a risk communication standpoint, I think there's a fundamental difference between saying that somebody's screening is a good thing.

370
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:38,200
Go get go do it. Versus screening is a thing that makes sense at a certain part of your lifespan when the benefits outweigh the risks.

371
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:43,300
And there will come a time. When the risks outweigh the benefits.

372
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:49,780
And just to close this loop. Why is that story hard?

373
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,860
A mental model people have of cancer, which, by the way, is not wrong. We started with it right at the beginning.

374
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:08,510
Who gets cancer? Older people, your chance of developing cancer regardless of type is higher as you age.

375
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:11,340
The mental model.

376
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:18,600
That mental model says, well, if your chance of getting cancer is higher as you age, shouldn't you be more likely to get screened the longer you live?

377
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:29,489
You have to have a more complicated mental model to understand the risks of screening, preparation,

378
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:34,860
anesthesia risks, the false positives, etc. before you even understand why you would ever not screen.

379
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:42,810
And that's part of the reason why this is so hard is that we have to set up that conversation if we want to have people discontinue screening.

380
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,230
All right. So let's transition from there about the generic questions.

381
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:55,950
And Amy, you were talking about this in your musing, and it's probably as good a place as any to start.

382
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,530
But, you know, there are situations in which.

383
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:11,070
Learning genetic information is. Complicated, powerful, but at least lay a few of them out on the table so we can discuss them.

384
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,720
Yeah, there's many situations on star escapes.

385
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,880
One that I wrote about was Huntington's disease. Testing that we have for it is really great.

386
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,590
Like an article is talking about something fantastic.

387
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:31,540
But this one becomes really complicated. It is one that we test once they are adults.

388
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:38,529
So after the age of 18, but if you are 18 and decide to get that information, there's a lot of implications for yourself in that.

389
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:45,970
Like if you were to test positive, do you move, it's coming and like not knowing when or what that's going to look like.

390
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:55,260
And then we also run into a lot of complications where individuals want to know their status because they're like grandparent or something horrible.

391
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,160
Maybe their parent doesn't want to know.

392
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:03,110
But since it's autosomal dominant, but if that child were to get that information, that tells you the status of the parent.

393
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:10,850
So, yeah. How does this.

394
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:19,300
So let's let's unpack this more like if you ask people in general like would it be helpful to know your genetics?

395
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:28,210
Most people's general response is going to be short. How could knowing more information about me be a bad thing?

396
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:33,739
And you're alluding to one type of like, if I know that something bad is going to happen,

397
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,920
then I have to have that bear, that sort of psychological burden of it.

398
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:46,860
What are other domains in which learning something about your genetic risk would have negative consequences?

399
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:51,200
I could think of a couple, but I want to throw this out.

400
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:58,200
One of the examples that might come to mind in terms of what information you actually get negative that you wish you wouldn't have known about.

401
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,760
So what is the it's going to happen to me. And I have that dread kind of ignorance.

402
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:06,920
What else? Yes, in some situations.

403
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:16,310
So now it's the uncertainty problem. So it's not I know what's going to happen to me because I have no idea what this means.

404
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:24,060
So there's a psychological burden of I know I'm not normal, but I don't know what that means for me.

405
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:29,080
That's certainly an issue. What else?

406
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,170
Yeah, well, cause unnecessary concerns and.

407
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:39,250
And fears. So that's a essentially an overreaction story.

408
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,490
Like, I find out something that makes me.

409
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:54,660
An adage My life, maybe that I engage in a bunch of behaviors may be that I avoid doing things because I have fear that proves to be either

410
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:02,910
unnecessary or just the risk isn't actually proportionate enough to justify the degree to which my life has been changed.

411
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:07,780
Okay. So that's that's another story here. What else?

412
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,870
Knowing that you are at higher risk.

413
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:21,229
Your guidelines suggest to start doing the screening to effect the script for screening story and a lot more screening.

414
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:24,880
And it could come with the lowest cost of risk out. And.

415
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,389
So there's two pieces there. One is the you might engage in all of those behaviors and maybe you didn't need to.

416
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:35,520
And the other is maybe you didn't need to.

417
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:44,730
But those things come with their own sets of burdens or costs or risks, etc., which essentially you have to run, but you didn't want to be wrong.

418
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:50,610
All right. Any other ideas? Yeah, I'm thinking like parentage.

419
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:57,690
Something that might change your identity. You know, knowing your parents are so.

420
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:06,450
So heritage. You're thinking of that angle, not implications about family planning decisions, which is its own thinking about that, too.

421
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:09,930
But I know actually it was a thing you could test for science.

422
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:19,530
Well, certainly there are. Many types of genetic knowledge which might influence people's choices about whether or not to have children.

423
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:27,460
Like Down's syndrome and stuff like that, or recessive conditions where you discover that your partner may also carry them.

424
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:32,319
There's a variety of ways in which that can play. Yeah, super hot topic.

425
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,560
But you can screen when babies are in utero.

426
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:38,650
Yep. Decide whether to terminate the pregnancy or not.

427
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:50,780
Yeah. So. I put that in a special place, not just simply because we're talking about pregnancy termination, but because we're talking about.

428
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,890
The really complicated ethical question of one hour,

429
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:06,300
even if you are comfortable on an ethical basis with pregnancy termination, how one draws that line.

430
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:12,900
Because the knowledge that a fetus has X, whatever X is,

431
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:23,340
does not translate into automatically a knowledge of what that child's life might be, how acceptable or unacceptable that is, etc.

432
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:27,269
So there's its own human space there, which I don't want to minimize,

433
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:35,729
but I've got to move away from just because I want to talk about the larger question more in the adult space of like when we have a choice,

434
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:39,550
do I get this information or not? Other times.

435
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:48,670
Yeah. What about, like, insurance issues? Sometimes people can say that, like, there's implications for finding out about things earlier,

436
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:53,500
especially if you're, like, in between insurance providers and, like, a new policy or anything.

437
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:59,320
Right. So I do not claim to be fully caught up on the current legal situation.

438
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:09,320
Genetic information. But. Certainly the concern exists if you have knowledge about your genetics, which by the way,

439
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:14,600
is not actually that different from if you have knowledge about other environmental risk factors,

440
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:20,150
behavioral risk factors that are like the more knowledge that you have of things that might predict risk.

441
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,690
To the extent that that information is shared with an insurer,

442
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:31,400
that insurer may then use that information to predict things which might make them more comfortable or less comfortable insuring you.

443
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:41,540
By the way, I'm going to detour briefly because there's a non non-genetic story about information that

444
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,170
I forgot to tell you back when we were doing mental model stuff that's relevant for this.

445
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:49,910
Remember the dioxin study that I read about you guys write about?

446
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,000
I don't remember if this was clearly stated in the paper.

447
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,390
I don't think it was the original exposure assessment study, but that's that the interview study that I did followed.

448
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:14,680
Gave homeowners. Choice as to whether or not they wanted to receive the results of whether or not there were dioxins found on their property.

449
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:22,340
Why would you not want to know if your property was contaminated with dioxins?

450
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:33,970
Well, it turns out. Now if you are the property owner and you know that your property has a level of dioxins above a certain threshold.

451
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:47,970
You are, you meet essentially the EPA's definition of a hazardous waste site and you are legally mandated to disclose it to any potential buyers,

452
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:55,950
which means your property values take. But if you don't know that information, you can't disclose it.

453
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:05,730
And so there were homeowners who chose not to know whether or not their property was contaminated to avoid the

454
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:11,160
potential of having to mandate to be disclosed required to disclose that if they ever sold their property.

455
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:20,470
The analogy comes up in the context of genetics. If you don't know whether or not you carry a particular gene, your insurer can't find out about it.

456
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:27,910
If you don't know whether you have it, then you don't have to change your behavior in result to as a result of it.

457
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:32,780
So that question is very salient in this context.

458
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:40,340
Now, I want to give you another case study in which not knowing might have actually made somebody's life better.

459
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:46,659
I had the opportunity a few years ago to work on a project that was doing the

460
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:52,989
whole genome sequencing of cancer patients who had had resistant cancers.

461
00:52:52,990 --> 00:53:00,100
Two primary treatments, essentially people who had gone through the standard treatments for whatever the cancer were was not responding well to that.

462
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:07,600
The whole genome sequencing to see if there were any genetically targeted therapies that could be brought to bear on their situation.

463
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:13,420
And I was doing some follow up interviews with patients who had gone through this practice process.

464
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:23,710
And I will never forget the interview I did with this one woman who had had very treatment resistant breast cancer.

465
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:29,770
And what I thought I was going to be talking about with this person was.

466
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:36,970
You know, how do they experience? Testing was useful to them, you know, was invaluable, etc.

467
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:44,730
What I experienced in that interview with somebody whose life had been fundamentally made worse by the fact of doing the testing.

468
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:54,740
What happened to this one? What happened to this woman was that she got tested and the test found several.

469
00:53:55,810 --> 00:54:05,770
Genetic markers that aligned with some experimental therapies that were currently being tested in several clinical trials.

470
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:15,330
And then she went to go enroll in those kinds of trials. And because of a completely unrelated condition that she had.

471
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:25,139
She was denied enrollment. So she went from the mental state of I have advanced cancer.

472
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:28,500
I'm not likely to survive. There are no I've done my treatment.

473
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:36,210
It hasn't worked. And sort of accepting her fate. To a state of incredible hope.

474
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:42,460
That she might be able to get into this clinical trial that had a targeted therapy that should be working for her type of cancer.

475
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:47,310
To absolute despair that she was not actually able to enroll.

476
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,630
And she absolutely regretted ever having been.

477
00:54:54,820 --> 00:55:02,230
She was like, I would have been so much happier. I would be like, my life feel fundamentally different right now if I didn't notice.

478
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:11,880
And the problem with that is from an informed consent standpoint, nobody did anything wrong.

479
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:23,399
We disclosed in the in the study that there would be potential for finding things that, you know, we would lead them to potential trials, etc.

480
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:29,280
But we obviously had no control over what those trials would do or what their their inclusion criteria would be.

481
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:35,370
The trial didn't do anything wrong. They had specific reasons for their inclusion and exclusion criteria related to the therapy.

482
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:44,560
But the combination of those two things, this person, by the act of getting her genetic testing results, was made fundamentally worse.

483
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:54,430
That story always sticks with me as sort of the cautionary tale.

484
00:55:54,700 --> 00:56:01,709
No, it's not always a good thing to know stuff. There's no there's not an easy answer to how you do it.

485
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:05,410
But from a disclosure standpoint, I always think about them.

486
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:12,359
We have to think not just about immediate things. Oh, I might find out I have cancer, but down the street, what am I going to do about it?

487
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,520
Am I able to do anything about it, etc.?

488
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:21,090
Are we being kind of biased here in that we're really focusing on the negatives when you could find out that you would be

489
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:27,090
at higher risk for something and then engage in protective behaviors that might actually improve your quality of life.

490
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:34,440
So am I being biased right now? Yes, I'm being biased right now because the prevailing narrative of genetics is that marriage.

491
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:40,180
Much of the story that already exists out there is the narrative of We could do this past,

492
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:43,970
but we might find out something and it might make you better at it. Absolutely true.

493
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:50,590
Not minimizing it to the least. I want you to wrestle with that choice every time it comes up.

494
00:56:51,900 --> 00:57:01,260
Because if you look at the marketing for 23 TV, you get that story at there's plenty of that story out there.

495
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:09,160
And it's always easy to find the cases of people who discover who that take protective behaviors or that

496
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:14,460
with them take behaviors that enable them to adapt to their situation and whose lives are made better.

497
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:23,250
Today's theme is trade offs. I don't want you to think cancer screening is an unambiguous yes.

498
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:27,510
I don't want you to think that genetic testing is an unambiguous yes. I want you to wrestle with the tradeoffs.

499
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:33,280
And to all that, it's not always been. Yeah.

500
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:43,780
One other trade off when people get screened for autism and then they eventually learn that they can't adopt them and that's being a sham.

501
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:48,680
Yeah, we haven't even gotten into the issues which at least one or two people raised in

502
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,250
your musings about the stigmatization of certain conditions and whether that.

503
00:57:54,410 --> 00:58:00,590
If screening is imposed, that means we're essentially assigning labels to people who wouldn't have otherwise had those labels.

504
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:05,420
So autism comes into this space very clearly. So it has variety of mental health conditions.

505
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:13,720
It's complicated. There's no easy answers here.

506
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:22,880
I want to we could talk about this all day long, but I do want to move on to the last major surprise today, which is about.

507
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:32,260
Race and other socially constructed variables and the way in which we fit those or don't fit those in to risk prediction.

508
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:42,110
I saw many people talk about this. Amber I know you talked about it and I know you talked about it.

509
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:50,120
Mark I know you talked about it. I will I will start the conversation going, but I don't want to pick on anybody in particular.

510
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:56,810
I know you talk about it. Let's start with the sort of broad issue here.

511
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:07,729
And it gives any you started to say like, what is race and should it be part of our prediction models or not?

512
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:10,700
Like, what is this thing that we are talking about if we're.

513
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:18,580
Making a different risk prediction based on and including something like race or ethnicity into our our model.

514
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:20,879
Yeah.

515
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:27,390
So I mean, that was basically my point was that like race is typically I mean, it has to be a standard for something before speaking biologically.

516
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:32,520
So then the question becomes like, what is it actually that's causing a difference that we're observing?

517
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:35,399
And then how do we how do we actually address that thing?

518
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:42,540
Because when we then try to take race out of a study and apply it into a clinical practice, you end up with just doctors a lot of time,

519
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:49,639
just like looking at a patient and making a guess or not making a guess or there's like a lot of discomfort around those conversations.

520
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:54,690
So I think it ends up being a really difficult variable to apply in a practical sense.

521
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:58,200
And then like a lot of the biologic, so like a lot of the,

522
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:05,250
the historical biases that are in all the GFR stuff that I think has been more like in the news, that's all based on science.

523
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:16,559
That was very. Racist and sketchy and sort of done on slaves without permission to make a point about this is all really racist and not good science.

524
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:19,980
And so then it just has persisted and now we have this.

525
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:30,720
So let's take a moment and ask what are. We're not going to complete it, but what are some of the underlying causal factors?

526
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:35,310
That. Raised might serve as a proxy.

527
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,970
Yeah. So. Oh, yeah.

528
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:43,410
So let's unpack even with that. So structural racism including.

529
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:50,090
Structures in terms of access. So there's an access line here.

530
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:56,410
There's lots of different ways in which structural racism have created differential access to resources, different access to care.

531
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:02,180
What else? Yeah. Access to information or knowledge?

532
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:07,430
Absolutely. So we have knowledge differentials. That is another part of this.

533
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:11,300
What else is going on? Yes.

534
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,810
So no resources brought in within.

535
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:19,430
That's income and all the things that might come along with that might come along.

536
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:24,540
So again, what I'm trying to unpack here. Job exposures.

537
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:32,880
So there are definitely associations with both physical environment and occupational environment to various health outcomes.

538
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:41,730
Race may be proxy for that in different contexts, but there's at least several other major domains we also need to lay out here.

539
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:46,800
What else do you think? Like the stress of dealing with that racism?

540
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:54,520
We've had the stress effect. What else? There's interpersonal component here.

541
01:01:54,520 --> 01:02:01,780
We haven't yet brought up the fact that in addition to these structural factors that are affecting one's underlying health,

542
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:10,450
there are the structural and interpersonal racism that may affect the way an individual is treated by the health care system.

543
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:18,760
So that may be in terms of bias, in terms of individual decision making.

544
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,190
Who gets treated and who doesn't?

545
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:31,980
It may be manifesting in expectations around, well, this person fits or doesn't fit the prototype for somebody who would have a particular condition.

546
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,349
And by the way, we can talk about this on race,

547
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:41,160
but there's certainly tons of gender effects for which that is a major factor of, oh, women don't get heart attacks.

548
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:52,350
Stuff is just as much an expression of sexism as anything else is that we see the disparities in treatment that manifest in differential outcomes.

549
01:02:55,120 --> 01:03:01,000
What else? It's not.

550
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:06,700
Parliament. We've got behavior, we've got access to care, we've got resources.

551
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:11,740
We've got underlying structural factors that affect the prevalence of certain types of conditions.

552
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:18,700
And repeat your question. I just want to. What what does race stand for?

553
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:20,950
If race is not an actual causal factor?

554
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:27,280
Like nobody actually develops cancer because somebody points at you and says you are white and you are black and you are Asian.

555
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:31,780
The act of slapping the label on somebody is not the causal factor here.

556
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:36,880
What is the factors that we are trying to represent?

557
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:42,870
If we're going to make a risk calculation or estimate based upon that.

558
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:46,380
I don't know if this exactly fits,

559
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:54,030
but I'm kind of thinking about this article a couple of years ago about how like like for a South Asian in particular,

560
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:59,309
like the historical South Asian body went through so many famines that like our bodies

561
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:04,500
react differently and are more prone to like cardiovascular disease and stuff like that.

562
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:16,840
So this is why I wanted to push this because. There are differential physical characteristics and historical characteristics associated with.

563
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:27,340
Populations that came from certain geographies. So you are describing a factor that is more prevalent in a population that came from South Asia.

564
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:38,950
We can think about. Skin cancer and amount of melanin in one's skin.

565
01:04:40,030 --> 01:04:44,380
There is a biological factor that is associated with where one's ancestors lived.

566
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:50,600
A natural selection with sickle cell anemia in the area.

567
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:57,890
Sickle cell is another one. Sickle cell serves a very functional purpose in an environment in which there are lots of mosquitoes with malaria.

568
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:05,050
It confers a disadvantage when you are outside of that environment.

569
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:12,560
Why am I pushing this part of the earth?

570
01:05:12,590 --> 01:05:15,140
I asked you guys to read. Raises this question of what was.

571
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:24,990
What is the argument for bringing in race or gender or other kinds of factors in the context of a risk prediction?

572
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:29,480
When does it help? It doesn't.

573
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:37,159
There clearly are situations in which we under treat African-American patients for

574
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:41,780
certain conditions if we do not take that into at least the population level.

575
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:54,700
But it's worth at least acknowledging what we're probably trying to pick up there is the structural factors, is the environmental factors.

576
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:58,380
Is the reality that on average,

577
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:06,420
those people who present who self report at being black are more likely to have those underlying

578
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:10,680
factors and that those factors need to be taken into account in terms of thinking about,

579
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:14,760
say, their risk of asthma or their risk of developing cancer, etc.

580
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:23,600
So now my counterfactual question is this. Let's take a cardiovascular risk calculator.

581
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:35,770
We're applying it to. An African-American female doctor who lives in Ann Arbor, who has lived in Ann Arbor her entire life,

582
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:43,810
who has the wealth and diet and environmental factors of this affluent, predominately white community.

583
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:49,870
But it is black and has lived these.

584
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,780
Effects of the structural racism in our society and the interpersonal relationships.

585
01:06:55,710 --> 01:07:01,020
When is that factor something that should be in that calculation?

586
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:05,930
When is that factor going to be harmful to that person? If we bring it up.

587
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:15,900
I. Yeah, I think it's really hard to say because there isn't we haven't done the work of

588
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:19,490
actually figuring out what variable it is that's having a meaningful impact.

589
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:27,210
So then looking at any specific example and saying like, okay, well like race is or isn't good here or race is doing more harm than good.

590
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:33,840
It's really difficult because you don't actually you don't know which element it is that you're actually talking about.

591
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:39,940
So you can't say like whether it's the lived experience of being black in America that's causing the difference at heart,

592
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:43,350
a meaningful difference in heart disease or if it's diet and.

593
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:48,110
Well, so I'm I'm going to be a little bit provocative here,

594
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:51,510
probably because I think I know what the answer is, but because I want us to wrestle with this problem,

595
01:07:52,110 --> 01:08:00,960
I think that's right for many underlying health conditions where we don't necessarily have to unpack the differential factors.

596
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:05,999
But I also want to acknowledge there are some circumstances in which we probably can zoom in on

597
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,670
certain risk factors as as the likely culprits and make it an appropriate decision based upon that.

598
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:17,099
And the example that pops to my mind which have been brought up, he's not here,

599
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:25,860
but I wanted to touch upon is the clear differential in black maternal mortality in the United States.

600
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:36,729
You have black women in American hospitals having differential outcomes than otherwise.

601
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:42,770
Similar white women in those same hospitals. We can push.

602
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:49,520
I mean, maybe there to some degree are underlying factors that bring that person into the hospital in a different state.

603
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:57,800
But it seems much more likely to me that the factors that are operating there are far more likely to be interpersonal ones differences of judgment,

604
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:01,160
differences in applications of treatment rules, etc.

605
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:07,190
And in that context, we might then be willing to say, Well, wait a second,

606
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:13,070
this is actually serving as a proxy for a factor that needs to be addressed in this context because.

607
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:23,550
If. It's not representing, you know, the weight of the person coming in because we need control for the construct as.

608
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:28,740
In other contexts we might say, well, wait a second, are we.

609
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,639
Is incorporating this variable.

610
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:39,960
And again, we're talking a lot about race, but we can apply this to ethnicity, we can apply this to national origin, we can apply this to gender.

611
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:46,690
These are all socially constructed demographic characteristics. Sometimes those factors are.

612
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:55,700
Pay attention to that is going to help someone and making them more eligible for appropriate treatment.

613
01:09:55,940 --> 01:10:00,440
And sometimes that's going to harm and we might have bias. We might intentionally say,

614
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:03,290
I'm going to be more willing to look at these factors or less willing to look

615
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:07,400
at them in certain contexts when I know what the potential implications are.

616
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:11,630
For treatment. Or for screening or whatever.

617
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,320
I wanted to raise this.

618
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:20,370
This isn't something I've been thinking about a lot about, and I haven't talked with you guys about one of the other hats that I wear.

619
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:30,390
What are the other things that I do in my spare time is I am the current editor in chief of the journal Medical Decision Making.

620
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:40,720
And earlier this year, we published a policy on this question.

621
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:48,330
I'll try to make this period actually read it. I think how to a bigger.

622
01:10:53,930 --> 01:11:02,640
Long title. But the basic principle here is acknowledging what we've been talking about right now,

623
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:09,690
that variables like race or ethnicity or gender or national origin are socially constructed.

624
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,840
And if they are socially constructed and we are transparent in our reporting of research,

625
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:21,360
then it is not enough to say I did a gender analysis or I did a racial analysis.

626
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:27,840
I need to know what it is you think you're measuring when you are doing that analysis, and so are.

627
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:29,930
Requirements.

628
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:40,270
Is that if you're going to submit a paper to our journal authors, including individual characteristic classification variables in models or analysis,

629
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:44,620
must clearly define what they believe the variables are measuring and what

630
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:49,420
hypotheses or research questions justify inclusion of those variables in the model.

631
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:59,800
So that we know whether we think what you are measuring is differential behavior by the doctor who is treating that patient.

632
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:03,309
Or differential access to care.

633
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:12,490
Or prenatal care. Or differential. You know, diet and environmental factors that have changed that person's health as they were entering, whatever.

634
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:21,970
We have to be transparent about what it is we think the risk factor is that is being manifested in this analysis.

635
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:27,770
Yeah. Yeah. So for another class, we actually for an article, it wasn't this one, but it was similar, you know,

636
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:33,210
kind of discussing the same ideas for I think it was a different general having similar requirements.

637
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:40,020
And I think a lot of times the problem you run into is unfortunately it's just been published studies,

638
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:46,319
it's kind of a data issue where kind of is the variable you have and yet it's clear that it is a social construct,

639
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:50,520
but then we don't have the kind of proxy, you know, factors that we're looking for.

640
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:52,799
So then I think that is probably a good solution.

641
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:59,850
That's what we talked about in our class, too, where I think it's appropriate to include it often because if you kind of leave it out,

642
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:03,179
then you're ignoring the, you know, structural factors that we're talking about.

643
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:08,190
But then diving into the nuances important and saying this is serving as a proxy for x, Y in.

644
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:14,220
State them rather than just not sitting at all or kind of having the implicit assumption.

645
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:21,220
As an editor, my answer here is I don't necessarily know what the right answer is, but I want us always asking the question.

646
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:29,770
Like I read, one of the things that pisses me off is people who throw in race and gender, etc. enter into analysis just because they haven't like.

647
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:38,390
Not like you want to have a hypothesis if you're running a test on this and if your hypothesis if you have a hypothesis, then fine.

648
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:41,600
Let's engage with that. What is it? What do we think we're measuring here?

649
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:51,080
And if you don't, then why are we creating the opportunity for to treat these things as if they are biological variables, which they are not?

650
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:57,410
Yeah. I should also mention that in developing this policy, we had lots of conversations about age,

651
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,400
which both has clear biological factors and a variety of things.

652
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:06,709
Say the cancer screening discussion we previously had and has lots of context in which

653
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:10,640
there exists ageism in ways in which people are treated differently based on age.

654
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:14,390
So there's a gradation there, but at least with age.

655
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:21,550
Age is a thing one could measure. Race is a socially defined concept.

656
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:29,870
Sorry. I wanted you to see this. Just let you know that this is a thing that is being discussed.

657
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:34,760
Well, it's complicated, and I don't have a clean answer for what the right answer should be.

658
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:38,490
As we think about incorporating these variables, we're not. All right.

659
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:45,180
So let's take the last few minutes and talk with your neighbors about this question.

660
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:54,580
I asked you to. I had to read that story. This is a screening of The Gamble article.

661
01:14:56,810 --> 01:15:05,450
How did you feel about that? Because you are comfortable with the idea that raising cancer screening has this thing that a choice.

662
01:15:06,650 --> 01:15:13,790
That people could say yes or no to. Is that going to undermine our public health efforts to get more people to be screened when it's appropriate?

663
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:20,719
I take a few minutes and just sort of wrestle with the question of is it okay that we should

664
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:25,850
be talking about the cancer screening tests or the cancer screening test as well as a choice?

665
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:30,980
And if not, that's fine. But let's wrestle with that question. All right.

666
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:47,420
Well, I had a really interesting discussion.

667
01:15:50,030 --> 01:16:15,680
And I mean, I think that yeah, like I said, my wife and I don't it's just like,

668
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:35,120
you know, obviously they should recognize that this was an element that was suffering.

669
01:16:37,120 --> 01:17:42,550
I think they were trying to get past deciding not to take a polygraph test prior to I'd like to be in your life and hopefully it's you know,

670
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:54,320
if they decide to go answer it.

671
01:17:57,260 --> 01:18:19,550
I don't think that I think I mean, I feel like that has always been tested.

672
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:43,010
And that's why I think it was like I mean, when.

673
01:18:44,750 --> 01:19:17,960
I think my music and things like that. But I like I like the fact that we're not really going to have to do other things.

674
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:33,480
I think it's very hard for me to describe.

675
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:38,390
Right. So there's no simple answer for today.

676
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:45,230
It is about health tradeoffs and the societal tradeoffs that we face regret that we might face,

677
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:49,760
that when we make choices that lead to negative outcomes, particularly for particular individuals.

678
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:58,399
I hope not. Move back to this. This kind of perspective is not actually that common.

679
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:05,900
Most people and honestly, most health professionals, both in public health and in medicine and that think about screening of.

680
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:14,629
With the news, you staying, etc. I've had conversations with highly educated health professionals of genetics and screening,

681
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:17,650
etc. that were way more black and white than I ever imagined.

682
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:27,140
I would hear from somebody with that kind of background. I hope you will take away from today that sense of nuance, that sense of this is tough.

683
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:33,580
You're gonna have to make choices as individuals and as as members of our society about what we choose to do and what we don't choose,

684
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:38,960
which is that all you sort of got for today, that's still a big thing.

685
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:43,400
And I hope you'll hold on to it and bring it to your future work.

686
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:49,140
We're going to bring we'll come back together on Thursday to go work through the draft.

687
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:56,000
Again, please reach out to me if you've got questions about your decision and the context you should include, etc. I'm happy to help.

688
01:20:57,290 --> 01:21:02,360
Topically, we're going to shift. The next two weeks are going to be crisis communications,

689
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:15,170
things like pandemics or know toxic spills or product failures or those kinds of situations where uncertainty

690
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:23,299
and and fear and emotion are are even more important than that because you don't have that specific knowledge,

691
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:29,120
you just have to deal with the situation. So we'll go into those in some great detail over the course of the next two weeks.

692
01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:36,709
All right. The answer is you just make decisions.

693
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:41,450
You have to get something for controlling.

694
01:21:45,310 --> 01:22:16,000
All right. I know you're not fun to play a person like me, like I come out like that at the end of the year.

695
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:20,210
It wasn't like that.

696
01:22:20,290 --> 01:22:32,160
So it's like we're having unprotected sex. Yeah. At first I think that was so good.

697
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:41,650
It could have been in. So in this case, we got, like, three.

698
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:51,850
One is. Yeah, it's like lunchbox or something that you want to ask me like this that counts.

699
01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:59,530
It's the only thing that I saw that I didn't know.

700
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:04,830
I just heard it. There's not any really.

701
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:11,140
Like, if it's like that, I had to be in surgery versus, like, physical therapy.

702
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:20,079
That would be totally awesome. There are facials, surgery.

703
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:24,159
So I've had people tell you I was this type of graft throughout.

704
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:28,990
But the truth is that that was also either one would be fine.

705
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:31,690
You know, I was like, that was a challenge.

706
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:41,380
And so it was like 2 to 3 pages for like not more than one page of, like writing this decision to be tired.

707
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:46,370
So the assumption is that you've got one core page that is the table.

708
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:51,430
Maybe a little bit of other stuff, but like a page worth a table is not uncommon.

709
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:54,990
And if it runs into more than one page because you got a lot of stuff that's phobia,

710
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:59,800
like, like no more than a page of interest, just enough to sort of set it up.

711
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:05,610
Here's your choices, Abby, etc. Now here, it doesn't say I'm surprised.

712
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:12,810
What if I had to change them? It's hard for me to give our guidelines here because it depends a lot on the consequences

713
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:16,750
that sometimes it takes a page or so to really describe what your options are.

714
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:21,480
Each and again, I saw that yesterday and I don't like that.

715
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:27,190
So adjust the level of detail according to what you like.

716
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:36,580
What would you want as a patient to remind yourself of what the physical damage that you actually got.

717
01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:50,560
So yeah, yeah, we talk about that and say, Oh yeah, I'll send a letter.

718
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:57,550
But I wasn't like I can to something about.
