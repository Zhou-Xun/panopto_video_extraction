Hello. Welcome to this
lecture on sampling concepts.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,320
Today, we begin an
introduction to

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,275
the concept of
sampling variability.

4
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:13,260
In previous lectures,
we discovered how the

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,485
mean and the variance are
good summaries of our data.

6
00:00:16,485 --> 00:00:18,770
But we wonder how well
that they represent

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,475
the population we
drew the data from.

8
00:00:21,475 --> 00:00:23,395
In order to figure this out,

9
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:25,490
we would need to
draw many samples

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,290
from the same population and

11
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,180
compare the results of
the samples to each

12
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,395
other, or would we?

13
00:00:31,395 --> 00:00:33,380
In this module, I'm
going to show you

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,630
an elegant property
of statistics that

15
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,865
allows us to estimate
what it might look like

16
00:00:37,865 --> 00:00:40,805
if we did our study
hundreds of times.

17
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:43,160
So our single learning
objective is to

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,580
comprehend the concept
of sampling variability.

19
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,410
We return to the big picture of

20
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,080
biostatistics that we saw
in previous lectures,

21
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,850
and today we remain up in

22
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,680
the upper left-hand
corner discussing how to

23
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,860
use samples of data to
infer to the population.

24
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,850
Now, sampling
variability concerns

25
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,410
the question how different or

26
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,110
alike would your
results be if you

27
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,245
replicated your study with
a new sample of data.

28
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:10,985
So again, we have a population

29
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:12,920
represented by the orange circle.

30
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,590
We draw a smaller
sample of subjects from

31
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,425
that population represented
by the blue circle.

32
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:21,565
From this sample, we
compute a sample mean.

33
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:23,075
Now, we could consider drawing

34
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:24,725
a different sample of data,

35
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:26,405
another sample of data,

36
00:01:26,405 --> 00:01:27,905
and another sample of data.

37
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:29,870
We could repeat this many times.

38
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,310
Each of these samples,

39
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,160
because they are collected
from different individuals,

40
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,115
would likely produce a sample
means that are different

41
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:40,475
from each other as well as
from our original sample.

42
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,234
It is he difference
among these samples

43
00:01:43,234 --> 00:01:47,135
that is quantified by
sampling variability.

44
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:50,210
Now, understanding the idea
of sampling variability is

45
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,650
essential for most of

46
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,080
the statistical tests
that you will ever use,

47
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,500
including those discussed
in this course.

48
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,790
Therefore, we need
to dig deeper into

49
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,965
the specific
components that effect

50
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:03,623
sampling variability
in those tests.
