1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,360
And then I went home and they were like designer shorts and there were $300 there for four bucks.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,240
What's that like around here? The best college town has three downstate ones that are like that.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,870
Yeah, yeah. There's one at the one near a produce station.

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,890
I don't threat because I hate shopping, so I don't like sorting through anything.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,870
So I just started off. I'm like, the only way I like buying clothes is things.

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:35,849
If I see something go, I'm like, Is that worth the money that I'm going to pay can show so that if I can get it for like $3, I'll buy it.

7
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,020
But I'm not going to spend $20 on a shoe that's gonna get sales online.

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:46,500
And I just present the something about like the music and smells of like department stores during the life out of it.

9
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,810
Oh, right. Hello, everybody.

10
00:00:52,620 --> 00:01:01,160
It's that weird time of year where this morning, when I left and came here, I was nice and cozy, and now I feel really hot because of my outfit.

11
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,209
And tomorrow the high is going to be 75 with the day starts out at like 37 or so.

12
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,410
So I supposed to get down to like 33 on Friday night? Yeah, like 40 or something.

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,160
Maybe we'll get our first frost. Wasn't very good did we.

14
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,210
Yeah. On Monday at least I good.

15
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,350
I my. Oh there is a French horn.

16
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,820
It seems early. Were any of you around for the free donuts yesterday?

17
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,229
Me either. The one day away from home. Well, at least some of you get ice cream.

18
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,910
So apparently that was a faculty event. Really?

19
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:41,200
So we put it in, like the group chat, and someone in the group jumping around said, like, apparently that's faculty.

20
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,400
Oh, well, you know what? You were my thank you for bringing us.

21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:53,100
You were my guests. Well, I was supposed to be like after the town hall, but they honestly, they always have so much extra food afterward anyway.

22
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:02,700
They just tell students to comes. So whatever we're doing them and I go, Yeah, yeah.

23
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,970
Providing food waste. The donuts were for everybody though. Yeah.

24
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,480
That's like talk with the dean, right. Or is that that was last week.

25
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:17,720
No, they I don't know. They just had some leftover donuts from some of them. Oh I've never can never say no to a donut have you.

26
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:24,090
All right. So this week we are going to talk about one health.

27
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:31,050
Now, before I get into this, let me take the take the check the temperature of the room.

28
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:40,650
So in next week, we have a partial gas lecture where the first like 20 minutes I'll talk and then the guest lecture comes on.

29
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:48,120
[INAUDIBLE] be over Zoom. Okay, so do you want to just do that class that whole day on Zoom or do you want to meet here?

30
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,929
And then [INAUDIBLE] be on Zoom on the screen. I'm already here.

31
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,959
So you already here. Okay. Okay.

32
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:01,050
Because my other class they on Thursdays, I'm the only reason they have to come at 8:30 a.m., so.

33
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,740
Okay, you already be here. Okay, great. Well, we'll do that then. All right.

34
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:11,370
Okay. So last week we talked about total worker health and this week we'll talk about one health.

35
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,979
So what is one half? How many of you have heard of one health before?

36
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,490
All of you. Okay. Have you talked about exhaustively.

37
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,410
No, no. Oh, okay. To different content. Okay, briefly.

38
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,890
And toxicology, all different context. Okay.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,450
That was kind of like a buzzword that comes up a lot.

40
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,650
Okay. So it doesn't suck for the. Okay, okay.

41
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:46,229
So so the CDC defines this as a collaborative, multi-sectoral, transdisciplinary approach, working at the local,

42
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,809
regional and national and global levels with the goal of achieving optimal health outcomes,

43
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,960
recognizing the interconnection between people, animals, plants in their shared environment.

44
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:06,420
So this is absolutely oh, that should say yours. Absolutely not a new concept, but has become more relevant in recent years.

45
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,440
So let's watch a little short video.

46
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:19,260
Okay. One.

47
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:26,760
Health is an interdisciplinary perspective that recognizes the interconnectivity of all life systems on planet Earth.

48
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,380
The footprint of all living things overlap like a Venn diagram.

49
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,130
The health of humans, animals and the environment.

50
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:42,200
Four men are inextricably linked and stressing one life system impacts them all.

51
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:52,100
So what efforts can be made to promote global health and well-being to diminish the domino effect of negative impact?

52
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:59,330
It is pivotal that we manage issues and minimize unintended consequences before they spiral out of control.

53
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:05,600
For example, warmer temperatures worldwide have caused an increase in mosquito populations

54
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,850
which thrive in hot climates rather than a 30 to 40 day gestation period.

55
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:16,250
Mosquitoes become full grown in just six days, leading to rapid population growth,

56
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,990
and warmth causes a greater rate of transmitting infections during their lifetime.

57
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:27,260
The spread of infectious disease is one of the primary focuses of one health.

58
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,930
75% of emerging diseases in humans can be traced back to wild animals.

59
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,810
The Ebola virus in bats, for example, is considerably distanced from most human life.

60
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:47,179
But in a scenario where an infected bat contaminates foods which are consumed by monkeys that are later hunted by humans,

61
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:55,970
we can easily have an outbreak on our hands. Preemptively, treating wild animals would remove the risk to domestic animals and humans alike.

62
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:04,940
Shifting the paradigm upstream helps control and prevent disease transmission and demonstrates the need for a unified one health approach.

63
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,780
It's important that all disciplines and spheres become aware of their impact on other life

64
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:18,630
systems on Earth by enhancing cooperation between health and environmental professionals.

65
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,110
Communicating issues and goals with political leaders.

66
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:28,830
And educating the public sector. We can achieve the best health outcomes for all of Earth's living creatures.

67
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,290
Let's join efforts to act responsibly and positively impact global health.

68
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:50,000
Start today with one health. You always wonder who draws these things.

69
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:57,350
I think you're very nice. Okay, so have I told you all?

70
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,820
Because the other part of my work that I do is highly infectious diseases.

71
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,280
I know most of them come from bats, so I don't do caving or spelunking.

72
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:11,810
I know it's very it was very popular when I lived in Indiana. People love to go caving.

73
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,830
Yeah. And contemporary music caving is going to exist in caves that are named after more.

74
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:26,880
Just like there's a cave. Let's go in there. Just like existing caves and like, because there was, like, mammoth cave exploring them.

75
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:36,740
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, most of these bats are not North American bats, but sometimes they come here and they also carry rabies.

76
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:47,660
So so the basics of one help that we'll get into more detail on is with human populations growing and expanding into new areas,

77
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:57,830
we are blurring the borders now between invisible borders or sometimes very visible borders with wild and domesticated animals,

78
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,370
and then also proliferating disease transmission.

79
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:08,240
So this has also been affected by climate change and changes in land use.

80
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,080
Another term you might hear for one health is zoonoses.

81
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:19,159
But zoonoses really refers to the transmission of disease from humans to animals and vice versa,

82
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,230
but not necessarily that interconnectedness with the actual environmental component.

83
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:31,550
So just to put this into perspective, this is an older picture, but they don't have a new one recently.

84
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:38,660
This is from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, where, you know, Dr. Fauci did his research.

85
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:47,480
And this is just to show newly emerging, reemerging or resurging and then deliberately emerging diseases.

86
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:55,880
So if you think about it right now, like, you know, we are very fortunate to live near Detroit International Airport.

87
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:06,260
I could hop on a plane right now and be in Australia in less than 24 hours and I might be asymptomatic with

88
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:13,610
an infection or disease that is not normal in Australia and then all of a sudden I've brought it there.

89
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:24,860
So this map is not to say that the United States has more diseases than any other country is just obviously this is a US based institution.

90
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:33,620
So they're obviously going to focus on, you know, diseases that might impact the United States for deliberately emerging.

91
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,430
That is considered bioterrorism. The only thing you'll see there is anthrax.

92
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,329
Anthrax is naturally found in the environment. It is spore forming.

93
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,630
It is usually found in livestock and cattle.

94
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:51,350
But you can weaponize it to kill people if you have time to watch.

95
00:09:51,650 --> 00:10:02,660
There's an interesting hour and a half like documentary slash reenactment called Like Anthrax The Shadow Attacks on Netflix.

96
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:10,250
And it has Clark Gregg, who plays Agent Coulson from Marvel like in their reenactments.

97
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:17,630
But essentially the perception was after two after 911 that, you know, a lot of people thought it was,

98
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:25,010
you know, al Qaeda or like international terrorists sending these anthrax samples.

99
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:31,490
The calls were coming from inside the house. It was coming from domestically.

100
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:42,620
So very interesting documentary. But, you know, take for example, in 2016, we had a huge outbreak of Zika virus.

101
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:49,430
So Zika virus is caused by mosquitoes and interestingly, it is only carried by female mosquitoes.

102
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:57,859
So if you are bitten by the Zika virus and you happen to be a pregnant woman, it might cause microbes stealthily,

103
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,900
which is like the malformation of the skull, where the skull looks compressed.

104
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:10,820
And most children who are born with microcephaly generally don't live past like 20, 30 years of age.

105
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:18,709
So it was considered also a sexually transmitted infection because if the man, for example,

106
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:27,020
gets bitten and contract Zika virus and then they have sexual activity and then, you know, a child is born, it can be passed on that way.

107
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,460
But Zika virus could only be detected in the blood for a week.

108
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:37,849
Right. So how often do you get a mosquito bite? And you're like, oh, let me get my blood tested to make sure I don't have Zika.

109
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,500
Like, never. Right. What else was happening in 2016?

110
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,350
A lot of ICU. I forget what else was happening.

111
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:56,020
2016, that was some tropical storms and stuff. I think not the election.

112
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:02,530
Besides the election. Yeah, I don't regret the election. The Rio de Janeiro Olympics.

113
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:10,960
So obviously the CBC doesn't have any power over the the Olympics International Committee.

114
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:19,569
But they did like they were concerned about the fact that Olympians from literally all over the world were traveling to Brazil,

115
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:25,150
which had at times yellow or orange level warning for Zika virus.

116
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,990
And you have people traveling from all over the world, shenanigans at, you know, Olympic Village, etc.

117
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:41,620
So you might be potentially exposing people from Sweden where it Mongolia even, who might have never even come into contact with Zika virus.

118
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,459
But because they traveled now, they might bring it back afterwards.

119
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,600
So it's just to show how fluid our our world is.

120
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:57,100
So sorry. Some of this font is a little light cause I had copied it over from another design.

121
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:06,249
This is essentially the epidemiological triad where some kind of agent creates a pathogen and you have your susceptible hosts,

122
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:11,410
and then the environment in which it thrives and those three are together lead to disease.

123
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,239
But the environment doesn't necessarily have to be the natural environment.

124
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,160
It can be physical, social, cultural, behavioral. So we'll talk about all of that in a second.

125
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:30,729
So as I mentioned briefly in the video, climate change is leading to new normals for weather patterns.

126
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,860
So, for example, drought, the warmer temperatures are.

127
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:45,490
But also the more that you have inclement weather events like hurricanes that create things like still water, mosquitoes will proliferate.

128
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:55,360
And like the video mentioned, the life cycle of the mosquito is super short and they can have lots and lots of progeny during that time.

129
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,640
Warmer temperatures can also lead to more things like toxic algal blooms and result in negative things like red tide.

130
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:10,420
You know, every year people die from toxic algal blooms, although you don't hear like a lot about it.

131
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:19,450
I remember a couple of years ago there were there's a news story about some teenagers who were just like playing around and

132
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:29,529
they decided to like go for a swim on like a very small pond in a golf course that ended up having toxic algal blooms.

133
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:40,389
And then like shortly after, like one of them had like respiratory distress and died generally here is the lakes have toxic algal blooms.

134
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,930
Like they monitor those kinds of things and we'll let people know.

135
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,919
But that doesn't necessarily like stop people from their activities because

136
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,150
they might not always have like a lifeguard or like a a park service person.

137
00:14:54,340 --> 00:15:04,000
Walking around. So elevated temperatures also affect the patterns of weather and negatively impact plants, animals and humans.

138
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,280
Increased rainfall again,

139
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:15,489
which I said was a breeding ground for still water and then extreme climactic events like wash up debris, garbage, other things.

140
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:23,380
For example, leptospirosis is a disease carried by rodents, in particular in rodent droppings and urine.

141
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:28,120
So during hurricanes, when there's a ton of floodwater washing everything up,

142
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:33,549
it ends up in the stream and mixes with the natural water reserves, all that kind of stuff.

143
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:44,470
So like, you can imagine what's going on right now in Puerto Rico after the after Hurricane Fiona and now in in Florida and South Carolina.

144
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,000
Okay. Oh, mosquitoes. Mosquitoes.

145
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,080
Such a small thing, but causes so many problems.

146
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:59,140
I remember when I was a teenager in California, West Nile was a huge issue.

147
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,270
And one of the things, you know,

148
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:09,370
like is West Nile was particularly prolific is you just see a lot of dead birds everywhere because they would infected birds.

149
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,370
And birds is one of my my phobias.

150
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,609
I'll eat it. But I don't want to see it. I don't want to see it alive.

151
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:21,730
And I want to see a dead. Something about the feathers freaks me out. Don't don't ever to this.

152
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:30,040
But there was like a dead bird in the swimming pool at my mom's house, and she, like, collected it and, like, threw it in a trash bag.

153
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,810
And then we had to report it to you to the YOLO Vector District.

154
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:41,590
But what they would do to control the mosquito population is something called aerial spraying.

155
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:50,350
And this was like mass scale, right? So like all the news channels and radio stations in Sacramento would be like if you live in this zip code,

156
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:58,240
6 p.m., be inside your house for the choppers coming out and like dumping a bunch of insecticide, essentially.

157
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:04,090
Right. The Vector District also looks at what they call integrated mosquito management,

158
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:14,290
where they essentially try to stop the life cycle of the mosquitoes are like pool the still water and curb the population that way.

159
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,730
How many of you have heard the genetically modified mosquitoes?

160
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do what do you know?

161
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:30,040
Well, I just know they're they're trying to have like it in their genes where they'll go out and breed and then the offspring are sterile,

162
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,130
so they can't continue. Exactly. Yeah.

163
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:38,019
So all of these viruses and diseases are carried by female mosquitoes.

164
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,220
And the female mosquitoes will eventually, you know, lay that lay the eggs.

165
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,850
So all the genetically modified mosquitoes are male.

166
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:51,010
And then when they breed, they essentially are like dead or sterile.

167
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:58,140
Right. They have already been released. They've been been released and would have raised a few conditions.

168
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,870
Right. Not like in a practical. Oh, no, you can look it up.

169
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:07,630
They've been released in California, Texas, the southwest Florida.

170
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,040
What impact does it have on the on the food chain?

171
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:19,970
And not sure, because somebody asked me that in another class, because, you know, that whole, like, uh.

172
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:27,340
What? That what? Like hermaphrodite frogs. It's a situation argument people were having.

173
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,300
I mean. Oh, yeah. Or is it more like that turning into frogs again?

174
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,370
Yes. Yes. I mean, I do believe there's more capital.

175
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:41,500
Yes. That's chemical related. Right. But with this in particular,

176
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:49,659
I don't know what the impact is on frogs or anything that eats genetically modified organisms over at least some of the case scenarios.

177
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:55,900
It was very like strain specific and they wouldn't crossbreed to larger strains of mosquitoes.

178
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,590
However, I don't I can't say that for all the different.

179
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:08,769
Right. And it's a very interesting situation. I would say mosquitoes are easier to curb than ticks just because with ticks,

180
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,249
the only way to really manage them is to get rid of their natural habitat.

181
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,600
But you can't just deforest large sections of the United States.

182
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:23,049
Right. So mosquito management is is is slightly easier.

183
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:30,850
And people can do things to protect themselves, like wear sprays, but people often don't reapply their sprays and all that.

184
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:39,579
Mosquitoes are bad just because they breed so fast. And everyone's like, What's the unique about them?

185
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,680
That they can carry all these different diseases and stuff? I mean, go ahead.

186
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:53,740
So much of the world. Yeah. You know, like they can I mean, they can also live up here and also the fact that they drink a lot because of that big x.

187
00:19:54,170 --> 00:20:01,220
So many different I mean, flies vector disease, but there are like like kind of surrounding.

188
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:08,239
Yeah. I mean, they might like flies, might like contaminate or like poo butter food or whatever, but mosquitoes.

189
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,209
Yeah. Because they drink blood. They are literally like vectors of disease.

190
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,300
And that way they're like a little blood carrying out that and it can fly.

191
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,500
Right. So like if you think about something like bedbugs, for example, relatively stationary, they don't fly,

192
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,240
they make catch a ride and you wear your clothes out of the hotel or something like that.

193
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,640
But mosquitoes in particular have that. And they they do turn over so fast now,

194
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:42,070
just so fast that this scares me the most American infectious disease wise is like triple E or West Nile, Eastern equine encephalitis.

195
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,860
Yeah, yeah. You get older more and more of that. It's like scarily fatal.

196
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:53,540
I'm more worried about ticks, honestly, I'm back then and I mean the that have one out now.

197
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,380
Oh yeah. I don't think they would just give it to me but that's.

198
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,909
We got it. Oh yeah.

199
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:05,450
And I mean, they're more like outdoor workers, but yeah, it might be easier to get well, especially for people with, like, darker hair,

200
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:12,680
you know, like myself, if you have a tick latches onto my scalp, I could not know for like years because who's going to check me?

201
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:18,080
When I was a kid, I went to the barber and then I would take a look. Oh, yeah.

202
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:24,380
And you know, in Michigan in particular, because of my other class, we talk about case studies in the Great Lakes region.

203
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:31,070
Michigan, out of all the Great Lakes states, has had the highest volume of tick borne diseases due to climate change.

204
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:42,980
So in the last 50 years, Michigan's average temperature has increased by about a half degree, which to the average person does not seem like a lot.

205
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:48,740
But essentially what that means is it shortens our winters by about ten days.

206
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:58,820
So the winters are less cold and they don't last as long, meaning all these ticks have greater probability to survive.

207
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:09,110
So, you know, now they'll latch on not just to humans but animals and then domesticated animals, bring them into the house, etc., etc.

208
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,820
Yeah. Vectors with ticks though.

209
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,020
Unless you have the deep wood spray, it's not as easy to protect yourself.

210
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,910
I mean, like long sleeves, long pants or clothes and works.

211
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,630
Yeah. I mean, I've seen chemicals, but. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

212
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:36,230
What can you do? The infrastructure environment also contributes to the breakdown between one health.

213
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:47,040
So as we put up things like dams, canals, irrigation, you increase breeding sites for mosquitoes, larval contact due to moist soil.

214
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:51,829
So human diseases and then you're breaking down microbial barriers.

215
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:56,150
And that's cryptosporidium, which is essentially just like very bad diarrhea.

216
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:01,669
And then if you have defective plumbing, you can encourage viral dispersal.

217
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:08,840
If the plumbing is ineffective, where there's no leaks between the point of entry to the exit in the water treatment system.

218
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,230
Right. There's opportunities for aerosolization there.

219
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:18,170
And then you have your reservoirs and distribution centers like cooling towers that can carry things like legionella.

220
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,840
So development and change in land use.

221
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:33,290
One of the things that pains me the most, which I feel like I'm so powerless to do anything against, is like massive deforestation.

222
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,690
So, you know, remember, like, I don't know,

223
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:43,759
what was it like early 2020 where they were just cutting down like large sections of the Amazon rainforest because they had that that awful,

224
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:51,710
awful president. I mean, so much so many species that are indigenous to the Amazon rainforest literally don't live anywhere else.

225
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:57,080
And then some of the plants and trees that they have that they use as key ingredients for

226
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:03,319
like lifesaving medications also don't grow like literally anywhere else in the world.

227
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:10,760
But like, you know, there was I forget the name of the Netflix series, but like I don't shop at IKEA, for example,

228
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:18,680
because they actually there's been a lot of exposés of them logging that natural preserve

229
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:25,280
forests in Romania and other countries in Eastern Asia to make their furniture and the like,

230
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:30,590
you know. Yeah. And then the person who founded IKEA was like a Nazi sympathizer.

231
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:34,430
Also had a really good one about furniture that would crush children.

232
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,250
That's the same episode. Yeah, that was the same episode.

233
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:47,150
So, so again, as we like cut down more forests for like, I don't know, toilet paper or a like for your like, you know, dresser or whatever.

234
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,600
Again, blurring the lines between human and animal and the end.

235
00:24:53,740 --> 00:25:01,190
Ironman then, you know, with one health issues there's also increase decreases biodiversity.

236
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:08,930
You're disrupting natural habitat, so you're causing animals to go migrate into places they'd never lived before, like suburban areas.

237
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:18,080
This is a huge issue in South America, particularly with sand flies that cause something called leishmaniasis and it can cause

238
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:25,460
a lot of open wounds and sores because they kind of like it causes a big skin infection,

239
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:38,060
essentially. Technology and industry also contribute to the degradation of one health just because increasing use of prescription drugs,

240
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:44,960
specifically antibiotics, but other things have led to antimicrobial resistant infections.

241
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:49,490
How much have you talked about that in your other classes? Kind of.

242
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,819
So I don't have a picture of it here.

243
00:25:52,820 --> 00:26:05,110
But if you look up the timeline of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance, viruses and bacteria are super smart, as we can see with SARS-CoV-2.

244
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,920
Right. They will do what they need to do in order to survive, which is mutate.

245
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:19,070
So, you know, realistically, we haven't had any super novel antibiotic treatments come out since the 1970s.

246
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,200
But within several years,

247
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:30,440
anywhere between two years to a decade or 20 years of an antibiotic being discovered like penicillin or amoxicillin or Cipro, for example,

248
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:41,450
you will see antibiotic resistance already starting to emerge just because of the overuse of antibiotics or the overprescription of antibiotics,

249
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,470
kind of in the same way that we got into the opioid epidemic crisis.

250
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:54,859
But, you know, people don't often don't understand, like antibiotics don't kill everything, especially viral infections.

251
00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:02,420
But because of the way our health care system works, again, people go in kind of wanting a quick fix for their whatever.

252
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:08,420
And so for a time, antibiotics got just handed out like wildfire.

253
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,309
And then in my other class where we had a guest lecturer who used to live in Egypt.

254
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:16,490
In Egypt, you don't need a prescription to get antibiotics.

255
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:22,250
You can just buy it over the counter. And that's why a lot of people here will go over the border to Mexico,

256
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:29,360
because it's the same thing in Mexico where you can just like buy antibiotics like you do or Canada.

257
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,890
India or India. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

258
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:41,990
So, you know, essentially when you're taking antibiotics, you are shredding your gut bacteria, both good and bad, right?

259
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:52,400
The natural flora and fauna of your stomach. But also because people don't take the course of their antibiotics correctly or entirely,

260
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:57,590
what that does is you only you think you killed off most all of the infection.

261
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:07,100
You kill off most of the infection. And what's left is the really strong ones that survive and then they end up proliferating in the environment.

262
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,449
My mom's definitely guilty of doing this because before there was Obamacare,

263
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:18,859
there's periods of time because she does like like contingent work where she didn't necessarily have health insurance.

264
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:25,399
So if she had like, you know, prescribed like a Z pack or something like that, if she feels better by the fifth day,

265
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:33,530
she'll stop taking it and like squirrel away the rest because she didn't know, like the next time she had to be sick if she would have health care.

266
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:38,179
But those kinds of things, it's not great, but it contributes to the issue.

267
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,809
And then like food processing, a lot of this,

268
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:52,130
like monarch cropping or large confined facilities with swine chicken lead to this is the deadly strain of E coli.

269
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:59,090
I feel like I don't mess with romaine lettuce. Yes, Bridget, just like on the facts of the matter.

270
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,390
Yes. Have you seen any research about like, you know,

271
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:09,860
how a lot of people didn't end up getting their second dose from their first course of COVID vaccines?

272
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:14,360
Have you seen any research on like if that was associated with the variants that came out?

273
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:20,110
Cause I know there was concern I had of that, that exactly what happened would happen.

274
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,960
People wouldn't get their second doses. Then we had variants.

275
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:31,490
Yeah. I, they're still doing a lot of immunological studies about that just because they still need like years and years of data.

276
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:39,079
But a bigger contribution rather than people not getting their second dose was like the 55% of people who never even got

277
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:47,450
their first dose and allowed essentially like the different strains to proliferate and then cycle through the population.

278
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:53,410
I will say there are also now diseases that are resistant to and.

279
00:29:53,550 --> 00:30:01,890
I viral medications and then certain strains of malaria that also won't take to certain antimalarial drugs now either.

280
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:08,909
What about, I guess, kind of on the same topic, too, but like the accumulation of prescription drugs in our waste treatment centers and stuff,

281
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:12,950
is that another big concern or I know I've heard about?

282
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,680
And what can you tell us about prevention more? Yeah, I mean,

283
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:24,719
it definitely affects the natural environment in terms of like the chemicals leached into the ground and the soil and the groundwater actually today,

284
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:32,340
which I feel like there was such short notice. The College of Pharmacy is having like a drive where you can drop off your medications.

285
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,340
I have so much old medicine, you get rid of it in my pantry.

286
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:42,450
Oh, yeah. You can also drop them off at the police or fire stations on designated days.

287
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:51,839
But you should not be throwing them in the trash or like flushing them down in the toilet, because even for the wastewater treatment plants,

288
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,360
they're specifically treating things that are common in like fecal waste water,

289
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:05,190
but they're not necessarily made to treat things found in pharmaceutical byproducts, which is the whole gay frog's.

290
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,230
Yeah. Situation. It's, it's, it's like a conspiracy.

291
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:17,070
It's like the chemicals kind of stuff. I mean, I think there is an increased prevalence of frogs that are sexually fed or whatever.

292
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:22,260
And are they more environmental pollution are linked to Obama.

293
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:30,899
And because of that. Yeah. When, when, when, when the ACA came out and contraceptives became free.

294
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:38,400
So a lot of times when women take oral birth control, it only it doesn't metabolize everything in your body.

295
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:43,770
And so when you, you know, pee and you flush it into the the water system,

296
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:55,049
frogs pick up some of the ethanol estradiol that wasn't fully broken down in the body and then in the environment.

297
00:31:55,050 --> 00:32:03,250
And then that's how you get a hermaphrodite frogs like through the pesticides and then also disrupting the peace of bees.

298
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:07,060
Yeah. PCBs. Um, BPA.

299
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:12,930
Yeah, but I never thought about health care access back in time to microbial or antibiotic.

300
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:20,010
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. Um, you also improper storage of grains.

301
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:30,389
Aflatoxin is a huge thing. They just did a huge turkey cull because of avian influenza.

302
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:37,920
So I was listening to the news and they said, expect your turkey to be even more expensive this year just because,

303
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,970
you know, the transfer of human to animal to human virus, it depends on what kind of virus it is.

304
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:54,450
So generally avian will stay bird to bird. But folks who work in close proximity with birds like at poultry processing facilities, are susceptible.

305
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:00,419
Now, swine facilities are particularly problematic because pig viruses are super smart,

306
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:07,350
where generally bird to bird will stay, bird to bird, sometimes bird to human, human to human generally stays human to human.

307
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,360
But swine viruses are super smart where they can recombine with strains of

308
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,070
avian and human influenza and then create an entirely new strain of influenza,

309
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:22,440
which makes it more difficult to create a seasonal vaccine for.

310
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,890
So the H1N1 in 2000 was swine. Yes. I think this might have been a point on your last slide.

311
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:33,090
Um, but unlike some vegan propaganda documentaries,

312
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:40,560
they talk about like the use of antibiotics in animals like large animal operations

313
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,910
where like they just treat all the animals with antibiotics to prevent infections.

314
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:55,109
Has there been any relationship with that? And like antibiotic resistance and like humans, not that they've connected it to.

315
00:33:55,110 --> 00:34:06,630
In fact, they encourage you to properly treat your animals just because the antibiotics are geared towards preventing that animal disease,

316
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:10,200
not necessarily a disease a human would get.

317
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:17,960
And then when by the time you consume them and cook them, anything that any pathogens that could be there are likely dead there.

318
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,340
That is an issue, though, that some people have.

319
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:30,180
So like Q Fever, for example, is considered a category, a very dangerous pathogen, but it's naturally carried by livestock.

320
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:38,760
And so generally you'll have Q fever outbreaks among like livestock facilities, like in France in the 1990s, for example,

321
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:48,090
there was a huge like a sheep farm and there was a wind that just happened to be super strong and blew down to the south of France.

322
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,510
And it caused a lot of people to die from Q Fever.

323
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:58,859
I think it was either. Or Portland, where there was this couple that had goats in their backyard,

324
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:07,620
but they refused to like vaccinate them and they were making like goat soap and like, you know, natural goat milk products.

325
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:15,420
And there was an outbreak of Q fever there, which were also kids to come out and come back like unpasteurized milk and stuff.

326
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,560
Oh, yeah. Or have you heard about this, like, raw water movement?

327
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:26,700
Oh, God, no. The river. Oh, this all relates to psychosocial factors, I swear.

328
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:31,620
But, like, so we're kind of derailing you.

329
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,370
It's okay. It's okay. So, yes, this raw milk thing.

330
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,780
Don't drink raw camel milk if you go to the Middle East because you might get Morris coffee that way.

331
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,469
But again, you know, this is what I, I just watch French TV.

332
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:50,820
So there's that Zac Efron show on Netflix where he, like, does different adventures and stuff.

333
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:57,329
There's an episode on water where now these people who are naturalists, right?

334
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:07,410
Or like, you know, you see those like Tik Tok influencers who are all about like, you know, clean girl energy or like natural person stuff.

335
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,520
So they don't want to drink water that's treated.

336
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:18,810
And now there's actually a huge anti fluoride movement, which I talk I've talked about in my online class at night that I teach.

337
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:25,230
So people now are drinking like natural water from streams and etc.

338
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:35,250
And so you can see Zac Efron like talking to people and there's like they're literally bottling like untreated water from like rain

339
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:45,930
collection and like streams that animals have definitely defecated in and like bottling and selling it for like $40 and aruwan,

340
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:51,060
which is like a very boujee grocery store in L.A. that a lot of celebrities go to.

341
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:58,420
They now sell this like, pure water for like $40 for like a glass.

342
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,910
So, I don't know, like there's a charcoal filter to something like, oh, food.

343
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:14,040
Yeah, there's all there's a whole anti fluoride movement now, too, because they believe that it causes neurocognitive deficits in children.

344
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:20,250
I have heard that. Yeah I just kind of new thing to not like the world about with this raw water.

345
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:28,319
I can't believe that. Yeah. I mean, certain cities you can drink the water, like in Paris, for example,

346
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:36,990
or like certain cities in Italy where their municipal water is treated so well that you can just, like, go to any tap.

347
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:40,240
I won't even drink the water from here. Okay.

348
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,969
Like, that's why I have this big thing. This is the only water I have for the day.

349
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:50,549
And if I finish it, I'm parched until I go home, because I've literally seen the water on the sixth floor.

350
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:53,580
When I turn on the thing where you refill your bottle, it's come out brown.

351
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:57,200
Yeah. Really. Yeah.

352
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:03,480
But on the by the women's bathroom though. So I don't drink this I don't drink the water in this building.

353
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:10,320
Like I mentioned, importing pathogens due to travel and commerce.

354
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:17,520
We saw this totally with COVID recreational travel and commercial travel.

355
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:26,520
So non-native animals and plants, people either unknowingly or knowingly always try to sneak stuff in from other countries.

356
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:30,179
Like, even when I came back from Puerto Rico, which is a U.S. territory,

357
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:38,940
I had to put my luggage on a separate scanner for the Food and Drug Administration in order to make sure I wasn't bringing in,

358
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,240
like, a pineapple or something like that. Yeah.

359
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,559
Yeah. Hawaii. You're like, you're not supposed to bring in, like, meat from Germany,

360
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,300
like uncured meats and stuff like that, because they don't want you introducing stuff.

361
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:57,720
Remember the whole like thing going around where people are getting random seed packets from China?

362
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,130
No. Yeah. It's like, why would you plant them? Some people do, honestly.

363
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,380
I had a friend who lost in Delhi Airport by U.S. Customs.

364
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:11,580
Oh, there's some kind of some kind of program or something for that, which is interesting.

365
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,730
Okay. You better put in there, like when you wash your boots.

366
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:25,290
Okay. Politics can also serve as an environment in terms of destabilizing one health.

367
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:36,329
So, you know, when you have the denial of the viral ideology of an epidemic, for example, HIV, AIDS and then AIDS, fragmented government response,

368
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:47,600
as we saw with COVID disparate responses among countries during supply chain issues, those kinds of things, but also war and conflict.

369
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:53,100
So, for example, you know, in 2020 there was a civil war going on.

370
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:59,850
And along the border of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda.

371
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:06,360
And people kept running back and forth between the border when they were trying to do ring vaccination for Ebola.

372
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:10,110
So that made contact tracing like pretty near impossible.

373
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:17,900
And also treatment and then displaced persons in refugee camps in terms of like an adequate hygiene resources facilities.

374
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:25,770
This leads to cholera, respiratory infections, cutaneous leishmaniasis and a whole host of waterborne diseases.

375
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,080
Okay. There's also the social and behavioral environment.

376
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:35,159
So all of these things, which I'm sure you've talked about in your other classes,

377
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:43,230
contribute to the blurring of the borders between human environmental health and animal health.

378
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:58,590
So one have this is a more, I would say, comprehensive infographic that they said, again, are not exhaustive but elements to consider.

379
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:06,150
So the very simple, you know, Venn triad that you see of human animal health and the environment.

380
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:16,440
So here in particular, this takes into account diet, food security, antimicrobial resistance, livestock disease vectors,

381
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:26,520
social determinants of health, population movements, climate change, water pollution, air pollution, deforestation, and then biodiversity loss.

382
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,580
So one. So. Okay.

383
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:38,799
Okay. So you know what? There's in particular the common one.

384
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,270
Health issues that they talk about are antimicrobial resistance, vector borne diseases,

385
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:49,960
diseases in and food animals, human and animal bonds and then contamination of water.

386
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,710
So this is in one health action story.

387
00:41:52,720 --> 00:42:01,630
So they said in southwest U.S. and Mexico, brown dog ticks carry germs that cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever in people and dogs.

388
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:05,979
In Arizona, the free roaming dogs were spreading infected ticks.

389
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:12,460
So many people got sick with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which can be very lethal if not treated.

390
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:17,679
And then public health and animal officials were using long lasting tip collars on dogs,

391
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,560
regular pesticide applications, community education's free spay and neuter clinics for dogs.

392
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,440
And after only four months, 99% of dogs were tick free in the community.

393
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:35,500
And the number of people who had Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever went down significantly.

394
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:49,419
Yay! Success Story. Another example of vector borne diseases is the plague, or Yersinia pestis that is still present here in the United States.

395
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:58,510
Very much so. Those are carried by fleas and generally those fleas nowadays commonly live on things like prairie dogs.

396
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:02,020
So in the south southwestern United States,

397
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:10,030
if a domesticated dog comes into contact with the prairie dog or happens to be hunting or like biting one or whatever,

398
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:18,250
and then brings it back into the home or comes into contact with its fluids, and then that dog comes back home, interacts with the humans.

399
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:26,410
That's generally how you get a few cases of the plague every year in the U.S. Luckily now it's very treatable with antibiotics,

400
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:31,390
and you can generally figure out you have it because you get buboes.

401
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:38,800
It just looks like you have a large goiter, right? But that's generally what happens.

402
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:44,500
We talked a little bit about is high microbial resistance already,

403
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:49,270
but this is actually a huge issue because it's causing all of these super germs

404
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:56,560
like methicillin resistant staph aureus vancomycin that's resistant to drugs,

405
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:03,309
diseases of food, animals, as I mentioned, the huge turkey call that they did that they're doing this year.

406
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:08,889
There was a huge turkey call back in 2011 in Iowa for the exact same reason.

407
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:16,000
Just so rampant spread of avian influenza and then contamination of water is a huge thing.

408
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,550
I will be curious to see what unfolds in the aftermath of it.

409
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,980
Do any of you have family down there? Oh, no. Okay.

410
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:32,600
So I guess they're just. Okay. All right.

411
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:48,250
So, yeah. All right. So. So how does all of this relate to psychosocial factors, given everything that we've cumulatively talked about,

412
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,950
social determinants of health, natural built environment, all that good stuff.

413
00:44:53,960 --> 00:45:01,930
So how does zoonoses, antimicrobial resistance, vector borne diseases and contamination of water relate to psychosocial factors?

414
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:07,749
You can think about how one of these or like all of these relates to it, but I'll just have you all,

415
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:15,670
rather than me putting you on the spot, take a minute or two to reflect and kind of write down a few sentences on your thoughts.

416
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:23,260
And then I'll ask you all to share with me how you think this actually relates to psychosocial factors.

417
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:50,730
Okay. I see some pensive looks.

418
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:55,200
I saw some typing subject rating.

419
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:03,570
So how do you think all of this one health stuff relates to psychosocial factors?

420
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:11,030
Bridget. Lake right up. Okay. I'm sure they're all good.

421
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,969
That's. I was thinking of, like, access to health care,

422
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:17,450
like you were talking about with the antibiotics that some people won't complete the course because

423
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:23,180
I want to save them if they're sick again and then relate that to antimicrobial resistance.

424
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:30,979
And then, like, if you have an infection that is resistant to your antibiotics, it's going to take longer for it to go away.

425
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:35,660
And that can actually work hours or like work performance.

426
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:41,680
That was it. All right. But there's also your mental state right now.

427
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:47,210
Okay, great. Thanks, Jeff. I was thinking about the contaminated water.

428
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,690
Yeah, because, like, we can not.

429
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:58,760
We use water for everything. We were trained where we could with water, which would take a shower.

430
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:04,730
Like, if we know that these are the water in this river is contaminated.

431
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,900
Like, I. I thought about this issue every day.

432
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,680
I would think about when entering what I was thinking about.

433
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,950
If this water is okay or not right.

434
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:21,830
Maybe I would begin to feel like, oh, I don't.

435
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:28,130
I don't feel well, maybe it's illusion or maybe it's a weird thing, but I think that's a lot pressure.

436
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:35,880
Yeah. That's I think that's not good for him and the crowd, for sure.

437
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,950
Thank you. Yeah, great point.

438
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:49,830
So, for example, like the Flint water crisis, right, that was declared that started in 2014, wasn't declared a public health emergency until 2016.

439
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:55,500
They declared it over in 2019. A lot of flint still does not have clean water.

440
00:49:55,830 --> 00:50:04,170
Okay. Little Miss Flint, grown adult now think she just is about to go to college or like recently went to college and Benton Harbor,

441
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:12,630
which is another community on the west side of the state, that kind of neighbors an adjacent like affluent beach town area kind of near Holland.

442
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:18,950
Same issue with contaminated pipes leading to like this brown water.

443
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:26,350
Right. So if you can imagine not being able to wash your hands, brush your teeth, shower,

444
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:33,870
drink water from your tap at your house, since 2014, you're still using bottled water to this day.

445
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:42,780
Like the amount of not only like the psychological stress, whether or not it is stress,

446
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:50,339
whether or not it is quote unquote real or perceived, has the same effect on the body.

447
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:57,640
So the study today actually is a third of respondents from Flint said that their symptoms are headed PTSD.

448
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:03,599
In regards to all that, which like if you're like a mother or a kid in Flint schools or something,

449
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:09,840
like I could totally see that right then and any anytime they like it maybe the

450
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,560
of a bit hard to thank visit the land or something I mean your entire life.

451
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,750
Right right. So just that chronic stress of like I don't know eight years.

452
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:22,980
Day in and day out that wears totally on your body.

453
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:26,879
Yeah. And that can decrease. I mean, it can affect your work performance.

454
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,680
It can affect you your job satisfaction, work, family life conflict for sure.

455
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:37,860
Other thoughts and comes with bigger picture I guess and I mean that's kind of

456
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:42,690
what how big circle in like the human part I mean sexual factors is like the

457
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:49,139
human part of one whole right until they go to work conditions or women puts

458
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:52,970
the sexual factors puts people where they are to be impacted by public health.

459
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:59,190
So yeah. Yeah. And I thought and what about like risk perception?

460
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:06,180
Sure. So either both ends up kind of having it were also connected that you might not think

461
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:10,440
it's a risk I the better that you can get water from Italy at the grocery store.

462
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:16,350
Um, and then risk perception. Yeah. Ah. Water, raw water looking at what's going on.

463
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,290
And then also it's just like I think people are kind of like see behind the scenes.

464
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:21,149
So there's like, oh,

465
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:30,690
it's like we're at a much greater risk for increasingly more damaging events happening and if that's from vector borne imagery and stuff,

466
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:35,100
so there's kind of that whole connective how it all can have even larger impact in society.

467
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:43,870
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Um, going back to the raw water thing, not to fixate on it, it's.

468
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:47,490
It's difficult to. For me to put myself in,

469
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:54,629
in the mindset of somebody who buys in to the raw water movement just because I

470
00:52:54,630 --> 00:53:01,770
think there is a level of either misinformation or cognitive dissonance going on.

471
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:05,760
But I think that's an extremely privileged stance to come from,

472
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:12,950
where you will literally have people in the United States who don't have access to clean water, the job water,

473
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:18,000
you're going to say screw water treatment technology like, you know,

474
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,520
and then you take those same people to Flint and they're like, okay, go ahead and drink it.

475
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:25,650
It's the town with vaccination.

476
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,919
I mean, it's like profound. I mean, if you go to developing countries like India,

477
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,450
they'll love vaccines because they know they're pretty close to the harms of like all these diseases.

478
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:36,989
It can be that they know they've known people that been harmed by diseases from vaccines.

479
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:42,870
But it's like, where are the effects of what's called autism in the U.S. for people to get vaccinated for in the world kind of stuff.

480
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:46,280
It's like no one really remembers what's that like before vaccines?

481
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:51,620
I was like, what? The ignorance and the privilege of not necessarily needing them or seeing the need for them.

482
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:58,260
Yeah, yeah. My parents definitely were like, get all the vaccines, right?

483
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:05,340
They came from Vietnam and like, my mom got the smallpox one with a scar and you know, like all all that kind of stuff.

484
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:10,680
So I'm just like, Yeah, do it, give me the truth and scare me anyway.

485
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:14,370
So, so yeah, you know, I mean,

486
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:23,489
inherently there is no way to separate our environment from the way that it affects the way we interact and live with it.

487
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:28,710
And thereby the way that we perceive and have.

488
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:34,660
I don't know, like these of structure, these manifestations of our lived experience in it.

489
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:42,560
Bridget. So I was thinking about like this whole time, I think I mentioned like last week that an Indigenous sustainability Yes.

490
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:52,629
Class and sees things like the one how concept is basically just like indigenous sustainability but like oriented to public health.

491
00:54:52,630 --> 00:55:00,970
So this is like a like movement in public health, but it's like what indigenous people have always known to be.

492
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:02,979
That is their health. Yeah.

493
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:11,110
And like it also impacts their psychosocial factors because they're so far out of control of most of these things that are causing these like one,

494
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:14,620
health issues or like sustainability issues. So I was thinking about that.

495
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,850
Yeah. I mean, always feel free to share more about that class because it sounds super cool.

496
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:24,909
But also I think with the way and I'm making a sweeping generalization here, so feel free to correct you.

497
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:33,190
But like with a lot of indigenous or Native American cultures as well, there is more of a relationship to the environment and a respect for it.

498
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:41,799
So that, you know, makes sense for me that it's inherent to how it not only affects like the way they live,

499
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,280
the way they eat, but also their spirituality factors into that as well.

500
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:52,900
I, um, my undergrad is a background in environmental sustainability and one of those been kind of good to me for that reason.

501
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:58,180
So because like we always want to make a big circle and be like the environment and then like us inside of it and would like to have.

502
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:05,230
I think everyone's using a different entity, but we're obviously just within the environment, can't separate that necessarily from.

503
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:09,230
So yeah, for us in public health it's like, duh.

504
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:13,720
But I feel like so many people still just live within the circle of like, human.

505
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:20,769
Yeah. And not even get to the other two, let alone the intersection between and the other.

506
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:31,270
So that's some food for that. Um, okay, let's see how much time we'll watch this quick video.

507
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:37,419
So because next on Thursday, we'll talk more about human animal bonds and psychosocial factors.

508
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:44,290
But what watch this quick video and maybe just do a little a little chat about the animals.

509
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:49,389
I don't know why with this slide deck, it always brings me back to the top.

510
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:54,740
It's very annoying. Okay.

511
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:58,630
What commercial I get? Wait.

512
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:05,320
Did you download Grammarly free?

513
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,430
I don't think it's a pretty human animal bond.

514
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:16,980
101 We've all heard about the human animal bond.

515
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:28,440
But what is it and why is it important? Leo Bustard, a veterinarian, researcher and dean of the Veterinary College at Washington State University,

516
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,580
was one of the first people to coin and popularize the term.

517
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:39,690
He characterized it as symbolic of humankind's visceral connection with other living creatures,

518
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:46,140
especially those animals kept for companionship, working purposes or food production.

519
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:53,160
And for those precious few species to which humankind has opened up both hearts and homes.

520
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:58,350
It can also be called the affection connection like love.

521
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:01,590
The human animal bond can be hard to describe.

522
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:08,190
But just ask anyone who has been emotionally touched by a wagging tail or purring body.

523
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:15,780
They get it. No words necessary. We also knew the human animal bond made us feel good.

524
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:20,640
But until recently, we didn't know it was actually good for us.

525
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:28,860
Science now tells us that animals can play a role in preventing allergies, asthma and eczema in children.

526
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:33,180
They can help schoolchildren learn to read and learn empathy.

527
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:40,320
They reduce the incidence of strokes and heart attacks, as well as increase survivability from heart attacks.

528
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:45,090
They work to ease chronic pain in seniors and animals.

529
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:48,360
Help veterans deal with post-traumatic stress disorder.

530
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:56,980
In a lifetime. We've seen dogs and cats go from being considered animals to pets to family members.

531
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:03,400
These furry, four legged life support systems keep us in touch with the natural world.

532
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:13,720
It's because pets are so important to human health, happiness and well-being that we need to make sure they gain as much as we do.

533
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:19,140
The benefits of this bond need to be reciprocal, not parasitic.

534
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:26,820
We must offer pets not only the four basic needs of food, water, shelter and veterinary care,

535
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:36,990
but also emotional well-being, less fear, anxiety and stress and more happiness, calm and enrichment.

536
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:42,960
We want pets to live happy, healthy, and they like their rabies shots and stuff like that.

537
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:47,880
But so thinking about this, just some like food for thought.

538
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:51,520
How many of you have animals right now? Do you.

539
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,050
How many of you grew up with animals? Okay, everybody.

540
00:59:55,890 --> 01:00:01,620
So was there anything in that video that was surprising to you about the positive health effects of animals?

541
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:07,340
No, I don't fully understand. Teach you how to read. I could tell the focus part of the recovery.

542
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:12,120
Oh, I'm sure there are some studies behind that. Oh, about how animals teach you how to read.

543
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,660
Yeah. Oh. Does anyone want to attempt Bridget?

544
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:21,389
I don't know. I remember at my elementary school was like when I was passing elementary school because I was like in elementary, middle school.

545
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:25,020
So I was a middle schooler. They had like a reading dog come in,

546
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:32,490
so it was like a therapy dog and they would take kids that had a hard time reading out loud in the library and they would read a book.

547
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:39,180
Oh, okay. Yes. Yeah. I was like, I know the dog.

548
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:40,860
Does it speak secretly?

549
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:48,250
And then, you know, like teaches the kids, like how to, you know, dictate that like, my cat has been on zoom with me in university.

550
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:56,550
Like, given, like, the degree, you should as a they should know it's this it's with Bridget said for children with social anxiety.

551
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:01,830
You know one of the major things about reading and like developing your oral skills is the ability to,

552
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:06,479
like, do public speaking without stuttering or fear.

553
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:15,540
So oftentimes children find it easier to read, like gain confidence reading to an animal, but there's also reciprocal effects.

554
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:25,230
So like I volunteer at the Humane Society of Heron Valley and we have JV junior volunteers and they read to the animals to just like calm them or,

555
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:27,510
you know, calm them down, essentially.

556
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:35,160
What does that does the allergy reducing allergies, asthma thing makes sense or does that seem like counterintuitive?

557
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:40,440
Like kind of makes sense, but I think that's really dependent on the individual,

558
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:46,049
like how severe your allergies and asthma or I could see if it was like the hydrogen

559
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:50,670
prophecies or it's like germ theory or if they're like some exposure of some kind.

560
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:57,170
Like germs is good. Too much is bad. I mean, obviously, there's the individual ability where I think some people would have allergies no matter what,

561
01:01:57,210 --> 01:02:02,700
but maybe some people like because of the environment. So yeah, it's definitely the hygiene hypothesis.

562
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:06,450
So like what? My roommate in grad school grew up on a farm.

563
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:13,860
Um, so essentially like with that exposure to like all these different animals, essentially you're just like training yourself.

564
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:18,900
When you're young, you either build up a robust immune system where you're kind of like microdosing,

565
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:23,460
you know, to a certain extent, like training your immune system, your mouth is response.

566
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,720
So like now she has two young kids and lives in Montana.

567
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:33,570
I've seen pictures of her. They have like they have like a couple of dogs, chickens, her daughter rides,

568
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:42,269
horses, pets, goats, drinks, water, like from like a decorative garden fountain.

569
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:46,740
And I'm just like, oh, but you know what? She probably has a really good immune system.

570
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:59,760
Healthy, she's healthy, she's healthy. So thinking about your like animals and pets, I mean, do you feel a human animal bond with them?

571
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,450
Oh, yeah. I think again, you have two cats. Okay.

572
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:09,340
My mom is like the family dog. She lives with my mom, but we're tight, okay?

573
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:12,930
I'm the reason we got her. Okay? I always am.

574
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:15,150
I always am suspicious of people who are.

575
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:23,639
Some people are cat people and some people are dog people or they like something else, like snakes or something like that or like iguanas.

576
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:27,030
Right. My mom also has a cat. Okay. They play. It's really cute.

577
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:30,900
Oh, she doesn't like other dogs and she doesn't know how to play with toys, but she plays with the cat.

578
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:41,640
Okay, that's cool. Yeah. I'm more suspicious of people who don't have an affinity to a certain type of animal just because I'm like a sociopath.

579
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:51,150
But we'll talk more about the human animal bond on Thursday, but just kind of thinking like you don't have to say anything right now,

580
01:03:51,470 --> 01:04:02,580
like your personal experiences with a pet or like I don't know how they have maybe helps you get through like stressful or hard times for example,

581
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:05,879
or even just like promoting better health and well-being.

582
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:13,740
Like, I am now watching a dog for one of our retired colleagues.

583
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:20,390
Dr. Fans love, you know? And he is so cute and I love her so much and she's not even mine.

584
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:23,840
But because I don't have any pets of my own, because I'm gone too much.

585
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,940
Like she has a dog bed on my hands and I bought her those,

586
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:34,580
like Costco branded dog toys and she has her own dog vodka and like a Costco executive member squeaky toy thing.

587
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:45,319
But when I am watching her, which you'll see starting in a few weeks, I have to like run immediately back home after this class to let her go potty.

588
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:52,250
Because I'm scared. I don't know what happens because I've only watched her when I'm working from home and I take her out on three walks a day off.

589
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:58,969
Yeah. And I would not take myself on one walk a day if there wasn't a dog.

590
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:05,959
Okay. But like, I don't know, for some reason, when I'm watching Luna, I feel motivated to go out and do it.

591
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,900
Like I won't do it for myself, but it's so depressing.

592
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:16,160
But dogs keep a lot of people from slipping into a very deep depression, and I like a good schedule.

593
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:23,330
Yeah, for sure. I must have one of those dogs that wakes you up at, like 5 a.m., which I do wake up at that time regardless.

594
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:28,580
Oh, and if I'm 50, I'm a dog, so I'll practice at this time.

595
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:35,270
So we will definitely we'll stop here for today, but we'll talk more about this for sure on Thursday.

596
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:39,470
Welcome your personal stories or anecdotes on this.

597
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:44,840
Let me just look at the schedule real fast to kind of see where we are in this class.

598
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:50,720
This is the can this one. That's not the one. I want to jump in.

599
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:56,140
Okay. Schools will go for school.

600
01:05:57,010 --> 01:06:01,120
You have a quiz due this Sunday. You have a.

601
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:07,150
We have a guest lecture for a part of lecture next week and then a perusal assignment due.

602
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:10,750
Then you have no class during fall break.

603
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:16,659
And then we have another guest lecture that week, which will be the full time.

604
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:24,190
So we can talk then if you. I think she would prefer to be in person because she's coming from upstairs to down here.

605
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:32,080
But your initial pilot questionnaire and write up is due on 1030, so in 26 days.

606
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:40,990
So not only do you have to have it drafted by then, you have to have tested it with at least three people to be able to write about it.

607
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:47,980
Okay. Then, you know, after that so after fall break, essentially we start to move into the bodily systems,

608
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:56,140
cardiovascular, neurocognitive in terms of like substance use, ergonomics.

609
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:02,139
Then we'll talk about adult trainer and then plan to do a lecture on program evaluation.

610
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:08,770
Because I realize for the students, at least, you literally never get taught this way.

611
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:14,030
Well, program evaluation. We have a puppy we have to take.

612
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:18,010
Oh, good. I will take. Okay, I'm in one now. Is it useful?

613
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:22,540
It's all right. It's okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It started off really well.

614
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:26,859
It was really cool. And now it's like, is this, like, want to be yours?

615
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:29,920
And words like qualitative. Well, it's.
