1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:09,390
I have a fight between, like, p, like I tried to. I'd like to hear from you about what was going on, like, still.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:17,040
And then I was, like, professional. Well, I was, like, trying to be as if I was just a transcriber.

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,900
10 minutes. Okay. Morning, everybody.

4
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:30,240
Cambridge, Mass. I'm talking all those naval uplink announcements.

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,820
I brought $1,000,000 for you for each one of you believe.

6
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,170
Not even that, I think 2 million.

7
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,139
Good morning, everybody. So I have a couple of announcements.

8
00:00:53,140 --> 00:01:02,110
First that I like to.

9
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:26,010
That is so you know that we are recording all the major every alphabetically they are recording in Panopto recording.

10
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:38,950
I also before Zoom. So in case one fails you when the session ends, about a one hour is sometimes less than one less time.

11
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:50,290
You see that relates to the session is posted on some of the recording on these type of recordings.

12
00:01:50,790 --> 00:02:01,030
So what that means. So do you think that they all are together and they are reports that we will be meeting right within an hour.

13
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:10,300
So just wait until, you know, at least 1:00 to make sure.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,390
PM And they're looking okay. Their second is.

15
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:22,240
It might be more relevant as we get into the class.

16
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:37,030
But it's I'm thinking on opening the second class of operations, these scientists decision making models, you know, here next semester.

17
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,670
And that is a case kind of a problem.

18
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:48,220
So you are going to get problems from trying to get problems for the industry and then the groups.

19
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:54,069
So we are proposing and propose a solution and work on that.

20
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:59,390
Some of them are simulation problems and decision problems, things that we have.

21
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,570
So you can see the applications of what you are learning, right?

22
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:14,650
So and I am sure, you know, I was talking to my colleague Bill from New Orleans who was who was here the other day,

23
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:23,230
and he's like the idea he definitely is going to it was a phase one to.

24
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:31,300
So that's the second. So all are is normal based on process simulation.

25
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:37,839
But it takes everything that we the Monte Carlo simulation and some forecasting.

26
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:48,670
And this is, you know, so you're going to be able to use some of the tools and the modeling techniques that we are trying to research one.

27
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,900
Okay. I haven't done David too, Hunter.

28
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,770
The first I was teaching the class in Hong Kong for a few years.

29
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:08,319
We have been on a lot with that think the cloud selecting right but I'm planning to so far depending

30
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:16,280
on on the demand so that's why I'm telling you now and you don't have to answer me now or up to,

31
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:23,040
you know, after the midterm exam to see, you know, how how do you feel about the whole thing?

32
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:32,050
And then you can tell me. Yes, I mean, to say or not, because in order to open in class and electing to ask that having been done for a while,

33
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,850
you know, I need some kind of commitment that people might take it, right?

34
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,920
So that's it.

35
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:52,360
But you you don't it is too early in the term that for you to have it, you know, it may not make on your mind about how about next semester.

36
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:06,310
Now says first thing I wanted to talk to you about is is very likely next semester is your last semester at least for me.

37
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:19,870
And so my my recommendation is don't waste time, don't take easy classes because you have a job and you have to you have to leave.

38
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:28,360
And that's why you got to here. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to get the best information that you can get.

39
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:39,910
So think you know, those classes you think you know is not about doing well, is about, you know, expanding your learning and and getting some,

40
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:48,820
you know, skills that are going to be in the model of having you different in the marketplace and you hopefully you going not.

41
00:05:49,120 --> 00:06:06,030
So there is the data management class that you will teach and disprove and you know very popular and some of you think this I 53 because it's.

42
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:21,060
It is required is a required class for some of you to treat one class for people in any format and a healthy format.

43
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,720
And so, you know, data management, manipulation, visualization,

44
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:36,190
there is another class that is very good involving people who think that to get in is three or five, 640.

45
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:45,060
And instead of being data, you know, to us in the business school to deal with things for you and,

46
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:52,930
you know, traditionally students that are very interested in these type of applications,

47
00:06:52,930 --> 00:07:03,760
big data and machine learning how to get into an accountant, anything for me, show an instructor, visualize them.

48
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:10,870
You know, more than 500 data sources. I did not write modeling after that right now.

49
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:23,830
And it turned out to again be very popular and it is difficult to get it done.

50
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:33,400
You just went in quietly, but I usually have been able to get people.

51
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:46,269
A number of people have taken people in. I think this year let me you know, get about five of you are interested.

52
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:55,900
So you have, of course joined the waitlist in front of you that are interested in the class.

53
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:08,860
And, you know, you decide somehow if you're interested and then very likely that you're getting in about five students in the queue

54
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:21,580
and then will give you people we used to that in the at about the pandemic and we haven't done it after that.

55
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:29,770
But if goes well we can get up to ten seeds and four for the year.

56
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:39,280
So think about that. You can come out if you are very interested and, and, and I would put your name on the list.

57
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:47,500
And finally I'm getting for sure they are really both of their right.

58
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:54,060
But for that they have to I need to have a clear commitment.

59
00:08:54,070 --> 00:09:00,760
People are asking the names because that's the name and they open five seats in a class that is heavily demanded.

60
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:13,470
And you said I like the classes and that and I like it.

61
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:21,850
So those are my announcements I am coordinating.

62
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:35,650
I think by Thursday or next week I'm going to tell you when we have the speaker from Trinity, they're going to talk about analytics and how we use it.

63
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:44,470
So it will be a good a good conversation.

64
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,460
You know, I don't know what they're going to say. They might say that doesn't work.

65
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:57,880
So I don't know. But I know you are free to ask any questions you want.

66
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:17,780
It doesn't matter if you enjoy your time, but I think they will make it.

67
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,720
But. But it's only when it's a thing you need to learn.

68
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:30,030
After all, we would be lost without analytical techniques.

69
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:34,280
They're going to be, you know, think about how these little things.

70
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:41,860
And let's be. The process that they used.

71
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:52,960
So they we are going to finish the problem over number three and you sell you something on November three.

72
00:10:53,380 --> 00:11:03,670
I extended that to security and they were going to just finish is an example of this problem

73
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:10,330
and then we will go and do something else that will introduce the this issue an analysis.

74
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:18,550
So this is the last forecasting lecture or session that we're going to have.

75
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:31,270
I'm going to follow your listeners on, by the way.

76
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:40,030
I'm going to send you I'm going to record my solutions with them as we show them.

77
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:44,050
And there there is one perfect score.

78
00:11:44,920 --> 00:12:00,760
And in about three or four of you that wasn't missing, just what was that is it was a tough one to show.

79
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:17,080
All right. So what we what we were saying is that, you know, we estimated for Peace Time series,

80
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:29,200
the train line and the train line, we decided it was a linear trend, but they asked us to work with a quadratic trend.

81
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:37,450
And you see this pretty much like the linear trend is a looks like a straight line,

82
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:49,120
although this is a small curvature and you demonstrate that they are adding a quadratic term to the equation.

83
00:12:50,560 --> 00:13:00,520
Wasn't it wasn't worth it. Right. So and we saw that because when we compared they adjusted our square number in.

84
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:09,940
This is just R-squared for the linear trend, and this is the adjusted R-squared for the quadratic trend.

85
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:18,610
The one with the linear trend is higher than the one for the one that I think we're going to train.

86
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:26,170
So I means that it's not worth putting that extra variable in, but this is our equation.

87
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:41,110
What is that forecasting information for this for our claims is that claim sometimes t is equal to 11, seven, five, 5 to 3,

88
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:55,809
three times the period close to 1.8, six, six times because we're under the estimate term to make it exactly one that we kind of know what they mean.

89
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:01,260
The function of time that we're going to use to forecast is this right?

90
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:08,320
And we're not going to be totally perfect in these forecasts because they are some error term.

91
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:12,460
But now we will realize that there is more than a matter of time.

92
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:23,110
So we have we may have error time, but we will see that these things come down very, very periodically.

93
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,960
And this one focuses on Al.

94
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:27,530
Right.

95
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:47,709
And then what we want to do in we see the three forecast seasonality is figure out what proportion above the trend line or below the trend line.

96
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:52,780
Those data points tend to tend to leak.

97
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,460
Right. So there's no there is no disorder in here.

98
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:08,710
And so there is in this moment, number one, and this is month number one, they tend to be lower down the trend line.

99
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:14,830
And then there are ones like 4 to 7.

100
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:22,299
Right. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven months.

101
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,540
Number seven is most of four, seven again.

102
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,239
So they tend to be above the trend line.

103
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:40,180
And so so far, so the first thing that we did is we considered, you know, what, what is that proportion over below the trend.

104
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:46,120
And what we did is we developed what I think trend first, which is this equation.

105
00:15:48,880 --> 00:16:03,610
That we got from the regulations and they ignored laws when we got to be not be one times the three times the three Winchester periods

106
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:13,510
were so so in three years period and at least three years squared where these coefficients are the ones in that one and I think three.

107
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,830
Right. So it was high efficiency that I used or three.

108
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:23,930
Good. They were beaten or beat one actually.

109
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,400
And so in fact. Right.

110
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:47,020
Okay, so, so group once we do that, we figured out, okay, let me take all the January's and I can find 85 here and point it into here.

111
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:53,950
And if they had another January, it would take another year and get this number.

112
00:16:54,130 --> 00:17:01,030
And you see these numbers of 20 divided by 22 are not the same.

113
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:07,360
So my hypothesis is that they should be the same, the same proportion of or below the trend line.

114
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:16,300
This is 15% below the trend line and this operation is 18% below the train line.

115
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:21,960
Right. So why are anything is the same?

116
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:27,700
I hate what this is it because there's still some things that I've always done as the values that I can look pretty.

117
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,640
So to get rid of the noise that we figured out,

118
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:40,660
what is my best estimate of these attending sees these so proportionately all above the line, below the line and so on.

119
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:50,710
What I'm going to do is I'm going to average similar opinions if I'm dealing with words and I'm going to average over one well or two or three,

120
00:17:51,340 --> 00:18:04,060
I'll use these these proportional talking about models and I'm going to compress all that, you know, result of a very easily mind.

121
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:16,360
And the best way to lose this is I'm going to use the cognitive function in in Excel I call average.

122
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,540
If so and then.

123
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,950
So the syntax is the following.

124
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:39,979
I'm going to average if I'm going to average numbers is the one I'm going to look in this

125
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:49,070
column of the mornings and I'm going to look for number number one for the number one.

126
00:18:49,310 --> 00:19:06,210
Right. And then you go back and. Okay.

127
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:13,100
So I'm going to look into column B from B three to be 26,

128
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:25,130
and then I'm going to look for the number that I see on a three, and then it's going to be 45.

129
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:37,460
In this case, three, there's a14 ordering and if I find the one, I'm going to average the corresponding value in column H.

130
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,060
Okay. So all the ones that I find in column,

131
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:49,580
I'm going to get the corresponding non-green column and then going to average this one in front of a divided proportion.

132
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,330
It claims divided by three. Right.

133
00:19:53,330 --> 00:20:07,420
So I get all the if I do see that that the first range is locked and the second is locked because I'm going to get the information from those ranges,

134
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:13,310
the might I one, but the K three is not lock because at one when I call this formula,

135
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:19,850
I want to pick here all the febs, all the orange Apr, me and so on.

136
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:24,960
So now I think three is where I have a one at least in where it.

137
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:31,370
So I did that and then I copy, you know,

138
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:43,940
all these formulas and then you see now you see now then now I have K for this is where the number two is and then I have got a five,

139
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:50,509
that's for the number three for each of them and then average the corresponding proportion.

140
00:20:50,510 --> 00:21:00,770
And you know what I'm going to say, okay, this is my best estimate of the what I call now seasonal factor for,

141
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:07,250
you know, for January, seasonal factor for February.

142
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:21,230
So I think periodically January is 16% below nine and in February are 11% below the line and so on so far.

143
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:31,130
Oh, so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to produce the that I think then the seasonal forecast.

144
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:45,710
Right. So I'm going to say if I had predicted if I have predicted these sales with these would these seasonality the trend line together,

145
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:57,620
you know how well you know, would I would I be able to forecast so I'm going to come here over this seasonal forecast.

146
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:20,670
I mean. So you.

147
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:40,430
These former. I'm thrown out and what I'm going to do wrong.

148
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,870
I'm going to lose the seasonal forecast.

149
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,199
And the seasonal forecast is simply the weather.

150
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,040
I think the trend times de facto the seasonal factor.

151
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:57,380
This is where the trend is. But January is 15%.

152
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:02,790
I don't know, 15%, eight in 16% below that.

153
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,500
So what I would be doing is I would be for the quadratic trend.

154
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:17,000
And then to say this year my seasonal forecast is equal to the quadratic trend.

155
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:24,199
Right. For one over one times the seasonal factor in November one.

156
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,980
And that happens to be point 84. And that's what I will do.

157
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,210
And then I get of the.

158
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,180
Since the ads were.

159
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:48,010
The thing. Parliament.

160
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,520
So that's why we may see some of. Okay, 10,016, right.

161
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,600
If I have Don, just take my friend.

162
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:06,969
I would have estimated 11,989.

163
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:13,940
But because I use a seasonal factor now, I adjust to 10,016 now.

164
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:22,570
Okay. So I would do the same thing. In this one, I would do, okay, I'm going to multiply these.

165
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:32,130
Whether I think the train, which is 12,225 times the seasonal factor.

166
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:40,320
Four months to a year to.

167
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,900
And now I get 10,908. So.

168
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:03,270
So I take the word that I think threatened or the linear trend or whatever is that I'm using over.

169
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:07,680
It can be a whole forecast, whatever it is that I'm using.

170
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:15,480
And then I multiply that times the the seasonal factor corresponding to the period.

171
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:23,040
So on taking whatever number it is here that in this case it belongs to me.

172
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:33,240
It's, it's a function of the square and then I'm whatever I, I have, then I'd say, okay,

173
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:40,830
what's that month I am in the instance of the likely seasonality corresponding to that moment.

174
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:45,629
So instead of and those are two numbers, right?

175
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:51,950
So these are numbers that I'm going to use. These are my seasonal factory.

176
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:24,570
Right. So I don't want to be, you know, going up to 12 here and then we'll have to redo the formula because I and I,

177
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:30,599
I don't want the formula to take these blank and so on and so forth.

178
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:38,240
So what I'm going to do is the more general formula to forecast with the simple factor.

179
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:53,460
So I'm going to take the weather, I think, trend, and then I'm going to multiply the quadratic trend times, the seasonal sign corresponding to one.

180
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,290
So how do you how do you extract that?

181
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:05,040
If I say I want the seasonal factor and corresponding to 1 to 1, what function in Excel?

182
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:13,860
I will do that for you. They look good, though.

183
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:23,760
And if you don't know that, you can't just, you know, get, you know, the time TV look up and then you'll see the same kinds of things now.

184
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,870
And you know what I mean that people see.

185
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:34,710
So I am going to start with a formula.

186
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:43,350
Is equal to the mother I think training and then coming to the you know probably you need.

187
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:56,530
Simply This is the thing that is good for you.

188
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:04,810
So the first thing is they look at you. So what is the value that I'm looking at that I'm seeking?

189
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:12,250
So in this table. So I'm going to get numbers from the table.

190
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:19,690
So they they eat the their local value is always in column one the first part.

191
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:29,260
So one number I looking in is first born here, the number one.

192
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,740
Right. So I'm looking for this is this is what I want.

193
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:41,160
So I'm looking for the number one. So that is going to be the number they want, right?

194
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:52,680
Number one. And then I'm going to leave that floating.

195
00:28:52,690 --> 00:29:02,810
Right. Because because I want them to look for number two, three and four and so on.

196
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:12,250
So things that I one. And then so what is the table array with all these numbers?

197
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:22,410
And then I have these table is two quotes and those are going to be fixed because I don't want that table to shrink.

198
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:32,530
And when you look for the number one in the first column of my local table, and then who is that?

199
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:48,850
And finally, okay, if I find a number one here, if I find in number one here, what number should I return?

200
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,419
And I should return these five, right?

201
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:56,020
So these, these people called, you know, before.

202
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:02,090
So that's column over two. So you can see or remove it.

203
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:13,110
So that's your scene. That's right here. If sometimes there might be some ambiguity, but not in this case.

204
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:16,360
I need to do that for some.

205
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,160
And sometimes you may have a 1.5 here.

206
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:36,340
And then what be difficult is going to get the the closest number without going to the to the values that you have on the table.

207
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:41,530
And you don't want that. In some cases we need to specify no.

208
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:49,870
If you find and if you don't find that number, don't interpolate on any number, just give me an exact match.

209
00:30:49,890 --> 00:31:01,480
And in this case is going to be an entry return, you know, 5113141, but there's no 1.11 like that.

210
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,870
So we can do that and then that's it.

211
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:14,050
And if I enter, then you remember that we had in 2016.

212
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,430
So is what is doing is here.

213
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:37,390
And then what is doing is, oh, I am going to multiply the democratic trend times in number in this table that correspond to the long one.

214
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:50,020
Okay. And if I find demands one in this table, I'm going to turn I'm going to extract the corresponding number in column two.

215
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:56,980
So I find column I find the number one and the corresponding number in column 2.84.

216
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:10,450
Therefore, I'm going to multiply the what happens on any one only thing that I had that and I can just simply.

217
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:25,230
I like very interesting things that I can keep because because these are going to be the same seasonal factor.

218
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:29,460
And to produce a real forecast, I can do this.

219
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:35,760
I think it is extended for me that I'm going to be multiplying the seasonal day.

220
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:52,629
So I think three times the seasonal factor that I have really made the forecast, this is what we're forecasting and the other is estimating rates.

221
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,590
So this is what I think without know,

222
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:12,090
this is where I think the time is was and to see these things you find that large and and then you can you can extrapolate,

223
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:23,430
you know, and do the real forecast. So let's just take a look and look into the PDA.

224
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:38,040
And that's what we. He highlighted the seasonal forms and.

225
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:47,150
And I'll be. One.

226
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,420
To. It was activated.

227
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,740
You don't think he's special?

228
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:17,740
This is serious. All the names are in the first row and the inside is on foreign arms.

229
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:31,930
And so you see now that we have a much better agreement with them with the Time series and these are going to be my forecast, right?

230
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:43,400
These are going to be my forecast. They're going to match. They these are these are you know, I am a spring.

231
00:34:46,250 --> 00:35:04,550
This is actually an old and and because we we don't see the invalid because we are used for custody persons.

232
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:14,080
So we are focusing on dealing with in Israel on that here.

233
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:29,120
If I if I want to look at all you so you see on an average I'm looking at that time series O and following the mean growth of the time series.

234
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:40,410
But also I am applying to be able the seasonality to them and seem to be above or below that.

235
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:46,930
Very but this is it.

236
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:57,350
So I am going to really like that or for seasonality.

237
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:10,220
And so you have enough information to actually create seasonal if you know the value of your model.

238
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:26,090
For example, suppose that it is a suppose that there is a model.

239
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:32,960
So you can you can I ask you to go or somebody asking to do a model, they have seasonality.

240
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:43,450
So while we do to because the centrality and you see that is how you know seasonality constraints.

241
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:55,130
So I think and everything that you do is well, I think you know the trend.

242
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,799
Right. And then you say, okay,

243
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:08,690
I want to forecast the as if you didn't have seasonality and we are trying to forecast the trend and then you will feed either,

244
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:17,900
in your opinion, whether I think the trend or you create all those forecasts that you know and then follow the trend.

245
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:25,729
Then when you are satisfied with all is always or is one.

246
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:31,209
And I think for or is all of the all these linear regression, if you have the balls,

247
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:39,200
the thing that bears linear regression you can get and the best holds because you are going to optimize our findings,

248
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:48,860
then you're going to say, okay, now for both of these methods, I am going to get the observations divided by the forecast,

249
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:55,550
either the whole forecast or day, whether I think forecast go or linear trend.

250
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:01,760
And then I'm going to get to sense of seasonal factor one for one.

251
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:08,390
I'm doing it for the other. And then I'm going to be creating both of these.

252
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:20,360
I'm going to create a seasonal for two seasonal for that year because customer one and seasonal forecast.

253
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:29,840
Number two and for both of them, then you compute the missing and figure out which one gave you the better.

254
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:37,370
And Mitzie trading hours where is forward and does that square is going to help you get the best regression.

255
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,630
But we don't have a you know,

256
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:57,820
we we can develop a comparative measure for the for any kind of trend work guys in all these computing and RS quarter volume and so on.

257
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:07,399
But now that we have, you know, the two methods, the best method in forecasting and the best and then the best.

258
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:15,410
Okay then by all means, I am going to figure out the seasonality.

259
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:29,870
I'm going to reproduce the seasonal forecast predictions and then I'm going to compute the MSE for both and the lower and see is the one

260
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:39,209
that I'm going to continue using and that's the one that I'm going to use to forecast these numbers for which I don't have observations.

261
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:45,020
So these numbers here are going to be coming from a whole model with seasonality.

262
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:49,600
Or can be coming from here. I think what I think this is a lot.

263
00:39:53,380 --> 00:40:03,310
I'm happy to repeat this is important, and I know that you're going to find out what you've learned here.

264
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:17,340
Someone told me. You know, you do everything you can to get the best for guys.

265
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:22,350
I know you have seasonality and the trend.

266
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:33,020
You've seen the best trend and the best rankings comparing the old and the new and regulation.

267
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:40,860
So you have what's called configuration and and then after that,

268
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:46,169
then what you're going to do is feed the seasonality so you don't have to compare at that point

269
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:55,379
new holds and and you don't have to compare at that point just by trends and progression.

270
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:02,490
You'll wait until you do all your everything that you're going to do with the data that is produced, the seasonality and so on.

271
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:09,209
And then that is what you are forecasting. You want to see how accurate you are with these kind of forecasts.

272
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:13,320
And then for guide, you compute the ABC and can compare between the two.

273
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,100
You know, now for fun.

274
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:32,100
I want you I want you to know that I think you know how to do.

275
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:42,480
Please compute the horse midterm and do a seasonal forecast with homes and compare them.

276
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:53,309
See these seasonal forecast, updated seasonal forecast with homes and seasonal you know what what the best method is.

277
00:41:53,310 --> 00:42:04,800
And let's look now. I'm going to give you some time.

278
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,370
Maybe 10 minutes and.

279
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:32,210
So remember. But you need all you need all of that and you need to you already have the observations in your ear.

280
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:38,560
But you need to ace the train and the holes for gas so that to.

281
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:50,040
Rendering. Yes.

282
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:16,540
And then the new columns that we started working on, left, right wing claims divided by home workers, and then we see the whole season.

283
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,580
And so you need to develop another set of seasonal fact.

284
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:36,400
But unless you do that, then you can help each other.

285
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:41,860
But you need to do it yourself. Just write this by yourself.

286
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:48,930
And if you have questions, you can talk to your teacher.

287
00:43:49,140 --> 00:44:02,260
The. I guarantee that this is going to be in the matrix that.

288
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:10,450
It's cool to see this double exponential. Yeah.

289
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:32,790
That's what you.

290
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:38,410
Things. You know, whenever you finish off, raise your hand when I see about five people finishing up with you.

291
00:48:43,320 --> 00:50:33,100
This brings. I just.

292
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:14,409
So I'm going to make an announcement.

293
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:20,620
But Thursday is up at eight can be 654 on the count of three.

294
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:33,070
So that being said, if you are planning to sleep in the room, they want to know who's here.

295
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:44,970
And it is it is an incredibly valid, very valid excuse that you can be here.

296
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:48,850
Just tell me in advance, but.

297
00:51:52,740 --> 00:52:00,360
Can't they hear something? Some small penalties.

298
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:05,250
And so that is what I want to hear from you.

299
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:40,960
The. Anybody finish the.

300
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:50,440
One, two, three, one, one, one.

301
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:06,890
You raise your hand.

302
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:16,590
You know, one of the things that I need five.

303
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:21,820
I'm just looking at five. Big five get fired five.

304
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:29,480
But we have four. So let's let's do that.

305
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:38,470
So if you remember for. Okay.

306
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:45,010
Cool. I need things.

307
00:53:50,880 --> 00:54:13,380
I need alpha. Beta. I. The whole thing and all the halls.

308
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:20,540
You. Zero.

309
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:32,200
Actually quite easy. Do you know?

310
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:43,740
Do you think chances. Know.

311
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:52,580
Well so close that.

312
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:27,760
Let's. It means you.

313
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:38,600
But I know you. And he.

314
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:52,150
You're telling me you don't want to get rid of the seasonal factor, so sort of holds it.

315
00:55:54,540 --> 00:56:00,830
Let's say between three and four to months.

316
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:17,590
Then what you need to do is get A's and then the first phase.

317
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:36,060
We agree that we're going to be the observation flames the first three and zero attention that has.

318
00:56:40,930 --> 00:57:01,810
What they offer is equal to the first and then the base is going to be equal to the observation.

319
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:07,980
And that's how people write the movies here. It's. Times of.

320
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:22,160
A lot of the laws on cars.

321
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:37,210
Come and sit down. Oh, no.

322
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:41,800
I mean, isn't that the whole point?

323
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:47,380
I think this is one of the times.

324
00:57:55,870 --> 00:58:00,930
Oh, it's better than that.

325
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:09,670
I love that. It's gonna to be great, then.

326
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,240
Oh, this is working for you.

327
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:22,050
Sorry. And this is one minus how I want my neighbors.

328
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:26,750
I'm always.

329
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:48,840
Sometimes. We know, and that is alpha times the observation plus one minus four times the forecast and that's the base.

330
00:58:49,560 --> 00:59:05,850
And then the trend is to beat that lock times the current for the current ranking to increase the observational trend

331
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:22,440
which is the these the ancient this period minus the days in the previous periods and to multiply plus one minus theta,

332
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:46,530
go in and multiply that times the previous range we can use these same k three and then one the same group.

333
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:56,440
So when the age is. Serial number.

334
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:12,990
Number. 20 years, 33 years since 1982.

335
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:18,840
So here's the latest news.

336
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:40,740
And then you know that in a sea of homes, it was interesting to see somebody explain why we're looking for.

337
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:54,630
Well, I was going to say claims it was vision to.

338
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:05,400
Through the homes on site the operation to.

339
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:21,130
Everything's. They're trying to divide the number of them.

340
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:27,210
So the forecast that I hear on.

341
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:58,370
And then we have been legal. The format is the audience in this instance would be.

342
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:05,920
So you did the same thing, you know.

343
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:19,240
So now I am going to minimize their messy data.

344
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:41,240
And so they want to minimize he's to be subject to all of the data to be just than one.

345
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:49,830
And they know from the time they didn't do so.

346
01:02:50,560 --> 01:03:06,530
So I think it is 1.005 that it seems to me almost zero because you don't really get that.

347
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:12,920
Yeah, this is amazing.

348
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:25,550
And then I'm going to I mean, this is this is total for us.

349
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:31,550
This is it can be sort of on the trend for guys, right?

350
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:43,640
So with all of the weather shots building, our train just built into knowing that.

351
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:58,710
Then I'm going to continue all these observations with flames.

352
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:07,360
I was informed that.

353
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:17,190
Glass in season two is going to be on television.

354
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:30,300
Buy homes for cash.

355
01:04:54,310 --> 01:05:07,180
I want. I'm going to give you.

356
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:19,910
And we didn't create a seasonal record agency.

357
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:35,260
So. Reduces the total.

358
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:56,550
You. It's in the.

359
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:02,670
457 used to be.

360
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:12,780
The initial values and that's.

361
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:27,640
You wouldn't want to be seeing it on TV.

362
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:37,300
The second thing you do is. HP.

363
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:46,750
Or it's. Uh huh.

364
01:06:47,750 --> 01:07:04,890
Then I can just delete all these language. And for all season there is going to be another coverage if you're.

365
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:24,000
This is what I want is go into the range of the models.

366
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:46,340
They've got these things to look for in looking for looking for North Korea.

367
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:58,470
One. Is the key.

368
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:05,880
And then the third is what quantum should average.

369
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:11,950
Rich is this wonderful one theory.

370
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,470
And those are going to be we look.

371
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:37,310
What do you think?

372
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:42,150
The range of what he did include?

373
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:49,600
A range. It's very.

374
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:02,740
He resents inflation for rent.

375
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:11,900
So that's my formula. They enter one of the lines with the first one.

376
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:20,820
Three. What he did was different.

377
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:36,320
So once they have that they have made these sort of factories, then, you know, there's this is sort of a forecast on seasonal forecasting.

378
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:12,590
That's going to be equal to all seasonal forecasts that I can get this time from number two, right?

379
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:25,460
Because it's going to be the forecast times, the seasonal factors special, each one forecast times and then the seasonal factors.

380
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:32,840
Seasonal factors means we say the. We?

381
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:54,339
That means the first thing they look for value and is is the one which is going to enable

382
01:10:54,340 --> 01:11:00,820
what I'm doing and I actually know is number one is not their number one is here.

383
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:07,270
This is the corresponding to number two.

384
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:15,490
Right. So that's what that's where you find the seasonal factor of the people and the.

385
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:27,980
The flaw in it. People are afraid.

386
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:31,940
So where are we going to look for that to?

387
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:40,360
Moving to the table.

388
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:52,690
And I'm going to praise feng shui for looking right.

389
01:11:53,770 --> 01:12:26,140
The. And then when we revisit all these pieces in a pan over here and also in that, how do we extend that?

390
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:31,959
We can produce a seasonal forecast for the first one.

391
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:36,120
So it's going to be the base plus the trend. So we can.

392
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:44,310
Plus, the trend is taking hold for next year.

393
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:51,840
And then I'm going to add the last three of these numbers here, spending the previous ones.

394
01:12:55,090 --> 01:13:05,370
The last trend that I'm going to be on, we will try and do.

395
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:27,690
It is for. Okay.

396
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:36,450
So he's not really going to be my real friend right now.

397
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:40,880
I need to multiply that times. This is a lot of factors right in the.

398
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:58,200
Multiply that times the seasonal factor and they need to be equal to the whole focus and they want to see some of that.

399
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:12,570
And then repeated the. In their new book value.

400
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:23,250
We are looking for a long time over one.

401
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:57,890
Since. So I mean, to be the.

402
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:11,360
I just think we need to continue adding we.

403
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:45,520
Now, when praising Yeltsin, you simply highlight the scope of.

404
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:08,580
Because you if they say that they can also access it by the down arrow,

405
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:14,790
you can also get to the cell by just using the arrow keys as to just click on the mouse in Excel.

406
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:19,020
It will reset. Yeah, it's better because this is acting input.

407
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:27,760
Two. I cannot click in any.

408
01:16:51,180 --> 01:17:00,000
So I just highlighted, you know, I have my my form.

409
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:04,400
So let's see how how they look is.

410
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:11,760
London, three and four casualties in the community.

411
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:18,720
Can you show us the seasonal factors? We'll pass for volts.

412
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:22,830
I should in the same formula.

413
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:28,050
No, like there are you calculated the seasonal factors.

414
01:17:53,370 --> 01:18:02,430
Forecast for this time of year off by one.

415
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:08,510
For some reason, you know it's unchanged until you contract.

416
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:14,100
And remember that you get from opinion number two, right.

417
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:18,030
No opinion on that one because you have any team. All right.

418
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:30,000
So the last thing I'm going to do is I'm going just to plot these three important guys.

419
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:46,020
That's according to Patty. And so it's really something to work out.

420
01:18:49,810 --> 01:19:05,990
Yeah, it could be like 70.

421
01:19:24,030 --> 01:19:34,610
We have the names linked to the.

422
01:19:37,150 --> 01:20:02,450
That's convenient. These days, you use these and column names in the first row with its values, and that is what is more towards the younger business.

423
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:12,750
So. So because because apparently these series is is not too noisy.

424
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:22,110
So it's well, when homes is trying to do is follow that seasonality, it doesn't do that very well.

425
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:42,510
And so so right now, if I if I forecast these numbers, you'll see that a forecast that just the people that use the kind of straight line of the.

426
01:20:50,640 --> 01:21:01,240
The visuals and the sound.

427
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:14,900
Actually, this is the one that might just reduce our deficit to year.

428
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:28,340
This is a. New Orleans area music.

429
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:34,250
And then finally, the seasonal things and the whole seasonal work.

430
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:55,570
Season of BoJack cooking.

431
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:21,920
The plan is to shield people from on the line, as well as the blue, white and the blue followed around the yellow, light blue.

432
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:29,800
So those two are see the regression and seasonal forecasts on the whole seasonal forecast

433
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:39,010
to name a the very messy right that you and the one that is going in that you have

434
01:22:39,010 --> 01:22:47,350
now or you have now the predictions with the cold seasonal forecast and you have the

435
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:56,770
presage regression seasonal forecast from month to month before you read out of work.

436
01:22:57,070 --> 01:23:15,420
Right. And then to that, then you apply to the ABC with already the seasonal facts and the one that goes to Denver County on Thursday.

437
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:26,250
No, no, no. I think you're right.

438
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:36,280
Found. Andrew Sullivan.

439
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:47,540
Wow. I want to start by saying I'm surprised you didn't get me here.

440
01:23:47,570 --> 01:23:55,030
So how was your hunting trip? To the middle to average?

441
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:59,270
Do I go to my letter writers assignments? Yeah, they do.

442
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:04,730
So this year, you know what?

443
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:12,530
I don't know how to describe this military job, but it seems that.

444
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:33,340
Yeah, we're already at the heart of everything. I know if you trying to be this way know how to guard Indians, why are they trying to go after you?

445
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:43,340
Yeah. I love your record in the winter.

446
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:51,980
Oh, I know. That's like I just. Hold on.

447
01:24:53,320 --> 01:25:10,010
Yeah, I think I know what it's like to not know what you're going with.

448
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:44,650
Now, I see. When I was about six years old, when I was like, I don't know.

449
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:55,850
And I was I don't know.

450
01:25:56,930 --> 01:26:15,050
I guess I think, you know, how easy it was, right?

451
01:26:17,230 --> 01:26:43,050
I mean, I just decided to go online trying to find out, trying to create a new series.

452
01:26:43,330 --> 01:27:05,220
You know, I know how to make it look like.

453
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:28,200
So I was like trying to do that product.

454
01:27:32,450 --> 01:27:40,130
But not my way to say right now.

455
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:48,120
I want to be at that right now.

456
01:27:51,320 --> 01:28:08,990
Oh, okay. So I just to tell my back, just like you can take my parents.

457
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:17,350
My bad. I know that.

458
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:30,030
I know I might not even be.

459
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:53,900
Different people have different reasons for wanting a different person, and this year may have caused them to cancel everything else.

460
01:28:53,930 --> 01:28:58,230
I'd like to restore.
