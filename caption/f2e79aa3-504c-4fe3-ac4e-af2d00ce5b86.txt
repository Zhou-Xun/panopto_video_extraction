1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:09,300
Okay. Hello, everybody. Good morning.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,920
How'd the evaluation with Victoria go?

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:25,620
I'll meet with her tomorrow for a debrief. So I don't know anything that happened yet, but I'll talk to you about it on Thursday,

4
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:32,340
because just as a reminder, we don't have class on Tuesday because it is fall break here when you do.

5
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,820
I'll talk to you about it next. I like that.

6
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,290
An adult, you'll get the full time for the visit. Thank you for that. It you do have a midterm on Thursday.

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,110
So I will talk to you about the mid-term semester.

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,630
Feedback. Sorry, the Tuesday after.

9
00:00:52,050 --> 00:01:02,330
Words are hard today. I was I'm dog sitting again and I'm still not used to having something next to me.

10
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:12,089
And so I was awake for most of the night. And then at 1 a.m., she decides she's going to start like grooming me.

11
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,180
And I was like, go back to sleep. And then she did.

12
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:26,100
But oh, okay. So we'll be talking today more about water and different environmental justice issues.

13
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,770
And we have, I think, a pretty fun activity today that you'll do in pairs.

14
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:42,840
I put the link on the canvas announcement, don't pull it up right now because there's a lot of sound that goes with it, but we'll get to that today.

15
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,710
So I think we have two, four, six, eight.

16
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,690
We might have a group of three. We'll see. Okay. All righty.

17
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,740
And the owls working today? Yeah. Okay.

18
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,060
So just to recap again, why clean water matters in containing infectious disease outbreaks.

19
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,829
Still, though, today in 2022, sadly,

20
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:18,180
10% of the world does not have access to a good water source and 6% of deaths in low income countries are due to unsafe water sources.

21
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:25,470
And typically think people think about this as an issue outside of the United States, which for for a good chunk of it,

22
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:33,060
it is there's 2.1 billion people, 30% of the world that does not have access to safe drinking water.

23
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:42,120
So they might have access to water where they can like wash wash their clothes or like do some cleaning, but it's not safe enough to drink.

24
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,000
And then unsafe water is responsible for 1.2 million deaths each year,

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:59,579
mostly attributed to various infections and diseases people get as a result of that in terms of what it actually does, right?

26
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:06,810
Safe potable drinking water, curbing water borne zoonoses, hand hygiene, personal hygiene, plumbing and irritation.

27
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,149
And then if you recall back to week one,

28
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:17,610
so many of the decontaminating disinfectants we use are actually concentrated solutions that need to be diluted,

29
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:23,129
for example, like bleach or if you're using like what, an area ammonia.

30
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:31,590
So in order for those disinfectants and contaminants to be efficacious, you need to have clean water to make that solution.

31
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,600
So in terms of the Great Lakes region, right,

32
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:43,319
some of the biggest contributors of water contamination can be things like naturally occurring

33
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:52,260
ground substances where certain areas are just more naturally concentrated with heavy metals.

34
00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:02,400
And then animal waste, human waste sewage from both domestic and industrial processes, industrial manufacturing waste,

35
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:10,350
improperly disposed chemicals, pesticides, agricultural runoff waste injected deep into the underground.

36
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:19,860
So this is actually a practice that they do do in some areas where they might incinerate or liquefy the waste.

37
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:27,989
And then there's like not enough land, not enough land capacities, quote unquote, for them to put it somewhere.

38
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,860
So they'll inject it a couple hundred feet under the ground.

39
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:38,580
Mining activities. If you think about things like fracking, for example, that's become a huge issue.

40
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:46,560
Now, I have a friend who lives in the state of Oklahoma where that's one of the biggest states where they do like fracking.

41
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:58,380
Her gas is super cheap, but they have earthquakes all the time now just because they've disrupted the the plates and the mantle.

42
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:09,140
Oil pollution. Fossil fuels, urban development, leakage, underground activity, radioactive substances, acid rain and many more.

43
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:20,630
And so I want to focus on, you know, improperly disposed chemicals and hazardous waste in particular, once it's in the ground.

44
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,370
Right. Sometimes, you know, under the ground, we have something called water tables.

45
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,300
And then some states are fortunate enough to have aquifers.

46
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:37,700
So, for example, in the state of Nebraska, they didn't have a lot going for them, but what they had was great tasting tap water.

47
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,330
It was so good and it was so clean because they had an aquifer directly under the state that they drew from,

48
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,309
which is a great benefit and it doesn't immediately replenish itself.

49
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,640
It does take a very, very, very long time. But what's the main way,

50
00:05:54,890 --> 00:06:01,490
if we want to get rid of like chemicals and hazardous waste from the ground and

51
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:07,180
like and then subsequently seeping into the water tables and the water supply,

52
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:14,900
how do we how do how do we reverse that? You mean by the time you drink it?

53
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,860
Like the chlorination. I mean, how do you just get this stuff out of the environment?

54
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:27,640
I feel like sometimes there's like I've heard of, like you can put something in that absorbs that, okay.

55
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,940
You do remediation, like you take out all this oil. Oil.

56
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay. Have you heard of anything else discussed in your class classes?

57
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:44,320
So the big has been the primary way is actually excavation.

58
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:50,320
It's it's fine. It's probably the fastest and the most cost effective.

59
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,650
Okay. Another method that I don't know.

60
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,520
How many of you have ever heard of Fido remediation.

61
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,230
I see. Some had not. What is it, sweetie?

62
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,200
Uh, I think they use, like, algae.

63
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,660
No light to micro-organisms to isolate. Okay.

64
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:28,650
That's a step on the right track. Other. Other anyone else have heard of fight over mediation before.

65
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,280
So yeah. I mean, yeah, algae rape, environmental remediation is primarily use.

66
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,260
Oh, you really? So that again is sunlight.

67
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,450
Really sunlight in a very indirect way.

68
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:52,219
So if you think about you might have like lands that are heavily contaminated with lead in the soil freeze or something like that.

69
00:07:52,220 --> 00:08:00,830
Right. Phyto remediation is essentially using plants and strategically planting plants because they will uptake,

70
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,610
you know, through the process of photosynthesis and sunlight.

71
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,930
They will uptake some of these heavier metals in the ground.

72
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:17,989
So sunflowers, for example, are a great candidate for phyto remediation and it hasn't really picked up here in the United States,

73
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,170
but they're starting to use it in Australia, for example.

74
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,499
And you there's some interesting studies if you want to look it up where the essentially plant fields in

75
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:34,490
fields of sunflowers on like a site that they know has heavy metals in the ground or hazardous waste.

76
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:41,240
And then essentially the roots and the stem of the plants draw in that material.

77
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,100
And then you can like cut down the plants and then incinerate them or do whatever you want.

78
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,090
But the thing with that, a deal, it seems like a great concept, right?

79
00:08:50,720 --> 00:09:00,770
And it seems very like eco friendly, but it just takes a very, very, very long time, like at like 5 to 10 years, right?

80
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:07,639
Whereas like coming in with a giant like claw thing and then just like digging out all the soil until you hit

81
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,490
the point where there's no more contaminated soil and then dumping in new soil as a as a much quicker solution.

82
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:24,349
So sources of water pollution, water pollution in particular, you know, depending on who you talk to, they classify this differently.

83
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:30,620
But we're going to put them into four categories of ocean water, groundwater point source and then surface water.

84
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:39,890
So we just talked about some groundwater contamination, but then also there's frequently oil spills, sludge, all this kind of stuff.

85
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:51,200
Anyone remember the the Gulf Coast spill that took like a good ten years to clean up point source are

86
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,950
anything like industrial runoff and then surface are generally from farms livestock and stuff like that.

87
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:09,489
So if we're thinking about common waterborne pathogens, generally the sites of infection will go in through any of the following.

88
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:20,740
It doesn't necessarily prefer one over the other, although in this case ingestion is the most common route for contaminated water.

89
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,679
And then in this in particular,

90
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:32,050
generally people might ingest contaminated water through recreational activities like your kayaking, swimming, for example.

91
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:38,200
Health care facilities, food prepared with contaminated such as a contaminated water,

92
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:44,950
consumption of contaminated fish, and then direct dermal contact with contaminated water.

93
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:55,359
And then in particular, the common classes of viruses, parasites and bacteria that we generally see in water are things like norovirus,

94
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,629
adenoviruses of viruses, astral viruses, simple viruses for parasites.

95
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:10,000
You have cryptosporidium, schistosomiasis and then bacteria salmonella, cholera, e coli, shigella.

96
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:17,980
All of these generally cause very violent diarrhea and then subsequent dehydration.

97
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:26,469
In this class that I talk to you all about, the raw water movement that's happening, that's my other class.

98
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,790
Okay? Can't keep it straight. So I see some head shake.

99
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,010
So no one's heard about the raw water movement.

100
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:42,280
Part of it is now there's this I think I told you in this class, there's rather rhetoric going around about how floor chlorinated water is bad.

101
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,080
So with like the same if you can imagine,

102
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:53,800
like the Venn diagram of people who don't want to get vaccinated because they think you're adding

103
00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:00,309
unnatural substances into your body and the people who don't want to drink treated water,

104
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:13,750
it's like there's a good overlap. So now I would say in the more like affluent, wealthier, like influencer culture, there is a raw water movement.

105
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:20,290
So the think like, you know, the people who might aspire to like Gwyneth Paltrow's goop things,

106
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:26,590
there's a Zac Efron show that out on Netflix where he like does different outdoor things.

107
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,030
And I watched the episode on Raw Water and that's when I first found out about it.

108
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:40,600
So people now don't think that treated water is good for the body because they do add in things like fluoridation and

109
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:48,870
then it might be treated through ultraviolet germicidal irradiation to like get out the bacteria and fecal coliform.

110
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,010
So people are like, we hate this.

111
00:12:51,880 --> 00:13:04,180
So they are drinking water, raw water sources and you see a guy taking just like a glass bottle and dipping it directly into a stream and drinking it.

112
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:10,089
And then I think his guest that episode, I forget it was like some other celebrity,

113
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:18,910
but they had a raw water connoisseur who came to give them all these different samples and some taste, more soya or whatever.

114
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,049
And and then they had like a lack of urologists come and talk about the guy who is

115
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,879
drinking from the stream directly like this isn't like emergency situation solid.

116
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:38,740
We're stranded in nature. Right. And she was like, you know, like deer probably like pooped in that like fish poop in that water.

117
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,580
But now in these marketplaces, like,

118
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:48,190
I don't know if any of you have heard of Erawan it's a very boujee L.A. grocery

119
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:53,860
store where they sell like fresh pressed juices for like $40 and stuff like that.

120
00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:00,790
They sell glass bottles of raw water now for like 20, 30 blocks.

121
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,150
It's really. It's wild.

122
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,900
Uh huh, yeah.

123
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,780
So I feel like. Yeah, yeah. As public have Lexi just let, like, show.

124
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:23,820
I just. Oh, Paige, it's like if the water isn't, like, clean, are there like, things floating in it?

125
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,270
Like, on the bottom? Yeah, like in like in there.

126
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,409
Well, I mean, I'm guessing in erosion, they, like, put it put it through a sieve.

127
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,940
At least it's not the same. Putting it through a sieve is not the same as filtering it.

128
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,490
But some people really like in natural aspect.

129
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:49,360
I mean, like if I was like, you know, Leonardo DiCaprio in that movie where he like got there by the bear, right?

130
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:57,760
Like, okay, like I and if I was in that situation, everything with the movie and I had to drink raw water, I might like dig.

131
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:03,460
Dig, dig, dig for like a clean layer of snow and, like, let it melt.

132
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:13,180
But I feel like I know too much to partake in that phenomena in I'm is I'm just confused.

133
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,090
Like, how is the FDA allowing this? Like, is this number regulated?

134
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,149
No. Oh, no, no, no.

135
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:30,430
This doesn't part this doesn't fall under the Clean Water Act because that relates to like standards for municipalities in terms of like public water.

136
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:38,380
So this is kind of seen the same way as like natural supplements and like anything like that that like,

137
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:46,660
you know, supplements are not regulated by the FDA. So this is kind of seen like now people are drinking like college in powders

138
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,160
and like there was a trend where people were drinking chlorophyl for a while,

139
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:57,580
which is literally for plants. And so this is all like unregulated.

140
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,059
It's kind of like buy at your own risk situation.

141
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,140
I feel like it should come with a warning label. Yeah, those are the ones that we.

142
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,480
Yeah. Our job as public health professionals, I would say, is becoming increasingly challenging.

143
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,730
So yeah, like I mentioned, these are all common waterborne infections.

144
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:25,420
Um. To my knowledge, I have never had oh, no, I have had norovirus.

145
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,790
I was like, I don't think I've had any of these. I did have norovirus.

146
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:35,740
I got it from a local pizza place, a pizza buffet in in when I was living in Bloomington.

147
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:42,489
And interestingly there, because the public health department, local public health department didn't have enough resources.

148
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:47,440
So I called, you know, Monroe County to be like, hey,

149
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:56,139
I got mad food poisoning and so did my partner from like Avery's pizza buffet and on college have.

150
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:03,010
And they were like, thanks for calling, but we don't have like enough resources to do anything with this information.

151
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:10,329
But then I went to work like a few days later and they were like, I know, like I talked to like three other people who got sick from that.

152
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:21,580
Avery So anyway, all right, one in particular that is a huge issue is Legionella.

153
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:35,980
And what this is actually the start of the what we know was Legionella did begin in the Great Lakes region and it is a pretty new infection.

154
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:42,310
So this outbreak started in 1976 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

155
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:51,640
So they were celebrating the 200 year anniversary, the bicentennial commemoration of the Declaration of Independence.

156
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,129
So they had about 4000 attendees at this conference and they met at the end of July.

157
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:07,420
So it was like pretty hot in Philly. And what they started to realize was that there were about once they figured out what it was,

158
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:13,389
they ended up being 221 cases and 34 deaths by the first week of August.

159
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:20,110
So within like a span of 1 to 2 weeks. But originally they did not know what it was.

160
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:27,189
So this physician named Ernest Campbell, who lived in Pennsylvania, was the first to recognize this pattern of symptoms.

161
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:33,220
Among the conference attendees, he notified the Pennsylvania Department of Public Health and CDC,

162
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:42,730
and then the CDC tried to investigate for us, like, was this bioterrorism, was this foul play or was it microorganisms or toxins?

163
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:49,360
And so this bacteria had never been seen before by scientists.

164
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,950
So they called it Legionella, which we now know is not the best way to call it.

165
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:59,320
Right. But that's what they named it, because it was held at the American Legion conference.

166
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,850
And there is, you know, a more scientific name for it.

167
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,960
But I don't think anybody hardly recognizes that. I don't even know it off the top of my head.

168
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:17,890
But essentially the culprit was this bacteria was breeding in a cooling tower from the hotel's air conditioning system.

169
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,050
And frequently Legionella will live in things like cooling towers, hot tubs.

170
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:38,650
Yeah, all that good stuff. In the decade of 2007 to 2060, 17, 60 million Americans did not have access to drinking water.

171
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:45,940
That is a lot. A lot. Okay. Almost a fifth between a fifth to a six of the population.

172
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:53,920
And again, it's generally low income communities of color because of these environmental

173
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,630
racism issues where they're disproportionately exposed to polluted waters.

174
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:06,070
And when the EPA lowers its standards for levels of acceptable exposures for things like PE fires,

175
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:11,140
it does hurt environmental justice affected communities the most.

176
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:20,410
And recently in the last administration, a lot of EPA standards were indeed lowered.

177
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,840
And yes, I mean, obviously, clean water is essential.

178
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:33,190
So again, we talked a little bit about Benton Harbor and we saw them on the map when we played with that, like, genius thing.

179
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,900
But let's watch a video about what's going on there because, you know,

180
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:44,080
we watched that little Good Morning America inspirational video about Little Miss Flint.

181
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,260
But this one has a bit of a different tone.

182
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:56,290
It's a little bit more informative. So let's take a look at the overall physical infrastructure.

183
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:04,000
What Michigan see is an example of how badly needed and how communities of color are often the last to

184
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:11,890
receive it and then harbor where the water is undrinkable and residents anger is at a boiling point.

185
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:19,140
But the people of Benton Harbor I knew morning tea.

186
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,320
Decision there. They need to get their hands on bottled water.

187
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,660
Who are you to drink with?

188
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:38,540
Tap water because of high levels of blood. So you have to earn a living truckloads of bottled water to this small city.

189
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:47,770
For Lake Michigan three to buy a two year old granddaughter, Kinsley got into line an hour and a half before your distribution started.

190
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:54,650
I never had. You know, I think it it is this is not real money.

191
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,280
It is just not. Wow, that Mary Pearl grew up reading the tap water.

192
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:04,270
But a few years ago, she gave a sense that something wasn't right.

193
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:11,230
Going to get out of the shower. These are really the issues.

194
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,110
Last year, Pat had water fountains contain more than 100 parts per million.

195
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:25,800
What the federal regulations say action must be taken that of just 15 billion and you use as a filter.

196
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:32,710
Turner was provided by the state house to health officials warned that the current levels may be too high.

197
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:39,880
Were all questions like about mental health?

198
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,920
I was wrong. I was part of my normal life.

199
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:51,000
And I don't want to know now because I want you to read between the lines.

200
00:22:51,010 --> 00:23:03,520
She got her own issues when I on the Centers for Disease Control of her children because I think it's been resolved in earning your problems.

201
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:17,700
How does that make you feel? I feel I feel stupid, though, because just I can get through this sincerely and trust my mayor because he said,

202
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:30,700
really, you know, this would have been her her in November 2013.

203
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:48,340
So for 20 years or more, you high blood levels, seven consecutive passes protected by the state for three read more.

204
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:55,090
That's why every morning and why you're here and why you're here.

205
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:07,240
You knew that we used to be thinking of distributing bottled water since 2019.

206
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:13,360
In September this year, the federal government mental protection agency to take emergency action.

207
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:23,790
Agency issued its warning about the DMCA.

208
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:33,850
We will work. Who will have resources to deal with the problem?

209
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,190
Myself. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer's pledge.

210
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:45,250
You know, a small city like the harbor, you kind of got off the map.

211
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,020
So we're at the behest and mercy of the state of Michigan.

212
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:59,500
Right. Where and how concerned are you that they were left in the law?

213
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:16,210
We need you. You were saying only that you think you need to know up and out the lot of the law, you know, for the pandemic.

214
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:25,690
I'm not sure what to say. She's been a city commissioner for ten years and it's the professionals for feeling this moment on their own.

215
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:36,130
Once it was detected, I was being really angry about it because I know, I know they may be up against me.

216
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,540
We need somebody to get us what we say we mean.

217
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:52,090
We have to be able to win immunity. Rebellion is just another case out of the hospital.

218
00:25:52,460 --> 00:26:04,420
More broadly speaking, residents of Flint Rule, that city was led in 2014.

219
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:19,660
The city has had a daughter with harbor, mother, baby, and they know that if they actually do greater harm with a decision like that and her between.

220
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:35,880
She was like late, late. And I wonder whether the older daughter then when she did say, when you watch, I'll take all of the rain they would get.

221
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:47,640
And in the end, rendering line or may not want others to think they're laying on top of the medications after he sucks up.

222
00:26:49,290 --> 00:27:01,800
And since they chose Vermeer, many of them believe he's left high and dry after decades.

223
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,870
That's why the schools are struggling quite high,

224
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:15,600
and nearly half the population lives in poverty right across the river to the neighboring city of San Jose.

225
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:24,090
It's a contrast of a majority white city downtown and safe drinking water.

226
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:33,660
We're not talking about things like Josephine Baker, big picnics, the long view history manufacturer pipeline,

227
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:40,350
so-called white wine, white farmer struggles with crumbling infrastructure.

228
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:51,860
That is history. While most residents might suspect not environmental racism, we will look at it.

229
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:57,750
Look around. And I know I'll always talk about how beautiful things will be.

230
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:03,750
It was like, you know, you're going to be me.

231
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:11,430
You're going to be here. You know? You know, all this would happen by my neighborhood, even though they don't care.

232
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,880
We will learn normal patterns so people can drink.

233
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,309
And I'm not allowed out here in the city.

234
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:24,180
Manager. Quiet down. Why are we paying for bailing water?

235
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:38,740
And availability is very high. Meanwhile, well, everything this place pulls out of services in the next two months.

236
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:48,310
It's like it's going to cost some $30 a of the to help pay for these regular events in the town.

237
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:56,050
That's about an hour an hour water in Michigan on the way.

238
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,420
These are the communities that we are.

239
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:06,430
I do not believe that these local communities in the state of Michigan or across areas where we're going to find out what we're done for them,

240
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:15,520
it's not enough. I mean I mean, I want to take a bath, the 33 over 2002.

241
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:19,860
But at the same time. Ah, yeah.

242
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:25,840
Yeah. What is what is your life like in the meantime?

243
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,370
Benton Harbor ten continue to pay the price for the PBS News.

244
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:36,470
I'm John Yang, Michigan. Okay.

245
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:48,570
That's her reactions to that Honda. I had a very similar thought to this thinking about things.

246
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,549
So even just like replacing the line,

247
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:59,280
it doesn't address the issue of like the pipes that go to an individual's house that have already been like corroded with lead.

248
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:06,790
Right? So the part of me is like, okay, but it doesn't actually it stops probably like your mouth or like you can't run.

249
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:11,940
Like, how do you address that part? Because I feel like no one's ever talked about that.

250
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:22,200
Yeah. So obviously, like when, where? Well, when they're replacing lines, it depends on the concentration of the level.

251
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:28,410
So for the most part, they'll take care of like the main lines that run from the water treatment plant through like the main thoroughfares,

252
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,090
and then they might go in and dig up lead pipes in certain neighborhoods.

253
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:39,030
So then rather like, I don't know, like 30, 50 miles of contaminated lead pipe at that point,

254
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:48,150
you've only got maybe like five miles of contaminated by pipe left that might bring it below that acceptable 15 parts per billion.

255
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:55,319
The EPA is a little bit different than OSHA regulations because I think I mentioned very

256
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,520
briefly in this class with in terms of occupational safety and health protections,

257
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,080
they have not been updated since the 1970s for workers.

258
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:11,940
So when you're aiming for OSHA standards, you're really aiming for like a C grade or a D grade, whereas the EPA,

259
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:19,920
with barring exception two administrations changing the limits, they do try to update those regularly.

260
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:29,910
But I think that it's unfair and untenable to put the burden on the homeowner themselves to replace like their water piping in their house.

261
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:34,340
It should be like subsidized or like rebated or fully funded by it.

262
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:38,190
Right, by the government. I never heard of that program. Yeah.

263
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,730
Even here, they're like to replace the city pipeline.

264
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,730
And I'm like the city pipelines are not the individual residents.

265
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:52,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And if she was getting 100, like, I'm imagining that her pipes are not great.

266
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:59,370
Oh, yeah, no, no, for sure. And like in the video, it showed, like, the houses are falling apart, crumbling infrastructure.

267
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:05,249
These are all, again, very common because of a divestment in colors, communities of color.

268
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:15,270
So it is a very structural issue, figuratively but also literally other thoughts or comments to this video.

269
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:23,610
Okay. I put you had a reading, but I don't know why I did.

270
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,030
So we're just going to get that. Okay.

271
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:38,970
Air pollution now. So the major contributors of air pollution, which you've taken down to Batman's class, where he talks about this stuff.

272
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,630
Dr. Divine just class. Okay.

273
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:46,740
Have you talked about air pollution in any of your classes? Okay.

274
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:50,490
Who's teaching that now? Chemical.

275
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,770
Yeah. Oh, with Meeker and Dr. Devine, she came in to teach a guest lecture.

276
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:59,780
Okay. Okay, cool. All right, so this isn't like radio.

277
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:03,120
I was like, oh, you want to help? Okay. Or a lot of you.

278
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:13,390
So we have particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone.

279
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:21,750
We still have these heavy metals, benzene, biological aerosols, polycyclic hydrocarbon, greenhouse gases, pollen, mold.

280
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,610
The whole nine yards here. Right. And obviously, in your other classes,

281
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:35,040
you talked about how some of these in particular are contributors to global warming and the degradation of the ozone layer.

282
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:45,749
So in air pollutants don't necessarily have as clear like as visibly clear of a

283
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:51,510
relationship between infectious diseases like vectors do like a got bit by a

284
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:56,700
mosquito carrying the Zika virus and I have Zika virus so like I drink some bad

285
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,950
water and I accidentally like swallowed some that had giardia and I have giardia.

286
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:11,969
So in terms of air pollutants and the linkage to infectious diseases, it's a little bit more multistep, so to speak.

287
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:20,010
So in the sense that air pollutants impact the transmission and severity of respiratory viral infections.

288
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:30,720
So when you have a high concentration of air pollutants in the environment, like in Detroit, for example, that causes oxidative stress on your body.

289
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:35,790
And when you have greater oxidative stress, it releases something called free radicals.

290
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:39,420
And in turn, that can damage the respiratory system.

291
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,180
And when your respiratory system is damage,

292
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:52,530
it is less resistant to bacterial and viral infections because your lungs may not be as elastic, resilient, etc.

293
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:58,320
So literature clearly states this clear association between the concentration of

294
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,020
pollutants in the air and human respiratory viruses creating adverse effects.

295
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,630
Generally, how many of you bother to look at the air quality index?

296
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:17,850
You do need to know and it's like the weather. And yeah, I just look at like how it's looking like a daily page.

297
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,639
I was in Denver a couple of summers ago and they want us to like kind of check it pretty frequently.

298
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,090
Like there are days where they like recommended staying inside. Yeah.

299
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,800
Was it because the altitude there is also thinner, a higher.

300
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:41,190
So yeah, I generally don't track unless I'm starting to feel bad, but generally that is like a high pollen day or something like that.

301
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:48,630
But people who may be asthmatic, for example, or already have respiratory infections and are more sensitive to this,

302
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,520
definitely regularly check the air quality index in Sacramento where my parents live,

303
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,129
for example, there are frequent days where they say like it is in the unhealthy,

304
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:07,530
very unhealthy zone just because of all the wildfires that have been happening in Northern California and because Sacramento is in a valley,

305
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:16,979
when when the air flow as it settles into the valley, so it can lead to very hazardous conditions.

306
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:24,360
But in addition to creating stress to the lungs, it also creates stress on your heart and eye irritation.

307
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:34,110
And as we talked about before, once it gets in is the particulate matter is small enough, excuse me and reaches is the deep lungs and the alveoli,

308
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:41,700
the the layer of gas exchange between that it's very thin and can quickly enter your circulatory system.

309
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:47,700
So in this study by Domingo and Rivera from 2020,

310
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:57,959
they try to look at the link between air pollution and severe viral respiratory disease in about 10 to 20% of the infected population.

311
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:06,600
So this was very early in the COVID pandemic because they looked at China, Italy and Portugal before it became like global widespread.

312
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:16,530
And they found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, because of how small and airborne it actually is, can also.

313
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:24,799
Not only transmit like into your body, but also serve as a suitable transporter for air pollutant particles.

314
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:33,260
So not only are you getting a little SARS-CoV-2 when you're inhaling it, you know, some air pollutants hitched a ride along with it,

315
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:38,600
and pollutants in particular impair your upper respiratory tract where things

316
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:43,640
would have naturally been filtered out by the first line of defense like cilia.

317
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:56,720
In this study, looking at the Great Lakes region by martinis at all, they looked at health disparities attributable to the Detroit metropolitan area.

318
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,760
And based on their data and epidemiological analysis,

319
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:12,709
they calculated that air pollution in Detroit was responsible more for more than 10,000 disability adjusted life years per year,

320
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:17,090
with an annual impact of $6.5 billion.

321
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:24,260
And of course, this disproportionately affects Hispanic and Latin communities and low income populations

322
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:29,270
because of their proximity to things like industrial emissions and traffic emissions.

323
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:39,200
There was a higher prevalence of asthma in this community and premature mortality and hospitalizations from chronic respiratory infections.

324
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:50,660
Okay. So like we said, these folks are air pollution and environmental justice in particular.

325
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:56,030
They live generally in areas of high pollutants and are more prone to illness,

326
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:01,880
depressing their immune system over time, leaving them vulnerable to a whole host of infectious diseases.

327
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:09,050
And they also may likely reside in a medical desert so they don't have equitable access to health care.

328
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:20,270
So it's just like layers on layers of structural issues compounding to essentially exacerbate the issue of infectious diseases.

329
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:28,749
So before we move on to that activity, any thoughts regarding environmental justice?

330
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:32,260
And we talked about vectors, water and air.

331
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,860
Okay. All right.

332
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:41,770
So we have six. Okay. Okay.

333
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:49,450
So open your canvas. And in the announcements, you'll find the link to the activity for the week.

334
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:55,810
This is like a game created by the CDC and it's called Solve the Outbreak.

335
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:02,530
I tried to pick the topics most appropriate within the scope of this class.

336
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:06,460
So essentially you and your partner and I think there will be one group of three

337
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,460
will go through this game and see if you can actually solve the outbreak.

338
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,230
And you're going to discuss that with among yourselves.

339
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:23,920
And I'm asking you to have someone be the reporter and then report out, number one, what your case actually was,

340
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:30,850
what the circumstances were, what clues did you get and did you actually solve it?

341
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:39,520
Okay. So for a group one, I'm going to have Lexie and Burnley, you're going to be breathless in the Midwest.

342
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:47,640
Ian and Paige group to the Queen's killer, Adrianna and Huddah.

343
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:54,370
You're going to do the case of the Conference Blues Kang and Abby.

344
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,400
You'll do Sugar Plantation Blues.

345
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:03,489
Chloe and Mira, you'll do Hiding in Plain Sight.

346
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:06,580
Oh, perfect. This worked out perfectly. Plus hiding in plain sight.

347
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,780
And then swap the inside Hilliard deadlier than war.

348
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,490
Okay. Go. Go with your patterns.

349
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:29,090
Do you know this woman?

350
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:40,360
I think this one. Okay. Oh, that's excellent.

351
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:52,970
Oh. I know I'm going to write down the notes as.

352
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:14,760
Oh, yes. Let me give. Is anyone having trouble accessing their case?

353
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:24,050
Okay. Cool. To become an artist.

354
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:40,700
I like that song. We would to that an.

355
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:51,080
They wanted us to be able to do it. Yeah. Yeah.

356
00:42:52,840 --> 00:43:00,040
Yeah. How long do we have to. I don't know, like 15, 20 minutes or until people start talking.

357
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,790
You're good. No rush. It's good to be you.

358
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:21,460
Yeah. Right now, there are several articles about the matter in the U.S.

359
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:36,070
Number eight. And so I didn't ask you. There is something in the sense that there is a that number one on the record in this country

360
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:49,200
has always been that it was the right thing for me to be different and something to think about.

361
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,830
When they first. Oh.

362
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:06,760
And if they know what they attended, what they did, and if they know others, there's no.

363
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,900
We don't have lab results.

364
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:23,433
We have to come up with 50 years later the idea that if we reach 15 and I think that's all right, just call it whatever it is.

365
00:44:24,553 --> 00:44:29,103
Yeah. Okey dokey.

366
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:35,433
All right. I can't wait to hear all about it.

367
00:44:36,813 --> 00:44:41,823
Because I went through them, but I've never done any of the exercises myself.

368
00:44:42,483 --> 00:44:47,243
So how about we start with the Queens killer?

369
00:44:47,253 --> 00:44:49,083
Because you seem to be dead pretty fast.

370
00:44:50,043 --> 00:45:01,503
Please share with us your case and what you've solved of Funny because it started off like the first symptoms they discussed.

371
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:04,983
We were like, Oh, I'm looking at encephalitis. And it wasn't like this.

372
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:12,183
And then what were the symptoms? There was stiffness, headaches and some other neurological symptoms.

373
00:45:12,393 --> 00:45:17,103
Okay. Um. Emotions escalated.

374
00:45:17,373 --> 00:45:24,093
Why was it called the Queens Killer? Um, it was primarily in Queens borough of New York City.

375
00:45:24,393 --> 00:45:29,553
Eventually, it was like a couple of cases in the Bronx and whatever as it progressed.

376
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:33,213
But where did it come from? Um.

377
00:45:33,723 --> 00:45:38,293
Okay, that was it.

378
00:45:38,463 --> 00:45:43,413
There was like two potential sources in the beginning, and then it was kind of like narrowed down to one.

379
00:45:44,133 --> 00:45:48,752
They thought it was mosquitos, like just for mosquitoes. And then there were reports of like dead birds.

380
00:45:48,753 --> 00:45:57,663
So they're like, Oh, the mosquitoes are birds. And then turned out to be mosquitoes infecting the birds, which the mosquitoes.

381
00:45:58,023 --> 00:46:06,153
And it was. Well. So for the human cases, it was San Luis encephalitis, and then for the birds it was West Nile.

382
00:46:06,573 --> 00:46:12,513
So there were actually two culprits at play, and they didn't realize that it was two different things going on.

383
00:46:12,573 --> 00:46:16,203
Okay. Yeah. You all have that fast.

384
00:46:17,463 --> 00:46:22,053
Think about a career in investigation and infectious diseases.

385
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:26,873
How about breathless in the Midwest? Yeah.

386
00:46:27,393 --> 00:46:31,723
Yeah. I feel like probably everybody is. It was like this evolving story.

387
00:46:31,773 --> 00:46:43,153
So Zeke is a musician that was teaching a workshop class, a drum workshop, and he got sick, but he also just came back from a trip in Africa.

388
00:46:43,203 --> 00:46:47,213
So there was the first question is, do we get it from Africa reenactment of evidence.

389
00:46:47,623 --> 00:46:52,563
And so clearly they were trying to experience severe disruption and clearly got it from vacation.

390
00:46:53,043 --> 00:47:02,223
And yeah, but we continued. And then there was like a threat of bioterrorism in Chicago, too, so.

391
00:47:02,223 --> 00:47:08,133
And then some government employees were getting sick. Yeah, the American years had a lot going on.

392
00:47:08,253 --> 00:47:11,793
Yeah. Yeah. But yeah.

393
00:47:11,793 --> 00:47:16,593
So winding through all this, it happened to be the anthrax was coming from the drums.

394
00:47:17,073 --> 00:47:23,733
And as he was playing the drums, spores were being sent of the workshop where they sheepskin drums.

395
00:47:24,253 --> 00:47:27,753
Yeah. Yeah, that was it. But the whole time, glitzy.

396
00:47:27,753 --> 00:47:30,203
Never like. Is it contagious? Is anthrax contagious?

397
00:47:30,213 --> 00:47:34,833
They could be more people can spread it from person to person, but it can be spread through the spores.

398
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:45,063
So once you inhale it. Treatable with a, you know, clindamycin and some other antibiotics.

399
00:47:45,063 --> 00:47:48,513
But you have to know you have it right. Okay. Thank you.

400
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:52,383
Case of the Conference Blues. Do you need more time? Yeah.

401
00:47:52,483 --> 00:48:00,813
Okay, so there is a conference that's in Atlanta that I think 75 people attended or something.

402
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:06,153
And there's like an outbreak or something that people are getting sick.

403
00:48:06,363 --> 00:48:09,723
And so we were called in to investigate what's going on.

404
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:16,383
And we get a list of like 15 people who are sick from the organizer and the vendor

405
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:21,093
who like made the food and like a list of all the items that were available.

406
00:48:21,573 --> 00:48:24,962
And so we're able to talk to ten of the people.

407
00:48:24,963 --> 00:48:28,502
And with that, we figure out what events they attended.

408
00:48:28,503 --> 00:48:33,903
And we're like, okay, where were they most likely exposed? All ten of them attended the welcome event, and that's the only one.

409
00:48:33,903 --> 00:48:38,042
We're all kind of in attendance and it seems like it would be the first event.

410
00:48:38,043 --> 00:48:44,573
So we selected that and then we chose the next person.

411
00:48:47,913 --> 00:48:52,073
If you are seeking to run this initiative.

412
00:48:52,463 --> 00:49:00,053
And the minister said that he is so happy that what we find out is that some fantastic results

413
00:49:00,503 --> 00:49:05,503
that they're finding out that more people have been exposed than we go to like the police,

414
00:49:05,513 --> 00:49:08,333
we're supposed to interview everyone else to be like, what did you eat?

415
00:49:08,933 --> 00:49:15,833
And so we come up with a survey for the 75 people and we find out that 25 people are, in fact, six more than what we had originally thought.

416
00:49:16,163 --> 00:49:28,563
And we cut they recalculated the attack rate and the relative risk, and it was pretty high for the lasagna in the spitting image.

417
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:34,582
So we selected both of those. And then there was the common ingredient of spinach.

418
00:49:34,583 --> 00:49:40,223
And at this point, results come back and it says the whole night and we have the lot numbers still on the bag.

419
00:49:40,223 --> 00:49:43,683
We went back to the. The caterer.

420
00:49:44,973 --> 00:49:49,173
And from there we are. Sorry. I'm so tired.

421
00:49:49,293 --> 00:49:55,053
It's okay. And then it was like, okay, what do you do moving forward?

422
00:49:55,173 --> 00:49:59,793
Because there are these 12 other cases that have a different strains of equalize that are elsewhere.

423
00:49:59,853 --> 00:50:00,273
Sure.

424
00:50:00,573 --> 00:50:07,802
What should the FDA incorrectly suggested for the FDA to, like, go to the facility there like but you still don't know about these other 12 cases.

425
00:50:07,803 --> 00:50:18,603
So we took a detour. And the spin is we find out that the 12 cases are from spinach as well, even though it's a different strain.

426
00:50:18,633 --> 00:50:24,662
Yeah. Yeah. And then we had to figure out what was causing that outbreak of Ebola.

427
00:50:24,663 --> 00:50:27,783
And so the towns that are near this farm.

428
00:50:27,813 --> 00:50:31,743
Yes. It is like a fence that prevents them from getting to like a creek.

429
00:50:32,133 --> 00:50:38,313
And the farmer uses treated water, but there's been flooding.

430
00:50:38,943 --> 00:50:41,522
And so it was like, what do you think is causing it?

431
00:50:41,523 --> 00:50:48,903
And we're like, the flooding is causing like the like people contamination from the cows to then spread into the field and and.

432
00:50:49,683 --> 00:50:53,823
Interesting. Thank you. Sorry. That's okay.

433
00:50:54,483 --> 00:50:57,553
The cost of. So it's a gamble. Like stuff.

434
00:50:57,573 --> 00:51:00,633
It just seems like always a gamble to eat healthy, isn't it?

435
00:51:00,783 --> 00:51:05,883
It's always that a romaine lettuce, I fear sprouts.

436
00:51:05,883 --> 00:51:10,623
Alfalfa sprouts. Yeah, that's a different situation. Thank you.

437
00:51:11,073 --> 00:51:15,393
Sugar plantation blues. Oh, sure.

438
00:51:15,483 --> 00:51:26,403
All right. So this scenario takes place on a sugar plantation in Louisiana in the middle of summer.

439
00:51:26,453 --> 00:51:28,553
So it's a very hot and humid.

440
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:44,953
So after working for just two days on this plantation, a fair amount of the workers started getting symptoms like fever symptoms,

441
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:53,203
but they went to the doctor and doctors like I would just take some time and um,

442
00:51:54,043 --> 00:51:58,693
and for the most part they were all right except for one of the workers named where he was.

443
00:51:59,143 --> 00:52:00,493
He had to be hospitalized.

444
00:52:00,923 --> 00:52:12,493
Um, so it was concerning, um, asked us like, what we should do first because they mentioned that all the workers like, um, shared water bottles.

445
00:52:12,493 --> 00:52:18,343
They took them to the lake. So my head was like, oh, no, later.

446
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:29,353
But. The doctor was looking at her hair and he was thinking, oh, it could be meningitis.

447
00:52:31,123 --> 00:52:36,853
So initially I thought, okay, maybe we should test the drinking water and.

448
00:52:37,583 --> 00:52:45,503
But apparently the first thing to do in this situation was to discuss with the sex workers.

449
00:52:48,263 --> 00:52:53,393
So after we interviewed them, we were able to get a lot more information about.

450
00:52:54,313 --> 00:53:04,273
There are many activities leading up to this illness, and it appears that the majority of the owners this quarter,

451
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:15,433
based on one of the three, feels so long after we looked at the people that.

452
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:24,383
In this specific field. Things kind of took a sharp turn.

453
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:30,303
They went into a coma. Oh. Oh. Oh, yeah.

454
00:53:33,003 --> 00:53:39,713
Oh. So the doctors are like, oh, this might be rabies.

455
00:53:41,393 --> 00:53:48,683
Oh, yeah. And they mentioned, like, oh, he just has a scar that could be from my body.

456
00:53:49,073 --> 00:53:55,353
So. We were asked like where we think you would have reviews and reviews.

457
00:53:55,363 --> 00:54:05,443
Generally, he doesn't show symptoms for quite a while, so it would have been before he started working at this specific plantation.

458
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:12,222
Um, so, yeah, they, they tested him for rabies.

459
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:20,683
The results came back positive. I know. And they called his mom and she was like, Oh, yeah, he was bitten by a vampire bat a few months ago.

460
00:54:20,933 --> 00:54:34,753
Um, so, you know, unfortunately, in a way, um, so, yeah, but the thing is, he is from Guatemala.

461
00:54:36,853 --> 00:54:41,693
Plantations know like, oh, well, where is he getting this rabies from?

462
00:54:41,713 --> 00:54:48,913
So they're looking at his where he lives and they're.

463
00:54:50,443 --> 00:54:53,463
Asking. What?

464
00:54:53,703 --> 00:54:57,783
It's. What should we do now that we know that he's hungry?

465
00:54:58,233 --> 00:54:58,623
Sure.

466
00:54:59,523 --> 00:55:12,303
So they're offering the post-exposure prophylaxis to people that came in contact with his saliva directly, people that shared his life in a huff.

467
00:55:14,283 --> 00:55:19,563
And then finally, well, okay, what do we do about this?

468
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:29,243
Rabies situation where he lives. And it turns out that 11 people in his town have gotten movies in the past two years.

469
00:55:31,613 --> 00:55:40,773
So. The final question was, what should we do with this information?

470
00:55:42,483 --> 00:55:49,413
And it was to encourage the people to go back to their homes by closing gaps in their roofs.

471
00:55:51,693 --> 00:55:55,263
Okay? Yeah. Thank you.

472
00:55:55,323 --> 00:55:58,983
That was like a saga. That was not.

473
00:55:59,253 --> 00:56:05,973
That did not end how I thought it was going to go, because initially my initial thought was heat stroke,

474
00:56:06,573 --> 00:56:13,233
because people get influenza like symptoms and they get cold and clammy when they have severe heat stress.

475
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:18,483
Yeah. Interesting. And rabies. Yeah.

476
00:56:18,483 --> 00:56:24,332
It's not like what you think it like in the movies where somebody gets bitten and has rabies and then like 10 minutes later,

477
00:56:24,333 --> 00:56:28,863
they're foaming at the mouth, like, that's not that's not the typical presentation.

478
00:56:29,433 --> 00:56:34,143
Thank you. Hiding in plain sight. Yes.

479
00:56:34,773 --> 00:56:39,483
Okay. So, ah, interesting. So it was about people who are getting these like I.

480
00:56:41,383 --> 00:56:52,203
A. And he said, okay, so we were entitled.

481
00:56:53,163 --> 00:57:02,373
Okay. Yeah, it was interesting. And so basically what happened was this doctor noticed that quite a few of his patients were having this disease,

482
00:57:02,673 --> 00:57:06,393
but it was like a very slow progression, like it happened over the course of many, many years.

483
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:09,363
And he noticed that, oh, it's suddenly it's like more than usual.

484
00:57:09,663 --> 00:57:15,423
And so they contacted the Department of Health and they were saying, yeah, we're getting the same reports from the doctors, too.

485
00:57:15,903 --> 00:57:19,563
And so we asked the people some questions about what was happening.

486
00:57:19,983 --> 00:57:28,522
And so I think it was like 70% of that that was higher was like 90% are contact wearers that are experiencing the issue of people,

487
00:57:28,523 --> 00:57:36,163
opiate, regular contacts. And then they found out it was like and then it was like 70% of people with this these are new contact areas or whereas.

488
00:57:36,183 --> 00:57:44,053
So that was the difference. And now we were like evaluating like what exactly are the people doing such getting that's causing that?

489
00:57:44,073 --> 00:57:53,753
And so they had like a chart of like the different like contact solutions and one of them was Solution D and that was of the attacker.

490
00:57:53,763 --> 00:57:56,823
It was like twice as high as they were like it's probably due to this.

491
00:57:57,183 --> 00:58:01,053
So they did that. They did some sampling and then the results came in negative.

492
00:58:01,053 --> 00:58:07,593
So it was a contact solution. Then you did some more investigating, ask people about their behaviors and stuff,

493
00:58:07,983 --> 00:58:12,693
and it turns out it was like people topping off their contact solution that was causing the issue.

494
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:17,073
So this is new. Whereas not thoroughly reducing their contacts that is causing the issue.

495
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:21,963
Mm hmm. Interesting. Any contact lens wearers is in here.

496
00:58:22,563 --> 00:58:26,762
Okay. I stopped wearing contacts because I was like, my, my, my.

497
00:58:26,763 --> 00:58:30,453
I don't produce enough natural tears, and it's not like infections.

498
00:58:30,543 --> 00:58:38,973
But I had this my about the manager said but yes tricky sneaky but also this fog up.

499
00:58:39,153 --> 00:58:42,633
I'll take that, though. And last but not least, deadlier than war.

500
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:48,153
Okay. So this was listed as set in Philadelphia in late July at a conference.

501
00:58:48,153 --> 00:58:53,883
So that was helpful, you know. Oh, was it Legionella?

502
00:58:54,453 --> 00:59:00,063
Okay, cool. But it was it the exact same case?

503
00:59:00,283 --> 00:59:03,433
Yeah. As I say, I remember Dad said, oh, it was just like change.

504
00:59:03,483 --> 00:59:06,503
I think it's like military conference instead of like a bicentennial.

505
00:59:06,813 --> 00:59:15,533
Well, it's about 234 and the word conference in Philadelphia, and that's all we needed.

506
00:59:17,013 --> 00:59:20,703
Okay. Well, you know, some of these are not made out of thin air.

507
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:26,583
They change some details. But these kinds of wild things happen all the time.

508
00:59:26,913 --> 00:59:33,573
And if you're interested, eventually, you know, you can do like this infectious disease investigation in different capacities.

509
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:40,653
But if any of you are interested in going on and getting your Ph.D., you need to have to be an IRS officer.

510
00:59:40,983 --> 00:59:45,362
And this is like the kind of stuff that you would do as an IRS officer.

511
00:59:45,363 --> 00:59:48,633
And it's kind of like what Commander Garza does.

512
00:59:48,633 --> 00:59:55,772
But rather than like emergency response, it's like data, an epidemiological investigation, but a huge source.

513
00:59:55,773 --> 01:00:05,373
Another population that I work with in my research are are death care workers and in particular, forensic pathologists and people who perform autopsy.

514
01:00:05,613 --> 01:00:14,432
And they are some of the cornerstones of like public health surveillance because they'll look at unusual deaths and try to diagnose them.

515
01:00:14,433 --> 01:00:23,703
And then, you know, medical examiners have helps contribute like learn more about things like hantavirus scars and things like that.

516
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:24,063
So.
