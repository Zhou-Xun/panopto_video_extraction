1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:11,470
All right, do over. So we're going to review the overall burden of cancer in the U.S.

2
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:18,520
We're going to evaluate current cancer incidence and mortality rates. We're going to compare changes in those rates and over time.

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,680
And we're going to start to understand racial disparities.

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,590
And we're going to learn how and where to access U.S. cancer surveillance data so that you can get that information in the future.

5
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,040
So if you were in charge of collecting information about cancer in the U.S., what would you want to know?

6
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,130
Somebody says, Hey, go. It's your job to collect information on cancer.

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,160
What do you want? How many people have cancer right now?

8
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,219
Yeah. How many people have cancer right now? Great. Where the pockets of how they could.

9
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,980
That's not people of cancer areas. Yeah. So like where people are who are getting cancer.

10
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,920
Sure. The likelihood of death per cancer type.

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,459
Yeah, the likelihood of cancer. Who's dying of cancer and by type.

12
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,470
Sure, cancer. Stage.

13
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,230
Yeah. So you want some stage information on when they're diagnosed?

14
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,540
The most common type. So you'll get to keep count of all the cancers, right.

15
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,050
Screening. That's an interesting one. We don't actually collect that in cancer registries, but that is a good one.

16
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,950
The age of onset yet. How old they are, for sure.

17
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,630
Yeah. You want to know if they recover? If they relapse?

18
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,329
You would like to know that we don't.

19
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:52,260
We're going to talk about that when we talk about registration, but we don't actually like most about their socioeconomic status.

20
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,690
And now you guys are getting into stuff you really want to be able to do,

21
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:59,280
like etiologic research or research on what causes cancer and a lot of in the registry.

22
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,970
We don't collect a lot of that, honestly. Gender.

23
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,660
Yeah. Environmental.

24
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,630
UV light pollutants, but we don't collect that.

25
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,700
How about race or ethnicity? Yep.

26
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:28,390
Great. That's a good list. So when we calculate occurrence of cancer, we usually calculate the incidence rate, mortality rate, the prevalence.

27
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,150
So that was the how many people have cancer right now? That's prevalence, right?

28
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:38,900
The five year relative survival rate, which is kind of a weird cancer specific thing that we'll talk about what that means.

29
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,200
And and we're also just interested in the number of cases or deaths, right.

30
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:48,349
So the rates tell you the number of people per population who are getting it, but the numbers are really important.

31
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,350
Right. So we'll talk about the kind of the differences there.

32
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,590
All right. So this is a bit of review for many of you, but we'll just go through it quickly.

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,860
The incidence rate is the number of new cases of a disease that occur during

34
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,970
a specific period of time in a population at risk of developing the disease.

35
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,310
Right. And we often for cancer will express this as the incidence per 100,000.

36
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:23,280
Right. Because cancer while while many of us have experienced a relative or someone close to us having cancer,

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,090
it's actually at a population level, kind of a rare disease. Right.

38
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:35,590
And so we end up expressing it per 100,000. There's a number of people at risk.

39
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,330
It's an interesting thing. Who would you put in your denominator for breast cancer?

40
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,620
Who at risk of breast cancer. Women.

41
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,250
Yeah. Some men can get breast cancer. Right? So there is male breast cancer.

42
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,740
But do you think it's really appropriate to put them together?

43
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:08,750
Yeah, probably not. So it's actually kind of a different disease and has different causes and men and women.

44
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,770
So we usually actually will probably female breast cancer separately.

45
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:19,160
But that's a you know, that's one where it's a little tricky, right? It's a it's you have to think about it about what the right thing.

46
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,090
Um, how about for like uterine cancer?

47
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:37,670
What's the number of people at risk of uterine cancer? That's right.

48
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,760
People who have it. Women are people, you're right. People who have a uterus.

49
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,630
So that will be, you know, women who have people who haven't had a hysterectomy.

50
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,370
Right. Hysterectomy is actually the most common surgery and in older women.

51
00:04:52,550 --> 00:05:01,400
And so we actually have been kind of undercounting the incidence rate of uterine cancer because we kind of just

52
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,250
have population statistics like the number of women in the U.S. that we've been using as our denominator.

53
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:13,400
When a good chunk of those women have had a hysterectomy and therefore are not at risk of getting uterine cancer signal over have years.

54
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,840
So it's not as simple as it seems. Right? Seems easy at first.

55
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,950
Is actually a little bit more complicated than that when you get into the details sometimes like mortality rate,

56
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,940
the number of deaths due to disease that occur during a specified period of time in a population.

57
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,100
Again, we will be calculating that you'll see it expressed per 100,000 usually.

58
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,340
Okay. So let's talk briefly, how many of you guys have talked about age adjustment in your classes?

59
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:50,530
A little bit. All right. So which of these places do you think would have a higher cancer incidence or mortality rate?

60
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,730
So here we have this is a population pyramid by age.

61
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:02,229
And so it tells you kind of the length of the bar. It's like a histogram kind of on its side showing you men and women separately by age.

62
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:08,080
Right. So this is where I County, Colorado, and this is Christian County, Kentucky.

63
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:16,420
So just looking at these age structures, which place do you think is going to have a higher incidence and mortality rate for cancer?

64
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:25,830
I think that right there is a higher. Why do you think so?

65
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,330
Younger people. So what's the biggest risk factor for cancer?

66
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,940
Oh, yeah. But younger and younger, like the bigger part.

67
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,980
Meaning that there are more. More young people. So this is the number of people.

68
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:49,200
So this is telling you that in this county, most of the population is concentrated in the younger age group.

69
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So this is actually like a histogram of the number of people by age group.

70
00:06:54,390 --> 00:07:00,990
Yeah. Yup. To the left? Yes. So this one, the Colorado County has way more old people.

71
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,090
And age, of course, is the number one risk factor for cancer.

72
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:11,040
So you're going to have way higher cancer incidence and mortality rates in that county if you don't age adjust.

73
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,979
So age standardization is very important in cancer.

74
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:21,960
You will almost never see statistics presented without age standardization, because we know age is the most important risk factor.

75
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,790
It's not important to understand, I mean, unless you just want to know the number of cases.

76
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,540
So it is important to know that you're just going to have more cases in this Colorado tourney than in this Kentucky town.

77
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,800
Right. Because if you are in charge of health care administration, like some of you say,

78
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,260
you want to go into and you're in charge of like determining how many how many hospital beds do we need for cancer in this county?

79
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,740
You're going to need more hospital beds in Colorado. And that is an important thing to know.

80
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,240
But if you want to say if you just want to look at these two counties, if you look at raw data,

81
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,240
you might say, well, we have a big cancer problem in this Colorado county.

82
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,139
What's going on? And the answer is just they're all it's not really meaningful.

83
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:03,180
It's not interesting. There's nothing interesting going on. It's just the age difference that's causing these different rates.

84
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:09,270
So if you want to compare apples to apples and see if there's really a problem of some kind going on this Colorado County,

85
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,270
you want to compare age standardized rates. So we know age is the number one risk factor for almost all cancers.

86
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,540
So population, age, structure, it can change over time.

87
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,540
It can differ from place to place like we just saw in those pictures.

88
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,840
And so in order to compare rates to one another, we need to standardize.

89
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:32,969
So what an age standardized rate means is if the age structure in this Colorado county were like the standard population,

90
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:40,740
what would the incidence rate of cancer be? And then if the age structure in this Kentucky county were also like this standard, what would it be?

91
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,430
And then you compare them to each other. Okay.

92
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,710
So what you need to understand is essentially what you're doing is you're just making it so that you're saying, okay, we've got these cancer rates.

93
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,080
If the structure were the same in these two populations, how would they compare?

94
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,830
And it allows you to make direct comparisons that are kind of taking age off the table as an explanation for any differences.

95
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:11,360
Does that make sense? OC prevalence the proportion of the population affected by disease at a specific time.

96
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,030
So this is the number of cases divided by the number of people in the population. This does not have to be new cases.

97
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,140
Right? So this is an important measure because it tells us how many people are living with cancer.

98
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,200
It includes people who have survived a long time.

99
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:32,270
So this is a very important public health measure because it tells us how many people need kind of ongoing resources because they have had cancer.

100
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:41,080
Right. Now we're getting to that relative survival rate, which is kind of the weird one I mentioned.

101
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:48,340
So imagine you have a group of 30 year old men with cancer. What would we expect their survival to be if they didn't have cancer?

102
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,630
Like how? Just generally, how long do we think they would survive?

103
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:03,680
Yeah. Till I get you something like that. Right. So another 50 years. Now you've got a group of 80 year old men with cancer.

104
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,940
What will we expect their survival to be if they didn't have cancer?

105
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:19,730
Shorter. Right. So what we're trying to do here is you want to compare the observed survival five years after diagnosis

106
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:25,120
in people with cancer to the expected survival over that five year period if they didn't have cancer.

107
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:32,090
And that gives you the five year relative survival rate. So you'll see something like 65% relative survival, five year survival.

108
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:36,740
And you might think, oh, that means that 65% of people who got cancer lived five years.

109
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:44,990
Not exactly right. You're comparing it to the survival, the expected survival in their given their age and everything.

110
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:53,420
If they didn't have cancer, does that make sense? So it's a little bit more complex than just the proportion of people who survive five years.

111
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,730
Does that make sense? All right.

112
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:12,110
So we saw this yesterday. This is the burden of cancer in the U.S. We have almost 2 million new cases in the U.S. every year, over 600,000 deaths.

113
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:21,710
And the large majority are in people 55 and older. And their relative survival has increased since the seventies, but it's still only 68%.

114
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:29,600
So not fantastic, right. We know that men have a higher lifetime probability of developing cancer compared to women.

115
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,990
And we have a whole lot of people who are living with cancer. Right.

116
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:40,310
18.1 million cancer survivors in 2020. So a lot of these people have been diagnosed many years ago and have no evidence of cancer currently.

117
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:48,820
So the other thing that we count is just the number of cases or the number of deaths.

118
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:55,360
Right. It's very simple, but it's important to know this, like I said, because it kind of helps you decide how many beds you need.

119
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,150
Right. How many people are actually going to get cancer in your state, in your country.

120
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,060
Right. And that's actually an important public health and health care planning kind of thing to know, even though it's very simple.

121
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:15,249
We have all these fancier statistics that help us compare populations, that help us look at, you know, causes of cancer and all that kind of stuff.

122
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:20,170
But this is kind of the the very simple public health measure that we're interested in, how many people have cancer?

123
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:27,110
Okay. So let's start in our groups. A couple of you came in a little bit late.

124
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,790
Does that mean who does not know where the groups are?

125
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,910
Okay. I'm going to help you guys find your group. You're going to get started.

126
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,900
Click on this and you should find a word document with the questions.

127
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:50,960
You'll turn it in after class next time. Only one person per group will need to turn it in, and it's not going to be graded on whether you're right.

128
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,880
It's going to be graded on whether you try to do the thing. Okay. So no pressure.

129
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:02,630
You can sometimes group like to upload it into a Google doc so that they can all work on it.

130
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:09,170
You guys can do whatever you want to do. That's fine. One person will upload a word document at the end of class.

131
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,460
Let's keep trying to say tomorrow. We don't have class about this next Tuesday.

132
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:22,010
Does that make sense to everybody? Okay, so let me help those of you who don't know where your groups are, find them here with us.

133
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,100
And then who? Who's the other one right there? What's your name?

134
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,840
I can't find you. I'm sorry. You found yourself a group three.

135
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,800
Where's the three? You're back there with them. All right.

136
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:44,129
Are we all good? All right, well, we're gone.

137
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:50,690
So question one, I believe is is dealing. So you're going to just do question one that's dealing with incidents or deaths.

138
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:58,020
Excuse me, mortality in men and women. You're going to download the statistics document from American Cancer Society and it's not on up.

139
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,580
So I'll come around and help you guys out and probably ten, 15 minutes.

140
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:11,460
We'll see how it goes. I don't want.

141
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:30,090
You should be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

142
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,150
Hey, that's a good idea.

143
00:14:39,730 --> 00:15:12,760
Thank you. Did you?

144
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:36,910
I know you're. Yeah.

145
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,270
Oh, yeah. Oh, my gosh. What do you mean?

146
00:15:54,650 --> 00:16:03,960
A. We're you able to see?

147
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,950
In a way.

148
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:13,770
Okay. Let's go back to the.

149
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:47,360
There's a major. I.

150
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,010
But you'll also need to work on fear.

151
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,640
You've got to you concerned on the entire. Interrogation or access to the website.

152
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:06,300
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know.

153
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:14,100
Believe in the media. Our research.

154
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:22,470
You know. Yes. This was be the president. In fact, if you go to that scene.

155
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:33,370
So maybe see. Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

156
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:47,670
It's like saying about. Yeah.

157
00:17:51,040 --> 00:18:00,890
I know. I know. Right here on the track.

158
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:11,800
And it's just an array of stories.

159
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:24,190
All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

160
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,470
I hear things like that.

161
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:37,710
Yeah. Number three, scroll down to.

162
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:47,720
So that's where. Very, very much so.

163
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,780
Oh yeah, yeah.

164
00:18:53,230 --> 00:19:02,370
Yeah. Or on your career is that. Xavier Yeah, I love that.

165
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:08,540
And it's going to be very, very difficult.

166
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,690
Yeah. Now I just that.

167
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,060
So the first one. Just one more.

168
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:34,630
Yeah. Yeah. So I just. I will always love you guys.

169
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,450
But this is just an everyday. Like.

170
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:53,469
This is definitely a sign of mortality, but it's a gender I don't like.

171
00:19:53,470 --> 00:20:03,830
And I. So I was like, I didn't think it was all right, but I said.

172
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:17,500
You know, it's just like it's not like you can do it like that and.

173
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,980
Unless it's just. Got it.

174
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:40,890
You know what? I want you to stand by me at this moment.

175
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:56,810
I will ask you, I suggest that it is as long as it doesn't have to be, because I think I is incorrect.

176
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:06,110
So it's not just like I think it was silly, but I was in grad school.

177
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,740
You heard everything.

178
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,470
I'm sorry. Yeah, it matter.

179
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:38,350
And I don't even know, I, I don't I don't really recommend that.

180
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:51,130
Officers. As soon as I heard.

181
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,740
Okay? Yeah.

182
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:06,900
Yeah. It's only getting worse because I still. Yeah.

183
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:31,030
I think what he has done. So however you want to raise that in the group, we like to go to our jobs.

184
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,680
Yeah. What's your Apple Watch and batteries and your iPhone's location.

185
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:48,890
Assuming that 30,000. That was so terrible.

186
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,620
That's right. We'll be done. It's like in England recently.

187
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:05,270
But yeah. That was a business that.

188
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:33,480
It was our first time and then eventually we stopped because you have to be able to do something.

189
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:55,389
I mean, I think that was unique to we like it was a matter of just.

190
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:59,770
I just thought it to be perfect.

191
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:12,300
You. I don't want to go into. Sometimes I wonder if we are actually.

192
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:23,310
Are you reading the emergency department?

193
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:37,590
Marriage equality has to be something that's going to happen.

194
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:49,260
Yeah, that's true. I don't know why I go back to all of those things.

195
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:57,520
Yeah, but I do know that there is such a thing as sort of the beginning where there's money that goes with.

196
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:09,980
So I've been doing it since, I guess.

197
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:17,060
I think we just left drinking their last 1530.

198
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:26,600
I like. Yeah.

199
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:35,380
I don't like to I don't like the violence.

200
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:42,900
You know, a lot of things like. Yeah.

201
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:54,510
If you want to see your product. Oh.

202
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:04,500
Yeah. I think we we are right now.

203
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:18,670
We're going to stop trying, but. Going to allow for something like that.

204
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:28,370
So that's probably part of this. Yeah.

205
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:34,430
Yeah. And I thought it was going to.

206
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:46,790
Better sanitation. All your worries about your problems.

207
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:56,900
I don't have an answer.

208
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:03,380
I can't go on a candidate.

209
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:13,160
It not? Yes.

210
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:21,520
Maybe they. Yeah.

211
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,150
Uh. I don't know. I guess.

212
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:47,280
So how many groups are still on a, b, c, d, e?

213
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,180
All right, we'll do five more minutes. Okay. 1005.

214
00:27:51,180 --> 00:28:00,910
We'll talk about we'll come back to the lecture. I mean, just like, say, like the press.

215
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:12,940
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

216
00:28:52,770 --> 00:29:02,330
No. If everyone in the.

217
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,540
Saturdays and Sundays. Yeah.

218
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,300
And then they started every. Yeah, exactly.

219
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,130
Yeah. Very.

220
00:30:10,150 --> 00:31:07,090
I. Everybody fell asleep all at once.

221
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:31,230
Super quiet. All right.

222
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,530
Let's go ahead and talk about it since it seems like you guys have wound down.

223
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,810
So this was the first slide you first of all.

224
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,630
So I asked you to find the PowerPoint slides. It's a little bit hidden.

225
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:50,130
The website's a little weird, but a lot of you also found the big PDF, so that's like the huge everything document, right?

226
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:56,190
And so that's a really good thing to have. It's like the details that you want are not in the PowerPoint.

227
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:03,419
But the PowerPoint is nice because they've kind of taken the most commonly used figures and tables and turned them into nice PowerPoint slides.

228
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,200
And you can and people do just take these and put them in their presentation.

229
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,410
Like if you're doing a presentation on cancer and you want a couple of slides to talk about the background of your cancer,

230
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,350
you can put a couple of these in there and just say, Hey,

231
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:20,910
these are from the American Cancer Society facts and figures, and it's totally fine to do that.

232
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,620
You're going to see these men and women at the beginning of like everybody's presentations,

233
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,670
whoever does something about cancer, so very commonly used.

234
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:34,740
So it's just a good thing to know about and to be able to. It's a resource for like if you ever need to do a presentation, right?

235
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:40,680
Okay. So you were asked what statistic is presented here?

236
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:46,360
What are we looking at? Is it a mortality rate?

237
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,480
I see some nods. So the rate.

238
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:59,890
You're kind of confused about trying to put it into words, but it seems like out of like if you only look at one side.

239
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,670
Uh huh. This is the proportion of that.

240
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,630
Yeah. But what is. What is this number here? Like all of the cancer.

241
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,829
It's just the number. Yeah. This is literally just the number of cancer deaths, right?

242
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,889
So it's not showing it per 100,000 or anything like that. So it's not a rate.

243
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:21,850
It's just the actual number of people who die or who are estimated to die of cancer in 2022, separated by sex.

244
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:28,360
And then you're right, this is the proportion of that 322,000 men that are the each of these sites.

245
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:35,229
Right. So that makes sense. So this is that simplest statistic that we talked about, literally just the number.

246
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:38,410
So is this adjusted for anything? That's right.

247
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:42,470
Now it's not. It's just the number not adjusted just enough.

248
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:49,430
So if there are more men in the population, that could be why there are more cases.

249
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:54,980
The rates could be the same if men are older, on average, than women.

250
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:58,610
That could be why there are more cases. Do you see what I'm saying? So it's not.

251
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,950
It's literally just the number. All right.

252
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:15,170
What else did I ask you about? So I asked you to kind of list the top three leading causes that something to keep in the back of your head.

253
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,290
Like, I think on the test or a quiz.

254
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,160
I might I might ask you, like one of the top three causes of cancer death in men and women,

255
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,820
or what are the top three most commonly diagnosed cancers of men and women?

256
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:31,200
I might might do that. Might be a good thing to start with.

257
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:38,040
Um, okay. We talked a little bit about this yesterday and kind of what you guys thought about it.

258
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,110
So here's the next one. This is over time. So what statistic are we looking at here?

259
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,670
Mortality rate. Now we're talking about the mortality rate, right? So this is per population.

260
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:07,170
Is this adjusted for anything? If they did.

261
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:17,290
Yes, because it would not be fair to compare rates in 1930 to today, because the population structure of the U.S. has changed dramatically over time.

262
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,820
Right. So even if nothing else had changed, we would expect there to be more cancer.

263
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:26,090
Yeah. So this is making it so it's like apples to apples.

264
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:32,900
So changes that we see over time are not due to change in this graph are not due to changes in the population structure.

265
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:37,520
So that said, now we have mortality going back to 1930.

266
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,990
Okay. So we've got a long, long stretch here of cancer mortality data.

267
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:47,000
So I think I asked you guys kind of like, what? What do you see here? Like, what do you think is interesting?

268
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:56,870
Like what are some of the biggest changes you see? Yeah.

269
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:02,280
Large. Yup.

270
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,580
Pretty large. Yeah. And that's bad stuff, right?

271
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,629
That's entirely something. I think it's just interesting, though, what cards are used to be like.

272
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:15,590
Super rare. Right. It was the weird cancer that doctors would be like, oh, my gosh,

273
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:20,420
all the interns get in here because you're not going to see one of these again unless you wait 40 years.

274
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,380
But yeah, it used to be like an extremely rare cancer.

275
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:29,570
And then it just I mean, this is when you see just how, especially in men,

276
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:33,680
when you just see how overwhelming it became in terms of the cancer mortality burden.

277
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,960
It's just kind of shocking, I think. What else?

278
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,270
I know you guys were having an interesting discussion about one of these. Stomach cancer.

279
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:53,800
Yeah. So stomach has really changed over time and we got a little bit of a clue as to why you guys read in the in the notes.

280
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:59,950
I don't know if you noticed there's hints in the notes, but, um, yeah.

281
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:03,189
So it was talking about how food preservation has changed.

282
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:08,530
Refrigeration came about. So before refrigeration, how did we preserve food?

283
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,740
Largely by salting. Yeah.

284
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,479
And that actually cause stomach cancer.

285
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,219
And in fact, we're going to talk about this in the Global Lecture, but one of the things that they, for example,

286
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:23,800
they don't recommend eating like Cantonese style salted fish, particularly kids, because it can cause cancer.

287
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:29,200
So we know that like salting in that preserving way can actually be carcinogenic.

288
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:33,610
So that's part of it. And then there's another piece to that we talked about. What was the other reason?

289
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,879
Antibiotics. Yeah, because one of the big risk factors for stomach cancer is H.

290
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,710
Pylori infection and that is a bacteria.

291
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:51,520
And so right about 1945, we started using antibiotics and we didn't know they were they were using them for H.

292
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,430
Pylori. Right. We didn't know that H. Pylori was causing stomach cancer.

293
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:58,520
But if you were using antibiotics for something else, it probably felt awful priority.

294
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:03,630
And so stomach cancer. Anything else you guys saw?

295
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:14,210
Sorry. Colorectal is probably come down quite a bit because of screening.

296
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,940
Screening is interesting in terms of the effect it can have on incidence and mortality.

297
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:23,330
So if the screening is effective, it should reduce mortality rate.

298
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:28,669
So we see a decrease in prostate cancer mortality. We see a decrease in colorectal cancer mortality,

299
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:37,670
probably both due to screening screening and also decrease in incidence if it catches a precancerous lesion, not just early cancer.

300
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:43,969
So for prostate cancer, PSA catches early cancer.

301
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:52,340
So screening will actually increase the number of incident cases because we're catching more cases, but hopefully decrease mortality.

302
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,159
Whereas for colorectal cancer, when we screened for colorectal cancer,

303
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:01,550
we're hoping to find polyps which are precancerous and they can be removed right when you're there before they ever become cancer.

304
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:08,120
So successful screening program for colon cancer will decrease both incidence and mortality that make sense.

305
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,300
All right. And then we looked at pancreas and liver. What did you guys think about those?

306
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:26,020
They're kind of highlighted here. I heard some discussion over here about the liver one.

307
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:38,630
Could be increasing hep C. He wasn't around.

308
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:45,050
He's got super heavy. You can have access.

309
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:54,270
Developing cancer. Yup.

310
00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:00,209
I don't know if that has actually increased over time. Yeah. But that is you're right.

311
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:03,390
That is a cause. Alcohol use is a cause of liver cancer.

312
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:07,830
So that is entirely possible. The other thing that's going on too is an increase in BMI.

313
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:13,020
And BMI is a risk factor for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which can cause cirrhosis and therefore liver cancer.

314
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:17,280
So that increase in BMI over time is another possibility.

315
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,860
The papers. Everybody's confused about that. Nobody quite knows what's going on.

316
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:33,470
Could be and also thank you is really kind of remains a bit of a mystery like the big things like smoking and BMI seem to be associated with like yes,

317
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:36,140
everything every cancer is associated with those things.

318
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,520
Like there's nothing there's no smoking gun for pancreas that it's kind of a public health problem.

319
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:46,320
Right, because it is so deadly. All right.

320
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:51,360
Anything else for men? Women.

321
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:57,770
So it's the same scale which is important, right? Because you can compare them side to side.

322
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,700
Big, huge pet peeve. When people present two graphs in a paper and the scale is not the same.

323
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:09,610
I hate that it feels sneaky. I don't like it.

324
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,280
So first thing you can notice here is that the lung cancer, while it went up and down kind of the same,

325
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,610
never got as high in women as it did in men because women didn't smoke as much as men.

326
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,070
Like the prevalence of smoking in women was lower than the prevalence of smoking and men.

327
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:37,550
What else do you think you guys talked about here? Question.

328
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:43,400
Yeah. Would you like this?

329
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:58,400
Yeah. So that is a really good point.

330
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:04,230
So you always do have to that's a very good, like skeptical print of you thinking like an epidemiologist.

331
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:12,370
So are these trends real or are they a product of different counting of cancer?

332
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:20,500
Right. Like, are we counted? Were we counting it poorly or diagnosing it or identifying it more poorly in the past than we are now?

333
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:27,640
I would say for incidence and diagnosing it is probably true for for death we were probably better at it.

334
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:33,500
But you're right. Like would they have known it was uterine cancer versus ovarian cancer versus whatever?

335
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:40,890
You're right. There might have been more murkiness. It might not have been as accurately reported in 1930 yesterday.

336
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:46,989
However, all of these things are coming down over time.

337
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:51,280
Like would you have expected them to over report or under report?

338
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,390
Like would you have expected people to die of something and not get reported correctly?

339
00:42:56,290 --> 00:43:03,480
Or would you expect them to die of something incorrectly recorded as cancer when it was something else under.

340
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,330
Right. So that would make it look like it was increasing over time rather than decreasing.

341
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:16,030
And so, if anything, these trends could be more steeper than they really are, right.

342
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,600
I would think so. So you're not. You're thinking like an epidemiologist.

343
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:30,100
That's great. I would say, though, that if you're correct, we're wrong in a way that's underestimating the changes.

344
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:39,650
You think? Yeah. Yeah. So breast cancer seems to have come down.

345
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,559
And you mentioned screening. I would say mammography probably was started.

346
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,460
I think it was started in the around 1980, late 1970s, early 1980s.

347
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:55,880
So after we started doing that, so probably part of this breast cancer decline,

348
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,040
decline in breast cancer death is due to certainly we've improved treatment over time.

349
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:05,840
But part of that is due to the influence of earlier detection due to screening.

350
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:12,350
Right. Colon has been coming way down. You know, uterus.

351
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:18,320
Some of we talked about. All right.

352
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,360
Uterine cancer is increasing a bit. Does anybody know what the number one risk factor for uterine cancer is?

353
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:36,010
If be like a lot of hormonal cancers are higher in obese postmenopausal women because this is actually a real dialog.

354
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:44,399
We're going to talk in our Obesity and diet lecture about how some of the reasons why I think kind of

355
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:50,430
big obesity cancer risk is overblown or or in the public health interventions that we are trying for.

356
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:59,219
Obesity are stupid and not working right. Yelling at people to lose weight doesn't mean shaming them for being bigger

357
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,340
does not really seem to have done anything except make more people overweight.

358
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:07,979
Right. And there are some reasons that it may be that obesity is associated with cancer risk,

359
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:12,030
that nothing to do with any biological association between fatness and cancer.

360
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:14,100
However, in postmenopausal women,

361
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:24,150
there is some biologic rationale for higher fat percentage being associated with risk of these cancers because in postmenopausal women and in men,

362
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,940
the largest source of estrogen is a romanization in fat tissue.

363
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:34,740
So people who have a higher percentage of fat tissue have higher circulating estrogen levels.

364
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:41,010
And a lot of these female cancers are estrogen dependent. And so having higher estrogen levels will increase the risk of these cancers.

365
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:49,960
So that's partly why that's going on. Yeah. As well as.

366
00:45:53,830 --> 00:46:05,350
Yes. So part of this is about how so uterine corpus and cervix combined is actually kind of dumb because corpus and cervix are totally different.

367
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:09,700
So uterine cancer is the one that's post-menopausal. It's associated with obesity.

368
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:12,460
Cervical cancer is HPV associated, right?

369
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:18,700
I think probably back in the day, they didn't separate them because they couldn't tell that they were different.

370
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:23,350
And so if you want to present something from 1930 on, you have to compare apples to apples.

371
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:26,889
And so it's everything combined. And even today,

372
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:31,930
I would say that cervical cancer is so rare because we have such a good screening

373
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:38,770
program that it is a it's a small proportion of that yellow line today.

374
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,430
Most of that yellow line is going to be corpus colorectal. Again, rectal cancer is very uncommon.

375
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,560
It's often combined with colon cancer, but it actually is different.

376
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:52,660
And their papers now are trying to separate them and look at rectal separately.

377
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:57,730
It's hard to do because it's so many in so many fewer cases compared to Colon.

378
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:02,140
But yeah, you're right. That is a good point. Yeah.

379
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:09,680
So it's that first initial drop that. You know.

380
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,890
Okay. So I will tell you, you.

381
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:21,980
Most of the changes we have seen in cervical cancer that we have observed now are due to screening, not the vaccine.

382
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:29,290
Because when did the vaccine become available? In 2000. 2006 and first became available again.

383
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:33,739
Then it was only for like a small age range. So it then became available in 2009.

384
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:42,530
2010 is when we really started vaccinating. So if you were 20, say even 25 and 2010, how old are you now?

385
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:51,350
35, 37. So like, those people are just easing into the age range where they might get cervical cancer.

386
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:57,230
And so we really haven't seen a public health impact of the vaccine in this country.

387
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:00,950
Plus, even now, the uptake of the of the HPV vaccine is not great.

388
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:08,780
It's only like 50% or something like that. So the the the impact we've seen on cervical cancer is screening.

389
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:12,980
It's pap smears entirely at this point.

390
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:19,950
So that said, even I don't I don't actually know.

391
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:24,370
Can anybody look up? When did we start doing pap smears? I don't actually know when in time we started doing that.

392
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:30,210
Somebody with their laptop open for I really.

393
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:40,680
So you make a good point. I don't actually know that it could be that some of that decrease is due to.

394
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,979
Due to cervical cancer kind of laid out. It could be.

395
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:53,150
I think I would be really interested to see those lines broken apart. Could be that.

396
00:48:56,910 --> 00:49:01,240
Good point. All right.

397
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:07,700
So I will say that the number statistic is an interesting one.

398
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:16,060
Everybody got really excited in 2003 because it was the first year that the number of cancer cases have decreased.

399
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:18,530
Since they started counting them.

400
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:27,799
That's because age, you know, the age population age structure was changing over that time because these are just numbers.

401
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:33,020
This is not a rate. It's not age adjusted. So as the population age, you would expect a lot more cancer.

402
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:38,030
And of course, we had all of the effect of the smoking epidemic and everything, but we got people to quit smoking.

403
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:42,319
Lung cancer deaths started coming down. So this was literally the first year.

404
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:47,240
2003 was the first year that we had fewer cancer deaths than the year before since they started counting.

405
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:50,750
So everybody got very excited. Yes. Do you think.

406
00:49:54,140 --> 00:50:06,740
Numbers in terms of lives. It's going down. Yeah. We have there have been quite a few papers that have come out and maybe somebody

407
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:10,280
who is looking for a news article can find one that's been mentioned in the press.

408
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:17,150
There have been quite a few cases that have come out looking at like delay and screening or delay in treatment due to COVID.

409
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:26,720
And it was a thing, although I think that mostly it did not seem to have a huge impact on mortality, but it was definitely an issue.

410
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:33,940
Um, I think what we haven't seen as much yet is the delay in screening.

411
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:37,520
Like people who have not gone in for their screening, I think we might see that catching up.

412
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:42,020
But there are people who are wondering if long term,

413
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:49,430
like repeated COVID infection could increase risk of cancer because it does seem to have kind of an immune thing happening.

414
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:57,920
I mean, it's such early days, we don't know. So, you know, it could increase the risk of some cancer way down the line.

415
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,010
Who knows? It's on people's radar.

416
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:06,290
I don't think there's like a super strong hypothesis for it yet, but it's a thing that people are considering.

417
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:11,540
But in the short term, it definitely did delay some treatment.

418
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:18,480
And I think we're probably going to be seeing some. Some some stuff related to delay and screening.

419
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:36,420
Oops. Sorry. All right. So just to kind of put cancer into respect, into perspective, this is from 2016.

420
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:40,960
Cancer is actually the second leading cause of death in both men and women, second only to heart disease.

421
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:45,250
And that is changing, right, because heart disease is actually coming way down.

422
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:54,459
So we've done a fifth. This is comparing 1950 death rates to these are age adjusted to 23, which is old at this point.

423
00:51:54,460 --> 00:52:05,200
Right. So we're going to add some 2017 numbers in here. But essentially, you can see that heart diseases, we have made this huge impact over time.

424
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:11,319
Right. We've done a fantastic job with drugs. We've got really great blood pressure medications since 1950.

425
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:17,740
We've got statins for cholesterol. We've got such better surgical techniques.

426
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:23,940
I mean, my grandfather in the early eighties had a quadruple bypass and he was cut from here.

427
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:27,640
He had a sternum cracked all the way down his leg because they took veins out of his leg.

428
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,950
You know, I mean, it was just he was laid open from one end to the other, huge surgery.

429
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:34,389
And it's just not like that anymore.

430
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:41,230
I mean, they can do so much where they go in through the neck and they, you know, do balloons and all kinds of stuff where it's just so much better.

431
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:47,470
So we've really made strides with heart disease prevention for and heart disease mortality changes.

432
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:52,800
Look at 1952. 23 for cancer.

433
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,120
No, it's decreased some since 2003 we have made some progress.

434
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:09,510
But it's not this, right. So as we continue to do battle with heart disease, cancer is poised to become the number one cause of death.

435
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:16,530
Okay, so we have improved five year relative survival rates.

436
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:22,380
This is for all races. We'll discuss the racial disparities a little bit later.

437
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:30,300
But you can see if you just look at all sites, right? In the 1970s, we had 49 to 69, which is what I showed you in that slide earlier.

438
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,580
But if you look at individual like this is clearly driven by certain particular cancer sites.

439
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:40,690
Right. Look at breast. Breast cancer aims 75%.

440
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:44,010
Five year relative survival now is 91%. Right.

441
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:48,370
Colon and rectum. We've made some pretty big strides.

442
00:53:53,750 --> 00:54:00,800
And actually the improvement we've made in colon rectal mortality is not really shown here because as I told you,

443
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,440
a successful colon cancer screening program will prevent people from ever being diagnosed with it.

444
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:11,180
Right. Because if you're successful, you'll find a polyp and remove it before it can become cancer.

445
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,840
So this is among people who got it. What is their survival?

446
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:22,070
So way more people were getting it. A lot of people's death has been prevented just by preventing them from ever getting the cancer due to screening.

447
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:33,650
But among those who get it, we're still doing better with treatment. But there are some where we're still lung cancer is still really abysmal.

448
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:41,010
Right. Whereas pancreas. Pancreas is not great, right?

449
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:47,220
So so we've made improvements in some of the big cancers and less so in many of the others.

450
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,510
Right. So this is kind of like the weighted average of the improvement in survival.

451
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,310
But you can see that it's not equal across cancer sites.

452
00:54:54,320 --> 00:55:02,729
Does that make sense? And a lot of this improvement in survival.

453
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:07,320
Some of it is treatment, right. But a lot of it is earlier detection.

454
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:11,910
Right. So if you look at breast, the all stages is 90%.

455
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:18,430
That's kind of like that 91% that we saw. But you can see that it's really great for local or regional, but not so much for distance.

456
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,660
So we're going to talk a little bit more about stage in our biology lecture.

457
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:28,160
But the higher this stage refers to basically how large the tumor is and how much it has spread from the organ to origin.

458
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:36,629
Right. So localized is small and it's still in the organ where it started, whereas just is metastasized right at that point.

459
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:40,440
It's spread to other organs. Regional. So we're kind of in the middle.

460
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:48,380
Right. So you expect better survival of local. But what's really interesting is remember, so prostate is doing great.

461
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:53,550
I'm not sure a distant right. Colon is doing great unless you're distant.

462
00:55:53,580 --> 00:56:01,920
So the reason we have such good, good survival for these overall is because this all stages is a weighted average of all of these.

463
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:08,819
And so you can see for breast, most people are diagnosed at local or regional because the the all stages is really reflective of mostly that.

464
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:12,270
Same with prostate, right? 99% for all stages, 30% for distant.

465
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:16,590
So what you can gather from that is that most that are being diagnosed pretty early stage.

466
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:24,360
Let's look at ovary on the other hand, gosh, if you're diagnosed with local stage ovarian cancer, you're going to do pretty great.

467
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:30,510
But ovarian cancer overall is very deadly because most women are being diagnosed at just in a regional.

468
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:39,000
Does that make sense? Pancreas, on the other hand, even local, is pretty, pretty bad.

469
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:45,030
So like early detection of pancreatic cancer is probably not the answer for that cancer.

470
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:52,480
Right. If you think about early detection, detecting someone even is like stage one pancreatic cancer.

471
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:58,960
They still have very poor survival. So really, does the strategy for preventing mortality from pancreatic cancer has to be different?

472
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:04,080
Does that make sense? All right.

473
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:19,620
Anything else you guys want to talk about here? So when we think about cancer mortality, we already talked about this last one.

474
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:23,349
Right. It could be not real. Right. Changes could be not real.

475
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:27,239
It could be because of changes in registration or how deaths are counted or how well we count,

476
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:33,180
among other things, that factor in influence, cancer mortality or incidence.

477
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:38,700
Right? If you just have more cases of cancer, more people are being diagnosed but nothing about like the survival is changing.

478
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:45,629
You're just going to have more deaths if you diagnose people early or if you have effective treatment that will affect mortality.

479
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:46,830
Right. In a positive way.

480
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:56,310
And then if things are changing that influence cancer incidence or progression of metastasis over time, those things will also affect mortality rate.

481
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:00,000
So those are all kind of all of the things that we talked about when we looked at those statistics.

482
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,450
You guys kind of knew all that. You came up with those ideas on your own, right?

483
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:08,630
But those are the kinds of things that can influence mortality. That makes sense.

484
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:15,100
All right. We have about 20 minutes left to class.

485
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:24,819
So let's work in groups to work on question two about incidence and we will start discussing that those results next time.

486
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:31,780
So if you guys finish and you want to go, that's fine. But we're going to spend the rest of class time working on the question to our groups.

487
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:36,390
We have a few people who are signed up for a news article for next time.

488
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:40,770
For our New York Post. Okay.

489
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:53,640
So so I think what I didn't mention is there's a discussion thread for the news article and you need to post them like your news article,

490
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,390
like the day before. Some good.

491
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:02,980
All right. You'll be our fearless leaders. All right.

492
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:07,930
Get started on the incidents question and I'll come around the same way. And again, if you guys finish and you want to go, you can go.

493
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:44,130
Just. For.

494
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:30,270
It is. I hope you're right.

495
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:37,710
I just was like, Yeah.

496
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:53,980
Yeah. I think the last one, I think it was, you know, it's also.

497
01:00:54,020 --> 01:01:08,420
No. As far as.

498
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:30,090
Oh. Oh.

499
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,740
Oh. Oh, oh.

500
01:01:48,940 --> 01:02:11,380
We're going to talk about that. For instance, a prosecutor in the 1993, Andrew.

501
01:02:21,650 --> 01:03:29,010
Yeah. So. As I said earlier, I enjoyed.

502
01:03:41,440 --> 01:04:00,960
Yeah. And then there was just.

503
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:07,700
The case. Yeah.

504
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:13,230
I don't actually know. It's like a lot of.

505
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:29,240
Warner Brothers. Yes. Yes.

506
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:18,890
It it just in the 1970s that often have breast cancer screening.

507
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:30,750
So. I get almost daily press every day.

508
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:45,380
Over. She said of the true.

509
01:05:49,640 --> 01:06:01,560
Personally I like. You went to.

510
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:10,150
But it doesn't matter how many others.

511
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:26,890
Well, it's not just similar things.

512
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,010
You realize in that way that I.

513
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:47,670
Do I have to. Yeah.

514
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:55,610
I don't know, but I think it's definitely gonna be.

515
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:08,930
Organized. Oh. Anything you want.

516
01:07:12,990 --> 01:07:19,040
I think you did a great job. Yes.

517
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:35,040
Yes, I. That's good.

518
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:48,570
Q. Your team.

519
01:07:57,710 --> 01:08:02,100
You wonder. The Master.

520
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:18,839
Yeah. If you want to start on it, you can.

521
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:24,000
But we're not. We'll have you finish question two and you want to take off again or if you want to start it.

522
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:28,440
But we don't know if you guys will turn it in next time. How about.

523
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:37,570
We just take a percentage.

524
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:46,110
Yeah. Very nice to meet you there. And you can actually help with that.

525
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:52,680
Yeah, I see. You know, you have to hear that.

526
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:58,320
You've got to do that, Grandma. Oh, wow.

527
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:08,550
Oh, right, right, right.

528
01:09:10,530 --> 01:09:23,440
Yeah. I was just gonna ask your email to talk about else that.

529
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:44,340
Question. This particular 39,737 mothers could not be.

530
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:54,960
I was wondering. It's a weird thing. I think it's unusual in that respect.

531
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:59,490
Yeah, but. Yeah, but it's much less common.

532
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:04,320
Thank you. For clarifying question on these articles. Yeah, it's a group project.

533
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:10,060
The three of us have one article we all do together. Or at all, you know about what?

534
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:17,530
Do that. Yes. I'm going to be gone during an election day.

535
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:22,970
Last year I just wrote that one for you. Yeah.

536
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:29,070
Yeah, I used to try and hide it.

537
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:48,310
So I. Thank you.

538
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:57,260
So you can make the five year. It's not much of a flattening out at the end.

539
01:10:57,650 --> 01:11:00,710
We're talking about that. So big 1000.

540
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:07,910
Oh, yes. You're talking to a blip. It the. Because they stop doing.

541
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:13,810
At some point that we're entitled to the screening measure. And I think that based on public.

542
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:22,760
Something the. That, actually. Yes, because it actually is possible.

543
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:33,090
So. And so as we start doing it, that people are getting more.

544
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:46,050
Yeah. Is it true? Yeah.

545
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:53,980
I do. I think you're all just. Right, the urologist thought.

546
01:11:57,850 --> 01:12:05,050
It's entirely possible that the general practitioner. That's why I went to a.

547
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:15,670
Librarians have different property prices. Screening techniques.

548
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:23,290
We don't teach kids. Thank you so much.

549
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:26,840
Yep. No problem. See you next week. I hope so.

550
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:36,010
I think it's probably. No one ever really wanted to argue, as they did a trial of different digital activities after already set up.

551
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:48,130
So when they do a an actual prostate exam for PSA screened for prostate cancer digital rectal exam where they're actually just like,

552
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:52,670
put your finger in the butt and feel right and see if there's any.

553
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:56,090
Like, does it move? Are there lumps in the TV?

554
01:12:56,540 --> 01:13:03,920
So it's a very like subjective, right? Probably have to be very familiar with prostate health just like that.

555
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:08,980
That seems like. So do you still do it?

556
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:14,650
It's kind of like when you go in and they do the breast exam and you're like, What's the point like?

557
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:19,100
Yeah. Yeah. Don't really believe that.

558
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:26,860
You know, you go in for your annual I don't know. It's the first day of the drama. All right.

559
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:36,620
Common answer, but it was kind of a like it was like really prevalent breast cancer.

560
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:43,960
They were really fine. I didn't know that. Yeah, I mean, honestly, you're probably going to get positive.

561
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:49,550
I mean, it's like you live long enough in your life, I guess just increases the likelihood of that.

562
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:55,350
Right. Yeah. So. Not a dinosaur.

563
01:13:56,610 --> 01:14:00,210
Other things eventually in Syria.

564
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,540
Thank you. Yeah. Seniors, do they have a good one we got?

565
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:11,120
Yeah. Thank you.
