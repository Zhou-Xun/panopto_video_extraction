1
00:00:25,520 --> 00:01:02,749
okay

2
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:08,309
good morning for restart six five minutes to get everything loaded on this thing.

3
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:13,589
so as usual we'll just review a quick status.

4
00:01:13,589 --> 00:01:18,969
the maximum possible I think was twenty eighty four because I still have to go in and break

5
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:24,149
your responses. so that's good. season the sixties

6
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:29,309
and seventies I wanna pull that up. okay. so you can take it again. remember I dropped a couple

7
00:01:29,309 --> 00:01:34,689
of quizzes so it's not gonna affect your great. you know I'd like to see everybody do better.

8
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:39,869
this question was good. I'm remembering public participation in the books we've

9
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,909
tried really hard to make it more than just a paperwork process. okay.

10
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,109
and so see if you has a number different steps to engage

11
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:55,249
the public in a more creative way. so you know I I recognize that some

12
00:01:55,249 --> 00:02:00,901
of these questions kind of you could go one way or the other so don't stress about. okay. but

13
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:06,281
the main point here though is that EPA is trying hard to engage

14
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:11,401
folks a hundred percent that's good. pharmacy.

15
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:17,381
the key thing about the pharmacy the finding of no significant impact.

16
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:22,641
this is really the way that a lot of industry and proponents wanna go. okay. zero four

17
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:27,941
eight study for me process.

18
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:33,221
any questions on that. 's like a screening tool so that's

19
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:38,541
pretty straightforward. I'm one thing that I really did like was your selection of readings

20
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:43,701
that you like and I hope that feedback you know it was

21
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:48,921
good. I mean I enjoyed seeing that feedback. I also like to see

22
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:54,861
your responses for the Geo five. so I asked you you know about unintended

23
00:02:54,861 --> 00:03:00,633
consequences. did anything surprise you with that

24
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:06,113
there are any things that sort out for you about an unintended consequence of a

25
00:03:06,113 --> 00:03:12,533
well-meaning bill yeah

26
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:19,753
yeah they're

27
00:03:19,753 --> 00:03:26,593
okay and the areas that kind of show

28
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:36,693
she heard why

29
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:43,773
she is making it for surgery.

30
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:50,433
right right but.

31
00:03:50,433 --> 00:04:02,219
okay. anyone else

32
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:13,239
okay

33
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:22,199
right right martin

34
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,739
right. good. hello. 's.

35
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:32,739
for more national

36
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:38,099
issues. so that came about your subject areas

37
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:43,179
right to make sure that they could switch to what he actually ended up doing

38
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:48,239
was increased development in flood prone right and then they like

39
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:54,779
had to pay out so much money you know we can increase claim it affects an increase in funding instances

40
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:59,809
where there is so much that they I don't

41
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:04,909
want to take it away right yeah I mean this is really a fascinating story for native to this

42
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:10,189
one all the others as well and it happens all the time you know in fire restoration

43
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:15,669
I finished up the report last night of a fire affecting a community and they had to clean their houses

44
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:20,689
afterwards or what they go in is they put in oh. zone and other kinda

45
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:26,089
notches chemicals and they can actually make it works. okay so that's

46
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:31,249
you know unintended consequences. you know if you're doing research or practice with people you might

47
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:36,729
design a great policy but then you inside sign the people don't behave the way you expect them to.

48
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:41,809
okay and so this is Thomas and all the time and it's one of the reasons why in public health you know

49
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:46,869
you have these behavior courses. so lost a good stuff with that. so

50
00:05:46,869 --> 00:05:52,129
I appreciate that and that's enough of this. okay.

51
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:57,395
any questions on this quiz so today

52
00:05:57,395 --> 00:06:02,935
we have a very intense chapter on modeling and my intention

53
00:06:02,935 --> 00:06:08,235
in this chapter is not to scare you away or anything to catch you to

54
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:13,595
talk to language of modelers. okay. and we'll go through some concepts

55
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:18,675
in environmental fate and transport and bio kinetic modeling to the extent we came to

56
00:06:18,675 --> 00:06:23,795
ours. so I'm gonna go pretty fast I'm gonna skip certain parts and

57
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:28,815
I want you to learn the language. so if I say sensitivity analysis

58
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:34,195
or variability or uncertainty I want you know what that means for model product gnostic modeling

59
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:40,235
things like this it's a language that I'm after and then we'll get more into applications as we go. again

60
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:45,275
along in the semester. so how maybe which is a climate strike on Fridays to shift

61
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:50,795
gears a little bit. okay. and

62
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:56,275
you know yesterday at the UN was a big climate meeting right and this is probably

63
00:06:56,275 --> 00:07:01,515
the preeminent environmental model of our time is with climate change

64
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:06,815
in global circulation and these types of models okay. and so

65
00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:12,735
I was looking for one that you might be able to use and Ron and I encourage you to

66
00:07:12,735 --> 00:07:18,095
check out this site it's called global calculator and it's a very simple spreadsheet

67
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:23,775
type of model but what it allows you to do is to

68
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:28,775
put in different scenarios like how much travel you're gonna do or what's the

69
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:34,795
energy mix gonna be and then predicts the

70
00:07:34,795 --> 00:07:43,312
a number different impacts including cost and

71
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:48,652
energy futures and things like this and I just encourage you to look at it

72
00:07:48,652 --> 00:07:53,752
and okay and give it a try. it's it's very simple in some ways but it's

73
00:07:53,752 --> 00:07:59,092
also very complex in other ways and this is just showing you for example the historical

74
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:04,152
temperatures and then based on the scenarios here that can include lifestyle

75
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:09,392
technology land and other parameters that I can change it comes up with upper

76
00:08:09,392 --> 00:08:15,092
and lower boundary for temperatures over the next seventy

77
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:20,792
years something like that. so it's a cool little application. it's actually a spreadsheet model.

78
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:25,952
okay just been reported to the web. you know nice interface. so you can make

79
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:31,212
simple calculations look really jazzy if you want give that a shot.

80
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:36,572
bye. have much more structured models that we're gonna use in the course.

81
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:42,446
so should a goal is to try to get through all of this stuff here and

82
00:08:42,446 --> 00:08:47,546
the readings are not as essential as understanding the slides. but you should take a look

83
00:08:47,546 --> 00:08:52,606
at the readings. so I wanna cover a little bit of reasons tomorrow

84
00:08:52,606 --> 00:08:57,846
and focus really on mass balance modeling. will

85
00:08:57,846 --> 00:09:02,866
talk about some of the language for modeling and then I'll go through a progression of very trivial

86
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:08,026
to fairly sophisticated model examples with a little bit of math. so brush that off

87
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:13,226
with us back to science and math and physics and stuff like that. then we'll talk about

88
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:18,626
model of valuation with how you formulate models. what makes good models and and some of the modeling

89
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:23,686
issues. this is an awful lot to do. okay. so I've said

90
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:28,746
all of this and some of the readings that I have

91
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:34,046
put on canvas I listed here. this is a national research

92
00:09:34,046 --> 00:09:39,646
council report from what about twelve years ago. describing how models are used in the regulatory

93
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:45,424
process they are an essential piece of the regulators to kids.

94
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:50,824
they should also be major portions of policy makers toolkits

95
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:55,944
as well. okay. and so having some understanding not just to

96
00:09:55,944 --> 00:10:02,044
be able to say you know you've left this out your models not good. it's you know show me the the proof

97
00:10:02,044 --> 00:10:08,524
but to make things better as well. so we have to look at it on both pros and cons. bye.

98
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:13,644
okay. so models you guys have various types of definitions but

99
00:10:13,644 --> 00:10:18,964
one is this is a simplification reduction of reality utilize for some purpose.

100
00:10:18,964 --> 00:10:24,144
and this is one of the definition of mathematical definition is

101
00:10:24,144 --> 00:10:29,204
that it's some simplified version

102
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:34,864
of the system and the processes that take place within it and third

103
00:10:34,864 --> 00:10:40,466
type definition is a mathematical one. we're basically I have. why is equal to half of

104
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:45,566
now in each of these three definitions are just very quickly going through there is a tremendous

105
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:50,566
amount of subtleties let's look at the third one when you have a function like why because

106
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:55,646
after tax what's the dependent variable line of course

107
00:10:55,646 --> 00:11:01,006
what's the independent variable vector of access okay. and so the idea

108
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:06,726
is that why depends on these axes the exes are for independent

109
00:11:06,726 --> 00:11:11,926
variables and presumably not affected by why but relationship goes

110
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:17,066
one way. okay they affect why we can break this down into two pieces you have

111
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:22,066
the exes those of the parameters and they have specific values that go into the model and then there's some

112
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:27,166
sort of algebraic relationship between them and that's the structure. so why this is equal half to

113
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:33,446
of ex is a model that has two basic parts structure and the parameters go into it.

114
00:11:33,446 --> 00:11:38,646
okay. in engineering or some policy applications. we talk about taxes

115
00:11:38,646 --> 00:11:44,044
is the things that we can control okay so we'll change the dynamics

116
00:11:44,044 --> 00:11:49,044
of electrical power system by increasing or decreasing Hydro. okay that might be an

117
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:54,584
ex. okay and why might be one of us you know CO2

118
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:59,624
emissions or something like that. climate change and okay from these

119
00:11:59,624 --> 00:12:04,704
other definitions here. the things I want to emphasize the seems very basic but it's important. we

120
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:10,024
have a reason to do this. okay. and we have an application.

121
00:12:10,024 --> 00:12:15,144
so it's important that we get this right. so

122
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:20,384
you know we talked about impact analysis and the definitions and approaches

123
00:12:20,384 --> 00:12:25,804
ours. describe here we have a review of what the problem is the scoping. we select

124
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:31,344
indicators are measuring something that we care about. we come up with

125
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:36,664
an impact assessment where we evaluate the indicators often numerically. we might use

126
00:12:36,664 --> 00:12:42,094
modeling to figure out what's gonna happen in the future okay and then in the EIS

127
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:47,434
process we look at alternatives and those alternatives have to be evaluated so we would use the modeling

128
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:52,854
for that as well. we put it all together and we make recommendations and decisions. so in this

129
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:57,854
modeling plays a central park. okay. because we need to figure out what are

130
00:12:57,854 --> 00:13:05,254
the future impacts of alternatives. so that's how it relates to impact analysis.

131
00:13:05,254 --> 00:13:10,354
so this slide has some of the jargon that you need to know. okay.

132
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:15,394
if I am modeling to predict what's gonna happen. okay.

133
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:20,612
I call that simulation and in the context of say climate

134
00:13:20,612 --> 00:13:25,772
change in temperatures I might say we're gonna have a business as usual and

135
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:31,172
that's the scenario that we're gonna look at and again I will simulate that scenario.

136
00:13:31,172 --> 00:13:36,572
okay. if I wanna learn what's important to the functioning

137
00:13:36,572 --> 00:13:42,172
of the system. you know the words how important is it that I

138
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:48,432
put back the café standards that the administration remove these are the mileage standards.

139
00:13:48,432 --> 00:13:53,732
how much of a difference at is me then I'm trying to see what's

140
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:58,952
important and we call that a sensitivity analysis mathematically.

141
00:13:58,952 --> 00:14:05,032
I take my again my simple dependent and independent

142
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:11,272
structure and parameter model relationship and I change one of the inputs.

143
00:14:11,272 --> 00:14:16,792
okay and I see how much the model result changes and that's one way to to investigate

144
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:22,169
us instantly okay another example if you're into

145
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:27,249
natural systems or water systems. what's the limiting nutrient. okay and

146
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:32,329
how much is that change results as compared to something that's not limited. well it oughta

147
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:37,449
be greatly different if it's a limiting. talk more about that. okay.

148
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:42,489
so this is what we call sensitivity now also sometimes called Prog gnostic modeling.

149
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:47,949
okay to try to understand what's happening. Sir Bruce. reason

150
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:53,409
or tomorrow is to generate alternatives or determine the best alternative

151
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:58,469
and this might be done in a cost effective manner. what's the most bank you can get

152
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:03,589
with the box. this is what we call maximization for optimization.

153
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:08,589
and this is typically structured as a maximization or house com or the

154
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:15,789
minimization of the outcome subject to different constraints. what would be an example of a constrained

155
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:21,373
budget for example you only have so much money or you can only push the technology

156
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:26,573
so hard. we'll talk a little bit more about all these. I'm a fourth reason is

157
00:15:26,573 --> 00:15:32,453
to identify behaviors that might affect the ability to

158
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:37,573
model to implement or change system and this needs to incorporate things

159
00:15:37,573 --> 00:15:42,693
like risk averse medicine. how much people will cooperate with one another and this

160
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:48,013
is typically a different type of model than most of the others we call it again. unfortunately

161
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:53,193
simulations but it's also called gaming. okay. and they're all kinds of features based models

162
00:15:53,193 --> 00:15:58,453
for example that might be used for simple rules to figure out how collected but he's

163
00:15:58,453 --> 00:16:03,853
okay. questions on this. so again what I want you know is simulation sensitivity

164
00:16:03,853 --> 00:16:10,273
analysis optimization and gaming. just kind of application.

165
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:15,997
there's more. okay if I wanna know what's gonna happen in the future to forecast something

166
00:16:15,997 --> 00:16:21,357
I call that forecasting. okay so basically we might simulate an energy scenario and forecast

167
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:27,097
what is the time change now. no other reason

168
00:16:27,097 --> 00:16:32,677
to model is a little more complex in the sense of assigning culpability

169
00:16:32,677 --> 00:16:38,917
or who's responsible in this folder spank him to figuring out what's a good way to control the situation.

170
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:44,177
the example that I work with the most is a portion minutes of particulate

171
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:50,157
matter in the air for example if we go out and measure air quality we might see that

172
00:16:50,157 --> 00:16:55,377
today it's very clear day but if I go back a few other days some of those hot and hazy days.

173
00:16:55,377 --> 00:17:00,697
we might've had a particulate matter concentration of say twenty five micrograms per cubic meter.

174
00:17:00,697 --> 00:17:06,277
okay who's responsible for that. there are

175
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:11,297
millions of sources. pollutants coming from long range they come in

176
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:16,299
from nearby. I wanna know how to bring the p.m. level down

177
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:26,479
how why figure out who's responsible. so anybody you know how to do this.

178
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:45,039
yeah.

179
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,039
okay so what you're telling me is what we call receptor modeling which is based on the composition of the

180
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:55,039
particles that I measure and matching that to different source characteristics that's

181
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:00,679
model. that's a statistical model. I could also use a simulation model by modeling

182
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,859
contributions from cars power plants and other things and then seeing who is

183
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:11,119
actually putting out the pollution I calls this level at this location.

184
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:16,313
so those are two very different approaches ones receptor modeling based on what I measure

185
00:18:16,313 --> 00:18:21,653
location and the other is a simulation model using typically a dispersion model.

186
00:18:21,653 --> 00:18:27,233
good. seventh reasons

187
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:32,413
model is just because it's cheaper to manipulate a system with a computer and you know with

188
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:37,593
and actually build something and test it out and so it's

189
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:42,793
clearly not feasible to do a lot of things that you can actually quite simply model

190
00:18:42,793 --> 00:18:47,953
the complexity of the world is another reason you know for talking

191
00:18:47,953 --> 00:18:52,953
about things like climate change or some many factors that go into it and she using

192
00:18:52,953 --> 00:18:58,593
the parts of different pieces and their significance as possible without a mathematical

193
00:18:58,593 --> 00:19:03,953
structure and then finally will use models

194
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:09,273
because we have to. okay. EPA says you need must do this.

195
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:14,973
okay. or whatever. alright questions on this page

196
00:19:14,973 --> 00:19:20,033
good. so I'm from the NRC

197
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:26,093
review. there's a little bit of text about how the EPA is using models and

198
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:31,413
you know they have a very long history here and you know all models

199
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:36,953
simplification 's. but you know what we need to do is focus on what's important

200
00:19:36,953 --> 00:19:41,973
and we need to understand how good the model. 's. okay and

201
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:47,253
so that's really some of the points that are made here. lot of other points as well. now I talk

202
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:53,173
to you about optimization. I mean if you have ever run an optimization model before.

203
00:19:53,173 --> 00:19:58,181
okay. good you know this is some sort

204
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:03,661
of micro economic types of things but for example if you're looking at chemical exposure could be a worker

205
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:08,881
or a community whatever as I tried to bring it down by using better source controls

206
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:14,561
or possibly different materials. the cost of doing this may increase.

207
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:20,121
okay. and we have sort of a exponentially increasing cost

208
00:20:20,121 --> 00:20:25,501
in this picture as I tried to eliminate eliminate the chemical exposure.

209
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:30,681
alright so this is just sort of hypothetical graph now for

210
00:20:30,681 --> 00:20:35,721
any particular little point on this

211
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:40,921
plot. some of them are feasible and some are not feasible and what I'm showing you here

212
00:20:40,921 --> 00:20:46,161
is a location where I have say moderate chemical exposure. okay. based on

213
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:51,261
the X scale and the control cost is fairly high and based on this

214
00:20:51,261 --> 00:20:56,358
plot. what I should be able to do is to bring down the cost

215
00:20:56,358 --> 00:21:01,738
get the same chemical exposures so I could optimize this

216
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:07,658
by reducing the control cost by maybe improving the process for the technology and achieve the same

217
00:21:07,658 --> 00:21:14,298
level of chemical exposure maybe better than that would be to go in this direction

218
00:21:14,298 --> 00:21:19,418
by which I greatly reduced the chemical exposure. but

219
00:21:19,418 --> 00:21:24,858
the control post doesn't change. okay so both of these are examples

220
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:30,118
of optimization and the point of the optimization is to get on this curve

221
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:35,558
which we may call the French here is a production service curve or something like that depending on where you are in economics

222
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:40,638
and social well for things and stuff like that. okay. but the main point is don't

223
00:21:40,638 --> 00:21:45,698
be in this yellow area because you can always do better in terms of lower cost

224
00:21:45,698 --> 00:21:53,298
or better for for everybody see that. okay. question.

225
00:21:53,298 --> 00:22:01,282
yeah. so

226
00:22:01,282 --> 00:22:06,322
yeah. so you know technology changes things get you

227
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:11,442
know your cell phone gets more powerful for the same cost and so forth. so you know if

228
00:22:11,442 --> 00:22:16,462
you're looking at your cell phone performance or something on a load of high scale.

229
00:22:16,462 --> 00:22:26,322
maybe you can upgrade without increasing your cost. okay.

230
00:22:26,322 --> 00:22:33,302
okay so let's talk about the doesn't that's completely unrelated samples. let's say you have um

231
00:22:33,302 --> 00:22:38,742
a water treatment plant it's discharging some pollutants

232
00:22:38,742 --> 00:22:44,242
and it's deciding whether to put on primary treatment secondary

233
00:22:44,242 --> 00:22:49,442
treatment for serious treatments go up and clean up or whatever. each of those things

234
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:54,482
cost money. okay. and as I put on the additional layers of cleanup.

235
00:22:54,482 --> 00:23:02,116
I reduce the exposure. but my cost goes up okay so the question is

236
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:07,896
up here. I might not have a very effective choice of cleanup strategy.

237
00:23:07,896 --> 00:23:13,136
so I can do the same performance. okay. by using

238
00:23:13,136 --> 00:23:20,396
a better. 's smarter selection of cleanup strategies. that's all. so. okay.

239
00:23:20,396 --> 00:23:25,496
can I get to this point right here. the

240
00:23:25,496 --> 00:23:30,556
reason is that this to find is what's feasible or possible to do and you

241
00:23:30,556 --> 00:23:35,776
know the point I'd like to be as low. we're zero chemical exposure and low

242
00:23:35,776 --> 00:23:41,236
cost. but technically that's not feasible. okay. so this is what's called and feasible

243
00:23:41,236 --> 00:23:46,256
region. this is a feasible region. but the only possible reason. region or

244
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:51,416
set of solutions is on the score everybody with me on us.

245
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:57,804
now that was a good. simple question. first question is

246
00:23:57,804 --> 00:24:07,304
what's the best solution.

247
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:12,604
what doing are you. okay. my reasons for anything.

248
00:24:12,604 --> 00:24:18,884
okay. when

249
00:24:18,884 --> 00:24:24,864
yeah visual privileges anywhere you want be disappointed is woman's role black loss.

250
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:34,944
okay. because the rush is sort of contextual policy determines whatever

251
00:24:34,944 --> 00:24:40,864
like the regulated except you're looking at this like this is their basement

252
00:24:40,864 --> 00:24:46,584
right across from us right there probably had a

253
00:24:46,584 --> 00:24:52,084
lower cost that they can achieve. they were the

254
00:24:52,084 --> 00:24:57,356
first year was a story sure. so if you know the regulator

255
00:24:57,356 --> 00:25:02,896
said you can't have exposure. more 's. this is where. they are okay.

256
00:25:02,896 --> 00:25:08,536
so this is basically you know some sort of micro economic types of approaches

257
00:25:08,536 --> 00:25:13,936
or basic optimization thinking about a trade off with one parameter

258
00:25:13,936 --> 00:25:19,876
here. okay and showing you feasible and infeasible and optimal solutions.

259
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:25,276
okay. models can be used to define this person

260
00:25:25,276 --> 00:25:30,396
right to figure out the best that you can do and I'll show you an example now.

261
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:36,076
if you look at any reasonable projects for example the highway expansion.

262
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:41,236
you've got cost issues you've got air quality issues you got safety you've got noise you got all kinds

263
00:25:41,236 --> 00:25:46,236
of other issues and that kind of production front here here it has to be

264
00:25:46,236 --> 00:25:51,316
looked at in multiple dimensions because you got multiple trade-offs going on. okay. so there may

265
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:56,500
not be a simple solution to it but still models can help clarify this

266
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,900
kind of example is typical for pretty much all projects that require modeling.

267
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,980
there's a lot of information many people are involved boundaries and even

268
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:12,180
the scope of the problem is not is not clearly defined the loss of objective

269
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:17,300
lots of constraints. complex relationships. nonetheless you know I would still argue

270
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,340
the models play a pretty essential role here. okay. because it's an explicit statement of

271
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:27,920
what you think is happening. okay. may not be the way policy is made.

272
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:35,490
but is your best kind of technical rational turn to to improving the outcomes

273
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:40,830
okay. 's founders. so bold reasonable model really important. the

274
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:45,830
climate change model. 's and I mentioned is got an this enormous boundaries the

275
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:51,130
entire globe for example that might be needed

276
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:56,310
given the nature of the problem. typically though that kind of model is not tractable

277
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:01,690
and amenable to analysis and we need to break it up and simplify it.

278
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:07,910
so selection of a boundary is really important for that. boundaries can be institutional

279
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:13,430
defined by the regulator can be economic can be environmental.

280
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:18,830
these are all factors that can influence the boundary and the boundary of the model

281
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:23,990
environment is different. often is a geographic scale of temporal scales

282
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:30,610
and functional with media pathways and contaminants are involved.

283
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:35,819
one of the examples that sometimes I use for this is an application for

284
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:40,839
that steam assisted gravity oil sands extraction that I showed you on

285
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:46,239
the first day and this is like third of the third. it's a huge

286
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:52,399
state you know huge province in Canada and they do find the study area

287
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:58,839
for water quality impacts based on the drainage

288
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:05,459
with the idea that this is where water quality impacts would

289
00:28:05,459 --> 00:28:10,839
apply on the other hand the air quality impacts for much broader

290
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:15,999
and so you know I can go on at length here but you can have multiple types of projects or model

291
00:28:15,999 --> 00:28:22,639
boundaries depending on what you're looking in the same so much.

292
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:27,819
okay. next destination. mass balance modeling. some of you. I hope

293
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:33,079
are familiar with those sort to be familiar with us. yes no.

294
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:38,115
alright well this is important message balance modeling is a process of

295
00:28:38,115 --> 00:28:43,555
accounting for transport that's the chemical movements in the face

296
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:48,695
that's a degradation accumulation vibe accumulation et cetera. of typically

297
00:28:48,695 --> 00:28:53,775
contaminants in different environmental compartments. you are an environmental

298
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:58,955
compartment. okay. or what body is an environmental

299
00:28:58,955 --> 00:29:04,315
compartment key terms in the mass balance modeling.

300
00:29:04,315 --> 00:29:09,975
are the source. where is the mass and this is really contemporary

301
00:29:09,975 --> 00:29:15,755
and it's coming from what's up halfway house getting there.

302
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:20,955
what's the sinks. this is a location where the containment is ultimately stored

303
00:29:20,955 --> 00:29:26,175
or integrated or transferred out loading toward input or flux

304
00:29:26,175 --> 00:29:31,335
deals with the rate at which the sources and meeting the contaminants

305
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:36,415
and the mass balance is that this home of everything entering that

306
00:29:36,415 --> 00:29:41,495
compartment should match with leaving it in what's being

307
00:29:41,495 --> 00:29:46,935
stored. okay. so let me make this more real to you.

308
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:52,655
hey if you go swimming in like Michigan or boating rooms and look. alright. good big like right.

309
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:57,675
so on the left panel we're showing estimates from a very large study that

310
00:29:57,675 --> 00:30:03,135
was done a while back for mass balance of PC bees and this one is Mercury

311
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:08,275
doesn't matter which one we look at DC Beach. most of the PC bees coming

312
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:13,455
into the lake. okay. come in from the Fox River because

313
00:30:13,455 --> 00:30:19,255
it's contaminated superfund site. so they come in through this water pathway.

314
00:30:19,255 --> 00:30:24,275
there is Kalamazoo River. we talked about that. okay we know it's contaminated because of those

315
00:30:24,275 --> 00:30:29,635
paper mills. there is smaller loading 's and the size of these bars indicate

316
00:30:29,635 --> 00:30:35,255
about how much is coming in from some of the other ports along the harbor

317
00:30:35,255 --> 00:30:41,617
where's most of the PC becoming

318
00:30:41,617 --> 00:30:46,817
from the Fox however the blue arrow showing that hair

319
00:30:46,817 --> 00:30:52,317
deposition atmospheric loading over the surface of the lake which is large

320
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:57,517
is in fact responsible for most of it. okay. almost a twenty year or more

321
00:30:57,517 --> 00:31:03,037
that's more than twenty years. 's son and a half year. okay.

322
00:31:03,037 --> 00:31:08,297
somewhat larger than the combined tributary loading switcher three one twenty five kilograms.

323
00:31:08,297 --> 00:31:13,477
okay. same thing on the rights for Mercury we have tributary a

324
00:31:13,477 --> 00:31:18,577
loading 's of Mercury coming in some of the same locations are there but

325
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:23,577
the atmosphere closings are also dominant. interestingly the levels are about

326
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:28,817
half of the Mercury cases it's coming but their

327
00:31:28,817 --> 00:31:33,837
portion to someone something. so what we have in those pictures is

328
00:31:33,837 --> 00:31:39,155
depicted better here. we have stuff coming in from the air okay

329
00:31:39,155 --> 00:31:44,155
in terms of kilograms per year comes in and rainfall comes dry particles comes

330
00:31:44,155 --> 00:31:49,555
from absorption gas to the water. okay. we have some coming from shoreline

331
00:31:49,555 --> 00:31:54,855
discharges and river discharges and things like that. okay. and

332
00:31:54,855 --> 00:32:00,455
this qualifies in a different estimate the kilograms per year that are coming in

333
00:32:00,455 --> 00:32:05,535
now in billboard the or call here. we have a

334
00:32:05,535 --> 00:32:10,755
balance between what's coming in from the atmosphere and the tributaries and

335
00:32:10,755 --> 00:32:15,795
what's being incorporated into the surface sentiments down here. so some of the stuff. I

336
00:32:15,795 --> 00:32:20,955
mean it likes carbon rich fatty stuff so it's gonna be fine too and so soon

337
00:32:20,955 --> 00:32:26,515
and will be incorporated in surface items. okay. some of those settlements get buried

338
00:32:26,515 --> 00:32:31,515
and they get into what's considered deeper less successful or deeper real.

339
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:36,695
basically gone from circulation. okay. and then we also have

340
00:32:36,695 --> 00:32:41,821
some losses do to a little bit of degradation transformation and we

341
00:32:41,821 --> 00:32:46,961
have Al flows via St. Mary's River at the top of the legs. so we lose a little

342
00:32:46,961 --> 00:32:52,381
bit of peace TVs that way. the idea of the mass balances that all of these

343
00:32:52,381 --> 00:32:57,841
songs at together in Mass.. okay.

344
00:32:57,841 --> 00:33:14,331
so it's very complicated.

345
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:19,331
Joe that's a very good point yeah and as they degrade it may change their bio

346
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:24,391
accumulation characteristics and so forth. so yeah it's a multi step process for PC bees

347
00:33:24,391 --> 00:33:33,891
and this is one of the concerns that just they're so persistent.

348
00:33:33,891 --> 00:33:39,031
yeah bio it is kinda incorporated into this and it's not really brought out separately.

349
00:33:39,031 --> 00:33:44,431
this is very complicated. okay. my point here is to not get into the subtleties

350
00:33:44,431 --> 00:33:50,791
but to talk early mostly about the past wage but you're up.

351
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:55,811
okay. a couple other points from this. we have pathways that are two way here

352
00:33:55,811 --> 00:34:01,391
we have deposition absorption coming in but we also involve socialization. okay. so it's

353
00:34:01,391 --> 00:34:06,711
really we need to look at the net. okay. second thing is where

354
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:12,736
is most of the PC being in the system

355
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:18,576
absolutely look at the settlements and here it says forty two hundred kilograms in the settlements

356
00:34:18,576 --> 00:34:23,996
in the water column. we have thirteen hundred kilograms still quite a lot.

357
00:34:23,996 --> 00:34:28,996
okay but most of it's in the settlements and they don't even talk about the deeper buried settlements is

358
00:34:28,996 --> 00:34:34,096
probably much much more there. we. don't okay. so the mass.

359
00:34:34,096 --> 00:34:39,396
also tell the mass balance also tells us where the stuff is and in this particular

360
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:44,896
example. I have really models the water column the surface

361
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:50,456
settlements in the deep settlements the separate compartments and I'm tracking PC

362
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:57,196
that are flowing into and out of each of those compartments.

363
00:34:57,196 --> 00:35:04,356
we reduce you. hello

364
00:35:04,356 --> 00:35:09,376
I can't recall okay that's

365
00:35:09,376 --> 00:35:14,416
a very complicated picture let's make it simple practical for us. we have inputs coming

366
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:20,176
in to some control volume some compartments and we have outputs.

367
00:35:20,176 --> 00:35:25,256
okay so it maybe a stream flowing into a lake discharging and

368
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:30,276
generate the flow downstream. okay. what we want to do is track

369
00:35:30,276 --> 00:35:35,616
what comes into our control volume. understand the slowest mass inputs or flux

370
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:40,756
is coming in. flux is or discharge is coming out

371
00:35:40,756 --> 00:35:46,396
and any reactions and accumulations that are occurring within this control going.

372
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:51,456
it's important to understand this language okay. control volume is something I do fine.

373
00:35:51,456 --> 00:35:56,756
okay it could be discrete logical things like a lake

374
00:35:56,756 --> 00:36:01,816
it could be as cells in your body. okay. and in fact

375
00:36:01,816 --> 00:36:07,562
exactly the same types of approaches might be use at the cellular or organist mistake level

376
00:36:07,562 --> 00:36:12,762
okay so I might look at your liver your brain or something like that and that's what form two kinetic models

377
00:36:12,762 --> 00:36:17,982
with the mass balance puts together the boundary

378
00:36:17,982 --> 00:36:23,242
and the flows and it says that what I accumulate in the control volume

379
00:36:23,242 --> 00:36:28,242
is equal to what flows in minus what flows out plus

380
00:36:28,242 --> 00:36:33,262
or minus the reactions formation that occur within that control

381
00:36:33,262 --> 00:36:38,262
bye. okay. and those reactions are typically negative

382
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:43,402
losing mass. we could be positive like with forms of contaminants or if there's no

383
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:52,482
is that zero and it's life simple and happy. Michael.

384
00:36:52,482 --> 00:36:57,582
everybody okay on this. if you don't like this. you gotta stop now

385
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:03,662
because guess much worse. alright. if you wanna think of this as a bathtub

386
00:37:03,662 --> 00:37:08,736
and you're running the water in and then if it slows out you've

387
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:14,316
got your. okay. I don't care how you think about. if you wanna think about it is

388
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:19,516
you're making a recipe. okay and you're cooking and you're adding stuff into the pot. I don't

389
00:37:19,516 --> 00:37:26,736
care. but you gotta have a conception in your mind. alright.

390
00:37:26,736 --> 00:37:31,796
so what I wanna do then is take that reaction and expression differential terms

391
00:37:31,796 --> 00:37:37,596
where I have the mass flowing in but now I'm gonna look at in terms of a mass time per so it's rate

392
00:37:37,596 --> 00:37:42,616
and then that's the inflow coming in minus the outflow plus or minus

393
00:37:42,616 --> 00:37:49,976
a reaction. so I've taken exactly the same thing right here and I've just made it into a differential

394
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:55,576
and I express this is rates now and then it's steady state

395
00:37:55,576 --> 00:38:00,917
and this is a very critical assumption that means that the mass

396
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:06,016
in the control volume is changing on not changing over time.

397
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:11,356
so I can set the left side of the sequel to zero and that means that the inflows

398
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:16,516
are equal to the flows. so your bathtub has the same amount of water running as it does coming

399
00:38:16,516 --> 00:38:21,836
out. so it doesn't overflow. okay. or whatever your model

400
00:38:21,836 --> 00:38:27,076
is plus or minus the reaction to take place. Stacy is key

401
00:38:27,076 --> 00:38:32,096
concepts because it allows us to really simplify model. if that

402
00:38:32,096 --> 00:38:38,076
sometimes the case next. if there is no reaction

403
00:38:38,076 --> 00:38:43,456
degradation or whatever. then what I'm modeling is what's called a conservative in

404
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:48,536
contaminants and there's no reaction. so that means that last term goes

405
00:38:48,536 --> 00:38:54,256
away and then if I'm both conservative

406
00:38:54,256 --> 00:38:59,956
and it's steady state. it's really sucks what flows and flows out

407
00:38:59,956 --> 00:39:05,416
to Mass.. so many PC bees per year coming into Lake Michigan. is exactly

408
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:10,539
equal to what's leaving weakness the amount of PCP in the lake

409
00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:15,958
system doesn't change. okay. everybody with me.

410
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:21,418
conservative in our study state mass balance modeling. that's really

411
00:39:21,418 --> 00:39:35,938
key. alright. good move on.

412
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:40,979
absolute enough. okay. so you could have stuff coming in. you could degrade and

413
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:45,979
nothing slows out and and I case you have a steady state system for different

414
00:39:45,979 --> 00:39:51,059
reasons. okay. study state is kind of a birds eye view you don't necessarily know what's

415
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:56,903
going on just and know it's not change good question. others.

416
00:39:56,903 --> 00:40:02,022
okay. so really the key expression here is shown up here.

417
00:40:02,022 --> 00:40:07,123
alright so stare at that recap mass balance

418
00:40:07,123 --> 00:40:12,282
modeling you need some well defined reactor system. you need to know what's flowing

419
00:40:12,282 --> 00:40:17,702
across that boundary that reactor system. ideally you know about the transport

420
00:40:17,702 --> 00:40:23,042
within the control volume and the kinetics the reactions take place

421
00:40:23,042 --> 00:40:28,982
and you need to ensure that the model structure has some relevance to reality.

422
00:40:28,982 --> 00:40:34,083
okay. which what we just did for like Michigan I know. okay. but you know we're

423
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:39,123
simplifying. alright let's do a couple of silly

424
00:40:39,123 --> 00:40:44,702
examples to make some of the stuff come home in other ways.

425
00:40:44,702 --> 00:40:49,942
okay. imagine you have a stream flowing from left to right here and it is flowing

426
00:40:49,942 --> 00:40:55,023
at specified volume and or or flow rate and we have an industrial

427
00:40:55,023 --> 00:41:00,183
plant making a discharge and some of the parameters here are that these

428
00:41:00,183 --> 00:41:05,443
discharges seven hundred fifty milligrams per liter or total dissolved solids TES and

429
00:41:05,443 --> 00:41:11,223
the discharge rate is a hundred cubic feet per second and I'm sorry about the whole class.

430
00:41:11,223 --> 00:41:16,344
okay it doesn't matter the receiving water body has a height

431
00:41:16,344 --> 00:41:21,483
of a velocity of a meter foot and a half for second with the forty five

432
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:26,983
feet depth of two feet and it has already. GTS involved

433
00:41:26,983 --> 00:41:32,023
at three hundred and ten milligrams per liter. okay. so my question to you is will achieve

434
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:37,043
your standard of say five hundred milligrams per liter be via lead. we and I turn

435
00:41:37,043 --> 00:41:42,303
on we district. okay. just

436
00:41:42,303 --> 00:41:47,763
a mass balance because I'm adding stuff I need to track it goes into a

437
00:41:47,763 --> 00:41:52,925
receiving order I have the dimensions of that and so forth now there's

438
00:41:52,925 --> 00:41:58,146
a lotta subtlety in these problems and I'm going to simplify it

439
00:41:58,146 --> 00:42:03,225
in reality will have a mixing zone such that the discharge from this facility

440
00:42:03,225 --> 00:42:08,325
isn't going to be completely diluted or mixed and this is gonna have a mixing zone where concentrations

441
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:15,585
might be high. okay. blow that away. ignore that right now.

442
00:42:15,585 --> 00:42:20,885
I have flows upstream and downstream I have concentrations upstream

443
00:42:20,885 --> 00:42:25,945
I need to figure out what is the concentration downstream. recognize that

444
00:42:25,945 --> 00:42:31,385
flow downstream is equal to both what the river 's flow was here plus the discharge

445
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:37,146
so I'm gonna need to account for that. I need to do a mass balance on move order for us

446
00:42:37,146 --> 00:42:42,146
less. okay. I also need to do a mass balance on the containment

447
00:42:42,146 --> 00:42:47,685
tedious. okay. so you guys could recognize

448
00:42:47,685 --> 00:42:52,765
easily that this is just dilution case where the concentration is defined

449
00:42:52,765 --> 00:42:57,865
as the mass over the volume or the flow rate coming in for

450
00:42:57,865 --> 00:43:02,946
walks mass per time. divided by the flow per time

451
00:43:02,946 --> 00:43:07,946
the flow rates and so I can take the product of the concentration and the

452
00:43:07,946 --> 00:43:13,125
discharge and this will give me a mass for time.

453
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:18,125
okay because the units here are milligrams per liter and if I say liters

454
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:23,485
per minute. then I get milligrams per minute. okay.

455
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:28,686
and then the same for the river because I already have upstream stuff here.

456
00:43:28,686 --> 00:43:33,725
so slow in the river times the concentration the river gives me another flux rate

457
00:43:33,725 --> 00:43:39,285
a contaminant and then I just had to two flows and so basically what I'm getting here is the

458
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:44,625
milligrams per minutes for example divided

459
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:49,845
by the liters per minute the flow rate. the minutes cross off and then I just end

460
00:43:49,845 --> 00:43:55,689
up with milligrams per liter concentration

461
00:43:55,689 --> 00:44:00,770
okay. so this is why the previous line said make sure your units work out they match they need

462
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:05,770
to everybody with me on here. so you know I

463
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:10,890
throw in the data here and put in the parameters I do not have that flowing the river

464
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:15,909
and get a make a simplistic assumption that it's just cross sectional area times

465
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:20,949
the flow rate. thank as you me this long this flow here and I substitute the data

466
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:26,590
in there and plug away the unit should cancel out in the result like it is there.

467
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:32,350
okay it's just simple voucher right so if I was

468
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:37,350
working for CMS mass or

469
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:42,790
ramble environmental some other consulting firm and you know I pick my clients

470
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:48,729
would pay my normal rate of whatever it is because I do cheesy standard

471
00:44:48,729 --> 00:44:54,570
and you can see I have a pretty precise answer.

472
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:59,589
so I can't are you guys are smiling with

473
00:44:59,589 --> 00:45:04,669
a basket. so this is incredibly simplistic model that kind

474
00:45:04,669 --> 00:45:10,869
of precision is not warranted right there so many things I've potentially left out.

475
00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:15,909
but I do get a result. okay and it is mass balance based. okay.

476
00:45:15,909 --> 00:45:21,030
it's a simple dilution questions on. 's. why

477
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:31,209
might this be wrong.

478
00:45:31,209 --> 00:45:36,530
you know and certainly

479
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:44,909
you know variation. great what else

480
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:50,049
well search this yet I could be wrong. what else I leave I'll

481
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:58,724
leave out anything besides variation

482
00:45:58,724 --> 00:46:05,664
hey it's physically boost plus # maybe it's okay.

483
00:46:05,664 --> 00:46:10,823
so you know we assumes a lot of things okay and it's really

484
00:46:10,823 --> 00:46:16,204
need to look at the assumptions that you're made implicitly here. we assumed that the

485
00:46:16,204 --> 00:46:21,543
mixing zones didn't occur it was uniformly and instantaneously mixed across

486
00:46:21,543 --> 00:46:27,083
the reach of the river and as we'll talk later states to impose

487
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:33,043
separate requirements for the near field zone years of discharge okay but downstream

488
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:38,104
it will be fully it's just a question of how far downstream you to go I assume

489
00:46:38,104 --> 00:46:45,184
infinite accuracy and we talked about that. I did assume that the mask was

490
00:46:45,184 --> 00:46:50,204
in to did the grade were conservative. okay. and so you

491
00:46:50,204 --> 00:46:55,303
know there is a physical basis to this model and that basis is again a match. I

492
00:46:55,303 --> 00:47:00,424
actually did too bad spouses I just the water flow. I didn't account for evaporation or anything

493
00:47:00,424 --> 00:47:06,004
like that and I did mass balance on the.

494
00:47:06,004 --> 00:47:11,264
okay. so the critical point here in mass balance

495
00:47:11,264 --> 00:47:16,543
modeling is that you preserve mass. got 's a physical basis and the output he inflict those

496
00:47:16,543 --> 00:47:22,224
changes plus reactions by I happen. okay.

497
00:47:22,224 --> 00:47:27,264
that's a critical. let's take the same model boosted up a level of complexity

498
00:47:27,264 --> 00:47:32,532
here. essentially the same type of approach but this case this is

499
00:47:32,532 --> 00:47:37,653
Marlene let's model DOD anybody heard of DOD before biological

500
00:47:37,653 --> 00:47:42,833
oxygen demand. it's a measure of how much oxygen is gonna be sucked out to metabolize

501
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:47,933
typically ways. okay that's. present. you can think of it is just

502
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:53,893
another contaminants. okay. beauty. same river parameters

503
00:47:53,893 --> 00:47:59,272
in this case we're discharging eight hundred milligrams per liter of DOD.

504
00:47:59,272 --> 00:48:05,173
that's actually a law how much oxygen is in the water.

505
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:12,052
so anybody know often got some water in here.

506
00:48:12,052 --> 00:48:20,433
smells like coffee though.

507
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:25,873
yeah much dissolved oxygen is the water does contain oxygen

508
00:48:25,873 --> 00:48:31,192
need because fish to get the oxygen yeah it depends

509
00:48:31,192 --> 00:48:36,652
on temperature. give me an order of magnitude.

510
00:48:36,652 --> 00:48:42,093
good so you learn stuff here. it's not much of like ten milligrams per liter.

511
00:48:42,093 --> 00:48:47,333
okay. not very much at all. alright. so it's easy to use it up and here were discharging

512
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:52,412
eight hundred milligrams per liter which means that you know we are super

513
00:48:52,412 --> 00:48:58,272
saturating and it's not really work but I mean there's gonna be this is a big

514
00:48:58,272 --> 00:49:03,333
source of case going to a hundred liters to dilute each

515
00:49:03,333 --> 00:49:08,452
leader come up with something it's reasonable. okay. so again

516
00:49:08,452 --> 00:49:13,593
I wanna figure out what's the deal D downstream and I care about dissolved oxygen

517
00:49:13,593 --> 00:49:19,312
because if it goes too low. what happens for us to high return belly up. okay.

518
00:49:19,312 --> 00:49:25,232
typically we have rules to keep it above five or six milligrams per liter.

519
00:49:25,232 --> 00:49:30,455
okay so let's do the same thing

520
00:49:30,455 --> 00:49:35,534
let's figure out what the DOD is in the receiving water by doing the mass

521
00:49:35,534 --> 00:49:40,794
balance again multiplying the beauties just charge concentration

522
00:49:40,794 --> 00:49:45,915
times the flow units again should match out and match up and I get three

523
00:49:45,915 --> 00:49:51,094
hundred twenty milligrams. this shouldn't surprise you because discharge here

524
00:49:51,094 --> 00:49:56,594
is diluted like a factor of two or three. okay. and so we end up with a just fresh

525
00:49:56,594 --> 00:50:03,875
start. okay. this is still really hot right

526
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:09,274
now. beauty is a little different because

527
00:50:09,274 --> 00:50:14,814
from TV because you know is it not conservative. it disappears

528
00:50:14,814 --> 00:50:20,175
oxygen comes in the uh the surface of the water and plants and algae

529
00:50:20,175 --> 00:50:25,635
and stuff in the water will save the water a little bit and it's common to describe

530
00:50:25,635 --> 00:50:30,663
the DOD disappearance with the first order to Kay or reaction

531
00:50:30,663 --> 00:50:35,663
like this such that the DOD I call that else the change with respect

532
00:50:35,663 --> 00:50:40,802
to time follows the first order reaction with the rate constant eight one which is that the

533
00:50:40,802 --> 00:50:46,262
oxygen nation rate times the concentration. typically Kay

534
00:50:46,262 --> 00:50:51,302
is on the order of point two point three per day. so that means that if I

535
00:50:51,302 --> 00:50:56,762
start off with a PO Dave what did I say it was three hundred and twenty

536
00:50:56,762 --> 00:51:01,843
after one day. I lose roughly twenty three percent of it.

537
00:51:01,843 --> 00:51:07,123
okay. because variation comes in beauty to grace. I can take

538
00:51:07,123 --> 00:51:12,542
this solution by integrating it and I come up with a curve that looks like this for the boundary

539
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:17,623
conditions plus the beauty needs to disappear at equal. and if

540
00:51:17,623 --> 00:51:23,183
I look at the you know the DOD at time team compared to the initial DOD.

541
00:51:23,183 --> 00:51:28,183
just they'll right at the or source a time T four zero. it's just a racial

542
00:51:28,183 --> 00:51:33,713
one and as I moved down in time it disappears and so at the

543
00:51:33,713 --> 00:51:38,753
and I can take the log of that and you get a straight line. okay you seem us in

544
00:51:38,753 --> 00:51:43,753
calculus before the key idea here is that how long this is take for LT did

545
00:51:43,753 --> 00:51:48,973
this decreased by half half would be here. go down I guess three

546
00:51:48,973 --> 00:51:54,032
or four days something like that. okay that makes sense if I'm losing about twenty percent per

547
00:51:54,032 --> 00:51:59,333
day. everybody with me on this first order disappearances

548
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:04,413
exponential decay to first order process. alright. this is the way

549
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:09,713
we typically model kinetics of something that has been fairly

550
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:14,792
constant worry. so let's apply that model and the

551
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:19,933
key governing piece of this models that expression there and here to

552
00:52:19,933 --> 00:52:25,893
answer this question I need to understand what time to live close in to my model

553
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:31,194
because rate is continuously decreasing over time so I need to determine

554
00:52:31,194 --> 00:52:36,574
the travel time and in this always use the river velocity

555
00:52:36,574 --> 00:52:41,875
and just to find the travel time is that distance. Jesus of interest. bless you.

556
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:47,314
divided by the velocity and the prom asked you to calculate the beauty

557
00:52:47,314 --> 00:52:54,115
at different distances and so for example at point one mile.

558
00:52:54,115 --> 00:52:59,314
I do the math and it's six point zero zero four days to get there. alright

559
00:52:59,314 --> 00:53:04,994
so the river is moving along at a meter and a half a second I mean not that fast going

560
00:53:04,994 --> 00:53:10,432
only point one miles paper for long distance okay then

561
00:53:10,432 --> 00:53:15,872
I'd take the concentration right downstream plug it into that

562
00:53:15,872 --> 00:53:20,952
expression that I had before which was EXT to the rate

563
00:53:20,952 --> 00:53:26,172
constant Kay one times the travel time that works out to be a point nine nine nine one

564
00:53:26,172 --> 00:53:31,192
and multiply those two together and I get still three hundred

565
00:53:31,192 --> 00:53:36,212
and twenty. 's. so what what's going on. I just said that

566
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:41,912
I have first older loss. but I'm ending up with the same concentration ability.

567
00:53:41,912 --> 00:53:48,512
why

568
00:53:48,512 --> 00:53:55,492
I accounted for decay.

569
00:53:55,492 --> 00:54:01,333
yeah

570
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:07,135
yeah there's been no time it's the same as when I took water I didn't have enough time goodbye.. exactly

571
00:54:07,135 --> 00:54:12,196
okay. so ten miles downstream it takes point four days. I do

572
00:54:12,196 --> 00:54:17,996
the same and. okay. and now I start to see about a ten percent loss.

573
00:54:17,996 --> 00:54:23,135
okay. okay. I just didn't give

574
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:28,216
the system enough time to actually do anything. point one.

575
00:54:28,216 --> 00:54:33,356
okay. so here I had to add an additional kind of calculation to figure

576
00:54:33,356 --> 00:54:38,375
out the travel time to put that into the model. I have pretty much the same assumptions

577
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:44,176
as the instantaneous mixing model. I had dilution. I assume constant geometry

578
00:54:44,176 --> 00:54:49,316
constant velocity constant a rate with the first order disappearance and

579
00:54:49,316 --> 00:54:54,396
so what I've actually done is solved a fairly complicated brawl by making up three models

580
00:54:54,396 --> 00:54:59,696
dilution model of degradation model transport models putting those together and coming

581
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:04,836
up with us. 's. okay. so we in fact have a little

582
00:55:04,836 --> 00:55:09,906
model system here what's the sensitivity of parameters

583
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:18,446
remember what sense of you know this is what is it

584
00:55:18,446 --> 00:55:32,325
somebody did you guys. okay. nobody knew.

585
00:55:32,325 --> 00:55:42,286
yeah. so based on what you saw here what do you think are most sensitive parameters.

586
00:55:42,286 --> 00:55:50,545
so what do you think would happen if I doubled –

587
00:55:50,545 --> 00:55:56,545
yeah but probably wanna change huge amount because we only saw a ten percent change.

588
00:55:56,545 --> 00:56:01,805
good. so again this is physically based there's an empirical

589
00:56:01,805 --> 00:56:06,805
portion of the beauty model because the option nation rate constant K one

590
00:56:06,805 --> 00:56:11,810
I just talked it from somewhere okay. and we have that parameter and testing that sense

591
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:16,949
to reach that parameter could be important. okay. good. alright let's

592
00:56:16,949 --> 00:56:22,390
get to something a little more useful but importantly more complicated. okay.

593
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:27,510
here is a classical picture of a 3D chemical transport and state problems.

594
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:33,510
we're basically I rid up my world into little control volumes.

595
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:38,510
I have bulk flow through this control volume. so you might have

596
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:43,610
a current flow number from this face of the cube exiting the space of the queue.

597
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:49,050
I have a geometry or actually set up such that axis

598
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:54,070
that direction of flow. this is the convention. why is the

599
00:56:54,070 --> 00:57:00,370
height is he is coming out to us this is not much of a convention it depends on the application.

600
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:05,669
the contaminate comes into the control volume. something might happen to it in here

601
00:57:05,669 --> 00:57:11,754
including it might react it might move up

602
00:57:11,754 --> 00:57:17,574
down towards us or away from us. okay. and it could flow out.

603
00:57:17,574 --> 00:57:22,674
alright. so we have to consider all the processes that are occurring within this cube

604
00:57:22,674 --> 00:57:28,854
or control volume as well as the ones next to us in each dimension.

605
00:57:28,854 --> 00:57:34,394
okay. and this is kind of the basis of multiple

606
00:57:34,394 --> 00:57:39,914
models including things like circulation models or climate models or river models and so forth.

607
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:44,974
where for example this cube is just one of those surrounding the earth

608
00:57:44,974 --> 00:57:50,134
or water body or something like that and you know one of the powers of

609
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:55,374
computers is to be able to have potentially thousands or millions

610
00:57:55,374 --> 00:58:00,614
of these control volumes are that all couple together with a number of equations and actually

611
00:58:00,614 --> 00:58:05,894
get solutions. 's and so you can think

612
00:58:05,894 --> 00:58:10,906
of these 's mass balance models for each of those control

613
00:58:10,906 --> 00:58:15,906
volumes that are Hubble and the current

614
00:58:15,906 --> 00:58:21,066
state of the art in global models like this might be to have eleven to thirteen

615
00:58:21,066 --> 00:58:26,146
levels here are potentially even more and

616
00:58:26,146 --> 00:58:31,686
now depending. one degree point something degrees

617
00:58:31,686 --> 00:58:36,746
something like this. dimensions. so you'd have you know

618
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:43,186
thousands of

619
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:50,326
that models kind of work and pictured one media

620
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:56,506
system. this picture is showing how we might couple those to

621
00:58:56,506 --> 00:59:01,566
multiple media including water and soil and we would be looking at

622
00:59:01,566 --> 00:59:06,694
processes section expertise as well and so we have for example

623
00:59:06,694 --> 00:59:12,014
volatile as a nation absorption deposition settling and so forth.

624
00:59:12,014 --> 00:59:17,634
it's just these compartments represent well these represent environmental compartments oil

625
00:59:17,634 --> 00:59:22,914
soil air border. we could add the biological component to that people

626
00:59:22,914 --> 00:59:28,214
to industry to it whatever you like. the key idea here is that we have these different part

627
00:59:28,214 --> 00:59:35,094
of our mental compartments in different pathways.

628
00:59:35,094 --> 00:59:40,474
so I I think I mentioned the other week that we have in the Great Lakes she's confined

629
00:59:40,474 --> 00:59:46,857
disposal facilities for glass hills basically and they are um

630
00:59:46,857 --> 00:59:52,377
taking contaminated sediments that dump the in between two [INAUDIBLE] or the [INAUDIBLE] around

631
00:59:52,377 --> 00:59:58,077
the system and this picture is just showing you some of the pathways that might be operating

632
00:59:58,077 --> 01:00:03,177
for contaminants like PC beans or whatever. we'd leak out.

633
01:00:03,177 --> 01:00:08,577
they can include seepage see kids seepage. sorry

634
01:00:08,577 --> 01:00:13,897
through the type which is typically not that well protected they have

635
01:00:13,897 --> 01:00:19,097
precipitation coming through leading to infiltration and generations we changed into

636
01:00:19,097 --> 01:00:24,177
the sub soils. there are wind blown involved in relation to plant

637
01:00:24,177 --> 01:00:29,177
uptake and loss plant materials. those are additional pathways. okay.

638
01:00:29,177 --> 01:00:34,397
so here this picture is just showing you air water and

639
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:42,857
soil compartments in the link 's.

640
01:00:42,857 --> 01:00:49,264
very good question

641
01:00:49,264 --> 01:00:54,584
one guess what do you think that's good. it's also

642
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:59,604
not very expensive and it's an

643
01:00:59,604 --> 01:01:04,984
issue though. absolutely very vulnerable to storms and things like this

644
01:01:04,984 --> 01:01:16,164
as well as not actually confining the material.

645
01:01:16,164 --> 01:01:21,204
burns a better picture of contaminant migration pathways is this kind of classic picture

646
01:01:21,204 --> 01:01:26,344
that I no longer remember where I stole it from him but you know here we have

647
01:01:26,344 --> 01:01:31,404
maybe agricultural runoff and industry discharge and it makes its

648
01:01:31,404 --> 01:01:36,424
way into the lake and what this is showing is five accumulation up through the food

649
01:01:36,424 --> 01:01:41,564
chain. you know and then into the fish and potentially

650
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:46,700
into the fisher people there's also exchange with the atmosphere three deposition

651
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:52,061
involved civilization there's also the migration this way as well so this is the norm.

652
01:01:52,061 --> 01:01:57,821
it should be considered the exception but

653
01:01:57,821 --> 01:02:03,561
still quite complicated and most of our environmental laws regulate single media.

654
01:02:03,561 --> 01:02:09,101
so you know if you look at the clean air act for example we didn't

655
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:14,341
until quite recently consider bio accumulation. mercury was not viewed as an issue because

656
01:02:14,341 --> 01:02:19,500
the concentrations in here were very very low. however it added to

657
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:25,821
the burden these aquatic systems.

658
01:02:25,821 --> 01:02:31,081
another model more recent for Ben 's always hiring one of the

659
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:36,160
pH is that's considered a carcinogen. DAH is a probably cyclic our matter card you're curved

660
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:41,400
at least a couple of benzene ring stuck together the simplest thing Vaseline been

661
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:46,437
zero eight. is one that is considered among the more toxic this

662
01:02:46,437 --> 01:02:51,697
is a result of a combustion byproducts and complete combustion anytime you burn

663
01:02:51,697 --> 01:02:58,317
something produces Beatrice and so we did a

664
01:02:58,317 --> 01:03:03,437
model. we're looking at the flows and so forth into the settlement quarter comps

665
01:03:03,437 --> 01:03:08,957
soil air and the same sort of thing that might be done

666
01:03:08,957 --> 01:03:14,917
that was done with cities the and 's Mercury.

667
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:21,357
okay. I'm gonna switch gears a bit. any questions where we are right now

668
01:03:21,357 --> 01:03:28,977
and time for for free. the number. okay.

669
01:03:28,977 --> 01:03:34,077
short break because I have a lot of stuff to go. I wanna do this next week.

670
01:03:34,077 --> 01:03:39,077
got other stuff nice. so why were just thinking

671
01:03:39,077 --> 01:03:44,137
here. you didn't go to the climate March. but you know what's

672
01:03:44,137 --> 01:03:49,167
happening. right so how do we get policymakers to change this just

673
01:03:49,167 --> 01:04:15,906
discuss nothing to do with with

674
01:04:15,906 --> 01:04:22,867
kids playing which

675
01:04:22,867 --> 01:04:28,607
is interesting. okay.

676
01:04:28,607 --> 01:04:33,807
rich. so

677
01:04:33,807 --> 01:04:38,827
what I read something this morning that if we did try to achieve net

678
01:04:38,827 --> 01:04:43,987
zero by you know twenty fifty. 's and this would mean that

679
01:04:43,987 --> 01:04:49,823
the fossil fuel companies would reduce production by like fifty five percent

680
01:04:49,823 --> 01:04:55,183
would still produce oil but produce a lot of us and this fossil

681
01:04:55,183 --> 01:05:00,323
fuel thing. do you have a sense of how many how much money is needed

682
01:05:00,323 --> 01:05:06,983
to make this transition

683
01:05:06,983 --> 01:05:12,643
so who's gonna pay for that.

684
01:05:12,643 --> 01:05:17,683
so you know every day you you open the paper and you see like wind turbines oil companies

685
01:05:17,683 --> 01:05:22,983
are putting in offshore and things like this. um what struck me was if you take

686
01:05:22,983 --> 01:05:28,423
the oil companies like Exxon Mobil and stuff like that.

687
01:05:28,423 --> 01:05:41,743
what percentage of their investment you think is in renewals

688
01:05:41,743 --> 01:05:46,875
based their on advertising you would think it would be like all of it right

689
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:52,455
but I mean what does paper say it was between two percent.

690
01:05:52,455 --> 01:06:05,335
I don't know if that's accurate or not but it's just surprising

691
01:06:05,335 --> 01:06:23,535
other thoughts on those

692
01:06:23,535 --> 01:06:38,413
oil prices

693
01:06:38,413 --> 01:07:44,880
turn it sounds like you wanted to in live taxes

694
01:07:44,880 --> 01:08:06,460
I

695
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:12,300
feel like you like

696
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:18,980
taking with a lot of people out of work

697
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:33,912
a lot

698
01:08:33,912 --> 01:08:42,032
um they they're they're bunch issues

699
01:08:42,032 --> 01:08:48,972
flashing a hard

700
01:08:48,972 --> 01:08:56,932
year. take for the annual

701
01:08:56,932 --> 01:09:09,392
issue.

702
01:09:09,392 --> 01:09:14,952
yeah. good thoughts others.

703
01:09:14,952 --> 01:09:19,972
yeah well I'm just one other person. I mean I I think that

704
01:09:19,972 --> 01:09:25,492
you know jobs are really important and we need to consider would in the occupational

705
01:09:25,492 --> 01:09:30,776
context for calling the future of work okay. the demographic is changing

706
01:09:30,776 --> 01:09:36,156
people are changing jobs. types are changing and the environment is changing

707
01:09:36,156 --> 01:09:41,176
as well so these are all leading to a work future which is very different from the way it

708
01:09:41,176 --> 01:09:46,336
had been in the past and even right now according to some status statistics

709
01:09:46,336 --> 01:09:51,416
I read also installers and wind types of turbine

710
01:09:51,416 --> 01:09:56,536
people or whatever's fastest growing sector in the country right now. okay and so there are other jobs

711
01:09:56,536 --> 01:10:02,676
for different energy future that way

712
01:10:02,676 --> 01:10:07,856
and you know what you're saying about you know people responding to

713
01:10:07,856 --> 01:10:14,736
basically dollars. 's paycheck or whatever.

714
01:10:14,736 --> 01:10:19,976
certainly is true I mean you know we we have a huge income in equity is

715
01:10:19,976 --> 01:10:25,396
made very clear by some of our presidential candidates and

716
01:10:25,396 --> 01:10:32,024
it's not fair okay. and for you to choose say. 's deleterious

717
01:10:32,024 --> 01:10:37,284
lifestyle because you feel you have no option while one percent

718
01:10:37,284 --> 01:10:42,444
is completely different opportunities to me is just not right and so where

719
01:10:42,444 --> 01:10:48,644
you have come very far in terms of our progressive mess in this country to

720
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:53,844
ignore those things and yeah you do have to vote out these guys but essentially what you're telling me

721
01:10:53,844 --> 01:10:59,164
is you feel system correct. okay and not responding to public concerns

722
01:10:59,164 --> 01:11:05,424
and it's for responding to private concerns. so that's a big call.

723
01:11:05,424 --> 01:11:10,464
I can talk more on this because I gotta get back to this stuff. anyway my feeling should

724
01:11:10,464 --> 01:11:17,004
matter. you got to figure out what you want

725
01:11:17,004 --> 01:11:25,970
but it's really interesting. okay. okay

726
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:31,190
models can be very complicated and solutions may not be the same sort of thing that we

727
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:36,490
use before with the dilution models. we might not have the algebraic equations

728
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:42,010
we might have only differential equations and we need to be able solve them. this schematic

729
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:47,710
here is just showing that you know if I have a true prediction on the blue line here.

730
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:53,050
I can estimate this by knowing the slope at this point and moving out to the future

731
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:58,170
for example coming up with an estimate. even if I don't know the true function.

732
01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:03,310
okay. and so this is just an example of using the boiler point slope method or

733
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:08,870
something like that to come up with an estimate models protection.

734
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:14,050
if var varies from the true value. okay. and you guys have done this

735
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:19,110
when you think about oh my bank account is paying two percent interest

736
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:24,144
so I have a hundred dollars the hundred and two dollars next year right but in fact if

737
01:12:24,144 --> 01:12:29,304
they do daily compounding you know you'll have a little bit more. you just estimated with two percent.

738
01:12:29,304 --> 01:12:34,484
alright. so you know this is the same sort of approach that might be used

739
01:12:34,484 --> 01:12:39,844
by growth models. and if you go back to

740
01:12:39,844 --> 01:12:45,164
sixties I think with Jay Forester. Mister Gross model where he predicted

741
01:12:45,164 --> 01:12:50,224
the population will continue to increase and we would over consumer resources and we

742
01:12:50,224 --> 01:12:55,304
have a crash as a result of running out of oil and food and everything. used he to

743
01:12:55,304 --> 01:13:00,904
model such that the new population at the time she plus delta Chi

744
01:13:00,904 --> 01:13:06,152
's a one year or ten years or fifty years into the future is equal to the old

745
01:13:06,152 --> 01:13:11,172
population plus the when I say old the population at

746
01:13:11,172 --> 01:13:16,632
the current time she plus the birth rate and the birth rate is expressed

747
01:13:16,632 --> 01:13:22,272
in terms of birds per population time of or other ways times the population

748
01:13:22,272 --> 01:13:27,512
that we had times the delta T and then subtract all set the death rate.

749
01:13:27,512 --> 01:13:32,852
express the same way with the death rate like this and so you can simplify by

750
01:13:32,852 --> 01:13:37,852
pulling together the fact that and tea and Delta team multiplies both

751
01:13:37,852 --> 01:13:43,112
D and D. so I can associate that and I get that new population time

752
01:13:43,112 --> 01:13:48,252
to close delta T is the current population times the birth minus the death

753
01:13:48,252 --> 01:13:53,312
rate times the same stuff over here and then I can K who's

754
01:13:53,312 --> 01:13:58,512
B- D and make that substitution and then have an it's plus delta

755
01:13:58,512 --> 01:14:04,033
T minus and it's you over Delta T be very rates

756
01:14:04,033 --> 01:14:09,673
and that's going to be just what's left on the right hand side and then if you remember the fundamental

757
01:14:09,673 --> 01:14:14,833
of fear calculus he let Delta T go to zero or two very small values and

758
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:20,033
you come up with a differential equation such that the change in population with respect to time

759
01:14:20,033 --> 01:14:25,113
is equal to cater to people 's looks familiar. yes because we did

760
01:14:25,113 --> 01:14:31,133
the same thing for the beauty disappearance just sort of first.

761
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:37,793
you know what process. okay. now it's for is a population.

762
01:14:37,793 --> 01:14:43,013
I'm so we can solve that in different ways we could use calculus solution

763
01:14:43,013 --> 01:14:48,133
we could use an iterative solution where we say okay. plus

764
01:14:48,133 --> 01:14:53,273
a one year and we calculate that and that gives us next year 's population we plug

765
01:14:53,273 --> 01:14:58,353
that in here and get a year after that and so we could use this and this is called

766
01:14:58,353 --> 01:15:03,361
the oilers mess that point slow method and point here and it's not worth going through

767
01:15:03,361 --> 01:15:08,781
much you know as I do incremental calculations and

768
01:15:08,781 --> 01:15:14,101
I can come up with estimates for population over next you know fifty years.

769
01:15:14,101 --> 01:15:19,121
and of course I'm making errors because I'm assuming it's a linear step in each of those and

770
01:15:19,121 --> 01:15:24,441
it's not one way to reduce the error is to make a smaller

771
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:29,881
time intervals. okay. and if I love those time intervals go to very very small.

772
01:15:29,881 --> 01:15:34,881
I'll probably gonna get more results so this is just showing you the numerical

773
01:15:34,881 --> 01:15:40,141
integration or differentiation technique can come up with good answers. if you

774
01:15:40,141 --> 01:15:46,821
have small enough step sizes but

775
01:15:46,821 --> 01:15:51,881
for this problem since I have an algebraic

776
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:57,981
solution to that governing equation. I should use a calculus

777
01:15:57,981 --> 01:16:03,157
because I make no errors right. so basically here

778
01:16:03,157 --> 01:16:08,777
use the analytical solution because it's correct. I don't need to use in the need differential

779
01:16:08,777 --> 01:16:13,857
or the iterative or approximate solution. okay.

780
01:16:13,857 --> 01:16:19,197
so if you have a choice which one to use use analytical

781
01:16:19,197 --> 01:16:25,177
wanted to develop obviously but still realistically

782
01:16:25,177 --> 01:16:31,797
most of the numerical message that would be used are pretty good to you states.

783
01:16:31,797 --> 01:16:37,197
this brings me to another really important and this is really the central piece the of

784
01:16:37,197 --> 01:16:42,217
lecture today is the notion of the governing equation and this is usually

785
01:16:42,217 --> 01:16:47,337
a differential equation represents the way we think about process what is

786
01:16:47,337 --> 01:16:53,017
actually in know mass balance context happening. okay to

787
01:16:53,017 --> 01:16:58,197
get differential equation or a governing equations solved we need initial and boundary

788
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:03,225
conditions and then in cases there are analytical solutions can be used

789
01:17:03,225 --> 01:17:08,245
and we've already talked about the one for the disappearance of. good. I wanna move on

790
01:17:08,245 --> 01:17:14,185
with his questions in most cases in this course.

791
01:17:14,185 --> 01:17:19,225
governing equation is related to mass amounts. okay we

792
01:17:19,225 --> 01:17:24,225
can also do the energy balance. okay. we can do temperature

793
01:17:24,225 --> 01:17:30,025
balance. please all interacting types of

794
01:17:30,025 --> 01:17:35,305
systems. so this is compares numerical and Kosovo solutions

795
01:17:35,305 --> 01:17:42,485
I'm not gonna do that next model. most important one. okay.

796
01:17:42,485 --> 01:17:47,545
full Easter. conservative chemical reactor what's most important here is the and snows

797
01:17:47,545 --> 01:17:52,865
chemical reactor. same kind of box I had before control volume has a concentration

798
01:17:52,865 --> 01:17:57,905
inside seal volume inside the. we have stuff flowing in the concentration coming

799
01:17:57,905 --> 01:18:03,111
in enough low rate to we have stuff flowing out at a

800
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:08,771
concentration see out queue out. I have stuck in a little propeller here

801
01:18:08,771 --> 01:18:13,971
which means that it's fully mixed in size. okay. so if you're thinking about

802
01:18:13,971 --> 01:18:20,451
late. no structure to lake is completely mixed.

803
01:18:20,451 --> 01:18:25,711
we're gonna study the transient response of this we're gonna assume again if a defined volume

804
01:18:25,711 --> 01:18:30,971
and has rigid walls. we have the masters inside of this is the product

805
01:18:30,971 --> 01:18:36,031
of the concentration times the volume right because milligrams per liter time a 's number of

806
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:41,311
leaders multiply those together I get milligrams mass. alright and

807
01:18:41,311 --> 01:18:46,431
we're also gonna say this is basically completely full. okay so what flows and flows out

808
01:18:46,431 --> 01:18:51,431
because the walls are rigid

809
01:18:51,431 --> 01:18:56,491
everybody weather. so then we're gonna try to Mass. in that reactor

810
01:18:56,491 --> 01:19:02,051
exactly the same thing I did for the mass change with respect to the time is

811
01:19:02,051 --> 01:19:07,167
been changed in the time speak over time. this is equal

812
01:19:07,167 --> 01:19:13,047
to a close and minus four close out that's all there is to it. conservative so there's no reaction.

813
01:19:13,047 --> 01:19:18,167
alright. the volume is constant

814
01:19:18,167 --> 01:19:23,387
queuing it is equal to queue out. see how is that equal to see and so I convinced do a few

815
01:19:23,387 --> 01:19:28,887
substitutions and I get the governing equation. the volume of the system times a change in concentration

816
01:19:28,887 --> 01:19:35,627
overtime is equal to the difference between what flows and flows

817
01:19:35,627 --> 01:19:43,159
differential equations. so be careful

818
01:19:43,159 --> 01:19:48,319
so again I have this differential equation but solve it. I'm not gonna send

819
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:53,339
much time in solving and I'll just give you the solution but we need an initial conditions.

820
01:19:53,339 --> 01:19:58,359
let's assume that the parameters of the flow rate

821
01:19:58,359 --> 01:20:03,359
is constant. just to make it simple. let's assume that flow the and

822
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:08,599
the concentration in the slogan is Constance. okay so if it's a water body

823
01:20:08,599 --> 01:20:14,179
with the stream feeding into it the stream is the same flow in the same concentration. okay.

824
01:20:14,179 --> 01:20:19,419
and let's assume for the initial condition that the reactor has

825
01:20:19,419 --> 01:20:24,899
a concentration seasonal whatever happens to be just known at the initial time.

826
01:20:24,899 --> 01:20:29,999
okay. the solution is shown here quick concentration

827
01:20:29,999 --> 01:20:35,539
of time she is equal to the concentration of the influence.

828
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:40,759
times is one minus Ext 's to to you over V. this term here. 's

829
01:20:40,759 --> 01:20:46,028
plus the initial concentration seen often times the storm over here.

830
01:20:46,028 --> 01:20:51,928
so what we have is two pieces to this. we have the affect of the inflows

831
01:20:51,928 --> 01:20:57,288
and if you look at this expression as she gets big yak speed to the minus

832
01:20:57,288 --> 01:21:03,548
infinity goes to zero and so we have one minus zero so we end up with CNN.

833
01:21:03,548 --> 01:21:08,968
save us in picture the on second the over here we have the effect of the initial condition

834
01:21:08,968 --> 01:21:14,648
as she equals to zero and this is one

835
01:21:14,648 --> 01:21:20,008
and we have just seen. off so basically what happens

836
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:25,148
is we have these two pieces that song together reflecting the

837
01:21:25,148 --> 01:21:30,328
inflows and what we started with and there's a balance between us. let me give you a couple

838
01:21:30,328 --> 01:21:35,868
of examples before I do that. let me just know that you've heard of fox models before

839
01:21:35,868 --> 01:21:41,068
this is a box model but we're looking at it dynamically completely

840
01:21:41,068 --> 01:21:46,088
weirded example. our renters in Ann Arbor.

841
01:21:46,088 --> 01:21:51,968
you if measure the humidity in your apartment bed it's pretty high at times.

842
01:21:51,968 --> 01:21:57,008
I don't want to get you excited. but you know mold and bed bugs and all this kinda stuff like

843
01:21:57,008 --> 01:22:03,768
warm or humid conditions. anyway

844
01:22:03,768 --> 01:22:09,168
let's assume you just purchased or rented a damp apartment

845
01:22:09,168 --> 01:22:14,188
and you have fire aerosol concentration in there and I'm just gonna call the

846
01:22:14,188 --> 01:22:21,228
thousand see if use per cubic meter which is see if you

847
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:26,228
call me farming unit so it's some viable bio. errors okay. Reynolds

848
01:22:26,228 --> 01:22:31,688
bro. that's a little high we you don't like it to be a thousand years of use

849
01:22:31,688 --> 01:22:36,968
and so your ventilation rate in your apartment is about a thirty change

850
01:22:36,968 --> 01:22:41,996
for our pretty low because you're trying to save energy. okay you don't want see to so you

851
01:22:41,996 --> 01:22:47,836
take up the windows. okay. how long would just hate

852
01:22:47,836 --> 01:22:52,916
assuming that there's no internal sources of mold for you

853
01:22:52,916 --> 01:22:58,016
to drop a bio aerosol concentration

854
01:22:58,016 --> 01:23:04,696
from say a thousand a three hundred just five gallons

855
01:23:04,696 --> 01:23:09,716
the apartment volume is six hundred cubic meters the outdoor air concentration is two hundred. I mean

856
01:23:09,716 --> 01:23:14,776
thereby worse falls outside that's where they came from. okay. so when this

857
01:23:14,776 --> 01:23:19,916
case can we use a east full coast volume conservative reactors the answer is yes.

858
01:23:19,916 --> 01:23:25,016
your apartment is shown here we have a concentration outside of two hundred

859
01:23:25,016 --> 01:23:30,896
we have initial concentration here of a thousand. let's plug in shop here with the equation.

860
01:23:30,896 --> 01:23:36,116
the parameters are seen on his one thousand. the volume is

861
01:23:36,116 --> 01:23:41,236
six hundred. concentration inside. I'm sorry flowing in is two

862
01:23:41,236 --> 01:23:46,960
hundred and the airflow flow rate is the air change

863
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:53,380
one third per hour times the volume. six hundred. so it's two hundred cubic meters

864
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:59,100
per hour. okay. everybody with me. so then

865
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:04,620
I plug in Charlotte and I put that in there see units express

866
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:09,860
and here is the solution express graphically. we started off at a thousand

867
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:15,000
after ten hours we're down to two hundred fifty or three hundred. as time

868
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,140
goes on to infinity. we end up with a concentration doesn't go down to zero.

869
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:26,340
why not because that's a outdoor concentration.

870
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:32,200
okay. if I looked at the model. remember I told you the model was the sum of two pieces

871
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:37,280
that piece reflected the outdoor air coming in is the blue line it builds up to two

872
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:42,480
hundred. the initial fees from the thousand that was inside is the green

873
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:47,652
line that drops down. the results is the sun shone us up

874
01:24:47,652 --> 01:24:53,352
that's the two pieces of this model right here the flight. effective the inflows

875
01:24:53,352 --> 01:24:59,312
and the effect of the initial condition. so this is the transient response to

876
01:24:59,312 --> 01:25:05,032
this model. and it's a for we stirred constant volume.

877
01:25:05,032 --> 01:25:11,452
conservative chemical reactor everybody with me on this.

878
01:25:11,452 --> 01:25:16,632
okay. now I want to take it up and knots and

879
01:25:16,632 --> 01:25:21,872
swing those Pyro 's come inside their particles. okay

880
01:25:21,872 --> 01:25:27,192
their diameter is depending on the or mold whatever it could be ten microns diameter.

881
01:25:27,192 --> 01:25:33,312
okay that's a fairly big aerosol it'll drop out and it will code your

882
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:38,392
table top and your flooring your carpet or whatever. okay so there's

883
01:25:38,392 --> 01:25:44,312
a loss mechanism inside the apartment. so let's add

884
01:25:44,312 --> 01:25:49,358
to this chemical reactor this area going down which we have is Casey or first

885
01:25:49,358 --> 01:25:54,798
order loss we've seen this now. couple of times. everybody was me.

886
01:25:54,798 --> 01:25:59,998
okay. so less than exactly the same assumptions

887
01:25:59,998 --> 01:26:05,038
we add this mine is Casey to the governing equation.

888
01:26:05,038 --> 01:26:10,238
okay. gets more complicated now. but essentially we have the info

889
01:26:10,238 --> 01:26:18,118
is my see how flows plus or minus the reaction a reaction this case is really just.

890
01:26:18,118 --> 01:26:23,152
again I can defined governing equation

891
01:26:23,152 --> 01:26:28,692
have my parameters make it simple that there constant. I added the degradation

892
01:26:28,692 --> 01:26:34,392
lost now. I need to do find a couple of things to handle that in this framework.

893
01:26:34,392 --> 01:26:39,472
I'm gonna talk about retention time. and this is the meantime particle would spend

894
01:26:39,472 --> 01:26:45,552
in this in room my apartment or my control volume and that is equal to

895
01:26:45,552 --> 01:26:53,292
the over a queue or I do find this as beta and

896
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:58,292
it's the one over the attention time. which gives me units of time in

897
01:26:58,292 --> 01:27:03,292
verse and then I can add Kay which is also expressed in the same units of time

898
01:27:03,292 --> 01:27:08,432
and verse. 's I and can substitute

899
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:14,452
that instead of simple care change I had before. into the calculus solution.

900
01:27:14,452 --> 01:27:20,551
don't worry about us. okay. just mechanics you need. you may need to. 's

901
01:27:20,551 --> 01:27:28,431
so same problem. but in this case. I'm going to use a

902
01:27:28,431 --> 01:27:35,371
the GED as being

903
01:27:35,371 --> 01:27:40,511
one half per hour in other words half of the particles drop

904
01:27:40,511 --> 01:27:45,731
out in one hour in my apartment. okay. and

905
01:27:45,731 --> 01:27:50,951
I have the air change rate before which was one third for our fight eight

906
01:27:50,951 --> 01:27:56,751
feet. she to it it's a third hour inverse

907
01:27:56,751 --> 01:28:03,671
plug and chug again and this is the result that I guess. okay. and the green line.

908
01:28:03,671 --> 01:28:08,751
what's important here is less. so the man but the interpretation before I

909
01:28:08,751 --> 01:28:14,471
got the verbal one. the concentration came down to two hundred.

910
01:28:14,471 --> 01:28:19,491
that was the same as the outsider concentration. now I have the same

911
01:28:19,491 --> 01:28:24,889
starting point but it comes down faster and then it approaches a level

912
01:28:24,889 --> 01:28:38,089
of about a hundred one. tell me what's going on.

913
01:28:38,089 --> 01:28:43,369
I lose your guys.

914
01:28:43,369 --> 01:28:48,469
I have another process which is settling or loss that's occurring inside

915
01:28:48,469 --> 01:28:53,509
the space. okay. and those aerosols come in but they are removed in

916
01:28:53,509 --> 01:28:58,929
part and that's what I'm saying. please everybody with me on this.

917
01:28:58,929 --> 01:29:04,069
this is actually a pollution control technology. okay. if

918
01:29:04,069 --> 01:29:09,989
you had a settling pond in for example waste water treatment facility.

919
01:29:09,989 --> 01:29:15,229
you just slow the water through a big pond or tank and the particles

920
01:29:15,229 --> 01:29:20,569
settle out and then it moves along. okay. that's what your apartments is

921
01:29:20,569 --> 01:29:27,747
with respect to the air exiting is cleaner.

922
01:29:27,747 --> 01:29:39,287
okay next question. 's this is student state.

923
01:29:39,287 --> 01:29:51,687
you say yes. tell me what you mean

924
01:29:51,687 --> 01:29:58,167
which variable do I care about air flows constant

925
01:29:58,167 --> 01:30:03,427
settling rate is constant. the amount that settle. could very five

926
01:30:03,427 --> 01:30:08,687
high concentration side pass settle by below concentration has to settle in an hour.

927
01:30:08,687 --> 01:30:13,987
so that is going to change steady state is defined

928
01:30:13,987 --> 01:30:18,987
as the mass in the control volume is not changing the control volume

929
01:30:18,987 --> 01:30:24,505
is the apartment here it is changing so it's clearly not a steady state

930
01:30:24,505 --> 01:30:30,525
but once I get past maybe a day or so. it's not changing.

931
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:36,045
so as long term aims the system is a certain.

932
01:30:36,045 --> 01:30:41,285
so make sense. this

933
01:30:41,285 --> 01:30:46,325
is chemical reactor is not hypothetical it's been used thousands

934
01:30:46,325 --> 01:30:52,345
of not tens of thousands of times. here's a very simple example of an

935
01:30:52,345 --> 01:30:57,745
on events in gas fireplace. you can buy these things. okay so put you

936
01:30:57,745 --> 01:31:03,385
them in the wall you just touch a gas line but you don't have an exhaust for it because

937
01:31:03,385 --> 01:31:08,565
industry says the combustion is very complete. just produces CO2 these

938
01:31:08,565 --> 01:31:13,645
folks measure carbon monoxide and they turned it on to medium

939
01:31:13,645 --> 01:31:18,785
flame and the CO levels increase like this. they turned it off

940
01:31:18,785 --> 01:31:24,003
to decreased places. guess what that exactly follows the predictions from

941
01:31:24,003 --> 01:31:29,723
our police third chemical costs involving reactor model okay

942
01:31:29,723 --> 01:31:35,263
interesting way when they had it on high flame CEO the level did not increase is

943
01:31:35,263 --> 01:31:42,143
much anybody able to interpret these CEO numbers by the way

944
01:31:42,143 --> 01:31:47,403
you know what the standards are for Seo. it's about nine

945
01:31:47,403 --> 01:31:54,843
PPM. okay. so clearly we have a problem here. Houston

946
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:59,863
and it's fire CEO with medium flame because combustion is not so good you've got like a

947
01:31:59,863 --> 01:32:04,903
yellow flames compared to a blue flame so it's more product of incomplete combustion which

948
01:32:04,903 --> 01:32:10,263
include you. alright. switching

949
01:32:10,263 --> 01:32:15,723
gears. this development of the model is not a straightforward

950
01:32:15,723 --> 01:32:20,823
simple thing you need to have a client and application off model developer.

951
01:32:20,823 --> 01:32:26,165
if he's under ago conceptual development

952
01:32:26,165 --> 01:32:31,285
so I understand what you want and it needs to be implemented with the equations

953
01:32:31,285 --> 01:32:36,745
and coding and the interface it needs to be evaluated in terms of

954
01:32:36,745 --> 01:32:41,825
peer review and quality of short data sets and so forth and then

955
01:32:41,825 --> 01:32:47,085
is only useful in fact if it's used and so when it's used you wanna be able to communicate

956
01:32:47,085 --> 01:32:52,525
for example what the model says the uncertainty and so forth and this can be an iterative

957
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:58,155
process. okay so this game just so so shows you that in terms

958
01:32:58,155 --> 01:33:03,155
of the language that I want you to understand the formulation of the model typically

959
01:33:03,155 --> 01:33:08,555
follows this framework to find what you're trying to do in terms of objectives

960
01:33:08,555 --> 01:33:13,915
identified indicators or the outcomes that you care about. this is something

961
01:33:13,915 --> 01:33:19,235
I want to stress figure out conceptually what you're trying to do draw the conceptual

962
01:33:19,235 --> 01:33:24,995
model. make a picture. okay. identify the relationships the parameters

963
01:33:24,995 --> 01:33:30,195
constraints implemented and verify that it's functioning and check to see that it gives you something

964
01:33:30,195 --> 01:33:35,235
that's reasonable and feasible conceptual models I've added the

965
01:33:35,235 --> 01:33:40,255
slide because you need to think hard about what's important we get

966
01:33:40,255 --> 01:33:45,615
lost in the details you need to focus on what's important. some of the aspects of conceptual

967
01:33:45,615 --> 01:33:50,615
models are shown in the structure here. boundaries dimensions

968
01:33:50,615 --> 01:33:55,616
whether it's steady state or time depending. big choice you know what that means now

969
01:33:55,616 --> 01:34:00,736
mechanisms that affect transport and safety multimedia aspects of chemical

970
01:34:00,736 --> 01:34:09,636
physical biological sinks and sources and initial conditions need to the finals

971
01:34:09,636 --> 01:34:14,656
as a completely different example. were concerned about particle

972
01:34:14,656 --> 01:34:20,136
exposures causing cardiac and pulmonary offense. particles

973
01:34:20,136 --> 01:34:25,336
come from all kinds of sources traffic was the origins this particular conceptual model.

974
01:34:25,336 --> 01:34:30,776
it showing you that you have a fax on the autonomic and systematic systems in your body

975
01:34:30,776 --> 01:34:36,436
and very sick well I that occur as a result of exposure.

976
01:34:36,436 --> 01:34:44,436
not simple picture at least we've got a conceptually laid out here.

977
01:34:44,436 --> 01:34:49,976
there's another approach. if you are taking your stance course and

978
01:34:49,976 --> 01:34:55,456
you all have some stance and model formulation and variable selection you throw everything

979
01:34:55,456 --> 01:35:00,582
into the pot stepwise or all possible subsets

980
01:35:00,582 --> 01:35:05,642
or some other kind of statistical techniques just make sense and you see what

981
01:35:05,642 --> 01:35:10,922
pops up. okay. and this is another kind of approach and you know I'm not gonna talk

982
01:35:10,922 --> 01:35:16,342
much about statistical models or next thank you. models

983
01:35:16,342 --> 01:35:21,642
are best developed for mass balance. you know hierarchical structure.

984
01:35:21,642 --> 01:35:27,622
and we need to find a system as the complex and the components that are interrelated

985
01:35:27,622 --> 01:35:32,802
because they share some purpose they. represent mastery different components and so

986
01:35:32,802 --> 01:35:37,942
forth. here's a picture of the Hydro power project we've already talked about this little bit. you

987
01:35:37,942 --> 01:35:43,222
could break us down into environmental system with water quality land recreation

988
01:35:43,222 --> 01:35:48,282
sedan itself the reservoir the power plant each of these can be further broken down. each

989
01:35:48,282 --> 01:35:53,442
of these could be modeled separately. the overall analysis might pull together

990
01:35:53,442 --> 01:35:58,498
these different models for the water treatment and distribution system the system slant

991
01:35:58,498 --> 01:36:03,598
but it could be. we have different steps involved in treating water. we might

992
01:36:03,598 --> 01:36:09,098
fluctuate out some of the stuff set out those clock filter at this in fact

993
01:36:09,098 --> 01:36:14,338
distribute this is a schema tries to here with an additional

994
01:36:14,338 --> 01:36:19,938
steps up Rio 's in nation rapid minutes this is pretty common for most water treatment plants.

995
01:36:19,938 --> 01:36:25,058
the reason I'm bringing this up is that each of the steps. we break down and we call

996
01:36:25,058 --> 01:36:30,158
it unit operation today and this is an engineering

997
01:36:30,158 --> 01:36:35,198
term but basically we analyze what's happening in one of these boxes develop

998
01:36:35,198 --> 01:36:40,198
a model Ford a couple lives inputs to what happened before and it outputs what

999
01:36:40,198 --> 01:36:45,838
happened after it and we can come up with a very complex but very usable

1000
01:36:45,838 --> 01:36:50,998
model by building movies by putting together these basic building blocks okay

1001
01:36:50,998 --> 01:37:07,394
in the building blocks unit office um-hum

1002
01:37:07,394 --> 01:37:12,754
it all depends we're not starting from scratch hardly anything but it depends

1003
01:37:12,754 --> 01:37:17,754
on what your purpose. the data that you have available. so forth.

1004
01:37:17,754 --> 01:37:23,234
free question. I'm gonna get to some of them gonna try anyway

1005
01:37:23,234 --> 01:37:28,614
in these black and these unit office. they can be mechanistic week based. they can also

1006
01:37:28,614 --> 01:37:34,074
be a black box. 's an example of a black box might be for example

1007
01:37:34,074 --> 01:37:39,594
looking at combustion process where I know I put in fuel and I come out with CO2

1008
01:37:39,594 --> 01:37:44,654
and it's car monoxide and there might be proportionality 's that I use.

1009
01:37:44,654 --> 01:37:49,954
I could feed nutrients in to an organism and produce products here. I am not

1010
01:37:49,954 --> 01:37:55,034
gonna simulate probably every cellular thing that's happening in there but again treated

1011
01:37:55,034 --> 01:38:00,234
as a black box okay. even being a black fox. we

1012
01:38:00,234 --> 01:38:05,294
have constraints. we have to conserve mass storage geometry equilibrium

1013
01:38:05,294 --> 01:38:10,714
kinetics energy and so forth potentially in Mass. balance models for usually

1014
01:38:10,714 --> 01:38:15,934
looking at mass mass balance. so

1015
01:38:15,934 --> 01:38:21,694
putting some of this together and what are useful models for us. we have

1016
01:38:21,694 --> 01:38:26,694
for environmental models for fate and transport contaminant migration. we have

1017
01:38:26,694 --> 01:38:31,914
basically the emission sources for discharge and air pollution source of water pollution

1018
01:38:31,914 --> 01:38:37,414
source whatever characterized by parameters that include emission rate

1019
01:38:37,414 --> 01:38:42,814
chemicals properties of them. we have feet transport characterize

1020
01:38:42,814 --> 01:38:48,454
five dominant processes transport dilution reactions transformations

1021
01:38:48,454 --> 01:38:53,874
and then we have receptors. what we were trying to predict typically human health

1022
01:38:53,874 --> 01:39:00,192
and ecosystems and so forth okay. a couple of other points on here. take your questions.

1023
01:39:00,192 --> 01:39:05,452
also different types of permission sources in the air context we might talk about point

1024
01:39:05,452 --> 01:39:10,732
sources like the smoke mobile sources trucks and things like this in terms

1025
01:39:10,732 --> 01:39:15,952
of fate and transport processes. we typically are looking at transformations

1026
01:39:15,952 --> 01:39:21,052
of what we call primary pollutants for example in the air case you might it

1027
01:39:21,052 --> 01:39:26,112
so has too but this gets transformed in the atmosphere to a reaction product.

1028
01:39:26,112 --> 01:39:31,612
say sulfate ammonium sulfate or sulfuric acids. that's the second.

1029
01:39:31,612 --> 01:39:38,876
okay. car here for us

1030
01:39:38,876 --> 01:39:43,996
yeah so what's happening in a black box is that I am not

1031
01:39:43,996 --> 01:39:49,656
God. I do don't have a model that has equations for every transformation that's occurring

1032
01:39:49,656 --> 01:39:54,936
and I have very much simplified the processes that are occurring in that system

1033
01:39:54,936 --> 01:39:59,996
and so I specifically have it. relationship between what's going

1034
01:39:59,996 --> 01:40:09,256
in and what's coming out as compared to say a mechanistic or engineering type relations.

1035
01:40:09,256 --> 01:40:14,576
associates are a fairly high level approach

1036
01:40:14,576 --> 01:40:19,816
schema ties in what's happening in your model. they can show linkages of mass

1037
01:40:19,816 --> 01:40:25,036
or energy or information or whatever. this is one that we used for many

1038
01:40:25,036 --> 01:40:30,316
years still being used in Europe where we soak energy pathways and still being used time in

1039
01:40:30,316 --> 01:40:36,427
and change. we have emission control strategies.

1040
01:40:36,427 --> 01:40:41,647
so if we're going partly cold partly gas partly nuclear.

1041
01:40:41,647 --> 01:40:46,728
we might to look see what is the emissions from each of those units. this

1042
01:40:46,728 --> 01:40:51,887
results and omissions in this case to air their atmospheric processes like and form

1043
01:40:51,887 --> 01:40:57,447
that ammonium sulfate that comes down as acid rain for example affecting the forest ecosystem

1044
01:40:57,447 --> 01:41:03,627
and then we might have an environmental impacts that result as a result of that mission

1045
01:41:03,627 --> 01:41:08,627
and this whole time. okay. we saw this before women

1046
01:41:08,627 --> 01:41:14,188
were running this from left to right. this is a forecast.

1047
01:41:14,188 --> 01:41:19,748
what's gonna happen in terms of aquatic lake forest

1048
01:41:19,748 --> 01:41:25,607
in packs and so forth. okay. that's the scenario analysis

1049
01:41:25,607 --> 01:41:30,688
right for a particular scenario on the other hand. what we've also done and this

1050
01:41:30,688 --> 01:41:35,967
happened in Europe and it happened to an extent in the US was we said you have to

1051
01:41:35,967 --> 01:41:41,439
keep the amount of acid that's falling on these forest

1052
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:46,579
systems below a critical load and below this

1053
01:41:46,579 --> 01:41:52,779
critical level buffering is sufficient not to sit a fine.

1054
01:41:52,779 --> 01:41:58,739
everybody with me. so this is a notion of critical loads of the maximum tolerable impact

1055
01:41:58,739 --> 01:42:03,819
without causing damage or maximum tolerable loading without causing damage.

1056
01:42:03,819 --> 01:42:08,959
that's that's a limit over here and then we moved backwards

1057
01:42:08,959 --> 01:42:14,359
to optimize this to come up with a lease cost strategy

1058
01:42:14,359 --> 01:42:19,499
to achieve that. okay. so again. system. a big

1059
01:42:19,499 --> 01:42:27,879
modeling system used forward and and reverse modes or some error analysis or.

1060
01:42:27,879 --> 01:42:32,939
so coming back to the question how to develop models. you know in a sense

1061
01:42:32,939 --> 01:42:38,540
it's a combination of the darkness I am sick heart there's many subjective issues science

1062
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:43,680
you know clearly there's a lot going on in terms of content knowledge here. couple

1063
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:48,959
of rules. know what you're doing okay. I mean that's kinda common

1064
01:42:48,959 --> 01:42:54,060
sense so you need an expert. you need data as well because you can't

1065
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:59,140
develop a model for any practical purpose without updated. tell

1066
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:04,279
you if it's working and so there a lot of are issues and model

1067
01:43:04,279 --> 01:43:09,419
development some you know some of them are listed here. again we're not starting from

1068
01:43:09,419 --> 01:43:14,520
scratch off and it's a question of what model is most appropriate overall those might

1069
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:19,839
be used in those that might be used might be back of the envelope calculations for some incredibly

1070
01:43:19,839 --> 01:43:25,500
complicated system. so how do you select among them. models

1071
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:30,680
taken off the shelf and calibration. they need to be applied to local context.

1072
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:36,160
people are interested in how accurate they are. what errors. what are the areas for me.

1073
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:41,218
what fax results and so forth so you know if I'm looking at

1074
01:43:41,218 --> 01:43:47,357
models. I want something that explains what's going on. so my explanatory

1075
01:43:47,357 --> 01:43:52,917
power are squared could be should be what

1076
01:43:52,917 --> 01:43:58,238
you guys are taking stuff and epidemiology.

1077
01:43:58,238 --> 01:44:05,618
what's the good of our square

1078
01:44:05,618 --> 01:44:10,738
that would be marvelous. but I can get very useful results with point one point

1079
01:44:10,738 --> 01:44:16,458
two as well. so it depends on the context. absolutely. okay.

1080
01:44:16,458 --> 01:44:21,658
second thing I want and I I wanna have point one point two for my feet and transport

1081
01:44:21,658 --> 01:44:26,877
model that's awfully low. okay. I also want the model to be consistent with

1082
01:44:26,877 --> 01:44:31,877
explanations of mechanisms that I understand. okay. and that's what we'll call

1083
01:44:31,877 --> 01:44:36,978
verification and then I wanted to be personally. 's. okay. basically as

1084
01:44:36,978 --> 01:44:42,396
simple as possible still but roll and so in here in practice

1085
01:44:42,396 --> 01:44:47,656
this means that I need to validate the model with real world data that I need to have appropriate structure

1086
01:44:47,656 --> 01:44:52,855
and outputs and inputs to make it consistent with the mechanistic or structures and

1087
01:44:52,855 --> 01:44:58,476
I wanted to be as simple as possible. so these are things that I look for

1088
01:44:58,476 --> 01:45:03,936
now. I have too much stuff here to deal with errors. but all models makes

1089
01:45:03,936 --> 01:45:09,196
different types of errors and some of those errors are listed here. I'm not gonna spend any time on this right

1090
01:45:09,196 --> 01:45:14,216
now. additional deficiencies are shown here as well. so please just take

1091
01:45:14,216 --> 01:45:19,295
a look at this. so you know you

1092
01:45:19,295 --> 01:45:25,896
have this famous quote from George fox at all models are wrong but some useful.

1093
01:45:25,896 --> 01:45:32,556
okay. how much air and is tolerable is requesting question it really depends on the application.

1094
01:45:32,556 --> 01:45:39,226
it depends on you know the ability of data to support

1095
01:45:39,226 --> 01:45:44,406
the application the model. and so forth. but you guys may not

1096
01:45:44,406 --> 01:45:49,585
be model developers but you are gonna be models users and

1097
01:45:49,585 --> 01:45:55,146
interpreters and you need to be able to understand the structure function

1098
01:45:55,146 --> 01:46:00,625
of models. you need to understand where they diverge from measure.

1099
01:46:00,625 --> 01:46:06,366
I won't say reality because measurements are not reality

1100
01:46:06,366 --> 01:46:11,906
and so you need to be able to discuss and quantify those in certain. and you need to understand

1101
01:46:11,906 --> 01:46:17,520
when your knowledge picks out. need to get somebody else

1102
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:23,000
but the most important lesson and I've seen some many times you go a in court room

1103
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:28,120
and as an example and some of the Texas flooding an expert was there

1104
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:33,319
and said you know we design the spillway 's and the cold birds and it should've handled. five hundred

1105
01:46:33,319 --> 01:46:38,439
year storm. okay and there's billions of dollars of

1106
01:46:38,439 --> 01:46:43,919
damage and insurance companies and see out everybody else are suing everybody

1107
01:46:43,919 --> 01:46:48,959
left and right and the expert says you know but we engineer this is Central

1108
01:46:48,959 --> 01:46:54,040
flooded and you know the defense or whoever says

1109
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:59,040
did you inspect the river or the covert Burger whatever you know since I

1110
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:04,439
looked it at with the satellite photo I know the slope got the roughness program and all this kinda stuff.

1111
01:47:04,439 --> 01:47:09,520
if you go on there you would've seen the trees and the brushes and everything else growing in what

1112
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:15,022
he assumed was a completely smooth toll for okay and the water obviously backed up

1113
01:47:15,022 --> 01:47:21,062
in something like this. so you need to know what you're dealing with as the well physical

1114
01:47:21,062 --> 01:47:26,322
ground truth is really important. 's lots of some examples like that.

1115
01:47:26,322 --> 01:47:31,322
some ways to find a good model. are listed here. choose the simplest one you

1116
01:47:31,322 --> 01:47:36,322
think is applicable applicable easy to validate provides what you want as the

1117
01:47:36,322 --> 01:47:41,462
features that you want. EPA. often doesn't give you that flexibility

1118
01:47:41,462 --> 01:47:46,583
they're gonna say use Emacs use our line. use whatever

1119
01:47:46,583 --> 01:47:51,822
newsies had one models for whatever they're gonna specify what you have to do. sometimes

1120
01:47:51,822 --> 01:47:57,042
they allow you to it use for phone models. typically people

1121
01:47:57,042 --> 01:48:02,083
don't use specified miles. I've got

1122
01:48:02,083 --> 01:48:07,083
two or three minutes left for a couple of important thing.

1123
01:48:07,083 --> 01:48:12,922
models need to be evaluated prior to use. there's a language that corresponds

1124
01:48:12,922 --> 01:48:17,945
to this process. I wanna go over that. make sure

1125
01:48:17,945 --> 01:48:22,984
you get that today verification is the first in the

1126
01:48:22,984 --> 01:48:28,225
model. it's a hypothetical test to see that the model works as you expect

1127
01:48:28,225 --> 01:48:33,425
in our apartment with the bio aerosol model. if I have more

1128
01:48:33,425 --> 01:48:38,484
rapid settling. would you expect the concentration to be higher or lower in the

1129
01:48:38,484 --> 01:48:43,604
or lower. yes it's better work that

1130
01:48:43,604 --> 01:48:49,705
way. okay so test model your with these hypothetical test calibration

1131
01:48:49,705 --> 01:48:54,984
is the process of finding an appropriate value of the parameter. okay

1132
01:48:54,984 --> 01:49:00,145
so what's at here change rate. make sure it's the right one. okay.

1133
01:49:00,145 --> 01:49:06,024
you need data to do this evaluation is taking

1134
01:49:06,024 --> 01:49:11,265
small data set typically in comparing your prediction with that data from

1135
01:49:11,265 --> 01:49:16,359
the real world. okay. it's a case by case evaluation

1136
01:49:16,359 --> 01:49:21,819
because it's like one or two studies it doesn't tell you except whether working that context

1137
01:49:21,819 --> 01:49:26,859
is not general logical validation as a result of doing

1138
01:49:26,859 --> 01:49:32,079
a valuations many times using multiple data

1139
01:49:32,079 --> 01:49:37,699
sets by different people. it's a much stronger standard. okay.

1140
01:49:37,699 --> 01:49:43,079
and then solidity of the model is that it's been deemed

1141
01:49:43,079 --> 01:49:48,398
to give you adequate accuracy. okay after being validated

1142
01:49:48,398 --> 01:49:53,418
for that particular application. alright so we see we've gone

1143
01:49:53,418 --> 01:49:58,679
through a variety of different increasingly high bars to

1144
01:49:58,679 --> 01:50:03,719
assess the model performance reasonable

1145
01:50:03,719 --> 01:50:09,479
to you. who should do this. I just developed the pattern and model

1146
01:50:09,479 --> 01:50:14,799
which is like five thousand dollars. probably needs to be evaluated by an outside

1147
01:50:14,799 --> 01:50:21,743
party okay. this would be ideal. really don't

1148
01:50:21,743 --> 01:50:29,183
hates GM believe it or not has a standard for model validation third-party

1149
01:50:29,183 --> 01:50:34,743
assessors. you can look at that model validation is often very very difficult

1150
01:50:34,743 --> 01:50:40,663
I mean climate change models how we validate them. use we historical data. there's lots of gaps in the data

1151
01:50:40,663 --> 01:50:46,143
right. if things change in the future then we're gonna make a fallacy of extrapolation.

1152
01:50:46,143 --> 01:50:51,583
you know it's gets really really nice point is we need to do this despite

1153
01:50:51,583 --> 01:50:57,663
the shortcomings some of the questions here for validation are

1154
01:50:57,663 --> 01:51:03,163
highlighted. if I told you hardly any of the environmental models

1155
01:51:03,163 --> 01:51:08,243
are sufficiently validated but we still have to use them. if I tell

1156
01:51:08,243 --> 01:51:13,442
you in general many models are on validated. you still get on that airplane.

1157
01:51:13,442 --> 01:51:18,670
right that's been assembled with all kinds of structural models to figure

1158
01:51:18,670 --> 01:51:23,871
out whether it's strong enough to survive. who knows wind gust of lightning strike whatever

1159
01:51:23,871 --> 01:51:28,971
you still get on that plane right. well we do that because we

1160
01:51:28,971 --> 01:51:35,551
have coping mechanisms some of the coping medicine mechanisms for example or to use a margin of safety.

1161
01:51:35,551 --> 01:51:40,610
okay. I mean this could be important. we also do

1162
01:51:40,610 --> 01:51:45,610
sensitivity analyses and things like this but there's a cost to all. 's. alright.

1163
01:51:45,610 --> 01:51:51,031
and if you get into that plane and I can only take

1164
01:51:51,031 --> 01:51:56,110
ten passengers are better example you get into a skyscraper and they've made the concrete pillars

1165
01:51:56,110 --> 01:52:01,590
so strong that there's so little space last. okay for the occupied portion.

1166
01:52:01,590 --> 01:52:06,931
obviously there's a huge cost us. so we want to have efforts that reduce the

1167
01:52:06,931 --> 01:52:11,971
uncertainties. it's really important. expressing the uncertainty is really

1168
01:52:11,971 --> 01:52:17,055
important. I was just trying to quit yes

1169
01:52:17,055 --> 01:52:22,975
it is. so we'll have to pick up a few minutes of this next week.

1170
01:52:22,975 --> 01:52:33,814
no more protests this week I think. alright. have a good weight.

1171
01:52:33,814 --> 01:52:50,314
I got eighty percent. either
