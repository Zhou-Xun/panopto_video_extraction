1
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:14,299
Today we're gonna address the theoretical background of MI.

2
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:18,440
We're gonna define MI and its theoretical underpinnings.

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,740
We're gonna focus on the theory of self determination theory.

4
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,446
As we'll see, it's probably the best explanation for why MI works and how.

5
00:00:26,446 --> 00:00:30,534
So we're gonna relate SDT specifically to the practice of MI.

6
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:36,140
One thing to understand about MI is it has sort of two fundamental dimensions.

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,200
The style component or what we call the spirit.

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,770
Autonomy, support, choice, empathy, collaboration and

9
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,505
the technical aspect, your skills that we could measure asking open questions,

10
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:51,040
using reflective listening etcetera.

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,634
Here is the textbook definition of MI.

12
00:00:53,634 --> 00:00:57,373
What emerges from this definition is the idea that MI is

13
00:00:57,373 --> 00:01:00,885
not simply reflecting back and building empathy.

14
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:05,610
MI is about change and we achieve change by focusing on change talk.

15
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,940
Not only is MI about change but its goal oriented.

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:15,191
Most of MI sessions have a clear directive goal, that is, we are not neutral.

17
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:19,239
We do not present them MI saying I'm equally interested in you smoking more

18
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,661
than I am in smoking less.

19
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:23,411
We are more interested in them, smoking less.

20
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:24,520
MI is directional.

21
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,021
MI is persuasive.

22
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:29,129
Now we do so by respecting autonomy,

23
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:35,340
by letting the patient drive but it is nonetheless goal oriented.

24
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,240
Now there is some controversy in the MI world.

25
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,880
Some folks believe in preference, sensitive situations.

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,806
I'll give you a couple of them.

27
00:01:43,806 --> 00:01:48,554
For most women with early stage breast cancer having lumpectomy versus mastectomy

28
00:01:48,554 --> 00:01:52,550
or choosing whether or not you do a blood stool test or a colonoscopy for

29
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:57,251
colon cancer screening or choosing whether or not to have certain genetic tests.

30
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,443
Those are called preference sensitive decisions.

31
00:01:59,443 --> 00:02:02,040
There isn't a clear directional goal.

32
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,001
Now some people feel you can still use MI there because your goal is,

33
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:09,570
has to have a high quality decision and other people feel no.

34
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,271
If there's not a persuasive, clear goal, it's not MI, it's something else.

35
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:15,476
It's an MI derivative.

36
00:02:15,476 --> 00:02:19,171
In our course, we're going to take the position that it is still MI when

37
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:22,076
you're addressing preference sensitive decisions.

38
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:28,016
And our perspective is that even in these preference sensitive decisions,

39
00:02:28,016 --> 00:02:35,240
you have a goal, and that goal is a fully informed, patient driven decision.

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,040
Here's the definition of MI we've been using for years.

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,630
It captures that duality.

42
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:45,040
It captures the spirit and the technical aspects.

43
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,361
This is a wonderful expression by Monty Roberts.

44
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:51,650
Now you may not know Monty Roberts is, but Robert Redford played him in the movie.

45
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,200
Does that jostle your memory?

46
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,834
He's The Horse Whisperer, and he befriended Bill Miller,

47
00:02:56,834 --> 00:03:00,700
one of the creators of M I, and they shared this mutual insight.

48
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,542
If you do not show the horse or the human that you're willing to be there with them

49
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:09,300
that you're gonna be patient, you're gonna let them talk or

50
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,940
express themselves in the case of a horse, snort or kick or run around.

51
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,147
If you don't communicate to the horse of the human that you're gonna be

52
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:19,605
patient with them that are willing to let them act out,

53
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:24,540
you're not gonna establish the report you need to be an effective change age.

54
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,935
We're gonna talk today about self determination theory as the de facto

55
00:03:28,935 --> 00:03:31,287
theoretical model to explain the MI.

56
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:35,124
MI initially was a theoretical, Bill Miller is very clear.

57
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:38,948
He developed it out of need, not out of theory.

58
00:03:38,948 --> 00:03:43,732
However, for those of us who feel SDT, self determination theory is

59
00:03:43,732 --> 00:03:48,110
a very good explanation of M I, we like to explain it this way.

60
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:53,710
MI was a practice looking for a theory and SDT was a theory looking for a practice.

61
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,164
So we have decided many of us,

62
00:03:56,164 --> 00:04:00,592
but not all of us in the MI world to merge SDT within MI.

63
00:04:00,592 --> 00:04:06,590
To use SDT to explain why MI works and in many ways to shape how we do MI.

64
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,733
But just to be clear, there are some people in MI world who still remain

65
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:14,737
a theoretical who believe it's best to leave MI sort of unmoored and

66
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:19,240
not necessarily committed to one fundamental theory.

67
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,990
Let's talk about SDT.

68
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,740
SDT was originally used to describe and

69
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,690
understand who succeeds in school and who succeeds in the workplace.

70
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,640
So it was very much an organizational psychology orientation.

71
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,874
But over the years,

72
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:39,666
it became increasingly clear to many of us that the principles of SDT also can be

73
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:44,940
used to explain why behavior change occurs in the health context.

74
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,820
SDT has mapped out in thousands of papers that there are three fundamental

75
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,460
human needs autonomy, competence and relatedness.

76
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,260
When these three needs are met initially,

77
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,471
what they found is people do well at school and they do well in the workplace.

78
00:04:58,471 --> 00:05:02,406
So bosses who give their employees lots of choice and support their skills or

79
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:07,640
teachers who give students choice and support their skills had better outcomes.

80
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,083
Well, it turns out that this is also true for health behavior.

81
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,142
We're gonna focus today on autonomy competence.

82
00:05:13,142 --> 00:05:18,040
Relating this is more relevant to the school and the work site findings.

83
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,926
Autonomy is this fundamental human drive to want to feel, and

84
00:05:21,926 --> 00:05:26,121
this is where self determination comes from, this was my choice.

85
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:27,403
This was my action.

86
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:31,991
Competence, it's different than efficacy and social cognitive theory.

87
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:36,836
Competences, optimally challenge make the change just difficult enough so

88
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:40,338
that you feel you've accomplished something but not so

89
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:43,862
difficult that you become overwhelmed and only begin.

90
00:05:43,862 --> 00:05:47,477
The second observation of SDT that is highly relevant to motivational

91
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:48,350
interviewing.

92
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,101
Are there two fundamental types of motivation.

93
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,511
Now these can be put on a continuum rather than thinking that as discreet.

94
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:58,776
But for now, let's talk about them as just two different classes of motivation.

95
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:01,070
On the left is controlled motivation.

96
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,840
That's when behaviors are pressured or coerced by external others.

97
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,450
That includes guilt and shame.

98
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,401
Do it for me.

99
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,374
Do it or else on the right is the more positive or

100
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:16,040
preferential type of motivation called autonomous motivation.

101
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,631
I did it for my own choice, and I see the inherent value of doing this behavior.

102
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:26,340
You don't have to persuade control or bribing me.

103
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,617
Another observation of M I is that motivation equals energy.

104
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:36,377
When we say someone is highly motivated to do something from an SDT perspective,

105
00:06:36,377 --> 00:06:41,137
what we're really saying is that person has a lot of energy that they're willing

106
00:06:41,137 --> 00:06:43,097
to devote to make the change, and

107
00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:46,940
they have enough energy in order to maintain the change.

108
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:53,240
So from an SDT perspective, motivation and energy are almost anonymous.

109
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,110
So let's take all these observations and tie them together and

110
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,440
we come up with three components of a high quality or strong why.

111
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,345
It was my decision, it's important to me and it's within my skill set.

112
00:07:05,345 --> 00:07:08,540
In general until your patient has achieved each of these,

113
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,091
they're not ready to jump to the whole phase.

114
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:14,365
So your job is trying to get all three of these aligned before you jump to

115
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:16,840
the planning action face.

116
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,140
Alternatively, here's a low quality motivational state.

117
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,540
I'm doing it out of pressure or guilt or shame.

118
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,445
I'm doing it to get some sort of external reward,

119
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:31,150
praise or even money, and I'm not sure it's really something I'm able to do.

120
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,514
If your patient has any of these parameters,

121
00:07:34,514 --> 00:07:37,796
they're probably not ready to move to how.

122
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:41,940
So let's summarize what we showed today.

123
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,890
Many in the MUI world, you self determination

124
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,355
theory as the de facto explanation for Why MI works.

125
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:53,164
What self determination theory tells us,

126
00:07:53,164 --> 00:07:57,222
is when you meet the human needs of autonomy and competence and

127
00:07:57,222 --> 00:08:04,451
you build autonomous versus controlled motivation, you will have better outcomes.
