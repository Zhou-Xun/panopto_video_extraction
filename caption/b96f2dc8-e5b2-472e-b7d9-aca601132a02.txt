1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,335
Now that we know the
format of our table 1,

2
00:00:11,335 --> 00:00:13,280
we're going to
start building one.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,160
After watching this video,

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,690
you will be able to identify

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,935
the variables to
include in table 1.

6
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:22,120
We're going to outline
all the statistical tests

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,595
that you can use in this
bivariate analysis.

8
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:27,040
In following videos,
we will learn how to

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,185
use every specific test in SaaS.

10
00:00:30,185 --> 00:00:32,565
How do I build my table 1?

11
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,230
First, we have to choose

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,935
the variables you
want to include,

13
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:37,765
and those are usually

14
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:40,900
socio-demographic
variables such as age,

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,080
sex, income, education,
those are must.

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,330
Then you have
potential confounders.

17
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,505
That is the risk factors
for the outcome,

18
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:51,640
and those will be study specific.

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,545
If, for example, your outcome
is myocardial infarction,

20
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:56,750
you will have to include
the usual suspects,

21
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,625
like for example, smoking,

22
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,475
blood pressure, high
cholesterol, and so on.

23
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:03,575
Finally, you always include

24
00:01:03,575 --> 00:01:05,860
the main exposure
in your table 1.

25
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,270
It's important to include any

26
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,960
variable that is going to be
used in further analysis.

27
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,375
For example, if you are
going to adjust for

28
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,195
smoking in your
multivariable analysis,

29
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:19,010
you definitely want to describe

30
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,335
the variable smoking
in your table one.

31
00:01:21,335 --> 00:01:23,465
That's why doing the analysis

32
00:01:23,465 --> 00:01:25,790
often requires a lot
of back and forth.

33
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,475
Even if you plan
things very well,

34
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:30,605
new potential confounders may

35
00:01:30,605 --> 00:01:33,020
come up once you
do your analysis.

36
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,865
Therefore, you may want to go

37
00:01:34,865 --> 00:01:37,475
back and include those
in your table 1.

38
00:01:37,475 --> 00:01:40,510
What are you going to
report in your table 1?

39
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,950
In general, means and

40
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,630
standard deviations for
continuous variables,

41
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,860
and percentages, and
sometimes raw frequencies in

42
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,945
parenthesis for dichotomous
and categorical variables.

43
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:54,980
Depending on the distribution

44
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,540
of your continuous variables,

45
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,660
if they are not normally
distributed and highly skewed,

46
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,670
some people prefer to report

47
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,555
medians and interquartile ranges.

48
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:06,870
Now the one dollar
million question,

49
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,510
should I report p-values or not?

50
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,115
It's up to you.

51
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:13,340
As I mentioned in
the previous video,

52
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,480
some people prefer exclusively
descriptive tables

53
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,925
with no p-values and some
people prefer otherwise.

54
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:22,255
So for the purposes
of this class,

55
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:23,610
we will include p-values.

56
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,710
So you remember all the
different statistical tests

57
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,505
that are appropriate
for every occasion.

58
00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:32,075
Finally, let's align in

59
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:34,480
this algorithm all
the potential tests

60
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,310
you can do for your table 1.

61
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,130
We're going to assume that
our outcome is binary.

62
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,840
You either have it or not.

63
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,940
For example, you are
either a case of

64
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,280
myocardial infarction
or you're a control.

65
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,380
In that case, you have to ask if

66
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,690
your data is match or not first.

67
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,980
If it's not match,

68
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,340
you go on the left.

69
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,710
For binary and
categorical predictors,

70
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,660
you will have to do
a chi-square test.

71
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,670
For continuous
predictors, you have to

72
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,129
check if the variable is
normally distributed.

73
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:03,740
If it is, you will do a t-test.

74
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,690
If it's not, you can do

75
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,290
a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test,
also called Mann-Whitney-U.

76
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,480
You can also transform
the variable and

77
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,430
make it normal and do a t-test.

78
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,245
But for the purposes
of this class,

79
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:16,500
we want that from the data.

80
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,725
So you can practice
these other tests.

81
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:20,900
Now, if your data is match,

82
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,450
then you go on the right.

83
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,030
For binary predictors, you
will do a McNemar's test,

84
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,925
which is the match version
of the chi-square test.

85
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:31,430
For continuous data, you
will have to check again if

86
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,815
it's normally or not distributed.

87
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:36,205
If it's normal, you
do a paired t-test,

88
00:03:36,205 --> 00:03:40,010
and if it's not, you will do
a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test.

89
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,400
Note this is different
than the other Wilcoxon,

90
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,075
even if they share the
same Wilcoxon name.

91
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:50,390
Don't worry, we will go one
by one in the next videos.

92
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,615
But I wanted to show you
altogether so you can

93
00:03:53,615 --> 00:03:55,670
choose properly
depending on the type

94
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,585
of variables and
data that you have.

95
00:03:58,585 --> 00:04:01,025
In summary, in this video,

96
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:02,420
we learn how to identify

97
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,550
the variables to
include in table 1,

98
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,745
and we learn how to map
each statistical test

99
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:09,350
used in bivariate analysis

100
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,420
to each type of
variable and data.

101
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,740
In the next videos,

102
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,808
we will start using one-by-one.
