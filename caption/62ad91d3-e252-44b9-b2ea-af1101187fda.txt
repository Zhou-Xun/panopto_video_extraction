1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,300
Hey. So today we're going to start getting into some of the conceptual models and frameworks.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:13,680
I'm going to start first with occupational health and then we'll do the environmental ones on Tuesday.

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:14,700
Okay.

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:23,160
I was hoping to have a guest lecturer for the second half of today because he's done at the last two years my dissertation advisor, Dr. Todd Smith.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:32,010
But he's too busy now to give the guest lecture, so he's giving me permission to just do the slides for you.

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:43,680
Yes. So today we'll be talking specifically about two models, the G, the job demand resources model and the work family conflict model.

7
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,760
Okay. So the job demands resources model.

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,560
This has to be been called many different things in the past.

9
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:59,640
But the GDR for short was formally created by Bakker and Rudi.

10
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:15,520
Okay. I was about to start, actually.

11
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,050
Would you want to introduce yourself? Hi. Oh, this is not a spa.

12
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:31,960
Sorry. You don't have to if you don't want to. I'm Joan, and I know you're in Beijing.

13
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,500
Um, I also have, um, my MSW.

14
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,350
I'm not a dual student, so he's from a different university.

15
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:53,320
Oh, I don't know. Um, the wheels are new.

16
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:00,580
I'm not happy about it, and that's why I'm not yet.

17
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,890
What's your favorite emoji that you use? I ask that the rest of us.

18
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:15,760
There's an emoji that looks like my service dog. Oh, there is a black Labrador.

19
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,140
Imagine with like a it has a red vest on it.

20
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,970
On this? Yes.

21
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,530
That was my favorite. Oh, I see it. They're thing.

22
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,750
Do they now have more dog emojis? They have more dog emojis on the iPhone.

23
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,990
Interesting. I only have a single dog. Must be an android.

24
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:48,800
Interestingly, they don't have a grass emoji because whenever I pay the kid who was my one on Venmo, there's never grass.

25
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,160
So I have to just put like a leaf because I was, you know, one of them was someone I don't want to just like, right.

26
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,790
The thing I was like, Oh, it's got to be something done. It has to be something fun.

27
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,680
That's right. Well, welcome to the class officially, Joe.

28
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,410
So. Okay, so we're just getting started talking about the the job demands resources model.

29
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,969
So as mentioned, it was formalized in 2007,

30
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:20,430
but many versions of this existed before previous iterations like that from back then already, but also other people.

31
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:29,680
So like I showed you, you know, Tuesday, you know, when you make a contract, you go through so many iterations of it before you finalize it.

32
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:38,139
So essentially, they use this as an occupational stress model that suggests that strain from work comes when there's an

33
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:44,650
imbalance between the demands on the person versus the resources they have to deal with those demands.

34
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:55,450
And the GDR is the model most commonly used to predict employee burnout and also employee engagement and its role with organizational performance.

35
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:01,690
So when we say organizational performance, that also potentially means like injury and illness as well,

36
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,160
but also outcomes like productivity and presenteeism.

37
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:15,489
Presenteeism is basically it's like if you're at your work and you're doing your job, you're there mentally,

38
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:22,600
whereas the lack of presenteeism is like your body is physically there, but like, you know, you're just kind of going through the motions.

39
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:31,960
And this has been introduced as other like employee wellbeing models as well, like the Effort Reward Imbalance model by Siegrist,

40
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:40,030
which I sometimes use in my research, but it doesn't only focus on negative outcome variables, which is great.

41
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,339
Sorry Josh, I like trap too. With the motivation here you can move it and then you can.

42
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:53,500
There's positive outcomes as well. So things that are considered job demands are constructs that may be physical, psychological,

43
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:01,239
social or organizational that require sustained effort, sustained effort or skills.

44
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:09,490
So work pressure, emotional demands and the resources can also in turn be like the foils of those things,

45
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,020
but like career opportunities, super supervisor support.

46
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,969
So basically in this model,

47
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:24,910
they say that strain and motivation are the psychological processes that underlie essentially everything that you do at work.

48
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:33,849
So if you have sustained job strain that can lead to an exhaustion of physical and mental resources,

49
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,500
the depletion of energy, physical health issues and mental health issues.

50
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:49,030
But if you have adequate job and personal resources, you're likely to have better work performance, high work engagement and lower cynicism.

51
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:56,110
Like, you know, this might change from day to day, but rather than like a snapshot in time,

52
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,120
the Jtr kind of looks at the workers experience as a whole.

53
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,880
So, you know, some days you might be more motivated than other days, right?

54
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:13,150
Like I definitely have those days where you're like, I don't want to write anything and just like spin around in your chair.

55
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,370
My main problem when I work from home is I want to, like, organize everything.

56
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,709
Even though my house is already clean.

57
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:26,470
But I like procrastinate clean by doing, like, home, edit stuff like let me just, like, reorganize all my books.

58
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:33,879
So it's like in The Color of the Rainbow or read all about my t shirts, you know, something like that.

59
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:40,660
But this can potentially happen over time where, you know, a person works at a place,

60
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:49,299
you always start out really hopeful and enthusiastic and either due to interpersonal dynamics or work circumstances,

61
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,320
your your performance in your engagement can slowly, slowly drop.

62
00:06:53,450 --> 00:07:01,029
Okay, so this is the very basic like their initial what their initial model looks

63
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:06,969
like where they're saying that you have to hear the job demands and resources,

64
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:13,570
which they are the opposite of one another. Demands lead to strain, resources lead to motivation.

65
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,610
What feeds into the demands are like mental, emotional and physical.

66
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,340
And then resources can be things like support, autonomy, feedback, reward, right?

67
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:33,070
And the relationship between those items and their interrelationships with one another lead to these organizational outcomes.

68
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,660
Here's the updated version from a decade later.

69
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,500
So 27 2017.

70
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,570
So we still have the job demands and we still have the job resources,

71
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:55,000
but now they're separating out job resources from personal resources because you might have some personal resources like, you know,

72
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,729
when you go home from your job, is there somebody you can vent to for, you know,

73
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:09,969
you have a dog that's very excited to see you at the door and they help you decompress, you know, do you have to go home and do some caretaking?

74
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,900
Right. So you have like a 9 to 5 and then a 5 to 9.

75
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,779
Then you have what they call job crafting and self undermining.

76
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:28,780
I think self undermining is pretty self-explanatory, but job crafting can be like if you have enough autonomy,

77
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:36,160
you are able to shape the job more into what you want it to be rather than what it has to be.

78
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,770
Or no one's really specified for you what it has to be.

79
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:45,400
Self undermining is just basically like, you know, you're constantly telling yourself like you're undercutting yourself, right?

80
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,499
And then for motivation, they have, they've added a couple of things like work,

81
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,220
engagement and flourishing, like do you feel like you're flourishing in the workplace?

82
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:59,470
And for strain, they've added things like job related anxiety and health complaints.

83
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:06,340
How many of you get the Sunday Scaries? I don't, but my wife does and describes it vividly.

84
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,670
Okay, you get the Sunday Scaries Sam, you look confused.

85
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,560
Never heard you never heard of that.

86
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:19,870
Bridget Do you mind like when you think of all the things that you have to do that week so, and you can't really relax on Sunday, even if you began,

87
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:27,100
it's like you're mentally already you're already in the week and stressed out about have never been able to describe my Sundays more accurately.

88
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,910
Okay so Sam, you do get the Sunday scaries.

89
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,710
Okay. I have a lot of anxiety, but not the Sunday scary stuff.

90
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,950
Yeah, I used to get the Sunday scaries a lot.

91
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:46,020
I'm kind of dead inside now, but no, that's not you.

92
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,920
That means to me that they didn't use that as the I use.

93
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,709
You know, I used to have a lot more anxiety. But yes, it is like thinking about the things you have to do for the week.

94
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,320
And I feel like the Sunday scaries are more common.

95
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:11,729
And when it's like maybe a lot of imposter syndrome, maybe present or you're looking at your to do list and it seems really insurmountable.

96
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:20,280
Like I have to do all the things this week. But I think after you go through it enough times, like in knowing yourself, everybody's different.

97
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,959
Like, I've never gone through a week where it's like, okay, some weeks are better than others,

98
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,310
but I always made it and like, I usually never miss deadlines.

99
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:35,250
So it's like, you know, after a while you some of that self undermining goes away because you build the confidence.

100
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,319
But also like that happens.

101
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,560
It happens like, okay, you three could especially have experienced a student because like every semester your school changes.

102
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,090
So then like what you have to do, you changes. And then in my head I'm like Sunday night,

103
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:53,100
I like condensing the whole week until like one day where I have to get everything done was like, not the case.

104
00:10:53,370 --> 00:11:00,320
Yeah. Because I have who, who came up with the idea that weekends were only two days an idiot.

105
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,690
Yeah. Yeah. Although to fight for a two day weekend so.

106
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,980
Yeah. Well in this the yeah.

107
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:16,440
No yeah thank you thank you unions you're unions for the weekend but we'll talk more about it Sunday for day workweeks later on in the class.

108
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,450
But right now I sort of have like a four day weekend.

109
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:28,140
So we have class Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. That doesn't mean I don't have like.

110
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,140
Yeah, yeah. Those other four days. Yeah, but I'm in.

111
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,330
Talia, it is the way to go.

112
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:47,550
Okay. The way to go to be able to, like, have that time to be able to, like, stage your other stuff and.

113
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,930
Yeah. Yeah, I don't. I wish I could. I feel like I have to.

114
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:59,010
For me personally, Friday, I work on Fridays,

115
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,829
so I come home Friday and then my sad Friday afternoon activity is just cleaning my house in

116
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,090
the bathrooms because I feel like I can't fully relax for the weekend unless my house is,

117
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:15,180
like, pristine. And then Saturday usually like, I can do like one social thing.

118
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,810
I can't do a night thing and thing anymore. And I'm introverted enough where I'm like, Sunday, I need to recharge.

119
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,440
My sister, for example, is very opposite of me where like Friday through Sunday, I like, don't catch her at her apartment.

120
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,190
She's out like. But yes.

121
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:38,280
So those are considered, you know, personal resources. So if we look at here, I'm like a like a two by two table.

122
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:49,650
Predictions of the job demands resources model. So if you have low resources but also low demands, that's okay.

123
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,709
Because it does it leads to low straight and low motivation.

124
00:12:52,710 --> 00:13:00,630
But if you have high, low demands but high resources, you have low stream but high motivation.

125
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:10,730
And then if you have high demands but low resources, again, higher strain and low motivation and then the high with the high.

126
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,370
So what's one of the which one of the four do you think is the worst?

127
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,850
I think I strain the motivation. Mm hmm.

128
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,569
Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah. And then on this side.

129
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,870
So that was figure. So that's for you two. And then I'm figure seven here.

130
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:38,100
If you look at the interaction effects as well, taking into account all the other variables in the model generally rather than low motivation,

131
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:46,320
if there is low demand, you get average motivation. And then if there's high demands, you generally just get average strain.

132
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:53,790
Mm hmm. So the strength of the Jtr is that it is a really flexible model in that it can be

133
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:59,550
applied to different occupational settings and jobs with different characteristics.

134
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:10,049
So some of these models are like super this available for certain conditions, but you can apply the GBR to people who work in office jobs,

135
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:16,700
but also people who work in like manufacturing, for example, which isn't necessarily always the case.

136
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,320
So this is a super generalizable model in that way.

137
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,410
That's why it's frequently used and it can also be used to improve employee wellbeing and performance.

138
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:31,050
If you can identify where the strain is coming from by like a questionnaire or something like that.

139
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:36,360
And also the nice thing is it doesn't limit the set of predictor variables you can have,

140
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,559
although that is contingent upon like your statistical model because you don't want to

141
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,650
overload your model and it incorporates both positive and negative outcomes of work.

142
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,150
But the weaknesses is that is a flexible model.

143
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,899
Right. So take that with a grain of salt, as you will.

144
00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:04,530
And the direct link between job demands and resources has never really been clearly specified in the extensive research and literature.

145
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:13,440
And it says that the health impairment process, starting with job demands, is largely independent from the motivational processes.

146
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:22,860
But some people say that like the health impairment process and the motivational process, are not actually as independent as they think.

147
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:30,510
And then this model doesn't take into account underlying psychological and physiological mechanisms.

148
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:38,730
So job demands may also play a role in motivation, and it doesn't take into account the multi-level nature of work,

149
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,070
justice, health improvement processes that mean like the stress response.

150
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:51,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I would say stress and motivation are there sometimes tied together.

151
00:15:51,540 --> 00:16:00,809
Like, you know, I think a lot of faculty know that these jobs are killing us, aging us faster than it really needs to be.

152
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,740
But what else are you getting at dealing with how students feel?

153
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,960
Yeah, yeah. That's Bridget. You certainly talk about you want to be policy,

154
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:20,760
so how to measure data are essentially you take a top down perspective looking at management which are many many skills have been developed.

155
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:30,570
So for your questionnaire, if you want to include incorporate some things about like job resources or life satisfaction or strain,

156
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:37,889
you can totally incorporate those in there. Just know that some existing skills are validated, some are not.

157
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,020
They'll tell you in the paper whether or not they are,

158
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:49,410
but there's no consensus on what items you need to use specifically like how we talked about for the reason action approach.

159
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,770
There's very specific constructing a measure to get from like A to Z for the GDR.

160
00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:01,680
It's kind of like make it what you will as long as you incorporate the main constructs.

161
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,380
Okay. So the constructs you can include are work load.

162
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:18,770
You can assess both physical and mental. You can look at one or the other autonomy, decision making, role, clarity, leadership support.

163
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,250
You can even parse out that support between supervisors and coworkers.

164
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:27,560
And the operationalization could be like, Do you have too much work to do?

165
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,670
Do you have to be attentive to too much, too many things at the same time?

166
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,709
Does your work offer you the possibility of independent thoughts and actions if necessary?

167
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:44,270
Can you ask your colleagues for help? These are all existing questions that people use on a five point lookup scale.

168
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:56,780
So you can also look at things like job control with a statement reading of 1 to 5 social support, performance feedback, burnout, engagement,

169
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:06,709
etc. Questions about the Jedi are Josh 30 something you want to use for like looking at high stress

170
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:12,470
environments in accident rate or something and you as a high stress environment by using the air or.

171
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:19,640
Yeah, yeah. So potentially like just say like you notice because like previously there's always this hasn't always

172
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:25,250
been like an accident prone workplace and all of a sudden there's some way more accidents happening.

173
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,090
So first, I mean, if you were like an occupational health professional,

174
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:35,600
you might do a survey of the area, like has any of the equipment change, has any of the processes change?

175
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:42,740
Are there a bunch of like new workers? And if everything seems to be the same and it's the same workers,

176
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:51,709
but maybe like there's a new person in charge or something or like or something like that, you want to figure out what's going on.

177
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:57,620
So you might want to check in to determine like do they feel like what are their job resources?

178
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:07,670
How much strain are they feeling? And when you look at strain, you might not only determine whether or not there is the presence of strain,

179
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:13,670
but you want to figure out what that strain is. So after that, you might follow up and talk to people and they're like, Well,

180
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:18,920
this new person didn't like this new managerial style, does a lot of micromanaging, and I don't like that.

181
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,210
And that's not what I'm used to.

182
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:29,420
So I'm feeling like a lot of extra stress or something like that, but it doesn't necessarily have to be like explicit accidents either.

183
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:37,880
You could also notice a lot of turnover in an organization where people are just like quitting constantly and people are like in and out.

184
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,690
So that's a possibility to use that as much. Yeah.

185
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:50,630
Yeah. The next we're going to talk about is work, family, conflict, work, interference with family and work, family interference.

186
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,880
So they all go under this and Barela called work family balance.

187
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:02,870
So WFC w i f it can also go the other way where your family interferes with your work.

188
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,850
That should say f i w sorry.

189
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:13,490
It's one of the most well-studied concepts in the work family literature, and this has been going on since like the 1980s.

190
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,000
And there's a faculty member at the University of South Florida.

191
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,950
Her name's Tammy Allen, and she does a ton of cool work in this area.

192
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:27,830
But essentially the crux of work family balance is saying because you participate,

193
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:35,720
participation in one role can be made more difficult by participation in the other role.

194
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:42,469
So what are some examples of this? So with work,

195
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:52,970
family conflict or and F.W. job stressors predict work interference with family and family stressors predict family interference with work.

196
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:59,750
So that can be like your parental status, your marital status, job demand is coming to this and then flexibility.

197
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:07,310
So this is an older study, but it says mothers more than fathers experience career interruptions.

198
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:15,440
So you can see their like reduced work hours once they had to start caring for a child.

199
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:24,200
Was the difference between 28 versus 42% significant time off quitting their job and then turning down into motion?

200
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,850
I don't think this is surprising to anyone. Okay.

201
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,290
Stress obviously has adverse health outcomes.

202
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:42,709
So the negative work family conference outcomes can be like dietary choices, exercise choices and even safety behaviors.

203
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:46,670
So people change their safety behaviors as well.

204
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:58,750
Interestingly, like a lot of research now has confirmed that marriage benefits men exponentially and actually makes women's health worse.

205
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,360
What have any of you heard of this? What about down south last year?

206
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,320
Okay. So why do you. Why why do we think that might be?

207
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:19,400
Well, I know at least the benefit for the men is I mean, one of the biggest factors of determining early death of men is if they're lonely or not.

208
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,840
And that makes them way more prone to, I think, risk based behaviors.

209
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:30,040
Drinking. Not all of them don't like that. Not as I've learned as much about the negative impact on women from marriage.

210
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,110
Oh, yeah. Yes. Will you? As a designated third person?

211
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:42,340
Yeah. Also, when when the I'm talking about heterosexual relationships, by the way, when men are married,

212
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:48,580
they tend to seek health care more often versus when they are left to their own devices.

213
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:56,710
They will not seek health care. Right. Whereas women it's not only more emotional labor, but also physical labor.

214
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:02,379
There was a study in 2009 where they did a survey of folks saying, like, you know,

215
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:09,050
when you do your vows or whatever, sickness and in health which are poor, blah, blah, blah.

216
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:16,900
Right. So they asked men, how likely would you be to leave your partner if they had a serious illness or were diagnosed with cancer?

217
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:23,799
It's like 22% of men said they would. Yeah, but I saw the episode on Twitter.

218
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,870
I think someone said that that's something that they actually tell women when they get like a yes.

219
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,459
Like oncologists will tell their female patients, like when they are diagnosed with cancer.

220
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:39,580
Like, just see, you know, a lot of women's husbands leave them during this time.

221
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:47,950
I think one politician maybe was Newt Gingrich or even a Bob Dole where he left his wife when she had cancer for some other woman.

222
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,590
Whereas when you ask women the opposite, it's like 0.2% or something like that.

223
00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:00,879
I would have thought they'd be flip doubles just because like, I mean, the traditional role of men as providers like man can't provide women lives.

224
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,290
But it's interesting dynamic also. It's interesting.

225
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,729
Interesting. Oh yeah.

226
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:12,820
I'd be so mad. I'm so hungry. That it was.

227
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,890
I think Dr. Seuss left his wife because she was diagnosed with cancer or something.

228
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:26,530
That you're married. That is not a good guy. No. And I really pains me because at UC San Diego Geisel, which is actually Dr. Seuss, his real name,

229
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:30,730
our whole library is the guy's a library, and we have the entire season collection.

230
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:37,920
And then at graduation, like, people sit and like, you know, take pictures of the cat in the hat thing.

231
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,200
Um, anyway, he's not. No, he's not a good person.

232
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:45,670
It's problematic. This was a screenshot.

233
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:50,470
So the advanced program here is for to support female faculty equity.

234
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:59,230
So early on in the pandemic, they did a survey to see how COVID has impacted productivity of faculty from different groups.

235
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:05,080
And many of us are busier now than pre-pandemic. But women are more likely to be busier than men.

236
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,010
Right. Because there's a change in distribution of the work efforts.

237
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:13,750
Like I said, women have less time for research and writing because of their caregiving responsibilities.

238
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:21,320
Even for non academics, white workers reported being more productive than minority workers.

239
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,209
Right. And among faculty in STEM,

240
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:32,890
those in bed sciences had the largest decrease in time to research due to lack of access and our labs publication process was slowing,

241
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:37,390
etc. etc. So during the pandemic,

242
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:41,350
actually, men said they were more productive in their research because they didn't have

243
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:46,089
to like be here to attend like service meetings and like meet with students.

244
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:53,350
So you have more time to focus on writing. And they have kids and they like just run around at home and their spouse takes care of them,

245
00:25:54,250 --> 00:26:00,580
which, you know, we've progressed in some ways as a society. But the traditional caretaking roles, I think, are still very much there.

246
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:12,100
As an example, I think I told you I knew as my other class I watch 90 day fiance say a lot, but they tell you that maybe that was my other class.

247
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:16,390
It's like my favorite comfort TV show because I don't have to think too much about it.

248
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:22,270
And there's a couple on there. Jovi and Yara Yara's from the Ukraine.

249
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,459
Jovi lives in New Orleans. They have a kid he refers to watching.

250
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:36,340
His child is babysitting, which is one of my biggest pet peeve is if it is your child, it is not babysitting.

251
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:45,280
It is called being a parent. But this is also unsurprising to me and they they're not allowed to ask you in interviews anymore.

252
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,979
Like there are certain questions that are considered illegal when you're interviewing for positions.

253
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:57,969
So nobody should ask you as a woman, are you married or what your relationship status is, or if you plan to have children.

254
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:04,120
But in faculty interviews, sometimes it does come up, right, because people are curious like,

255
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:09,730
are you just going to get hired and then go and leave for a semester or something like that?

256
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,669
Thankfully, no. But he did ask me about that.

257
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:20,930
But for a lot of my colleagues who have had kids while they were going through the promotion and tenure process,

258
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:25,190
they do give you an extension that you can take for a year, but the clock doesn't stop.

259
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:29,780
You still have to be productive during that time.

260
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:35,420
And generally, women in academia, ones, they have families there.

261
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:43,400
Their research progress slows down. So it's a matter of what I guess you want your priorities to be.

262
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,920
But yeah. Oh, okay.

263
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,279
So there are some positive work family outcomes,

264
00:27:52,280 --> 00:28:02,360
those are positive spillover experiences in one's role improves the quality of life in another aspect skills, behaviors, values, etc.

265
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:11,060
So just say, for example, I don't know, I'm making this up like you're you're a nurse and then you have a family.

266
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:15,670
You're, you're really good at, like, multitasking and balancing a lot of things at once.

267
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,810
Right? Or perhaps, like, you get a lot of fulfillment and enrichment from work.

268
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:28,819
So those experiences in your work role can improve your quality of life in another one through the transfer of resources.

269
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,940
And they don't necessarily have to be tangible resources.

270
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,770
And facilitation in that one domain provides gains that contribute to another.

271
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:43,220
For example, I'm crushing in at work and I got a raise or a big bonus or something like that.

272
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:50,810
So we're able to like pay for our mortgage, pay off our mortgage or like go on a really nice vacation or something like that.

273
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:56,150
That's kind of like facilitation. Like one domain provides games to that.

274
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,580
This is a more complex model.

275
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:10,070
So if you look here at the model of work family balance, they call it some different things work, enrichment of family,

276
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:16,430
family enrichment of work and its relationship with one another, feelings of work, family balance.

277
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:23,270
And then they look into these dispositional characteristics, work involvement, family involvement.

278
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:30,710
You don't have to get anything too complex like this in your questionnaire unless you really want to.

279
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:35,870
It is very well measured. So overall,

280
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:41,269
the appraisal of the extent to which individual's effectiveness and satisfaction in

281
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:45,140
work and family roles are consistent with their life and values at a point in time.

282
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:52,850
So the work family balance thing though, if it is balanced, it doesn't imply an absence of conflicts.

283
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:56,120
This model is super dynamic. Okay.

284
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:04,810
So again, for this, there is real no there is no real consensus on a set of questions or particular constructs.

285
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:09,009
So if you're interested in measuring work, family conflicts, constructs,

286
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:13,839
you can probably draw on organizational commitment, job satisfaction, job tension,

287
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,630
role conflict, ambiguity, turnover, intention, life satisfaction, relationship satisfaction,

288
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,590
relationship agreement, hours worked and all that kind of stuff.

289
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:34,710
Yeah. You can also for this one, you can use liquor, unipolar or bipolar differential semantic scales like we talked about previously.

290
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,060
You do have to test, though, for construct validity and codex alpha.

291
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,579
Like I said, I'm not going to make you check it, but it's important to know. Oh okay.

292
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:52,290
That was for my class. Ignore that. Any questions about work, family balance or comments before I move on?

293
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:59,970
Josh So I guess it's heavily cultural based and I mean like in terms of work, family balance, gender roles, that kind of stuff.

294
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:10,110
Yeah. I'm curious, I mean, does it does a lot of the stuff tracked for like a non Western American perspective or.

295
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:20,940
Oh my gosh. Yeah. Okay. So, I mean, I'll give you my perspective and other people feel free to contribute as well.

296
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:26,280
So in Vietnamese culture, it is still very much a patriarchal culture.

297
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:32,380
So my parents are now divorced. Best thing that ever happened to them, I think.

298
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,960
But my one, my mom had my sister, who's seven years older than me, she kind of,

299
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:44,940
you know, dropped out the part time with them when they had me and was the last one.

300
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,940
My grandmother, her mother in law, forced her to quit her job,

301
00:31:50,940 --> 00:32:01,380
to stay at home because they thought childcare was too expensive and childcare wouldn't raise us as properly as she would.

302
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:08,010
Even though my mom wanted to work. Right. So basically she was a stay at home mom for 17 years.

303
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:15,240
And then my dad just like literally pieces out with all the money here and has a new wife within like 2 seconds.

304
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,950
But then she had like a 17 year gap in her resumé.

305
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:26,459
But it is like a super patriarchal character, a patriarchal culture,

306
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:33,870
in that the man is considered the provider and the woman does like domestic child care, techie things.

307
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:42,390
I'm very different because I was born here and I think I'm disrespectful because I talk back a lot.

308
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:49,800
It's okay. I don't know. Does anybody have other opinions they want to or experiences they want to share?

309
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:01,060
You know, I was I was talking to somebody else who's from Filipino culture.

310
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:12,100
So it's kind of very, very similar to that as well. I can't I can't think off of the top of my head where there is a culture where

311
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:21,159
women are more that's just thinking more just in terms of like different.

312
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,440
I mean, the guy like the nuclear family, I think is I mean,

313
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:28,210
that's like in more of like extended families, like living situations or multiple generations.

314
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,010
Oh, yeah. And the kind of ex work, family balance, all of them.

315
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:42,459
Yeah, probably. I mean, Asian people live in a lot of multi-generation generational households, sometimes for better, sometimes for worse.

316
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,550
But you feel that like cultural familial obligation.

317
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:58,269
Mhm. Mhm. Anyways, yeah, but off the top of my head I can't think of any culture where women have more far more power than men,

318
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:02,679
I guess mauritshuis and some Polynesian cultures.

319
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,719
But. Yeah, man, it's not a great time to be a woman.

320
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,310
I love to say everything I do this morning.

321
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:18,310
Listen to a podcast. Really? Because it's like you look at nature and the females drive everything.

322
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:28,410
Like the like women are girls and like nature, and then men are just like, Oh, okay, you can come in now, but not like women.

323
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:36,190
It's funny how, like, homo sapiens have cast like men to be the leaders, but in nature it's the opposite, I think in a lot of terms.

324
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:40,930
But off topic, yes. Interesting. Like praying mantis.

325
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:48,580
Yeah I mean mosquitoes the female mosquitoes and know and that's carry Zika and I think I mean it depends on how fast you start looking at their pulp

326
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:58,990
anthropologically or humans I know it does there's variances or I mean it's not it's but the case that leaves for similarly farming situations.

327
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:05,169
We've been gaslit for all of humanity though. I don't know. Just say a little bit.

328
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:12,400
A little bit. So, yeah, things are, are, things are kind of changing, though.

329
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:16,090
Oh, yeah, I'd say so. Josh, you look skeptical.

330
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:23,680
Well, I mean I mean, certainly things are changing. I think mostly positive, but there's always stuff that seems progressive, you know?

331
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:30,700
Yeah, it certainly bodes well, I think, especially when you look at like higher educational outcomes, like dudes are doing very well.

332
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:39,219
Yeah. I mean you can hope they'll be an issue in itself, but I mean in terms of educational payments and jobs, promotions,

333
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:46,510
I mean even a drama undergrad, any time there's any kind of extracurricular activity or position of leadership, almost always.

334
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:54,790
Woman We're just going to see. Oh, so yeah, well it is I will say like the industrial hygiene industrial has tended to be mostly men,

335
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:59,020
but now most of our classes are predominantly women instead of men.

336
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:10,570
Um, but interestingly, public and public health women make about 80% of the workforce, but ah, very seldom in like the highest level positions.

337
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:17,649
Um, yeah, I've noticed that like just I did public, I was an undergrad, I mean, I was like public health education with like this program.

338
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:21,580
And health education tends to be like more female dominated anyway.

339
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:27,730
But like my classes in undergrad, you have maybe like one or two male students.

340
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:34,210
And then in like the I'm huge program, it's more like closer to 5050.

341
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,760
So like I think a lot of women in public health, they get their bachelors and not their masters,

342
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:45,580
whereas like more men will get their masters in public health. And one of three men in my cohort.

343
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,780
Yeah. Yeah.

344
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:57,010
So I mean that is big but you know I think three or four of us and it's yeah, I mean 97% female in our core and I think that's typical for be right.

345
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:02,110
But when you look at positions of leadership like you look at who are the deans of the schools

346
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:08,229
and programs of public health are like we have Rochelle Walensky now as the head of the CDC.

347
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:14,709
Right. So they're trying to, you know, identify more more gender equity for those positions.

348
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:20,420
But historically, like U.S. surgeon generals and these other top public health positions,

349
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:27,160
or even who leads like departments in a county health department, tend to be men, which is very interesting.

350
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:35,620
I also worked at a county health department and I would say like mostly women were there, but it was like a man, one or both.

351
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,230
Apartment is like pretty cool. So other women, mostly men, like ran departments.

352
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,230
Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting.

353
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,890
Well, for a while, the stuff is age stuff, and that's kind of phasing out.

354
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:56,190
That's what I thought was just like, I'll just retire or just die, and that will come, you know?

355
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,569
But a lot more of it, though. I'm all for it. I'm all for gender equity.

356
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:06,240
But what I don't appreciate that I will say is pretty common is that some of my worst bullies have been

357
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,030
other women just because it's like a hazing process where they feel like they had to go through things.

358
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:17,370
So subconsciously or consciously, they make your life really difficult.

359
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,699
And I'm like, Excuse me, where I don't feel like a self-proclaimed feminist,

360
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:35,850
but that's a whole other than the things that are in your knowledge that like fewer places for women in leadership positions.

361
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,780
But in fact, the competition for. This.

362
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,670
Yeah. People often think about success as a zero sum game.

363
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:54,400
Just because I like if somebody else has success, they're taking my potential success.

364
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:58,780
I don't necessarily think of life that way, but maybe a lot of people do.

365
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,550
Or you'll even find that difference in professions. Like I'm sure they think about that very differently.

366
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,430
And at Ross, like the business school, for example.

367
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:13,389
Yeah, well I guess it kind of feeds into our next topic, which is safety, culture and safety climate.

368
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:19,000
And we talked a lot a little bit about how these terms are kind of like loosely thrown around.

369
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,620
Okay. This is Todd's icebreaker, so we need to do that.

370
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:31,660
So we're going to define what these things actually are and talk about its dimensionality and parameters and how to actually measure them.

371
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,820
This is just showing you the modern safety research and practice, how it's evolved over time.

372
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:44,290
At first we were mostly concerned with like hazard controls and technology,

373
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:51,340
like how do we stop fires from randomly happening in the factory and like catching a bunch of people on fire?

374
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:57,400
And then in the mid 20th century, they started getting more into human factors and human errors.

375
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:04,990
How many of these problems are are contributed by human error versus the actual like engineering of a product?

376
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:11,860
And now in recent years, we're moving more towards organized, looking at organizational and management factors.

377
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:21,639
So there are three E's of safety, engineering, education and enforcement typically of their hazards.

378
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:27,370
Or we try to engineer them out, try to ensure a safe design with education.

379
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:34,359
Obviously you want to educate and train the workforce and then enforcement and for safety rules, policies, programs and procedures.

380
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:39,610
But we all know just because those things exist doesn't mean people will actually do that.

381
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,090
So how do you get people to do them?

382
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:51,040
These historically have been the preventative and corrective strategies that we have used, but we know now it's not as effective.

383
00:40:51,040 --> 00:41:00,940
Right. Oh, you you have all seen the hierarchy of controls before.

384
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:07,389
You know, Jill, you have Josh, you're nodding. You know, you don't need to know too much about this,

385
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:12,910
except that this is essentially what US occupational health and industrial hygiene professionals

386
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:19,800
utilize as the order in which we try to get rid of a hazard in order to protect the worker.

387
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,999
So first we try for elimination. If we can get rid of something completely, we do it right.

388
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:33,370
So like the work they're doing outside right now, there's a potential fall hazard still if they could be doing their task on the ground.

389
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:37,780
Right. We're eliminating the fire hazard. Fortunately, they're doing something with the ceiling panels.

390
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,480
I'm not quite sure what they're doing anyway.

391
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,879
And then substitution is replacing the hazard for something less hazardous.

392
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:52,030
So using acrylic or latex based paint instead of lead based paint engineering controls,

393
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:58,270
isolating people from the hazard is like HEPA filtration machine guard barriers.

394
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:08,709
Plexiglass administrative controls is changing the way people work, staggered work shifts, shift rotation policies and procedures.

395
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:17,410
Training falls under this and then PPE like masks, gloves, etc. That's considered the last line of defense and the least effective.

396
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,920
We generally don't like to implement this unless we absolutely have to,

397
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,140
because as the greatest reliance on the person to like put on and take off correctly, right.

398
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:31,480
If this room has air circulation of like six air changes per hour,

399
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:37,690
you're not necessarily actively thinking about that and you don't notice its presence on your physical body.

400
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:43,060
So we try to not have to implement PPE unless we absolutely have to.

401
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,690
Okay, I going backwards. All right. Oh, okay.

402
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:59,389
So don't look ahead. What do you think safety climate is? I'd feel it should be a culture where if at any point you don't know what you're

403
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:02,690
doing or let's say you're working on a device you don't fully understand, it will stop.

404
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:07,790
And you want to be able to stop work if there's a safety hazard and ask questions and

405
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:11,510
there should be a push back and then we should feel free and totally fine to do so.

406
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,230
But oftentimes people feel for many reasons not to do that.

407
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:18,800
Okay, so like this culture where like safety is prioritized.

408
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:27,190
Okay. Other thoughts about what safety of be? I think it depends on who you ask.

409
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:36,190
The big battle is it is is it a uni dimensional construct or a multi dimensional construct?

410
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:47,470
Generally we think about safety climate as defined as the perceptions held by employees about the importance of safety in their organization.

411
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,240
The big thing about safety climate, it is cross sectional.

412
00:43:53,320 --> 00:44:01,900
It is a moment in time. So when you ask people about their perceptions about the importance of safety in their organization,

413
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:07,600
it is for that moment in time that you're asking them. It's not a holistic view.

414
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,080
Okay. Workplace Attributes and Safety Program Features.

415
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:18,850
So what do you think about this? What do you think about the safety climate at the School of Public Health?

416
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:34,140
I guess I asked what in terms of safety that like psychological safety or mechanical, physical safety, physical safety factors ask us.

417
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:39,810
I would say I go in thinking of how we going to move around the school and stuff.

418
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:46,590
I would say it's pretty safe. If there's any hazards or anything, there's a sign or we can see it.

419
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:51,100
I will say that, no, there's no signs in the doors or where they're going in.

420
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:57,870
They're just doing work. And I walk in, I'm like, No, sorry. They're like, the ceiling down and they're in the entryway.

421
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:05,729
So overall, good compared to other colleges or units, we might be depending on what you ask.

422
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:05,940
Right.

423
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:13,709
So if I specifically asked you like what do you think of the safety climate at the School of Public Health versus like where you take your classes?

424
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:19,230
And I say regarding COVID for a really long time, we're the only people left still screening,

425
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:22,320
like responsibly and like requiring masks and stuff like that.

426
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:27,840
Right. But it really depends on like that specific moment in time.

427
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:33,900
So if I were to ask you again this question in a week and maybe they're not doing work out there, that could potentially change.

428
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:43,620
So it expresses poor organizational values about the importance of safety, implied or expressed.

429
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:50,759
What are the safety management practices within this organization and then leading rather than lagging indicator?

430
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:57,030
So lagging indicators are things like fatality rates, injury rates, stuff that's already happened.

431
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:00,629
Whereas leading indicators are like preventative measures,

432
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:05,850
like number of trainings that you've done, like work surveys or improvement that you've done.

433
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:14,490
And a safety climate. Is this somewhat psychological perception of phenomenon because it is so abstract

434
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:17,850
and it's going to be different depending on what you ask for everybody.

435
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:27,990
So again, here is the official definition Zohar created formally created this, you know, construct.

436
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:34,170
But it's maybe easier to think of safety climates as the relative importance of safety.

437
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:42,600
So strictly speaking, individual perceptions about the importance assigned to workplace safety is referred to as psychological climate,

438
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:50,850
and sometimes they distinguish perceived safety climate between the individual level versus what the group feels like it is.

439
00:46:52,470 --> 00:47:03,150
Hmm. So Meta analyzes show that safety climate is one of the strongest predictor of actual safety behaviors and lead in related outcomes.

440
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,870
And most but most research is cross-sectional.

441
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:12,780
Few safety climate studies are actually longitudinal or intervention studies,

442
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:20,850
and most attention regarding safety climate research has been given to defining it and measuring it rather

443
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:29,100
than looking at what the mechanisms are linked to the outcomes in less about safety climate interventions.

444
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,490
So they've just focused a lot on the measurement part.

445
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:42,510
So this is a very basic model where you have the safety climate, what the behavior is and what the outcomes actually are.

446
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:50,460
Antecedents are like precursors to safety climate, which you don't have to worry too much about what that actually means.

447
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,990
But what is it potentially so safety climate.

448
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:03,149
In these like 200 studies, the included on meta analysis have been linked to performance of safe work practices and behaviors, safety,

449
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:12,630
consciousness, accidents, and other safety events, safety related activities, safety, motivation, and also injury and illness.

450
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:22,800
What do you think that safety? Why would you think the group perception of safety climate is like at an Amazon warehouse?

451
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,420
You were probably pretty low. Yeah.

452
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:45,000
I mean, as we're talking about this and thinking about how someone's someone's values and their like previous lived experience regarding safety.

453
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:53,250
So I think their expectations about safety would impact how how they would be perceived.

454
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:58,440
For sure. Definitely. And I will say before.

455
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:08,160
Before we move on to the next step. One huge thing that also impacts safety climate that we have found out is leadership style.

456
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:20,250
Okay. So the biggest, best impact is transformational leadership where it's more democratic and they're able to take feedback from their employees.

457
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:26,070
It's very transparent, open communication. The workers feel like they're heard and they're respected.

458
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:32,670
So just say you work at a job where the person who's like your direct supervisor or the leader of the

459
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:38,520
camp or who you see as the leader of the company is very vocal about how they care about your safety.

460
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:48,060
And they're not only like talking the talk, they're also walking the walk that might make you feel more motivated to comply with safety behaviors.

461
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:56,190
Whereas if your supervisor, you know, does not give a crap about, you know,

462
00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:03,209
whether or not you get a P break in 12 hours or whether or not your arm gets chopped off in a

463
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:08,640
machine because you're just going to be replaced by the next person that feeds into your cynicism,

464
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,440
but that also makes you less likely to comply with safety behaviors.

465
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:18,270
Does that make sense? I'll give you two specific examples.

466
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:25,200
Me? You're up. Maybe you're all too young to remember Frontline on PBS.

467
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:32,120
I don't watch from the time you do. Okay, so it's like a like a YouTube video.

468
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:36,360
Okay. I'm like, well, you know, they're like X, Y, Z type of things.

469
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:40,980
So there was a Frontline documentary looking at 60 Minutes.

470
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:43,800
Yeah, it's like a little 3 minutes type of thing. Yeah.

471
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:54,270
But on PBS and they were looking at these manufacturing companies that manufacture like huge steel pipes and that nothing like this,

472
00:50:54,660 --> 00:51:02,489
like the size of this room, either for oil foundries or for like various like water systems.

473
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:10,380
Right. So there's this company called Wain and they have multiple locations throughout the country.

474
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:16,730
They were super negligent in terms of prioritizing safety.

475
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:21,840
They would lie. They would hire felons, former felons,

476
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:31,890
to pretend to be like the industrial hygienist or occupational safety and health person doing the sampling to like falsify reports.

477
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:42,450
They did a ton of illegal water discharge. Workers would get their arms cut off in machines because they prioritized production over safety.

478
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:45,690
People would die or get crushed in rollers.

479
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:54,990
It was really super egregious and these were happening in the sites that they had like throughout the country in New Jersey, Texas, etc.

480
00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:00,899
But the sad thing about like this dynamic between like occupational environmental

481
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:07,740
health is that less value is placed on a human life than the environment.

482
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:16,650
Now, just because of how defunded and deregulated the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had become.

483
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:25,920
Wait, so you're saying there is more? I mean, it hurts me to hear that like, oh, it's really hard to get a big fine from.

484
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,629
Yeah, it's really hard. It's really easy.

485
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:33,600
You get a good find from EPA because they're really delineated and there's a lot more stuff, but like, it's pretty hard.

486
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:40,860
I mean, like. Yeah. So I actually covered some I worked for the health and safety component of Carlos of Multinational Company

487
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:47,940
and like we saw like the working over and working on planes and stuff and like the most egregious,

488
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:53,310
I mean we, we were pretty good, but like the most egregious behaviors that we could do would land us maybe a $500 fine.

489
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:59,820
And, I mean, like, like you can, you can more from littering and like, you would be hard pressed to really lose much money.

490
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:06,560
Right. So, so, for example, in this documentary, you had a McMahon employee who was doing repairs on a machine.

491
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:12,810
He was alone at night. He was supposed to have an attendant supervising because they cut corners on all kinds of things.

492
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:18,060
He did it alone. They found him the next morning, like crushed to death, stuck inside this conveyor belt.

493
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:23,540
They managed the company managed to argue it down to.

494
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:28,690
A misdemeanor rather than a felony. And the fine was like $8,000.

495
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:38,680
Whereas like, if you go kill an endangered species or you go to like, I don't know,

496
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:43,690
Montana and like kill a bison or something like that, like you're going to get a big fight.

497
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:50,830
Or if you do something like illegal dumping on like Yosemite or something and you get caught,

498
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:56,830
you're going to get a huge fine, probably slapped with, you know, at least five digit, six digits.

499
00:53:56,870 --> 00:54:03,009
Well, what about like compared to like, you know, environmental issues of like illegal dumping at like the corporations and stuff

500
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:07,140
like directly into waterways that we just saw here happen over the summer.

501
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:14,260
So, like, is that even compared to those issues or is it more like the like what your examples are more along the

502
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:21,069
lines of like really I guess sticker prices and making sure we keep America pretty in those areas and stuff.

503
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:27,280
It's just like, what about like areas of just negligence for, you know, proper waste management?

504
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,360
Oh, yeah. There's more, there's more regulations for that as well.

505
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:33,370
I mean, I mean, I think a lot of environments that kind of end up being a slap on the wrist.

506
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:38,499
But I mean, there's. Yeah. And I think that's a much more enforced is environment regulations and OSHA stuff.

507
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:45,400
I mean, there was a study, it was like if every workplaces that get audited by OSHA, it would take like 600 years or something.

508
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:52,359
Yeah, yeah. There's very few OSHA. There's less than 2000 in the United States for the entire private sector.

509
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:58,780
So it's like one ocean inspector for every like 20 million employees.

510
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:06,190
So they tend to focus mostly on like high risk industries like oil, gas, mining, construction, manufacturing.

511
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:10,149
So they don't ever come unless somebody whistle blows.

512
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:15,370
Very few people whistle blower because they're worried about retaliation, but because of the ways,

513
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:22,570
the rights of the of the way OSHA set up and the way that employers do have certain rights as well.

514
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:34,190
If an an ocean inspector can't just like. Be sneaky and like, do that, like secret boss, undercover boss thing.

515
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:37,250
Right. They have to, like, declare that they're there.

516
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:43,580
Show up on the best day. Show up. And they and. And the person in charge can say, you can't come in today.

517
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:47,480
Like, come back another day. Right.

518
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:51,820
So it's like they could be like come back Friday instead.

519
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:58,580
Not today's not good. And then and then they just tell everybody Friday the ocean inspectors coming back like everybody be on their best behavior.

520
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:04,639
There's some funny YouTube videos where there's like a trench collapse happening in the middle where there's like an ocean inspector standing there.

521
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:08,150
He's like, it's not even like a minute later, the trench collapses.

522
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:21,079
But, you know, if they do give them any penalties or anything like that, the employer has up to 15 business days to contest it in court.

523
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:26,540
So that's what the Occupational Safety and Health Regulatory Commission is for.

524
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:30,620
So they look at these cases as well. It's really hard.

525
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:34,759
A big part of it too is just I mean, we have the Food, Water,

526
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,079
Clean Air Act and law that have been updated and stuff, but like OSHA is really contentious.

527
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,030
It hasn't been updated since the Senate did it.

528
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:47,689
And so like my office has really great research, but those new standards take forever or impossible to get enforced into OSHA.

529
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:52,710
So like we can look at our own regulatory agency to get better and protect standards all levels.

530
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:58,760
So Naish is the research branch and they don't have any regulatory power, they just do recommendations.

531
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:03,110
But the recommendations are so much further than what our internal standards.

532
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:06,559
Yes, well, also because of a bipartisanship.

533
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:10,010
So we now hear getting off in a way.

534
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:15,890
But I feel like it's important it's going to be relevant in future lectures. So musculoskeletal disorders will eventually talk about ergonomics,

535
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:21,140
one of the largest costs in the United States, like people like having carpal tunnel.

536
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:25,880
I'm currently having more sleep at night now because I tip so much.

537
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:32,840
But, you know, like lower back pain, back pain, etc. causes a lot, a lot of money.

538
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:38,990
And so there is no regulation for ergonomics at workplaces, period.

539
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:41,959
So they tried to push this through it.

540
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:51,500
It made it got written in 1999 and went to Congress in 2000 and it got slapped down, if you recall, who was in office at that time.

541
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:56,090
Generally, OSHA loses more power when certain parties are in the office,

542
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:07,280
so that ergonomic standard would have required employers to do ergonomic assessment and as a result,

543
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:13,790
change either like the type of processes that they have or change the type of equipment they have, modify it, etc.

544
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,880
Cheryl, you, you'll and we'll give you a better guest lecture on that than I can.

545
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:24,169
That was slapped down. They were trying they now have had an emergency statement regarding heat stress because

546
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:29,240
they can't get a heat standard put out there either despite the climate change,

547
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:35,270
tons of it, simply because they're like the almighty powerful general duty clause.

548
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:42,020
But like because of the repeated getting taken down in the Congress and high public, they're scared to use their full extent of the word.

549
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:46,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And they get rolled back a lot too.

550
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:49,430
So like during the Trump administration, for example,

551
00:58:50,060 --> 00:59:00,469
he allowed like at poultry processing facilities like up to 175 to be processed per like minute or something,

552
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:06,650
which they previously had the cap at like 150 because it was dangerous to the workers in terms

553
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:10,400
of like how fast they were having to move things on the belts and like sharp tools and all that.

554
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,540
Once he was out of office, that was rolled back down to 150.

555
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:21,889
But they it's like this constant like like this role of like the seesaw was also bad for food inspectors.

556
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:30,680
Yes, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So behavioral outcomes, we either have two types of behaviors, compliance behaviors,

557
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:39,320
which is like obeying rules and procedures or contextual behaviors which are like safety, citizenship behaviors, for example, like safe.

558
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:44,540
An example of safety. Citizenship might be like, you know, during a fire evacuation.

559
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:51,650
Like I make sure, like all my peers and colleagues in the area are also like coming coming along with me and not staying behind.

560
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:59,120
The theory behind safety climate is that it originally came from the social exchange theory,

561
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:04,430
which I showed you on Tuesday, that I got confused with the social learning theory.

562
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:14,810
And the social exchange theory posits that there's an obligation for reciprocity when one party acts in a manner that is beneficial to another party.

563
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:21,410
This one here is one of Dr. Smith's papers.

564
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:27,110
He particularly does some work with firefighters in general looking at safety, climate and firefighting.

565
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:34,020
I did. One paper with him, but this in particular was looking at because it's a hazardous occupation.

566
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:43,679
So if you're interested in reading more, they talk about the multi dimensionality of looking at like cohesion supervisor support politics,

567
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:50,430
bureaucracy, hiring and promotion and its impact on safety climate among firefighters.

568
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,180
These are some quotes that came out of this study.

569
01:00:54,780 --> 01:01:00,690
If you don't have strong leadership in which you have faith in and strong leadership that does not lead by example,

570
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:08,579
you're not going to get me to follow you. The second is, if you have an individual leader that really cares about you,

571
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:15,180
you're going to take that extra step and do what's necessary and do what protocols say because it's there for our safety.

572
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:19,470
If you don't get that from the team leader, you're not going to get that extra step.

573
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:25,230
How many of you have been in a like a workplace organization that was kind of like that?

574
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:35,830
Joe. Prior to coming back to school, I was a therapist.

575
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:43,980
I worked in a community mental health organization for not very long place issues,

576
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:58,110
and it was when I was there I had this very significant surgery and was like in my head that was thrown away like a mom was.

577
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:14,670
Everything was in crutches during the winter and my office was in this like outpost building sort of and that.

578
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:19,930
But I had to like come to the main building and get to get clients.

579
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:29,160
But that's why they would check in the waiting room was and like just the the number of.

580
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:34,840
Like a safety hazards that.

581
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:47,960
That I was just like having to navigate multiple times a day, every day and just simply get my clients.

582
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:54,110
I was just like a great person. And and yet.

583
01:02:56,150 --> 01:03:01,180
Like, you know, leadership would pay.

584
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,080
They would either say, like.

585
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:18,020
All of the like, lovely things about how much they love and care about you and really want a safe and supportive culture in the workplace.

586
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:32,090
Or that like when I would be like you or me voicing like a specific issue, then there's nothing that they can do about it.

587
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:39,080
It's just. Yeah. Yeah. And just.

588
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:52,290
It tells you a lot really quickly about. What we know, what the leadership value is, and how much you value.

589
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:58,250
Mm hmm. Um. And, uh. Yeah.

590
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:04,930
I think the knowledge of how much you're valued makes it. Makes it easy to.

591
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:14,540
Trying to determine how much you then value my position.

592
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:18,740
Yeah. Thank you for sharing. That makes perfect example.

593
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:33,170
Back to the McQueen Steel example. There was a neighboring company there called American Steel and they were like the total opposite.

594
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:37,610
Super low turnover. Super low injury rates.

595
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:43,639
Same town, right? Same same industry.

596
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:46,790
But once somebody got a job there, they had a job for life.

597
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:52,190
They kept that job. And only because they paid the workers well, but they prioritized safety over production.

598
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:56,860
So, you know, like these workstations in the factory are hot.

599
01:04:56,870 --> 01:05:02,059
They had, like, installed individual cooling stations for the workers, and there was issue with the machine.

600
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:06,650
They would shut down production completely until that issue was resolved.

601
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:14,240
And what they found was that the McGuane used to be vice president for this company,

602
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:20,420
and this company started allowing workers to buy shares in the company,

603
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:27,500
kind of like the Green Bay Packers is like a commune or like a co-op type of thing.

604
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:34,550
And McGuane hated that. He's like, I want all the money to myself.

605
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:40,040
So then he went off to make this steel company. And then that's. That's a very interesting Frontline documentary.

606
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:48,530
Yeah, well, yeah, the the guy who's the secretary of labor, Bob, he's an alumni of the H program.

607
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:52,100
So we met him in Nashville. He was at the reception.

608
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:57,530
You? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I was like, Oh, my God, I feel like I'm meeting a celebrity.

609
01:05:57,550 --> 01:06:03,680
But he was the department of he was the Department of Labor secretary in the Bush administration.

610
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:07,040
But now he lives in Florida and is consulting.

611
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:12,560
It's kind of he's mostly retired. So the difference between safety,

612
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:20,750
culture and climate is that starting with the climate shared perceptions among members of an organization

613
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:27,079
concerning workplace safety like is that this is a moment in time where safety culture are the values,

614
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:31,819
norms and belief that a particular people share with respect to group in safety.

615
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:37,459
And this is a time bound necessarily organizational culture are the values, norms,

616
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:44,870
beliefs that an organization members come to share through direct experience, social interactions, symbolic meetings,

617
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:52,489
stories, etc. So if you'll notice, like the organizational culture that is part of like a union,

618
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:58,010
for example, like the United Auto Workers is very different than employees that may not be unionized.

619
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:05,400
Here we go. So safety climate again, a moment in time.

620
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,520
We're just kind of taking the temperature of what things are.

621
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:13,950
We're a safety culture. We're kind of looking at everything in confluence with one another.

622
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:19,620
Climate is a surface manifestation of culture.

623
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:23,790
And climate is more perceptual, situational and immediate.

624
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:28,080
And climate is more accessible. We have quantitative methods.

625
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:35,310
So that's why people are trying to measure climate more than the project, because safety culture is really difficult to measure.

626
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:40,620
So safety, climate parameters, in terms of your measurements,

627
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:45,120
you want to look at the strength of the measures, the levels of the measures and consistency.

628
01:07:45,810 --> 01:07:53,280
You kind of have to you can do individual level measures and you can do group level measures to try to keep the constructs together.

629
01:07:53,460 --> 01:08:01,980
Don't go like all over the place with them where it's like if you're asking about something, make sure that it's all within the same level.

630
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:06,780
Right. So within unit homogeneity.

631
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:15,389
So why is this important? If there is a lack of homogeneity, then there is no real climate.

632
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:23,610
So just say you have a really big manufacturing facility where you have people who are welders

633
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:30,479
and then you have people who do some stapling and then you have people who do some painting in.

634
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:31,920
When I was working in Indiana,

635
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:43,889
I had a chance to visit this manufacturing company that makes athletic products so they make the most basketball t stands in the United States.

636
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:50,370
You know, the the T stands for basketballs. And they also make a lot of like padding material that's on gyms where it's like when,

637
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:53,190
you know, you run against the wall, you know, like pressure glasses.

638
01:08:54,450 --> 01:09:03,360
So they had people who were like stapling batting in one area, people who are welding in another area, people who are in spray booths in another area.

639
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:10,529
So when you're looking at safety climate, it would make sense for you to look through it.

640
01:09:10,530 --> 01:09:12,120
A homogeneous unit, right?

641
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:17,849
So you would like look at safety climate among people who are doing the stapling versus people who are doing like the painting.

642
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:27,510
Right. A weaker climate means you expect a weaker behavior outcome, and a weaker climate also means less continuity over time.

643
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:37,560
Strong climate is not always a good thing though, okay, because it could go either direction.

644
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:44,489
So climate consistency is the perceptions across multiple organizational levels,

645
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:49,200
like senior management, middle management, first line supervisors, front lines employees.

646
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:59,760
Whereas when you have inconsistencies between it increases the likelihood between discrepancies in formal versus enacted policies and practices.

647
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:06,030
Let's take. Yes, Bridget. Oh, I don't know. Oh, you didn't have an office?

648
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:13,770
Yeah. Okay, let's take, for example, let's just say we're not talking about city climate, which is something like climate in general.

649
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,410
One thing that they love to measure the climate here is diversity, equity and inclusion.

650
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:29,429
Let's get spicy in our conversation. So if you ask senior management, what do you think the climate of DTI is like?

651
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:30,660
What do you think they're going to say?

652
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:39,600
All of the boilerplate school language they're feeling, they might say they're making more to feel like their messaging.

653
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:49,890
Yeah. Yeah. What if you ask somebody like me but you have a heartache, you probably have more real experiences.

654
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:55,230
What about what are how do the students feel? It depends who you ask.

655
01:10:56,100 --> 01:11:00,540
I think it definitely differs between grad students and undergrads. Definitely. How how is how so?

656
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,980
Well, I don't really go to like parties and stuff. Oh.

657
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:12,900
Oh, they hang out or. Okay. I mean, I haven't been an undergrad in Michigan, not necessarily here.

658
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:18,730
I know there's a big problem. I and I grew up in the area, but I mean, there's very much kind of entitled rich white kids.

659
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:25,650
It's kind of a big dynamic, which they're generally not really known for being very, like, cool with diversity.

660
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:29,909
Sure. Sure. I mean, you know, among peer to peer is right.

661
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:37,150
But just see, we're looking at the school in general like what are your perceptions of the school in terms of diversity, equity and inclusion like?

662
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:40,350
Are we doing it or doing it?

663
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,480
It's a big push. It is a you know, there's a lot of talk.

664
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:48,300
I know SPG has a requirement. We have to do our own trainings for it.

665
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:58,380
Um, but then looking around, I mean, even myself as a white person, I see a lot of white people and not much diversity.

666
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:05,580
Um, and then I think that even goes even more when you go into, you know, people in charge and stuff.

667
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:08,670
But even students themselves, it's not really parents.

668
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:17,700
Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. So, like, if you were to ask, like, senior management, for example, they would say, like, we're doing great, we're making strides.

669
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:23,690
Look at all these like more black and brown students we've admitted and so and so and that, etc.

670
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:29,620
Right? They're like, Yeah, we're doing great. But if you ask, someone like me slaps her.

671
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:35,370
And in fact, I'd rather I'm a I'm on a personal stance. Maybe it's because I'm from California.

672
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:39,540
Don't tolerate if you're not going to do it. Okay.

673
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:45,540
I'd rather just have you say nothing at all. Right. Because I feel like the bigger you are, the further you have to fall.

674
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:50,009
So the bigger the statements that you make, if you're not accomplishing that,

675
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:55,620
like maybe you're moving some people, but a lot of people are not fooled.

676
01:12:56,550 --> 01:13:02,730
So that's where you can lead to inconsistencies and where you look at the discrepancies between like what

677
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:09,990
was considered like a formally enacted policy or procedure or statement versus what is actually practiced.

678
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:16,260
Like, who are we actually like admitting to the school who are actually hiring to work at the school?

679
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:19,919
Who actually is staying at the school? Right.

680
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:25,970
So that's just an example of that. And you have many more hot takes, but not a record.

681
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:35,420
And we can talk about why. So indicators of a positive safety, climate demonstrated commitment and leadership of senior managers.

682
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:38,640
This is so, so important.

683
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:45,390
Acceptance among managers at all levels that occupational safety and health is a line management responsibility.

684
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:50,910
What does this mean? Of course, the person who's, like, sitting in their desk is in the CEO.

685
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:54,300
They have to care about safety. Right, because they're like the face of the company.

686
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:59,010
But the line managers are like the supervisors in charge of the individual units.

687
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:07,679
They are essentially the the the the the main conduit to convey these occupational safety and health practices.

688
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:12,630
So if they're not, you know, enacting it, it's definitely not going to happen.

689
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,310
Participation, health and safety decisions by personnel at all levels.

690
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:24,930
So now it's more common now where you see workplaces have like safety and health committees where different workers volunteer to be part of it,

691
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:32,940
training to promote competencies and then shared perceptions of the nature of the hazards, magnitudes of the risks, practicality, etc.

692
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:42,969
Okay, so these are the different dimensions. According.

693
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:47,710
So depending on who that you talk to, you, they'll use different products to measure safety climate.

694
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:52,360
So Flynn and colleagues, these are the constructs that they use to measure safety climate.

695
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,880
Interestingly, work pressure is there.

696
01:14:55,630 --> 01:15:02,320
Whereas if you're looking at Neil and Griffin and how they define and use what constructs they use to measure safety climate,

697
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:10,390
they also have work pressure in there, but they also have a risk, for example, perceived individual risk, but also human resources practices.

698
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:18,340
And I recommends a lot of sense because as you've been talking about this, I've been thinking it like, okay, cool.

699
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:22,930
But like, how how do you, like, make people actually care?

700
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:29,870
Mm hmm. And the week, you know, you mention you can you can you can influence that.

701
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:39,190
Like the line workers care when the people in charge are walking a lot and talking the talk.

702
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:44,260
But what if that's not happening and.

703
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:50,069
Like. It just feels so much more complex.

704
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:55,240
But when you add in race that.

705
01:15:56,240 --> 01:16:05,780
That, like, brings in a person's perception and their own susceptibility.

706
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:13,940
Yes. Yes. Thank you. Like, I think it's either today or yesterday was one of the largest nursing strikes.

707
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:22,940
Was it Minnesota? Yeah. Where? It's like 100,000 nurses watching, not only for better pay, but also for better working conditions,

708
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:28,309
because they felt like throughout the COVID 19 pandemic, their safety and health absolutely was not prioritized.

709
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:31,720
We had a strike here. Michigan medicine because of that. Yeah.

710
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:36,310
Yeah. Huge one. Eastern Michigan, too. Oh, yeah, yeah.

711
01:16:36,450 --> 01:16:40,430
Yeah. The provider. Yeah, yeah. For the the the faculty, even.

712
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:47,180
Yeah. So with the collecting and assessing the safety climate, there's a couple of ways to do this.

713
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:51,980
First, you can use generic assessment tools that are available that other people have created,

714
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:57,290
or you can use detailed, multi-dimensional custom built tools, or there's multi approach methods.

715
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:01,850
The best way is to quickly administer a survey like we talked about.

716
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:08,030
The Naish Brief Safety Climate Scale is like a nice, easy six questions.

717
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:15,790
Wham, bam. Okay, we did it. But you'll notice for each construct there's only one item, right?

718
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:21,380
Whereas we talked about you ideally want to have like 3 to 4, but you have to think about respondent burden.

719
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:27,830
This is a very burdensome because some safety climate assessments are like 50 questions, right.

720
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:35,780
Hot and Murphy they have a 1414 samples of the six item measure CHROMEBOX Alpha 0.72.9.

721
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:41,570
So pretty good. Then those, uh,

722
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:49,640
Dr. Smith adapted these six items to the fire service and in his paper he got a Chromebooks of 0.78 pretty good

723
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:56,300
significantly associated compliance behaviors and safety citizenship participation behaviors with the climate.

724
01:17:57,410 --> 01:18:08,120
Um. You can also do focus groups and interviews, but you can also do direct or indirect observations as well.

725
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:13,940
Or you can supplement these more qualitative methods with survey administration.

726
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:19,910
But the important reasons for administering climate surveys.

727
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:22,880
Senior management needs to communicate why they're doing it,

728
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:27,740
how it fits with their broader safety and health efforts, what will be done with the results?

729
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:32,389
That's one of your things I mentioned on the rubric, right? Like, why are you even taking this in the first place?

730
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:36,740
You should have a purpose on there for them and how the result should be communicated.

731
01:18:43,290 --> 01:18:47,050
That's. Okay.

732
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:53,770
I'm going to stop here with this piece of magic, too.

733
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:58,510
I know. I don't think we have that available to us on our phones. Honestly.
