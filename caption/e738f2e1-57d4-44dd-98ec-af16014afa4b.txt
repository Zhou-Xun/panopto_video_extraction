1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:16,430
Yes. Yes, I agree. Something tells me about what is happening here, what's going to produce.

2
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,640
Some might try to stop New Orleans east.

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,400
The not present different things than what you said.

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,050
It wasn't that it's here for a while.

5
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:41,150
I think to a certain extent, I don't know whether it's.

6
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,310
You can. Okay.

7
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,920
All right, everyone hear me? Yes. Good. Okay. Good afternoon.

8
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,480
How is everybody? How was our week so far today?

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:06,310
Are we going on? As long as long as the weather is supposed to change tomorrow.

10
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:12,950
We're supposed to have a lot of older airs. And things must be good for us.

11
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:19,750
Really? It. Really for us. I think you was holding questions on our first assignment.

12
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,890
I know I took the last 324, but just anything that anyone has.

13
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,420
Yeah, I just wanted to clarify one more time. Mine only has dates.

14
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,950
The latest date is 2019, so that's still acceptable. There's five years, but like 2019 is acceptable.

15
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:39,370
So it is okay. I would say to everybody, if you if you want to go that route, it's okay.

16
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,859
Just know that your picture of what's going on is going to require you to probably talk

17
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,630
about where their adaptations to COVID took place and what was going on with them.

18
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:57,040
Because you won't have 990 data to be able to really speak to that, so you'll have to try and contextualize it in other ways.

19
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,669
So I don't know if they have other public reporting that they made available like annual reports or audited financial

20
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:08,830
statements and a couple of usually that you would found audited financial statements for your organizations.

21
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,160
Those are fine. I mean, those are not in in in a lot of ways those are actually easier to read than the 990 sometimes.

22
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,280
Um, so, but, but again,

23
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,759
we're going to talk about those quite a bit throughout the rest of the term because there's a large disparity between large and small

24
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:34,450
organizations in terms of smaller organizations ability to afford to hire an accounting firm conducting audited financial return.

25
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,389
And what that means for their ability to access grant funding and kind of who gets to have access to what resources.

26
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:46,340
But that's another story for different mark so on that so if my or position did

27
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,950
does have both ninety's and the fully audited so should we still just focus

28
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:57,069
on the nine ideas for this task focus on the 1980s use the the audited returns

29
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,969
is another way to kind of fill in the blanks so where you may not need to go.

30
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,060
So for those of you who don't have, for example, did an initial statement to rely on,

31
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,020
you might have to look more at their annual reports, more their Web resources,

32
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,680
more, you know, what other types of public reporting for those of you who do have the audit

33
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,849
financial statements that may help you to to have to do less features there.

34
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,249
But again, you'll be responsible to read through all that.

35
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,200
So I don't want it to be that, you know, those of you who have an organization that has audited financial statements,

36
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,670
some other less work, it's just about where you distribute the work on the assignment.

37
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,089
So it's either, you know, reading the detailed financials if it's available or reading the nine nineties and then kind of going

38
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:42,300
through a more detailed review of the organization's other reporting mechanisms that make sense out of.

39
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:55,780
Our feeling about this assignment. And as the semester going by, everyone, workload wise, it's heavy to look it up.

40
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:03,290
Yeah. So I am giving some thought to the concept that the week of the four starts,

41
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:12,060
the week of the four that we might not have class and instead give you a work day, asynchronous work day to work on finishing this assignment.

42
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:19,190
How we feel about that. I put a bracket in it.

43
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,920
You may have noticed that there was no there were no presentations or current events that day.

44
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,330
I wanted to see sort of what the semester was going to shape up to be.

45
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:36,830
If we're if we're amenable to that, then maybe we'll maybe we'll proceed with that idea to give you some time and work through your assignment.

46
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,760
And perhaps that will help you to make sure that the quality is a little better.

47
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:47,360
So I'm not going to change the deadline deadlines to October or midnight as is there will not be an extension on the assignment,

48
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:59,660
but perhaps that will give you a little bit more space to work through it and just kind of like get it done and have a little bit of space to do that.

49
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,290
Since we're heading into midterms with we only need once a week.

50
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,100
So thank you. My pleasure.

51
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,090
My pleasure. What do I do? What I can do? Okay.

52
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,530
All right. Other questions on that one. How do we with our trustees are like those salaried employees?

53
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,870
Are they going to do that again?

54
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,540
How do we know, like what their salaries are for the board of trustees, meaning if they're volunteers or if they are getting paid?

55
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:32,870
So you look at the 919 on the page of the 990, you don't see any compensation for the board members.

56
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,320
Usually that means they're volunteers. And if they see, that means they think if you see compensation.

57
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,460
So if a board member is compensated, that's not it's not out of the realm of possibility.

58
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:49,220
But you have to be careful when you're reading that statement of the board that you're careful to see what is their role.

59
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:55,250
Sometimes organizations report their staff on their because their staff serve as exceptional members of the board,

60
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:01,550
meaning they may or may not have a voting power in terms of the governance, but they're still listed there.

61
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,930
So just read what their title is. If you see, for example, the title is the president.

62
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:15,079
Usually that's the president of the board. If you see that in CEO, usually that's the CBO, but sometimes they may refer to the CEO as president.

63
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,600
So that's where you would go to the website of the organization and look, you'll find it very easily on the organization's website.

64
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,060
It'll list board of directors and staff and then you'll be able to talk to.

65
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,630
And that should give you a clear sense of what their thoughts. I don't know.

66
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,750
For every organization that you'll be successful in finding the exact compensation that they receive.

67
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:41,680
So what I expect you to do is sort of look across what you can find in total compensation number.

68
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,309
Sometimes they'll report it. Sometimes they'll be a schedule or an addendum in the 1990 where they'll have to

69
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,980
report how much the salaries are for the staff people or for the major C-suite folks,

70
00:06:51,980 --> 00:07:01,610
the CEO, CFO, etc. So, you know, like in nine in the 1990, that is like salaries and other compensation, employee benefits.

71
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:08,090
But how do we know if their board members are getting this or the people who are working are getting.

72
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:18,700
So you have to look at the name of the person who was listed there. So are you on the page where it lists the name of the individuals on 990, 990.

73
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:25,100
So here in this. So on the 1990, what you'll find is.

74
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,970
Oh, my. She's.

75
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,130
Like the name and size and average function.

76
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:02,730
So on this page here, okay, here, this is schedule part seven of the first sort of summary.

77
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:10,890
You'll see each of the people are listed. So Susan, you're executive director, likely the CEO of the organization.

78
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,550
Here you can see she has reportable compensation of $4,779 0 hours.

79
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,240
It's possible she was there for part of the year and maybe she left or, you know, what have you.

80
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:27,180
But note how as I go down the list, here they are, all the board members and there are no compensation figures for them.

81
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,830
So that's how you can start to tell and you'll see they label them so.

82
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,460
Treasurer, that's not. Treasurer is not the CFO.

83
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,690
Treasurer is likely a board member who is serving as the Treasurer on the board.

84
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,290
Their responsibility is to oversee the governance of the finances.

85
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:50,790
But the CFO of the organization, that's the staff position responsible for actually making the day to day financial decisions.

86
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,930
So the Treasurer will provide oversight over the CFO to.

87
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,340
And Director. So see, here's an example.

88
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,379
Executive Director President The President means president of the board.

89
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:11,070
You're executive director, the CEO and all these people here listed director, director, director, vice president.

90
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:18,770
We'd have to check their website. Look, you know, is this person the vice president of the board or are they a vice president inside the organization?

91
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,000
Sometimes they'll call the staff people by those names. So today we're going to talk about philanthropy.

92
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,050
So we're I talked about previously the chief development officer.

93
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,330
Sometimes they're referred to that staff person is referred to as the vice president for

94
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:38,400
development or the vice president for advancement or the vice president for philanthropy.

95
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,050
Even though it says vice president, they're not on the board. There's still a staff person.

96
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:52,560
So usually what's clear, though, between these positions is if you're on staff, you're not on the board and you can't be both.

97
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,019
You'll see them sit on the board.

98
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,520
But typically there'll be an asterisk or something that says ex-officio that they don't have voting rights on the board.

99
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:06,420
Sometimes in their bylaws of these organizations, you may find that staff can't vote as part of the board.

100
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:14,129
Sometimes the founder of an organization may serve as the CEO, and then they also serve as a board member because they started it.

101
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,830
And so the organization's bylaws wrote that end.

102
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:25,350
But it's rare, probably more common for smaller organizations where they're newer and they don't have as many people that are sort of a degree.

103
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,250
Know. So this will have to compare with the on the website.

104
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:39,900
They have this separate page where they ignore everything, who are are board members and they just campaign and see who is correct.

105
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,360
So if I go to affirmations, let's say to.

106
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,120
I grew up here and usually I go to about zero hour.

107
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,549
Okay. You're all Gordon. They are. It tells me who they are.

108
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,870
See here, we know Donnie is the Treasurer. Lately, the board has changed.

109
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,620
It's. It's not uncommon that it'll turn turnover over time.

110
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:08,380
So you're all the board members that when I go up here to about. I go to our staff.

111
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:09,880
Your staff.

112
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:23,110
Exactly in Germany, all these folks and you can see here, deputy director of development, director of finance, that's equivalent to the CFO.

113
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,250
Excuse me. It kind of goes on and on. Okay.

114
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,080
Okay. All right. Other questions?

115
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,360
Anything else? Okay.

116
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:56,990
All right. So. What we'll do today is talk through the fundraising and development part of our content.

117
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,700
I'll go through that. With us together are the lectures that we're going through.

118
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,590
I try to keep them limited, so it's not a lot of me talking.

119
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,730
Is that helpful content wise, kind of get the context for getting good information out of that.

120
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,600
That's good. Okay, that's fine. So I'll continue with that.

121
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,560
I have a mini case that I put together for today that I want to take us through.

122
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,050
So we'll practice a little bit about fundraising and development.

123
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:28,610
It's a very important part of nonprofit organizations that feature very distinct from what you'll find inside of a for profit corporation.

124
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:39,170
So fundraising and development being really the revenue generating part of the organization, but very much distinct to a nonprofit.

125
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:46,040
You won't find a fundraising and development department inside of a for profit corporation, whereas you might find some of the other departments,

126
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:54,770
like the Human Resources Department, the Technology Office, you know, all of those departments you may find in a for profit corporation.

127
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,970
But fundraising development is distinct to nonprofits. Will the current events on break?

128
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:08,320
We'll jump to our case next week. Remember next week, September 27 or two seven, be out there on Zoom.

129
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,629
Okay. So next week we're on Zoom will meet for our full time.

130
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:20,860
We have presentations scheduled for that day. So I'm going to expect those of you who are queued up for that date will be ready to go.

131
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,550
I'll send out the zoom link I posted on the campus site. You have it.

132
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,040
We'll run our class that way.

133
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:36,520
And during class we're going to be working through an exercise that is specifically tied to this article and the readings.

134
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,579
So I want to just remind you to please make sure you read this.

135
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:45,250
In addition to reading the case, be sure to read this article so that you're prepared to engage in the exercise,

136
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:53,319
and next week's session will be really all about mismanagement and ethics and thinking about some of the policies in place,

137
00:13:53,320 --> 00:14:02,650
governmental policies in place designed to protect against inappropriate behavior, inappropriate conduct inside of nonprofits specifically.

138
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,760
All right. So philanthropy, how many of you have been involved in any way in philanthropy?

139
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,300
Raise your hand. What were your involvements with?

140
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,730
What part of it? I think you raise your hand.

141
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:27,250
Yeah. So I was a part of the sorority, and they had a philanthropy, just like fighting against domestic violence and abuse awareness.

142
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,290
So we did a bunch of different plans. We had an accident for society.

143
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,989
So was like a week full of philanthropy events like bringing awareness.

144
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:40,290
And then we had to do like an Oxford fundraiser for to give to our organization that we represent.

145
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,290
Excellent. And did you did you did the money go back into the sorority?

146
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,650
No, not for the any of the money that we raised during that week.

147
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,760
Okay. So it went to other nonprofits. Yeah. So like the nonprofit,

148
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,330
there is this one nonprofit that just raised money to provide resources specifically for

149
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:03,220
South Asian women that were domestically abused to kind of help them get back on their feet.

150
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,840
Thank you for sharing that other half. I thought you had your hand up.

151
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:14,560
Yeah, I worked for several nonprofits across fundraising departments and project management.

152
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,910
Okay, great. And Genevieve. Right, I.

153
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,200
I'm getting all my animals there, everybody. I've got pretty much got it done.

154
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,809
I worked for a nonprofit that was very small.

155
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:37,990
And although it was not in my initial final fundraising, organizing or early tender, you know, that, oh, program of it.

156
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:43,840
So I work with some nonprofits back in Indiana and we put in like some stuff over the

157
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,630
Atlantic providing free hotel and then also like organizing coalition drives and things,

158
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:58,209
meetings like school clinics, stuff and you know, not really crashing and stuff like that can be done.

159
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:04,030
Like certain plantation drives we've done like waste management drives and like child education place.

160
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:08,589
Okay, great. All right. Well, thank you all for sharing those.

161
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:16,570
The reason I wanted you to share is because you you can hear how some of you've been exposed to this in terms of the activities.

162
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:21,020
But I want to share with you today is more about kind of the business of how this works.

163
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,120
So how does philanthropy work inside of an organization? What is it designed to do?

164
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:32,770
You know, what what is it all about from a purely kind of transactional perspective?

165
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:41,740
So we'll talk about the mechanics behind it, who's involved in it, and how organizations make strategic decisions associated with philanthropy.

166
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,040
So we have this this this concept that we that we think about as as corporate philanthropy.

167
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,250
And sometimes you'll hear the term corporate social responsibility.

168
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,620
Usually that's in a for profit company or there's a corporate social responsibility department that's

169
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:02,790
maybe responsible for thinking about how that corporation does something that is designed to give back.

170
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:08,060
So you might have the CSR department at Microsoft or the CSR Department at Apple

171
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:13,610
distinct from whether or not that company has a foundation or a nonprofit arm.

172
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:23,990
So Ford Motor Company, for example, is a corporation manufactures automobiles, but they have a Ford Motor Company fund separate from the corporation.

173
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:29,690
The profits of the corporation go into the fund. They flow into the fund and fund.

174
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,850
No, it's a double double there. They they finance better.

175
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,940
They finance the funds ability to deliver services or make brands.

176
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:48,640
So you'll hear that term. I just want to make that clear. You'll also hear the term prospect.

177
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:56,830
And what prospect is usually referring to in philanthropy is people who are aiming to solicit gifts from.

178
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:06,430
So I may think to myself as the director of development for an organization I live, my organization is located in Albuquerque.

179
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:15,130
So I'm going to look down the list at all of the people who perhaps have been interested in giving or maybe they have a company locally,

180
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:19,480
or maybe they have some reason why they should give to my organization.

181
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:25,269
And they are going to be considered my list of prospects and my cultivation of them is going

182
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:31,930
to be my approach to helping to find a way to ask them to make a gift to my organization.

183
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:38,319
Once I'm done cultivating those prospects, I then move on to what we call solicitation.

184
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:46,570
So I'm soliciting gifts. So the solicitation process is really all about is all about going through and

185
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:52,300
thinking about how I'm going to get those donors who I am interested in contributing.

186
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:58,540
I'm going to get them to now make the gift. So sometimes we'll see that this happens on social media.

187
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,440
You'll see that, you know, the organization might put out a post or say, hey,

188
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,180
we're going to run, you know, a GoFundMe campaign or, you know, some way to get people together.

189
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:18,820
Or it's a very personal outreach process where the development officers or managers are working one at a time to go engage in donor stewardship,

190
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:26,170
which I'll talk about here in a moment, but stewardship specifically as it relates to the relationships that they're building.

191
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:34,840
So the stewardship of donors is what is involved in cultivating prospects and forming relationships.

192
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:41,200
We'll also talk about today a little bit about donor recognition, which is another piece of this that that organizations are.

193
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,120
Okay. So a little bit about where philanthropy has been.

194
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:53,929
So in the eighties, 1980s, fundraising was growing through the rise of community foundations.

195
00:19:53,930 --> 00:20:00,610
Corporate foundations like the Ford Motor Company Fund is an example of one and then increases in individual and family foundations.

196
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:06,499
A lot of people found ways to take funds out of their estate and start family foundations

197
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,550
or start a way to sort of organize those assets and then start to give them away.

198
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:21,290
Or they acted by placing those funds in the trust of another nonprofit, which was acting as a fiduciary.

199
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:30,770
And that is where we find sometimes one organization is going to oversee the operations of another and you'll have it kind of rolled up together.

200
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,670
So that's what the term fiduciary means and we'll talk about that quite a bit.

201
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:40,850
But the idea here is that philanthropic fundraising of the 80 started and it

202
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:45,169
kind of grew through the nineties and 2000 into a process of corporate giving,

203
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,730
becoming professionalized.

204
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:53,810
So it was no longer just about, okay, I'm going to put away money or I'm going to kind of just sort of very informally give it away.

205
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:59,030
It became a very, very professionalized process with norms and standards.

206
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:06,379
Remember back to our discussion of organizational theory in our first or second week of our course, I talked about some of those memetic pressures,

207
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,540
this idea that organizations looked at kind of copy in order to sort of do what the other is doing.

208
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:18,470
And so organizations started to grow their philanthropic offices to really create a business around this process.

209
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,070
Now nonprofits are also increasingly dependent on government funding.

210
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,140
And so I want to just draw the distinction that very often the Philanthropy

211
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:35,450
Department may or may not be working on the government funding part of this.

212
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:42,440
So donor stewardship is very often about the private cultivation of donors, meaning individuals, businesses,

213
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:48,740
foundations, but not necessarily the same people who are working on applying for government money.

214
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:56,110
Okay. What is the benefit then of this type of funding?

215
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:04,330
Well, sometimes we can see that funding can come in the form of an annual or a multi-year grant.

216
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:13,900
Sometimes we see that philanthropic donations may be more flexible and they will carry less overhead than government contracts.

217
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:22,660
So, for example, if the local trucking company that exists in my town is willing to give me a grant for $150,000,

218
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:29,050
or to make a gift to my organization $450,000, they may say, okay, I'm going to give you this gift.

219
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,430
It's $150,000. It is here restricted.

220
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:42,640
Restricted to be used for your program to deliver mental health services to children ages 6 to 9.

221
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,460
That's all you can use it for. Right.

222
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:51,410
Government grant maybe the state has a post up for a government grant.

223
00:22:51,410 --> 00:23:01,219
$150,000 restricted to use for programs for children ages 6 to 9 that meet these 18 qualifications,

224
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:06,080
that have these provisions that are required, that must be reported a certain way.

225
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:15,230
So you can see where government funding sometimes can carry a lot more requirements, where it may be serving the same population.

226
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,790
So organizations have to make decisions very often on which one to choose.

227
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,580
Do they pursue a government grant? Maybe it has a little more money, but comes with more reporting responsibility.

228
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:31,900
Maybe it's a little less money from a private philanthropist, but comes with a little bit more flexibility of what they can use it for.

229
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:37,720
So they make those decisions. Now they're soliciting funding for specific initiatives.

230
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:44,880
Typically, you'll rarely hear that a philanthropy officer's strategy is to just solicit money for operations.

231
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,710
This is where the government is sometimes more useful in terms of philanthropic giving.

232
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:57,570
So if I'm looking to raise revenue in my organization for staff coverage, general operations staff coverage,

233
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:06,899
I may be looking for grants because I may not find a foundation or a family or an individual who's willing to just write a check or make a gift for,

234
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,440
you know, general operations. Typically, someone wants to make a gift.

235
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,100
They want to see that it's going toward a particular part of the organization.

236
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:19,440
Now, in practice, that does not mean and I want to draw this distinction that the philanthropist

237
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,760
comes in and basically starts directing every single thing that happens.

238
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:29,910
In fact, that's part of being an effective philanthropy manager or director of development,

239
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:37,290
is to manage expectations from your funders, to say, you know, we're going to take your gift, here's what we're going to do with it.

240
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,880
But, you know, to help them to have buy in, help them to feel part of the process,

241
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:47,850
but not turn that philanthropist into now a new staff member that's sort of overseeing everything that's happening.

242
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:57,280
Foundation funding is usually somewhere in the middle, so an individual donor might make a gift.

243
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,970
Let's go back to our example. Children, 6 to 9, that trucking company.

244
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,379
Okay, we're going to give a gift for $150,000. The government may set up many,

245
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:12,880
many qualifications that you have to sort of fit and reporting the foundation might sit somewhere in the middle, will make the gift 6 to 9.

246
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,030
You know, you have to report in every quarter on your progress.

247
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,420
You know, you have to pass a certain means test in order to do this.

248
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:25,750
This is where the audited financial returns come in. You know, you're required to have an audited financial statement to qualify.

249
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,820
You're required to have certain accounting principles on hand, etc.

250
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,630
But this is distinct from individual philanthropic dollars.

251
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:41,179
But the two of them together are designed to really help balance what the long term

252
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:46,910
funding mechanism is with what we commonly see inside of nonprofit organizations,

253
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:50,570
which is the short term volatility in cash reserves.

254
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,860
So what does that mean?

255
00:25:53,510 --> 00:26:02,750
Organizations and you're going to see this in your ninety's typically need to carry some type of cash flow in order to make their bills.

256
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,750
They have liabilities that sit on their balance sheets. They have responsibilities.

257
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:13,420
They've got payments to real estate. They've got payments to employees.

258
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,840
They have equipment that they may lease.

259
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:20,829
All these things are liabilities they may have to carry and they have to think about, okay,

260
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,889
how am I going to make sure that I have enough cash on hand and have cash flow

261
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:27,850
going through the organization that I'm able to juggle the various priorities?

262
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:37,430
So a key distinction then that we need to think about is the concept of charity versus philanthropy.

263
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:44,419
So charity traditionally has been used to describe the types of voluntary

264
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:52,430
giving that are that are predicated on gifts for immediate or short run needs.

265
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:57,590
So when we think about philanthropy, in contrast,

266
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:05,510
we're thinking about this as giving that strengthening and infrastructure gifts that are designed to help develop the institution.

267
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:11,300
Are we serving the needs or enhancing the development of those people?

268
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,290
The organization is serving two distinct concepts.

269
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,990
So you'll often hear people say, you know, that's just charity, or I just gave that away.

270
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,320
It's a distinct concept, though, from philanthropy in the sense that there's usually a strategy around that.

271
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:32,960
And that, again, I want to be clear, as I've said it in the last few weeks, that does not mean one is right or wrong.

272
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:40,490
I just want to make sure you hear sort of the two terms and kind of know what people are usually meaning when they're in the nonprofit landscape,

273
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:52,330
when they're utilizing those terms. We have also seen in recent years venture philanthropy, strategic philanthropy and some of these others,

274
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:57,510
other formats where donors are seeking to achieve one goal.

275
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:05,080
And they have an organizational structure around how they're going to look for ways to make progress on that goal.

276
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:12,190
So the Gates Foundation, for example, they have a very, very strategic philanthropic strategy.

277
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,500
They have a very a process excuse me.

278
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:23,470
They have a very strategic set of rules that they've established in order to make good on the philanthropic contributions they're making.

279
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:30,670
But that doesn't mean that a family foundation or even an individual doesn't have a specific area that they're working on.

280
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,239
And so very often you'll hear an organization, sometimes large ones, that you might expect, oh, will they rely on government funding?

281
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,160
Or they get funding from a corporation?

282
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:51,520
They may have somebody who comes to them and says, you know, my family member had a particular disease or illness that your organization serves.

283
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:56,680
And it was very impactful in my life and in the life of my family.

284
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:03,729
I've I've done well in my work, and I'd like to make a sizable contribution to you in order to implement this

285
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:08,000
particular program that directly connects to what it is that I experience.

286
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,540
So you can hear that that philanthropist has a strategy.

287
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:16,230
It's not just, Oh, I want to get recognized and I want everyone to know that I did a good job or that I was supportive.

288
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,310
It's I have a particular goal and particular mission personally, but I'm looking to advance.

289
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:34,040
So fundraising then the term fundraising is usually referring to the goals of soliciting charitable or philanthropic giving,

290
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,100
distinct from the term development,

291
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:45,320
which is a more comprehensive approach of looking for giving that aims to support the long term growth of an organization.

292
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:52,729
Okay, so when I say that I'm engaged in fundraising, usually that means I'm fundraising for a particular goal.

293
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,760
Right now we've got a new building going up.

294
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:02,060
I'm fundraising for it. The development department is engaging in that activity.

295
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,730
But development is not just about fundraising.

296
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:12,440
Development is about thinking about the organization's strategic plan, where it's looking to raise money, where it's looking to grow,

297
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:18,470
what is looking to achieve, and then to that point, looking for a strategy around how to make that work.

298
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:22,310
And that is precisely where the development officer comes in.

299
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:31,190
That person is really overseeing and strategizing around the process of those fundraising and development initiatives.

300
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,620
Now I have a question. I development director, the same as a chief development officer.

301
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,640
Their goals are both development. But like this one have more.

302
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:50,870
Mean I'm assuming the chief does, but I don't know if there's any information you can give on that asking.

303
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,130
Should we. No, no. Great question. So so typically what we'll see inside of an organization.

304
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,770
Typically what we'll see inside of an organization is we'll see that the chief development officer I'm abbreviating it as CDO and everyone see,

305
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:13,120
okay, a chief development officer will sit at the top of the organization's philanthropic office under that person.

306
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:22,260
They may have different vice presidents of development and vice president for major gifts.

307
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,740
Okay. Vice president for annual giving.

308
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:38,589
So major gifts, meaning gifts of $500,000 or more gifts that are connected to someone's estate, where maybe I say upon my passing,

309
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:46,000
I will bequeath $1,000,000 paid out over ten years out of my family's trust to your organization.

310
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,420
This is a covenant between us, and therefore you can count on that.

311
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:53,400
That would then sit on the organization's assets.

312
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:57,070
Meaning I know that in time those dollars will come in.

313
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:02,830
I can't put it as an asset until the person's gone, but you get the idea of a major gift annual giving.

314
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:07,640
I'm responsible for the people who are going to, you know, make a gift every year.

315
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,700
They give $200 a year or they give $1,000 a year, they get $5,000 a year, etc., etc.

316
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:19,090
Under these VP's, very often you'll start to see development directors,

317
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:27,940
and the directors are responsible for the implementation of what this person's major goal is.

318
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,990
So the Vice President so the chief development officer might say.

319
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:43,620
I have a strategy that we're going to get 25% of our of our funding or let's say 30% of our funding from major gifts this year.

320
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:50,760
VP For major gifts, I'd like you to start a process of strategizing how you're going to get that 30%.

321
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,510
We need to raise $2 million in major gifts.

322
00:32:54,270 --> 00:33:01,790
Now the V.P. for major gifts will go back to their development directors and they'll say, okay, development director, team, there's five of you.

323
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,780
We're going to divide the 2 million up into five. And each of you is responsible for raising a chunk of that.

324
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:11,010
And every month we're going to meet we're going to talk about who your prospects are,

325
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:14,520
who you're going to go approach for those gifts and how you're going to get them.

326
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:21,130
Meanwhile, over here in the annual giving office, the chief development officer might say, you know what?

327
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:29,850
5% of this year's dollars in revenue will come from annual giving because we know those are smaller gifts this person may have under them.

328
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:34,110
Maybe one director, you know, but they don't have as much money that they're responsible for raising.

329
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:40,530
And under that person, there may be some managers or coordinators.

330
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,910
All titles you'll see in the philanthropy world. Yeah.

331
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:51,680
So then on top of that, if there's a small nonprofit and they only have a development director because like an hour, an hour.

332
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:56,480
I'm David. A nice case. Like they only know a development director then.

333
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,730
Like, there's no, like, chief development officer or anything, right?

334
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:04,290
If they're one small organization. Yeah, it just know it's like they're staff members.

335
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,480
How is it one development director? It's this person they're serving as the CDO.

336
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:17,160
Great point. I'm glad you brought it up. Now I want everyone to picture doing everything I just said, and it's just one person.

337
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:22,800
A lot of work, right? As a lot of people to go talk to and a lot of people to go try and find.

338
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,550
So very often you'll find that larger organizations have a whole group dedicated to this effort.

339
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:35,210
But that doesn't necessarily mean they're more successful just because they have more people.

340
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:40,430
Sometimes that could create barriers because there's a lot of inertia and a lot of things that happen as a result.

341
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:44,120
But you can kind of see how it starts to play out.

342
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,660
Does that help? Is that helpful to kind of see what the structure is?

343
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,970
All right. So you'll hear the term gifts in-kind.

344
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:56,220
So these are gifts of products that differ from cash gifts.

345
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,990
So I'd say, for example, I decided to give a car as part of my giving.

346
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:10,380
So Ford Motor Company Fund very regularly, or at least it was was donating vehicles to Disabled American veterans.

347
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:16,080
Every year they send a certain number of vehicles in-kind, basically saying, here are these vehicles,

348
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:21,060
we're gifting these to you so you can use them to transport disabled veterans to their medical appointments.

349
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,680
We also see this concept of enlightened self-interest,

350
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:31,710
the idea that a company might make a gift that might not have a direct or immediate benefit to their bottom line,

351
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:38,430
but would help them to maintain some kind of a healthy society. So you'll very often, if you look carefully at corporations,

352
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:43,560
you'll see that they have particular organizations that they're interested in advancing their work.

353
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:50,220
Crayola, for example, if you go to their website, always website, at least up until two years ago,

354
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:58,740
you would find that Crayola says we will only make gifts in the community in New Jersey where we were founded.

355
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:07,310
That's in. So every time every company kind of has its own interest, set its own reason to make a gift.

356
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,360
So you have to think about as you're considering the role of the chief development officer or

357
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,860
the director of development or whoever it is is working inside of the philanthropic department.

358
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:27,210
You got to think about who can I go to? So let's say, for example, I'm going to go to the local tool manufacturing company.

359
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:36,270
Okay? And the tool manufacturing company says, you know what, we are all the interested in gifts related to sea urchins.

360
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,000
That's it. That's all we do see urchins.

361
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:45,900
And you say, Well, but we have this great program on maternal and child health, sea urchins that say no, sorry.

362
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:58,170
Thank you so much, sea urchin. Now, if you are working then to cultivate that donor, what you might do is you might say, okay, sea urchins.

363
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,580
Sea urchins.

364
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:09,200
Why don't we look about where inside of our organization we can connect a program related to sea urchins as it pertains to maternal and child health?

365
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:19,400
Maybe it's sea urchins that are designed to help infants and their mothers become more relaxed in their development out of their relationship.

366
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:25,430
You know, how can we make these to go together? And that's very often what the development department is trying to do.

367
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:32,780
How can I take this person's interest and match it with what I'm doing rather than saying, this is what we do?

368
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,500
You all are on sea urchin, so therefore we can talk.

369
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:42,620
Okay? So you've got to kind of try to find consensus. You've got to find a way to get everybody to get something out of it.

370
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:52,370
Okay. Foundations now foundations are a little bit of a different story in that they're

371
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:58,850
required to give a minimum equivalent to 5% of the value of their invested assets.

372
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,380
So what does that mean?

373
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:12,710
If I have $1,000,000 invested from my foundation, 5% of the value that needs to go out to somebody in order to maintain my tax exempt status.

374
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:17,840
[INAUDIBLE] very often see in the 19 different tests associated with determining whether or not

375
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:22,520
an organization is a foundation in order for foundations to kind of maintain their status.

376
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:31,020
A family foundation is usually one that is independent where the board is dominated by members of that family.

377
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,520
So you'll very often see these in, you know, different communities.

378
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:43,380
So, for example, in metropolitan Detroit, there's the Max Fisher, a max and Marjorie Fisher Foundation.

379
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,690
It's the foundation that has different priorities,

380
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:51,640
one of which is to fund programs in Brightmoor for the neighborhood in Detroit, the Family Foundation.

381
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:56,790
Those family members are on the board, you know, and it goes down through the generations,

382
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:01,920
etc., distinct from perhaps something like the Community Foundation of Southeast Michigan,

383
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,960
which is really more of a corporate foundation that has dollars that have been invested into it.

384
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:11,730
It gives out grants, but is not necessarily run by particular family members.

385
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:23,950
You might have heard over the last ten days during the coverage of the Queen's passing that the royal family has many different in the United Kingdom,

386
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:30,820
has many different charitable interests, and that its family members kind of oversee different contributions.

387
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:38,200
So, you know, that's another example of sort of internationally a family that has sort of used those dollars

388
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:45,099
as not a statement on kind of what the equity associated with that is or what what the you know,

389
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:51,620
what the arrangements are. It's a different system, but it's my kind of give you examples of where you might have heard about that type of thing.

390
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:59,260
All of this, all of this is sometimes distinct from writing a grant.

391
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:04,230
Or you might find that these types of entities will be looking for grants.

392
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:11,950
What does that mean? Well, we might find that a family foundation, very small, may say, you know what?

393
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:18,130
We've got some people in our group who kind of know how this works. So we've got a grant proposal system that we have.

394
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:24,790
You've got to write up a grant if you want dollars from our foundation. You can't come and just pitch us on an idea of sea urchins.

395
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,830
You've got to come and tell us, what are you going to do with those dollars?

396
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:31,000
You know, we've got we've got certain requirements that we want to fulfill.

397
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:39,100
The government has a much more involved process, usually for grant requests.

398
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,970
Both, though, are going through the process of writing a grant.

399
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:47,079
And that's typically where you'll see all these different components discuss

400
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:51,340
inside an organization and where the strategic planning is really important.

401
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:57,700
Because very often if you're going to need to write a grant proposal, you're going to need to know what is it that you need?

402
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:01,330
You're going to need to know how are you going to evaluate your success?

403
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,520
How much is it going to cost? What is your organization's information?

404
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:11,360
How are you going to staff this? Etc. And.

405
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:22,150
So individual donors are those people who are very easily describable.

406
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:27,160
We can we can look at that. We can figure it out. How old are they?

407
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:32,030
How much money do they make? Where are they living? What's their the gender that they identify as?

408
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:41,650
You know, what is their occupation? How educated are they? What is their affiliation with a particular school or college?

409
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,300
What is their affiliation with a particular neighborhood? All things we can easily find out.

410
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:53,860
It's very difficult, though, is why. Why do they want to give and you can't make assumptions.

411
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,160
And that's why the relationship building part of this is so critical.

412
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:03,219
It's not enough to just say, well, they need all these different demographic pieces of information,

413
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,010
so therefore we're just going to assume that they're going to make a gift.

414
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:15,770
If the relationship building that helps to tell us the what the topic the discussion and that's why I started with this idea of cultivation.

415
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:20,570
You're having those relationships. You're making those conversations.

416
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:29,760
This is why I think colloquially you may hear about philanthropy departments and you'll hear, you know, stories.

417
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,950
We flew down to Florida. We flew down to this, you know, family's private island.

418
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,220
We flew down to their home on the beach in California.

419
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:46,379
You'll see what that translates to is we're trying to go have a conversation with that family and figure out why are

420
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:52,590
they wanting to give so we can figure out what it is that we are doing that would be in line with their interests.

421
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:56,640
That's very often what you'll hear about with those directors of development.

422
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,379
So there's a continuum of motivation that we can think about in development

423
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:09,440
and in philanthropy that goes from this construct of being purely altruistic.

424
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,030
So perhaps I'm on the very extreme end. You know, it is good feeling.

425
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:24,560
It feels good to make a gift. And I see that, you know, I can help children enjoy better services at the local children's hospital.

426
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:28,850
I feel good about that. You know, it's great. I feel really good about that.

427
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:38,600
As we move across the spectrum to a more self-interested, oriented approach, we might say, you know what?

428
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:43,580
Not good enough to feel good. That's that's nice. But I need something more than that.

429
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:52,220
So as we move toward this direction, what we start to see is things that speak to, for example, recognition.

430
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:55,490
Okay. So a donor might say, you know what?

431
00:43:55,790 --> 00:44:00,020
It's not enough that I just make this gift. I'd like some approval for that.

432
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:03,740
I'd like to be recognized for that. I want you to put my name on something.

433
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:10,730
I want a sign that says that I sponsored this. I want everyone to get a bag that says that I gave this to you.

434
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:18,220
Sometimes those individuals who are giving may have an investment in themselves.

435
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,780
You know, they may say, you know what, I'm going to invest in giving to the hospital,

436
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:30,950
because I'd like to be able to know all the people who have the very largest portfolios of cutting edge medical research.

437
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:33,420
I'd like to know who they are. I'd like to know what they do.

438
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:40,030
Now from a staff perspective, very important back to that concept of development departments.

439
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:46,870
Setting expectations just because you make a gift doesn't mean that all of a sudden you get to get first or you get to go,

440
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:54,790
you know, get before someone else. We saw this play out during the early days of COVID, especially among hospital philanthropy departments.

441
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:59,700
There were reports, for example, in Florida and other states where all of a sudden, you know,

442
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:06,490
the people who had made gifts to the hospital, they were turning up and they'd gotten vaccinated before everybody else had a chance.

443
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:14,799
So, you know, these are the kinds of things that we have to think about in terms of this continuum of motivation, where as development professionals,

444
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,170
we're managing expectations and we're sort of, you know, saying, okay,

445
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:25,720
this is the limit, this is the boundary through which your gift is is providing.

446
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:32,910
So all the government departments then go through a fundraising process.

447
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:38,430
And what they have to do is they really have to go through and they have to solve different problems.

448
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,240
First, they got to determine what those priorities are.

449
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:50,670
That's where the strategic planning comes in. Can't go talk to donors of I have no idea what it is that I'm going to go raise money for.

450
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:55,530
I'm just going in there and saying, Yeah, we have a great center.

451
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:59,870
It's really great. It's amazing. We do wonderful work.

452
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,900
Okay. What do you do? Oh, it's great.

453
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,770
Really great. Wonderful. No, not right. The philanthropy.

454
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,860
The donor wants to know what is your priority?

455
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:20,500
What are you trying to do? We'd like to be able to offer 20% more of the people in our community services by 2025.

456
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:28,660
And we need your help. Okay, that's a priority that we set. We got to figure out who we're going to talk to.

457
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,750
We got to qualify them. So back to my example.

458
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:40,910
My my friends who support the sea urchins. If they're not interested in talking to us, they're not interested in talking to us.

459
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:47,870
So if we're going to have meetings with that donor and they're not interested in anything we do, they're probably not a prospect for us.

460
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,620
And that's okay. That doesn't make their interests wrong.

461
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:59,090
It just means that we have to qualify them. We as an organization have to say, okay, is this particular donor appropriate for this gift?

462
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:07,080
Maybe they're appropriate for something else. Maybe it's, you know, way in two years, we've got this great new program like I just described.

463
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:14,300
This is not a real endorsed idea, but connecting maternal and child health, you know, to two to this.

464
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,120
We're going to come talk to them in two years about that.

465
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:22,880
We're not going to talk to them this year about building a new tower in our facility because that's not what they're into.

466
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:28,700
So we've got to qualify. Then we're going to cultivate the relationships.

467
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:36,290
We're going to cultivate those relationships so that we're clear and intentional about what it is that we can ask them for.

468
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:43,160
Raise your hand if you would respond well to someone walking up to you and saying, Hi, nice to meet you.

469
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:48,280
Would you give me a gift for $5,000? Yeah.

470
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:51,100
No, I don't think so. It doesn't really work very well.

471
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:56,300
So if we're going to start with that conversation, we've got to have some way of talking to to that person.

472
00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:01,780
Got to know them. Got to kind of know their story. All right.

473
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:12,910
Next, we solicited the gift. So let's say I have a conversation with a donor and I'm sitting down with them and I say.

474
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:19,640
You know, we do really wonderful work. Our organization is truly transformational.

475
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:29,240
We are building a new program that's going to give 5000 more children access to food than ever before.

476
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:35,960
It's going to open in 2025. It will be delivered by our competent and incredible staff.

477
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:42,560
We've been working with organizations across the world to help inform what it is we're going to do.

478
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:50,250
Nice to meet you. What did I miss in that conversation?

479
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:54,480
But you can say, Honey, are you telling him this?

480
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:00,480
Why am I telling them that? What did I. What did I do? Go ahead.

481
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:04,440
Ask them for money. I don't know. I don't know. As some.

482
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,800
Great, great. I'm so happy for you. Yes. Oh, that's wonderful. It's great.

483
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,520
It's great. Thumbs up. Yeah. Okay.

484
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,230
Yeah. Amazing. I see it on Channel seven News tomorrow, too, right?

485
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:20,910
If you got to ask. You've got to ask. You have to say all what I just said.

486
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:23,910
Not necessarily what I just said, but all of your pitches, so to speak.

487
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:29,280
Then you got to say, and we would be grateful if you would contribute to our new program,

488
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:37,380
we would appreciate it if you would want to make a contribution to this, we would like to ask you for another dollar figure.

489
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:44,490
All appropriate question. Now, you might not get to that in the first meeting, but again, the key is there soliciting a gift.

490
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:53,160
Next in the process is acknowledging the gift. Now, sometimes you have to acknowledge the gift in the solicitation.

491
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,670
What I mean is you got to actually tell them what you're going to do.

492
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:01,410
If you give us $10,000 for our new program that we're going to be developing.

493
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:09,270
We're going to make sure that every child who participates in the program knows that your company was responsible for funding this initiative.

494
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:19,110
If your family makes a gift to this program, we're going to make sure that you get to meet the children who benefit from the gifts that you're giving.

495
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,240
So thinking about how to acknowledge,

496
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:26,850
recognize the donor and sometimes the donor might say to the Philanthropy Department or to the development director, you know what?

497
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:33,810
I don't need anything. I'm you know, I'm back to this part, purely altruistic for me.

498
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:39,420
I just want to give because it makes me feel full. And that's not I don't mean that sarcastically.

499
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:47,069
Some philanthropists, that's just all they like. That makes them happy to know that their dollars are going toward good causes.

500
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:53,680
And that's fine. So your task as a person on staff and development is to figure out what it is that they're looking for.

501
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:59,520
And finally, it's to steward the gift and that relationship.

502
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:10,200
So. It is a great program. It is incredible development that we've this incredible center that we've built.

503
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:18,520
We're going to service 5000 more children. Uh, you know, we would really appreciate your generosity.

504
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:25,080
Um, you know, David, would you be willing to give us $10,000 for that gift?

505
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:30,790
Look, you get everything right. All right?

506
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:36,500
We need those $10,000 tomorrow. So we need you to write us a check right now.

507
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:41,900
Can you do that right now? He. I may be right.

508
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:45,350
Maybe not. That's the stewardship.

509
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:50,210
That's the stewardship. The stewardship is. I made the ass I solicited.

510
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:56,570
I told you how I'm going to acknowledge you. Now I've got to figure out how to make it possible for you to make the gift.

511
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:04,970
Is it monthly payments to the organization? Is it you can make it as a you know, as you can bequeath it in your will or near estate?

512
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:09,170
Is it you're going to give it in two parts?

513
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:15,650
$5,000 this year and $5,000 next year. But when you leave that meeting as the development department,

514
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,600
you better walk out knowing how you're going to make it possible for that person to make that case,

515
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:27,350
because it's not enough to just say, well, you give it. I got to make sure that they're able to give it and that there's a mechanism in place.

516
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:32,750
And that's when I come back to my chief development officer, and that's when the chief financial officer might get involved.

517
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:36,890
And you see now where the collaboration start taking place across departments.

518
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:40,520
The CEO might say, we're going to start this new program for children.

519
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:46,070
The CFO might go, the CDO might say, we're going to raise it from these people like David.

520
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:50,659
And then the CFO might say, okay, the chief development officer,

521
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:57,820
I heard David wants to give let me come up with five ways that it be possible for us as an organization to receive that general.

522
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:05,510
So. Sometimes we can think about fundraising as a pyramid.

523
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:09,830
So we've got, you know, ultimate gifts that sit up at the top.

524
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,940
These ultimate gifts are sometimes referred to as principle gifts.

525
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:20,300
So back to my little diagram that I illustrate on the board here, the VP for major gifts.

526
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:24,320
That person is usually going to be working on this principle gift category,

527
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:31,490
those gifts that are designed to be specifically for a particular part of the organization's operations.

528
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:37,290
But they're large in magnitude. So they're not going to usually be the same people working on the annual giving.

529
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:46,280
So when you see that the cardiovascular center is named after Samuel and Jean Frankl.

530
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:52,400
Samuel Jean Frankl, Cardiovascular Center here at the university, that's a principal gift that family said.

531
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:57,880
We are going to give a very sizable gift. Same as the Ross School of Business.

532
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:01,900
Same as the Taubman Library. Same as the Dudas Deaf Center.

533
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:06,190
Same as the Quarterly Community Room at all.

534
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:11,559
Principal Gates. I don't want to speak on any of those organizations because I don't know what those

535
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:16,060
gifts were or whether or not philanthropically they came from a particular thing.

536
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:22,059
Just giving examples of that. Sometimes those can naming rights can be given without a gift.

537
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:25,720
But usually if you see them, that means that there was some kind of principle giving relationship.

538
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:31,020
Okay. A major gift. Sometimes you're thinking about it as a special gift.

539
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:36,960
A major gift is something large, but not an right.

540
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:39,000
It's not the largest one we've got.

541
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:48,610
Now as a clever development department, you got to think about, okay, so if I'm trying to cultivate relationships, I'm trying to steward donors,

542
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:56,260
I'm trying to get these folks to give I got to kind of have a landscape analysis of who is in my community and why are they giving.

543
00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:03,310
So the person who's giving $500,000, is there someone in the community who can give $5 million?

544
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:10,630
Because if I give the naming rights to my building away for the $500,000 donor, what am I going to offer the $5 million?

545
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:21,620
So you see, there's a strategy component to this. Regular gifts, annual gifts, usually not $5.

546
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:28,290
So when you see someone giving $5, that's not usually in the annual giving category as part and probably part of the total constituency,

547
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:37,140
part of the annual gift is usually, you know, $1,000, $5,000, you know, some some amount of money that is given.

548
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:46,740
But for every donor that gives that gift, you have to keep in mind as a development department that that donor is giving at their comfortable level,

549
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:52,130
meaning they feel that that is a great contribution from them.

550
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:56,100
You may want to work on helping them to raise their gift,

551
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:04,170
but you have to walk in to know that that's what that person is comfortable giving and to not say to someone who's making an annual gift,

552
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:07,800
You know what? You can't put your name on the building. So.

553
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:11,670
Thanks so much. Bye bye. We're not going to talk to you anymore.

554
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:17,690
That's what I mean by relationship. The 50 people will give $5,000.

555
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:24,740
That equates to $250,000, just the same as the one person who gives $250,000.

556
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:30,530
So I got to keep in touch with my donors and make sure that I'm keeping those relationships going,

557
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:35,710
because if 50 of those people drop off, I may not have another one person to give the rest of that Twitter.

558
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:41,870
Okay. I have a question. What about the, um.

559
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:48,410
Like, there's been, like, multiple individuals throughout history who have, like, started up funds and they die.

560
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:51,950
And then all these funds run this organization for years like the Commonwealth

561
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:56,150
Fund is started by Anna Harkness and still runs on those funds to an extent.

562
00:56:57,350 --> 00:57:01,820
Rockefeller, like all these others. What type of funding would that be in that pyramid?

563
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:06,740
So they're most likely going to be in this category.

564
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:13,810
Here. Okay. So. It's a foundation, typically.

565
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:17,440
So they're they're giving away like 5% say of that.

566
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:25,540
So are they in the fundraising period? They would likely fall wherever they're going to give commensurate with these levels.

567
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:31,870
So the Rockefeller Foundation for a hospital may say we're going to be a principal gift.

568
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,410
Or a zoo. They may say, you know what? We're going to be only in the annual gift.

569
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:40,650
Okay. So it depends on the gift that they're giving.

570
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:48,570
That's what dictates where they fall in the pyramid is the pyramid is really about how the organization views the hierarchy of donors.

571
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:56,840
Very often you'll see the foundations like that are going to give at different levels, depending on their priorities.

572
00:57:57,350 --> 00:58:02,810
So in health care, they may give, you know, principal gifts in environment.

573
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:07,130
They may give more annual gifts. And we had two different level.

574
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:16,170
Clarify. Yes. Thank you. I was just going to ask you, as you have to be like.

575
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:26,740
Does it have to happen, like in in an early fashion to qualify for Medicare Part and just be once meaning does it have to happen every year?

576
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:34,540
So no, I mean, very, very often you'll find in organizations that they may have annual gift giving campaigns and a person may say,

577
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:39,220
I'm going to join into the annual campaign, and then they fall off two years later.

578
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:46,720
Typically, they'll get recognized every year, meaning if I start giving in 2022,

579
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,080
I'm not going to get recognized in 2022 as being part of the annual campaign.

580
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:57,940
And then, Paul, does the development department, do they decide what kind of gift is kind of for them?

581
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,660
Or is it just like, oh, like redefining if it's worth it?

582
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:07,990
So it's going to be principal. If it's less than that, it's going to be development department decides.

583
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:11,469
And that's that's a great question because that's really two to the question.

584
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:16,020
The first question is, you know, what? What are we going to ask this foundation for?

585
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:20,110
You know, what are we going to tell them to get, you know, for this particular gift that they're giving?

586
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:25,030
Maybe they're giving at a major gift level right now, but we really want them to be a principal gift.

587
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:29,200
So what's our strategy for sort of creating levels with our donors?

588
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:33,140
All right.

589
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:44,690
So you can see here in this figure giving by source, you know, different different levels that that we see the vast majority comes from individuals.

590
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:55,040
You know, foundations give about $60 billion and the bequests, very important, are about $30 billion.

591
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,720
So in our hierarchy here, you see that corporations are the lowest.

592
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:03,890
Okay? Only about 5% of total giving comes from a corporate income.

593
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:08,840
So you'll want to keep that in mind. We're going to get to that in our case about Jp morgan Chase.

594
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:12,270
Keep that in mind as we think about these corporate donors.

595
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:19,520
You know, is that the best place to go to to ask for giant philanthropic dollars or is it better to think in your community about,

596
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:24,980
you know, other places you might know from a table, including donations or just managed financial.

597
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:39,160
Okay. Case for support. So the reason that an organization is seeking that support out, sometimes you'll see a case statement,

598
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:43,690
a document that might have a comprehensive discussion of their fundraising objectives.

599
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:47,230
Very often when an organization is undergoing a large capital campaign.

600
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:55,479
That's where you'll start to see this statement. But distinct from an internal case statement, which is what that organization,

601
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,830
as AbbVie asked, you know, what are we going to do for these different donors?

602
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:04,450
That's internal. You're not usually going to put that out versus the external statement.

603
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:06,910
How am I going to communicate with my prospects?

604
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:12,680
So I might have a whole internal strategy where I'm saying, okay, we're going to go to this group for this, this group for that.

605
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:19,720
These are the prospects for this is the prospect of that. But externally, I'm just going to have one case statement that says, if you are,

606
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:25,000
you know, a gift of $500,000 or more, you get this, if you're 10,000, you get this, etc.

607
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:32,370
So we talked a little bit about how we identify those prospects. We qualify them.

608
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,450
We talked about that.

609
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:44,710
But the key part here to remember is that they have the financial ability to give and they have the potential interest in giving out.

610
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:50,659
This is where it gets a little bit tricky because just because someone has the financial ability to give

611
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:57,700
it today doesn't mean that that person is the only person who has the financial ability to give tomorrow.

612
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:02,230
So an effective development department is going to be looking across the

613
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:07,930
community of people who are making a contribution in some way or another to say,

614
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:12,130
you know what? That person maybe doesn't have the capacity to give it today.

615
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:16,990
We ought to know that maybe we're going to invite them to be on our young leadership board.

616
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:23,390
We're going to invite them to be part of our advisory council because we'd like them to be involved with us.

617
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:29,290
And maybe when they get to be more established and they have the resources, they'll be interested in making a gift to us.

618
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:34,670
So we have to sort out how we're going to solicit those gifts.

619
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:39,520
And really where we can think about this is through this principle.

620
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:46,040
So we are linking through linkage that prospects, interest.

621
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:54,170
We're then determining their ability level to make that gift and then see here what is their interest.

622
01:02:54,350 --> 01:03:01,520
So we have to make sure that there's a match between that prospect's passion and the organization's mission.

623
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:11,720
Now the donors are going to control their own linkage. But the not for profit really has the ability to influence the interest.

624
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:17,890
Certain extent the linkage as well. But the interest. How do we make a match?

625
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:25,650
How do we make this sound good for this person? So lots of different solicitation methods.

626
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:28,540
I'm not going to go through everyone here, but just you can get a sense of them.

627
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:33,940
Personal solicitations, you know, where I go and ask you like the one I just kind of roll played out.

628
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:41,100
Direct mail. Here you can see advantages and disadvantages of both telemarketing events.

629
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:49,170
I want to just make this point with events because it's very commonly the way that organizations say they raise money.

630
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:56,550
Not usually very cost effective. And you'll see it in the year 1990.

631
01:03:56,580 --> 01:04:00,540
I challenge all of you to look for it. They ran their annual gala.

632
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:08,490
They spent $500,000 putting it on and they raised $560,000 raised.

633
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,130
We made $60,000 in that process.

634
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,990
Now, if that's a cultivation opportunity to keep my donors that are giving in other places going in that that's exciting for them.

635
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:24,480
Wonderful. And it serves a purpose but it's after we're counting on getting all our dollars from.

636
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:28,950
Probably not the best place. Okay.

637
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:32,520
Email, crowdfunding, text. All other ways.

638
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:37,329
I put some criteria here down for successful crowdfunding only because I know

639
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:40,840
you're probably all seeing these online and they're very common right now.

640
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:46,989
But the key part of this that I just want to emphasize for crowdfunding campaigns and this is a great,

641
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:52,360
great means test to put before any organization if you're working with them or you're advising them.

642
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:57,520
Is the ball exciting or urgent to go viral?

643
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:02,739
Today on Remember the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge? What was that?

644
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:05,990
Someone called out. Was.

645
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:17,850
Just like you would you yourself pouring ice over your head in the challenge that you would never get any money back.

646
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:24,660
All right. So, yes, what was their clear and tangible goal?

647
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:31,870
Institutions are just to fight against elites.

648
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:36,090
Okay. What did pouring ice on your head have to do with that?

649
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:45,080
Not much. I don't know what the total raised was out of it.

650
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:50,420
The key part that made it very, very famous at the time was that it went viral.

651
01:05:51,940 --> 01:06:04,650
And then everybody, like great organizational theory demonstrators, demonstrated the concept of mimetic organizational activities.

652
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:09,560
Everybody copied it. We're going to do ice bucket challenge for this.

653
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:15,820
We're going to do Ice Bucket Challenge for that. We're going to do jump into, you know, pile of chocolate bars for this.

654
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:21,700
After that first one didn't really go much for most organizations.

655
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:26,320
And this is really an important part about crowdfunding. It has to be tailored to you.

656
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:31,100
It has to really make sense to be organization. Yeah.

657
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,350
Right. Oh. I just.

658
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:43,740
So how does it work when, like, nonprofits will say to, like, give and then I'll be matched like three times or something like that?

659
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:46,650
Like, how does that work with this company? Okay.

660
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:56,510
So usually what that means is you'll go out to the community and you'll say, we're going to look for 150 people to give $1,000.

661
01:06:56,550 --> 01:07:06,630
We're going to raise $150,000. Meanwhile let's say that the at the VP for community giving.

662
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:10,660
Okay. All right.

663
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:17,410
The BP for community giving. And then we're going to raise $150,000 for 100 people, 150 people to give $1,000.

664
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:21,880
All my directors go out and help me figure out how to get those people together.

665
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:28,480
Meanwhile, this person says, I'm going to send an email to the V.P. for major gifts.

666
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:31,090
I'm going to say these are major gifts.

667
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:39,610
Do you have someone in your group that would be willing to give $150,000 if you can collect $150,000 from 150 people?

668
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:46,360
And they may say, yeah, you know, I was just talking to this donor, you know, over dinner last month.

669
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:52,840
And, you know, they were really looking for a way to give where a lot of people are going to give and they'll really hear about it and it'll be great.

670
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:58,930
So this person will say, okay, let's talk to them. So they go have a meeting, they get together, they talk.

671
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:02,020
And this donor says, Sure, I'll do it.

672
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:07,870
And so then when they announce this, they're going to know they won't necessarily tell you who it's going to be.

673
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:16,000
They'll know that that donor is going to match it. So they tell you if you give up $1,000, we're going to match it times two.

674
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:20,040
That's usually how it will happen. It doesn't have to be.

675
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:25,500
Sometimes you can take this person and I'll go to the CEO of the organization and say, hey, you know,

676
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:29,520
would you be willing to put in from the general fund or would you be willing to put in from,

677
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,230
you know, some funds that we've had so it can happen that way?

678
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:44,700
Or you might have a mechanism in place where a foundation in town might say, we'll match, you raise 150 and we'll put in the rest.

679
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:50,710
So do they still match it all or just like case by case, case by case?

680
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:59,640
But that's a great question. Like all great crowdfunding efforts, there's usually some kind of string attached.

681
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,480
So they may say, we'll only match if you reach your goal.

682
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:10,570
Otherwise you get zero. And then the crowdfunding efforts will only disperse the funds.

683
01:09:10,590 --> 01:09:12,510
If you raise 10,000 or more.

684
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:21,440
If you get $9,950 and you can't get it close to 10,000 by tomorrow, all the money that all those people get, it goes back to.

685
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:27,640
So donors get recognized in different ways.

686
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:31,630
Here you can see some examples. You know, the standard hospital.

687
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:35,740
This is a rendering of the new hospital there of 500 people.

688
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:43,420
But you can see here, Stanford Hospital written here. You can see here all the major donors that are listed.

689
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:50,250
This rendering doesn't show it, but there are also large names here and here that sit atop,

690
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:57,150
you know, where they recognize the different donors at the entrance. So what is the campaign?

691
01:09:57,150 --> 01:10:01,020
I keep referring to that concept. And then we'll take a break because I wouldn't want a little while.

692
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:08,610
What is a campaign? So a campaign is usually the organized structure through which the department starts to make decisions.

693
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:11,430
Now, just because I'm a smaller organization,

694
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:16,470
I don't have this giant group of people working with me doesn't mean I'm not going to run a campaign, too.

695
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:22,290
It just means that I may be the only person coupled with the CEO and maybe a couple more board members to run it.

696
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:27,190
But my campaign is usually organized around three phases.

697
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:31,330
The first is the quiet phase. What's the quiet phase?

698
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:36,880
Sounds very nefarious. The quiet phase is where we're doing all of our planning.

699
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:42,940
We're planning for how much we're going to collect. We're planning out all those levels for planning.

700
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:46,810
What I was asking about earlier, who gives what level?

701
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:51,639
But the question was, with regards to Rockefeller, you know, like, what are we trying to get them to do?

702
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,430
All that stuff. We're going to create our nuclear.

703
01:10:55,550 --> 01:11:02,330
We're going to get all those major gifts that we need so that when when we kick off, we may be saying that,

704
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:07,820
hey, we're going out for a $20 million campaign, but we're not going out with zero in our hand.

705
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:10,219
We're going out with 10 million already.

706
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:20,840
And in that meeting, I already know that half this campaign is covered by ten people or half this campaign is covered by 50 people or whatever it is.

707
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:26,780
I mean, it's covered. And that's really, really critical, I think, of the campaign.

708
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:34,130
I make that announcement and toward the end I start to transition into this public face.

709
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:41,150
So along the way, I'm collecting major gifts. I'm heading to my wrap up.

710
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:47,780
I'm heading to celebrate. But the key part here is that I set in motion the plan in this quiet phase.

711
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:53,489
That leads us to our many cases that I want to set up for you,

712
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:58,560
and then I'm going to set it up and I'm going to take a little break in a moment here to brief.

713
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:07,380
Birmingham General Hospital building a new tower with a focus on promoting wellness, prevention and coordinated care.

714
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:11,130
You were recently hired as the capital campaign director.

715
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:18,510
Your task is to coordinate the campaign activities for a campaign designed to raise $600 million.

716
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,860
Your boss, the executive director of the Hospital Foundation,

717
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:31,740
has been actively working on securing the large anchor gift for the campaign from a wealthy philanthropist who owns a medical device company.

718
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:39,450
The philanthropist plans to commit a gift of $200 million that will allow him to have the medical tower named in his honor.

719
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:45,990
Your task is to build from this gift and engage additional donors who will contribute to the campaign.

720
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:51,750
Okay, that's some thought. We're going to go through these questions here when we come back.

721
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:56,880
And just wherever you're sitting with us and we'll do that.

722
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,220
We're going to take a five minute break. Yes. The kicks back because I was so to thank you.

723
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:08,870
Take a break, everyone. Reset. Reset is very wonky and is trying to turn it down.

724
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:23,400
And I don't think have. She's so smart.

725
01:13:24,290 --> 01:13:27,960
Oh, we made it. Oh, you got it.

726
01:13:40,404 --> 01:13:43,884
All right. So maybe emergencies.

727
01:13:44,464 --> 01:13:52,354
Yeah, I'm just sitting there somewhere and.

728
01:13:52,614 --> 01:13:55,724
Would you like to else on paper or just be thinking.

729
01:13:55,924 --> 01:14:01,644
Thinking, just discussing the other individuals, then I know that.

730
01:14:04,904 --> 01:14:21,054
You really don't want to. I don't like expansion and that's why you have to choose was talking about it.

731
01:14:21,434 --> 01:14:56,854
And I think even if it's like the Mediterranean like they don't like you can you don't like brands like television in your home and stuff.

732
01:14:57,124 --> 01:15:10,544
And how do you think you were able to do?

733
01:15:10,634 --> 01:15:25,874
Because you probably you know, because I didn't mean it like that.

734
01:15:27,964 --> 01:15:40,424
Yeah. Famous people are there other countries where they have with their replacement because there's like you have

735
01:15:40,424 --> 01:15:55,514
to follow the I mean that's what I know that's markets in the world under occupation is not static class.

736
01:15:55,514 --> 01:16:08,464
And so I started building, I had more minutes of a gas station or something like that.

737
01:16:08,484 --> 01:16:15,524
It's probably doing your bathroom time, some of them that people don't realize.

738
01:16:16,334 --> 01:16:19,573
What's it? Maybe not. How we doing?

739
01:16:19,574 --> 01:16:28,624
Okay. You the one that, like, works on the side of the bridge.

740
01:16:28,634 --> 01:16:36,584
Yeah. And he knows how to serve in the hospital.

741
01:16:37,544 --> 01:16:49,104
Also a part of that's true. Even if they can introduce them to each other.

742
01:16:50,044 --> 01:17:02,624
Given like the West Hollywood is,

743
01:17:06,584 --> 01:17:18,844
what is what is an indication as to how many jobs and only what you care about making like you're just looking at this.

744
01:17:20,144 --> 01:17:28,394
I mean, it's it's extremely easy to go and all that.

745
01:17:28,664 --> 01:17:44,174
But we've done so much. We actually have some ideas that this one's for.

746
01:17:45,384 --> 01:17:50,324
You just need to be that way.

747
01:17:51,584 --> 01:18:11,294
Yeah, I talked to another couple, so I think it is a little bit like the government is set.

748
01:18:12,314 --> 01:18:28,624
Thank you so much for joining us on this morning.

749
01:18:37,444 --> 01:18:55,334
Oh, that's all right.

750
01:18:56,144 --> 01:19:01,604
Let's, uh, let's come back together. Social media. I think it's okay.

751
01:19:06,574 --> 01:19:11,344
Let's talk through the tough to do kind of group wise what you what you were talking about.

752
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:21,424
So how about let's start through the like our goal is to obviously you have particular area that you were talking about.

753
01:19:21,444 --> 01:19:29,884
You know, he's thinking, okay, all right, he's going to be bigger.

754
01:19:30,274 --> 01:19:38,044
We're talking about well, we only got as far as catching this.

755
01:19:38,584 --> 01:19:43,894
Okay, go ahead. What were we're reading as well as a nutritionist?

756
01:19:44,014 --> 01:19:46,464
I have this bad idea, which is wait, no,

757
01:19:46,474 --> 01:20:00,134
no idea that every bad idea that I think is going to contribute to the type of get caught for like a week away or something in place.

758
01:20:00,654 --> 01:20:08,553
And I was imagining like their grandchildren's art or portraits of their grandchildren or something like that.

759
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:15,384
You give them access to encourage you, which is I'm sorry, but very feasible actually.

760
01:20:15,734 --> 01:20:21,064
And it has been done before, but not more than excellent.

761
01:20:21,544 --> 01:20:29,524
So that's pretty interesting. I work for this model and like they have this thing where like they have like a board of their

762
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:35,703
donors and they recognize them in terms of gold and silver donors and bonds and things like that,

763
01:20:35,704 --> 01:20:41,674
depending on the amount of money. I mean, I think over $10,000 or something was gold.

764
01:20:43,054 --> 01:20:46,424
And that was a way that they recognized that they have like a hold of it.

765
01:20:46,534 --> 01:20:52,764
And then another way was I had to make individual calls to donors and kind of say like,

766
01:20:52,774 --> 01:20:57,933
hey, like we're checking in, like for the holiday season, like, I hope you're doing well.

767
01:20:57,934 --> 01:21:05,073
This is just a call to like do models. Just to let you know, we were thinking of, you know, kind of just like a thank you call to kind of,

768
01:21:05,074 --> 01:21:11,074
you know, keep up that report so that they can also remember to do their, like, annual donations, I guess.

769
01:21:11,824 --> 01:21:13,264
Right? Oh, that's excellent.

770
01:21:13,264 --> 01:21:23,224
So one suggestion I'm hearing in terms of, you know, how can we appeal personally to their family members and other sort of recognition levels and,

771
01:21:23,434 --> 01:21:26,704
you know, how we can create levels, other things that were discussed.

772
01:21:28,894 --> 01:21:35,784
Any part of this, not just on recognition. I see the middle road deliberating here.

773
01:21:36,894 --> 01:21:42,533
You know, one thing that we discussed for question number one was approaching the friends

774
01:21:42,534 --> 01:21:48,024
of the rich philanthropists to see if they could also donate to our campaign.

775
01:21:48,384 --> 01:21:53,954
Okay. How might you operationalize that? Definitely.

776
01:21:53,964 --> 01:22:05,814
Like includes, I think it's important. So maybe getting a quote from the left about why they gave that included that not marketing to them

777
01:22:05,814 --> 01:22:12,324
or just having the philanthropist reach out to his friends directly and then having that connection.

778
01:22:12,624 --> 01:22:18,834
As far as like cutting information, we talk to them and it's a great suggestion.

779
01:22:18,834 --> 01:22:23,934
So thank you for sharing that. And you know, you could you see this sometimes it's happened just like that.

780
01:22:23,934 --> 01:22:27,564
Everybody what you've said so far, all things that happened.

781
01:22:27,594 --> 01:22:31,074
So not nothing nothing here that's being proposed is that far off.

782
01:22:31,704 --> 01:22:39,984
So, you know, certainly we see cases where we look at family members and how we can recognize them as part of someone who's maybe older.

783
01:22:39,984 --> 01:22:44,484
We've seen cases where we look for levels, you know, how to recognize people in different tiers.

784
01:22:44,844 --> 01:22:54,804
And certainly using our large philanthropist as an influencer and and looking for their friends what they might be interested in contributing to.

785
01:22:55,134 --> 01:22:59,664
Very often you might hear that term, sometimes you might hear the term parlor meeting.

786
01:23:00,114 --> 01:23:03,354
It's an old term. Again, with all these terms,

787
01:23:03,354 --> 01:23:08,844
I want to just be clear that they sometimes carry connotations that are reflective of the type of

788
01:23:09,114 --> 01:23:17,214
inclusivity that we that we are more intentional about in our work as public health professionals.

789
01:23:17,214 --> 01:23:20,184
But I just want you to understand, when we hear those words what that means,

790
01:23:21,054 --> 01:23:27,804
but it basically means a meeting where everybody gets together in their living room or in their house or somewhere and basically says,

791
01:23:27,804 --> 01:23:34,854
okay, I give a gift of X. I'd like you all my friends, to make a gift to other groups.

792
01:23:36,304 --> 01:23:47,764
Yeah. To talk about with the issues of equity, how the donors might get special treatment, faster service while coming into the hospital,

793
01:23:47,764 --> 01:23:56,574
and that might leave out people who can't afford to donate and they're getting slower service or getting put on the back burner.

794
01:23:57,194 --> 01:24:00,453
So to make an excellent point, thank you for sharing that.

795
01:24:00,454 --> 01:24:04,454
And this is something we have to keep in mind as development professionals.

796
01:24:04,834 --> 01:24:08,344
What are the implications if someone and their friends may be making it?

797
01:24:09,574 --> 01:24:17,824
You know, as the development officer, it's likely your responsibility to set expectations and say, okay, this is you know,

798
01:24:17,824 --> 01:24:23,194
this is as far as it's going to go in terms of what you have access to as part of the gift you're giving,

799
01:24:23,794 --> 01:24:27,754
you know, but at a certain point, it doesn't go further,

800
01:24:28,594 --> 01:24:36,094
meaning you're not going to get surgery first and displace someone else if you know, if you made a gift of a certain level.

801
01:24:36,484 --> 01:24:40,864
So it's not necessarily about the service you receive, but rather about the recognition you receive in the building.

802
01:24:41,024 --> 01:24:50,793
Good. Mark. Yeah, we also talked about, oh, this donor says this medical device company and is donating to a hospital.

803
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:58,894
So there may be some kind of ulterior motives in terms of, you know, or medical device companies selling their stuff to hospitals.

804
01:24:58,894 --> 01:25:05,884
So it's not that it's inherently wrong to do that, but will this be considered?

805
01:25:06,544 --> 01:25:12,694
Absolutely. So this is this is that's a great point and something we'll talk about next week in our in our ethics discussion.

806
01:25:13,414 --> 01:25:16,324
You know what what is the what are the conflicts of interest?

807
01:25:16,804 --> 01:25:25,234
You know, conflicts of interest don't mean that you can't it just means they need to be managed typically inside of these organizations.

808
01:25:25,744 --> 01:25:32,734
And imagine, what protections can we put in place to ensure that there's not undue influence?

809
01:25:34,394 --> 01:25:38,714
Christiane, I saw your hand up. You touched on it. Okay.

810
01:25:39,044 --> 01:25:43,244
What others can't be told.

811
01:25:43,244 --> 01:25:51,373
The cattle, which people have been traditionally donors who donated like in previous years,

812
01:25:51,374 --> 01:25:56,924
like give back list and see for this the audience they've donated something up to now we're

813
01:25:56,924 --> 01:26:02,314
not and maybe like reach out to them saying that this is what we are planning on doing.

814
01:26:03,134 --> 01:26:07,004
We all have any plans to donate to see people.

815
01:26:07,364 --> 01:26:11,864
Excellent. So communication is. I think I'm hearing you saying that that that's.

816
01:26:12,864 --> 01:26:19,524
That's another critical part of this is that we're communicating effectively with our with our prospects and seeing,

817
01:26:19,524 --> 01:26:25,524
you know, with what it is that they're willing to do. Be.

818
01:26:26,584 --> 01:26:30,754
That is that encapsulated appropriately, Abby and then Kate.

819
01:26:32,224 --> 01:26:42,484
I mean, I was just wondering if we can also approach maybe some of the companies that venture capitalist like like these brands like Nike,

820
01:26:42,484 --> 01:26:45,494
for example, maybe Facebook.

821
01:26:47,254 --> 01:26:48,424
So it's a great question.

822
01:26:48,424 --> 01:26:56,074
And so so I think what do we think if we were to approach companies like that, what were our thoughts on how we would do that?

823
01:26:56,224 --> 01:27:02,584
What would we need to make sure? Yeah.

824
01:27:02,834 --> 01:27:08,774
See, maybe like that there they've showed interest and like things like this before.

825
01:27:09,014 --> 01:27:14,894
Like, we're not just wasting our time talking about, like, wouldn't give us the time of day, basically.

826
01:27:15,624 --> 01:27:20,504
Okay, good. Yeah. So we're, we're, we're prospecting. We're qualifying them as prospects.

827
01:27:21,774 --> 01:27:27,053
Thanks, Kate. Oh, I was just going to add to the question about equity.

828
01:27:27,054 --> 01:27:34,164
I wondered or I was thinking about how the tower has a focus on promoting wellness, prevention and coordinated care.

829
01:27:34,164 --> 01:27:46,704
So what these donations be inherently tied to the philanthropist and what their views are of those restrictions?

830
01:27:48,864 --> 01:27:56,544
Sure. And this is something that we're going to have to see more and more in kind of the era that we're at, that we've entered, which is, you know,

831
01:27:56,544 --> 01:27:58,434
where people are getting their information,

832
01:27:58,734 --> 01:28:07,734
what their values are and what kinds of things they come to the table with as as requirements for what they want out of recognition.

833
01:28:08,154 --> 01:28:14,334
It's not just about getting their name on the building, but do they have particular attitudes about the way that the organization runs,

834
01:28:14,634 --> 01:28:18,804
especially with the health care delivery organization and, you know, what kinds of services are offered.

835
01:28:19,194 --> 01:28:25,464
You know, you know, whether or not the organization is working toward a certain set of values or a certain set of.

836
01:28:27,704 --> 01:28:31,874
Mission oriented goals. These are all things that philanthropy has to contend with.

837
01:28:32,174 --> 01:28:37,334
And sometimes that may mean you got to walk away from the philanthropists, know that they're not going to be able to make the gift.

838
01:28:37,964 --> 01:28:43,244
The organization may have to say, you know what, I'm very thank you, you know, but it's not going to work out.

839
01:28:43,544 --> 01:28:48,904
And so then this philanthropist, like he donates $200 million.

840
01:28:48,914 --> 01:28:53,954
I mean, he owns the medical device company, but it will be his personal money or the company.

841
01:28:54,584 --> 01:28:58,164
That's a great question. Who needs money? There's great, great questions from everyone.

842
01:28:58,214 --> 01:29:02,414
It's a great question. The answer is it will likely come from him personally.

843
01:29:02,774 --> 01:29:06,704
His company could also make a gift, but that will be separate.

844
01:29:06,764 --> 01:29:09,883
That's right. And b b separate. Conflict of interests.

845
01:29:09,884 --> 01:29:16,304
Alert, though, if he's the CEO of the company and he's also making a personal gift and you have to start to say,

846
01:29:16,304 --> 01:29:20,474
okay, let's make sure that there are protections in place to ensure that this is going to work out.

847
01:29:23,784 --> 01:29:31,554
I was going to point out, are we going to talk about the weirdness or if we're still like the donor or are we just like answering anything,

848
01:29:31,564 --> 01:29:37,464
anything you want to answer? Yeah, I was going to say for building awareness about like the campaign.

849
01:29:37,614 --> 01:29:47,574
I was going to suggest so like and ah, even remember 2017 may be Ronald McDonald House and Detroit created a family room and like

850
01:29:47,574 --> 01:29:53,004
the children's hospital and how we campaigned a lot for it as we had like this really big.

851
01:29:55,104 --> 01:29:57,563
Then and there was like, you know, the big ribbon cutting thing.

852
01:29:57,564 --> 01:30:02,214
And we invited a lot of key members in the community that have advocated for it before.

853
01:30:02,484 --> 01:30:06,444
And there was also a lot of like journalists and stuff from major news outlets

854
01:30:06,444 --> 01:30:09,564
that would report on that to just kind of like more people would know about it.

855
01:30:09,864 --> 01:30:18,804
But a big way to build awareness is just like inviting people who are in the community, like doing grassroots type of work or on the same issue,

856
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:24,653
or like who have fought for it before and then making sure they know about it like they're in attendance and they can be like picture

857
01:30:24,654 --> 01:30:31,104
it and stuff for like media things and then like that way a lot more people can like know about like what's happening and stuff.

858
01:30:31,974 --> 01:30:35,324
No, that's great. And that, you know, raising awareness about this is something.

859
01:30:35,334 --> 01:30:41,213
Thank you for sharing that because it's something that that you have to keep in mind as you're going through this process that that there

860
01:30:41,214 --> 01:30:48,324
needs to be awareness building around those gifts and making sure that people are aware of them and that people know that it's happening.

861
01:30:51,774 --> 01:30:57,114
Other thoughts? Okay.

862
01:30:58,694 --> 01:31:07,444
I would like to highlight a question that came up, and I just want to kind of explain to everybody with an excellent question, and I appreciate it.

863
01:31:07,514 --> 01:31:12,884
I try to make sure everybody knows about it. So I used the term earlier called fiduciary.

864
01:31:13,274 --> 01:31:19,813
And what that term means is that an organization very often may find that it is too

865
01:31:19,814 --> 01:31:28,004
arduous to get all of the necessary pieces in place to have a501c3 designation.

866
01:31:29,144 --> 01:31:34,334
So the organization may say, you know what, we're incorporated. Maybe they have a board, maybe they don't.

867
01:31:35,204 --> 01:31:38,474
You know, maybe they have staff, maybe they don't.

868
01:31:38,864 --> 01:31:42,374
But basically they'll say, we are going to get our five on 1c3 ourselves.

869
01:31:42,824 --> 01:31:50,894
We're going to operate and we're going to use the Bible when C three designation of another organization that's maybe larger or more established.

870
01:31:51,774 --> 01:31:58,164
And that organization that is acting in that role is called the fiduciary organization,

871
01:31:58,644 --> 01:32:09,084
and they utilize fiduciary responsibility to oversee this company's activities, adhere to the standards of what would be a51c3.

872
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:17,904
So if I want to raise money as part of that company or that organization, I might say, don't write me a check for my company.

873
01:32:18,114 --> 01:32:21,654
Write a check to this other entity that is serving as fiduciary.

874
01:32:22,674 --> 01:32:26,724
That way, your tax deductible, your country, that way your contribution is tax deductible.

875
01:32:27,024 --> 01:32:33,984
But I, as the organization, don't have to necessarily go through the process because it can become very expensive and sometimes very

876
01:32:34,224 --> 01:32:39,264
labor intensive to get your own back once you three or you may not want to have to do all that work.

877
01:32:40,534 --> 01:32:45,104
All that 9090 reporting, all what you're looking at, it's a responsibility.

878
01:32:45,134 --> 01:32:50,944
It's not just invisible. You have to do it and you have to adhere to all the policies and procedures at the IRS

879
01:32:50,944 --> 01:32:58,014
designates as coming with the privilege of maintaining a513 to make sure that term.

880
01:32:58,024 --> 01:33:04,954
And you may see that arrangement. And again, as I say to all things you talk about, nothing is right or wrong.

881
01:33:05,254 --> 01:33:09,454
It's just different ways that organizations do things and how they structure things.

882
01:33:09,824 --> 01:33:11,344
I think it's a great question that came up,

883
01:33:11,344 --> 01:33:16,984
and I just want to make sure everybody knows that the fiduciary was the big brother of the little brother and the big.

884
01:33:17,254 --> 01:33:23,794
So the fiduciary acts is the one that is going to oversee all the financial transactions and

885
01:33:23,914 --> 01:33:29,234
essentially treats the organization as maybe a line item or a fund inside of their budget.

886
01:33:29,254 --> 01:33:36,304
So they track everything. And in turn, the organization has to have enough money to be able to pay the fiduciary for that service.

887
01:33:39,184 --> 01:33:44,174
Okay. Let's turn to current events organizers.

888
01:33:45,424 --> 01:33:50,614
We have a to that and we have some ideas.

889
01:33:53,134 --> 01:33:56,974
All right. From there, I'll click through from there or from wherever I am.

890
01:34:00,514 --> 01:34:04,794
What do you think?

891
01:34:05,134 --> 01:34:12,324
Oh, my God. Okay, I'll do it.

892
01:34:12,394 --> 01:34:20,474
It's almost like I was trying to minimize the technology hiccups literally every time I.

893
01:34:23,544 --> 01:34:29,874
Everyone. I'm Emma and I'm going to you. My current event that I'm going to be presenting on is the migrant service at Martha's Vineyard.

894
01:34:30,714 --> 01:34:35,694
So I just want to start off by acknowledging the debate about undocumented immigrants in

895
01:34:35,694 --> 01:34:39,864
America and also talking about immigration and public health and how that's intertwined.

896
01:34:40,194 --> 01:34:44,844
Being an undocumented immigrant, there's a lot of there's two social determinants of health.

897
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:51,714
You face racism, xenophobia. There's a language barrier sometimes that can impact your access to health care, your quality of health care.

898
01:34:52,374 --> 01:34:55,554
You could be under stress because you don't want to go to a hospital.

899
01:34:55,744 --> 01:35:00,894
You're living in fear. And you just came to America because after going through so much mental, physical stress,

900
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:05,814
now you're even in more stress and just want to live a better and healthier life.

901
01:35:07,104 --> 01:35:18,414
So, yeah, it's a big issue in America. If people if we want to in America help these undocumented immigrants to minimize the inequities between them.

902
01:35:19,534 --> 01:35:29,914
So you jump right into the current event. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a $12 billion bill in June 2022 that allows him

903
01:35:29,914 --> 01:35:34,113
to transport undocumented immigrants out of the state of Florida and other states,

904
01:35:34,114 --> 01:35:41,674
as well as more liberal states that want them that want the undocumented immigration policies passed to support the migrants.

905
01:35:41,684 --> 01:35:53,134
And they also call them sanctuary states. It is only one of many Republicans that are protesting Joe Biden's immigration bill.

906
01:35:53,564 --> 01:36:04,294
And then on September 14, 2022, DeSantis organized for two planes of Venezuelan migrants to be sent from Texas unexpectedly to Martha's Vineyard.

907
01:36:04,504 --> 01:36:08,403
Not only do the people of Martha's Vineyard not know that this plane was arriving in Martha's Vineyard,

908
01:36:08,404 --> 01:36:11,644
but the migrants also didn't know that they were specifically going there.

909
01:36:11,854 --> 01:36:17,374
They thought they were going to Boston for job opportunities, immigration relief.

910
01:36:19,114 --> 01:36:23,894
And you can like watch videos online about their stories about why they got onto the plane.

911
01:36:23,914 --> 01:36:29,464
They weren't really aware. Now, these migrants are now miles and miles away from immigration hearings.

912
01:36:32,544 --> 01:36:36,804
But this isn't just an issue like an isolated issue. This is happening all across America.

913
01:36:36,984 --> 01:36:44,214
There was just a bus sent to Kamala Harris's front door and they're basically just like, you want to take care of these people.

914
01:36:44,814 --> 01:36:49,744
So Republicans from states like Florida, Texas and Arizona have been sending undocumented immigrants to New York City,

915
01:36:49,764 --> 01:36:55,714
Chicago and D.C. But thankfully, the community and Martha's Vineyard came together to help these migrants.

916
01:36:55,734 --> 01:37:01,944
This is a picture of them in front of a church to get shelter and supplies.

917
01:37:02,874 --> 01:37:09,714
So this leads me to talk about the nonprofit that has been impacted by this event, United Way's 523 nonprofit.

918
01:37:09,714 --> 01:37:15,984
And it's one of the largest publicly funded nonprofits in America and impacts over 95% of communities in America.

919
01:37:16,224 --> 01:37:19,614
And it now has a new goal to build equitable communities across the globe.

920
01:37:19,824 --> 01:37:27,444
This is the logo for the specific chapter that I'm going to be talking about, which is the Cape and Islands chapter.

921
01:37:29,004 --> 01:37:32,514
Yes, the 1100 local united ways around America.

922
01:37:32,904 --> 01:37:33,863
So different chapters.

923
01:37:33,864 --> 01:37:39,924
And their mission is to seek to improve lives by mobilizing the caring power of communities around the world to advance the common good.

924
01:37:40,644 --> 01:37:46,764
So it's really cool about united ways that they provide their own services, which I'll talk about on the next slide.

925
01:37:46,764 --> 01:37:55,554
But they partner with local nonprofits and volunteer organizations to come together and help the communities of the Cayman Islands partner with 28.

926
01:37:56,944 --> 01:38:05,753
And what they do specifically, each chapter kind of has their own things that they do for their community and they create housing stability.

927
01:38:05,754 --> 01:38:13,764
So they'll help homeless people have a path to self-sufficiency that also invest in affordable housing.

928
01:38:14,004 --> 01:38:19,464
They encourage financial stability. They promote health. It played a large role in the COVID 19 outreach in the community.

929
01:38:20,094 --> 01:38:23,994
They also do a lot of work with education and recovery, with substance abuse.

930
01:38:24,864 --> 01:38:26,574
They support young children education.

931
01:38:26,574 --> 01:38:32,394
And it's something that's unique to them and their chapters that they help a lot with women's health, especially maternal health.

932
01:38:32,994 --> 01:38:36,744
And then the way that they United Way helps the migrants.

933
01:38:37,674 --> 01:38:45,144
They provide a temporary shelter, volunteers, food, and they provided a lot of money and grants to help them.

934
01:38:45,264 --> 01:38:49,044
They also got local nonprofits involved, like I said, that they do a lot of work like that.

935
01:38:49,314 --> 01:38:51,464
And they're also working towards stabilization.

936
01:38:51,474 --> 01:39:02,184
Now, thankfully, the immigrants were able to be sent to a military base where they have more resources there than the people of Martha's Vineyard do.

937
01:39:03,284 --> 01:39:11,274
We see a representative showing just like how the community came together.

938
01:39:12,444 --> 01:39:22,973
So, yeah, the CEO of the Massachusetts Cape Cape and Island United Way basically said that he wants to help them get their immediate needs right now,

939
01:39:22,974 --> 01:39:27,824
but he also wants to help work towards stabilization and use a lot of their resources that they have for education,

940
01:39:27,864 --> 01:39:33,384
homelessness to help the migrants move on and hopefully get toward citizenship in their lives.

941
01:39:34,074 --> 01:39:37,224
This leads me to my discussion. If you guys have any questions, let me know.

942
01:39:37,254 --> 01:39:40,824
But you can jump right in. Yeah.

943
01:39:41,394 --> 01:39:45,744
I or specifically want to talk about the second one. Let's jump to number two.

944
01:39:46,404 --> 01:39:48,713
So with this being an ongoing recurring issue,

945
01:39:48,714 --> 01:39:54,474
do local nonprofit organizations need to divert their money and energy from their typical services to provide for the migrants?

946
01:39:54,474 --> 01:39:58,854
And how do these nonprofits like, you know, would be more prepared with resources and services?

947
01:40:14,334 --> 01:40:19,104
Oh, yeah, I think. I don't know that diverting.

948
01:40:19,824 --> 01:40:20,244
Sorry.

949
01:40:20,994 --> 01:40:35,884
I don't know that diverting money or energy services, but I think maybe creating a new area within the organization to help for emergency crises.

950
01:40:36,804 --> 01:40:43,044
Depending on what nonprofit it is. But it sounds like United Way. It sounds like their mission aligns with this a lot.

951
01:40:44,964 --> 01:40:54,953
So I think, like a lot of organizations would fit into supporting people that were sent to Martha's Vineyard because people need so many things.

952
01:40:54,954 --> 01:41:00,074
So I think it's like kind of what we were talking about earlier, like finding ways to get donors in.

953
01:41:00,084 --> 01:41:11,393
But this is like finding services to match what the community needs because hopefully, I mean, who knows if they'll be out there again,

954
01:41:11,394 --> 01:41:19,194
but it's going to be all nonprofits in different areas are going to have to come together one time or another if this is a recurring event.

955
01:41:21,544 --> 01:41:27,724
Christiana I used to work at this organization called Project for Global.

956
01:41:28,024 --> 01:41:33,514
And one thing that she's really adamant about, especially in the context of making this history is sustainable.

957
01:41:33,924 --> 01:41:42,674
So I think that can be beneficial here, like just a sustainable model of like if there's a crisis, you know, helping with interventions like food,

958
01:41:42,694 --> 01:41:47,984
stuff like that, like we're talking about, but then also supporting like long term sustainability for those communities.

959
01:41:48,004 --> 01:41:57,543
So like education or like just I guess programing that helps economic stability and like employment stability and things like that.

960
01:41:57,544 --> 01:42:01,834
So I think that would help it to not be a proprietorship.

961
01:42:02,134 --> 01:42:08,244
It's like more organization focused on the sustainability portion of it instead of only the like.

962
01:42:09,124 --> 01:42:13,533
Yeah, I think, you know, it does a good job that not they want to provide those immediate needs,

963
01:42:13,534 --> 01:42:17,704
but they also feel attached to this problem now and want to help.

964
01:42:18,754 --> 01:42:20,464
With the stabilization and sustainability.

965
01:42:30,224 --> 01:42:39,944
So I think whether nonprofit should, uh, you know, dedicate their money and resources to a particular mission, that, for me, depends on two factors.

966
01:42:39,944 --> 01:42:42,764
First, and what the factors kind of go hand in hand, I guess.

967
01:42:43,334 --> 01:42:46,944
But I think the first factor would be how well they're doing with their important mission.

968
01:42:46,964 --> 01:42:53,924
And the second one would be like, um, how closely that information kind of relates to the mission that began because I feel like,

969
01:42:53,924 --> 01:43:01,514
as we saw in the Harlem Children's Zone, if they're not able to get over there for one reason and so on,

970
01:43:01,514 --> 01:43:09,734
their mission, which is like individually relevant to their own organization, I think it doesn't make sense to like kind of dedicate,

971
01:43:10,004 --> 01:43:15,254
I mean, take on more responsibility and you know, like, yeah, hopefully it doesn't happen again.

972
01:43:15,254 --> 01:43:17,234
So they don't have to divert more money, but.

973
01:43:19,904 --> 01:43:27,824
So I appreciate this question because I think it speaks to a theme that we've been talking about a little bit over the last few weeks, which is.

974
01:43:29,314 --> 01:43:36,274
Nonprofit responsibility to respond in situations that maybe are unexpected.

975
01:43:36,724 --> 01:43:41,284
And how many crises, to Christina's point, about creating sustainability?

976
01:43:41,314 --> 01:43:50,254
How many crises can an organization feasibly address with its resources if it can't predict what's going to happen?

977
01:43:50,884 --> 01:44:00,124
We and plan for what's going to happen. And C has to continue doing the programs and services that it was planning to do that particular year.

978
01:44:00,844 --> 01:44:11,164
So I think this is a great example of kind of thinking about organizationally not just the politics of it, but just feasibility wise.

979
01:44:11,674 --> 01:44:15,364
This happens. Agree or disagree with what happens?

980
01:44:15,484 --> 01:44:18,694
This happens. Now what? You know, what?

981
01:44:18,724 --> 01:44:23,703
What where does the United Way go to say, look, we we we stepped in,

982
01:44:23,704 --> 01:44:30,064
but who's going to help pay for this or who who's, you know, who's responsible for for for the resources for this?

983
01:44:30,334 --> 01:44:35,524
Maybe philanthropists will come together today and do it because it made headlines.

984
01:44:35,524 --> 01:44:39,694
But if it happens every six weeks or every few months, then what?

985
01:44:40,084 --> 01:44:43,803
You know who picks it up and does it now become part of it?

986
01:44:43,804 --> 01:44:50,554
I think it's an issue that we also have seen organizations talking about with the Dobbs decision as well.

987
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:58,944
You know, states where all of a sudden. You know, access to abortion services is just not there.

988
01:44:59,184 --> 01:45:05,694
So, you know, organizations such as Planned Parenthood would become responsible for that.

989
01:45:05,724 --> 01:45:14,544
You know, where where do those dollars come from? So, you know, what what types of balancing need to go on to address some of these emergent needs?

990
01:45:15,774 --> 01:45:21,964
And the list goes on and on. You.

991
01:45:24,734 --> 01:45:27,764
I know it's an organization and management class, but I can't help.

992
01:45:28,834 --> 01:45:33,904
Look at it from the. From the side of the migrants.

993
01:45:34,564 --> 01:45:44,574
So even if the nonprofit, the next nonprofit defensive plane focuses on migrants, show up, manages to tolerate mission creep and do the fundraising,

994
01:45:44,654 --> 01:45:52,194
raising like this is a horrible experience for these people to be cared for by someone who's never done it before.

995
01:45:52,434 --> 01:45:57,954
I just absolutely guarantee that if you don't have experience carrying migrants, it will be a disaster.

996
01:45:58,314 --> 01:46:06,254
So think that this will be an ongoing and recurring issue to these claims like that,

997
01:46:06,264 --> 01:46:17,034
that the nonprofits feel they may be susceptible to this tech crisis, need to organize their resources in it.

998
01:46:17,154 --> 01:46:21,624
And I don't really mean money. I mean knowledge, maybe also money.

999
01:46:22,944 --> 01:46:25,224
And I don't I don't know how often that happens.

1000
01:46:25,344 --> 01:46:39,174
But that's what strikes me, is that there needs to be like a blueprint for what do you do if you are the next nonprofit that meets with this crisis?

1001
01:46:40,024 --> 01:46:47,124
And and that's what I would hope the United Way might prepare and share and and

1002
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:52,314
really consult with people who are caring for this population on a regular basis.

1003
01:46:55,064 --> 01:46:59,594
I think by I mean I'm would I don't know specifically but did a good job because

1004
01:46:59,594 --> 01:47:03,673
there were a lot of videos and pictures of just like the migrants being really,

1005
01:47:03,674 --> 01:47:04,604
really thankful.

1006
01:47:04,604 --> 01:47:13,183
And when they were leaving to go to the military base, they were just like the whole community like opened their arms and it wasn't just non profit,

1007
01:47:13,184 --> 01:47:19,524
which is really nice of Martha's Vineyard to do that, but. Not if you're dropping them off in New York City, New York City's.

1008
01:47:21,054 --> 01:47:25,254
New York City. You know, so hopefully every.

1009
01:47:26,234 --> 01:47:30,154
Nonprofit and community is able to respond and likewise.

1010
01:47:31,034 --> 01:47:36,494
So thank you for sharing that. And to your point, I think you are raising something important here,

1011
01:47:36,494 --> 01:47:43,094
which is really where the crossover from management to policy comes in, which is the organizations can manage.

1012
01:47:43,694 --> 01:47:47,114
And I think the best most recent example of this is what happened with Coke.

1013
01:47:48,284 --> 01:47:55,064
Absent government involvement in the response to COVID, all of a sudden all the nonprofits were responsible for dealing with this.

1014
01:47:55,064 --> 01:47:59,084
How are we going to get people vaccines? How are we going to get people treatment? Where are they going to get a test?

1015
01:47:59,564 --> 01:48:02,984
Where are they going to go get quarantined? Where are they going to be isolated?

1016
01:48:02,984 --> 01:48:10,514
Who is going to coordinate all the hotels that need to be isolation centers? All these questions fell onto nonprofits when the government said.

1017
01:48:11,834 --> 01:48:15,914
Every place. You all sorted out? We're not in the ball out.

1018
01:48:16,304 --> 01:48:24,344
We didn't really last that long in that mode because the pandemic in earnest started in the United States in March of 2020,

1019
01:48:24,344 --> 01:48:27,974
and the administration changed less than a year later.

1020
01:48:29,474 --> 01:48:31,774
But you can imagine that, you know,

1021
01:48:32,534 --> 01:48:39,254
had a pandemic started in a year or two of an administration and there wasn't an election to change the administration.

1022
01:48:39,784 --> 01:48:48,404
You know what would have been the policy orientation of what to do, you know, and kind of how to respond and where to go with that.

1023
01:48:48,804 --> 01:48:53,864
And then is it up to the organizations to start advocating and lobbying for support?

1024
01:48:54,234 --> 01:48:57,434
You know, is it become local municipalities that need to figure it out?

1025
01:48:57,914 --> 01:49:02,174
These are all questions that I think are really important here. And I'm glad we're talking about it,

1026
01:49:02,174 --> 01:49:09,034
because I think it raises this very important point about how far does the nonprofit really have the ability to go and see.

1027
01:49:09,044 --> 01:49:12,884
For example, here the community was willing to openly say, yeah,

1028
01:49:12,884 --> 01:49:21,254
we'll we'll we'll help you to go over if 30 of these claims show up at some point, just like we saw with COVID.

1029
01:49:21,554 --> 01:49:26,564
There's only so far people can go before resources need to be expended in order to make

1030
01:49:26,564 --> 01:49:31,424
sure that people are taken care of and that it's actually a feasible arrangement.

1031
01:49:31,424 --> 01:49:37,424
You know, that you're accounting for all the different dimensions mental, physical, emotional, all, all these different parts.

1032
01:49:38,084 --> 01:49:41,854
So this is an excellent presentation and I appreciate you bringing it to us.

1033
01:49:41,864 --> 01:49:46,754
It's very timely and it's a great example of kind of these questions that we have to wrestle with.

1034
01:49:47,384 --> 01:49:52,544
Thank you. All right.

1035
01:49:53,344 --> 01:50:07,274
In the. Because part of what you want to reconcile, where you want to present seated standing without changing your thinking.

1036
01:50:09,584 --> 01:50:17,563
Well, everyone, my presentation is similar topics that I will be addressing the global refugee crisis and

1037
01:50:17,564 --> 01:50:23,624
we're talking about what's your the same I can't speak French but Medicins Sans Frontiers,

1038
01:50:24,014 --> 01:50:28,454
I will call it MSF from Haiti.

1039
01:50:29,144 --> 01:50:38,804
So this is a stark number. A hundred million people in this world are forcibly displaced at this time in 2022.

1040
01:50:40,154 --> 01:50:46,904
Next slide, please. 69% of these originated just from five countries.

1041
01:50:47,264 --> 01:50:53,114
These five countries are Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, South Sudan and Myanmar.

1042
01:50:54,944 --> 01:51:06,794
41% of these displaced people are children, which is surprising because only 30%, 30 some percent of the world's population is children.

1043
01:51:08,354 --> 01:51:16,933
And then here I just put some visuals for you to see what the major source countries are and the major hosting

1044
01:51:16,934 --> 01:51:27,194
countries which make sense because they usually migrants will go to or refugees will go to neighboring countries and.

1045
01:51:28,264 --> 01:51:33,004
And so you can see Syria and then Turkey and Colombia.

1046
01:51:34,334 --> 01:51:47,934
Afghanistan, Pakistan. And then the next slide is just a quote from Filippo Grandi, who works at the UN High Commissioner for Refugees,

1047
01:51:48,384 --> 01:51:55,164
that this is a wake up call that we must try and work in resolving destructive conflicts and

1048
01:51:55,164 --> 01:52:00,564
persecution and address the underlying causes that force innocent people to flee their homes.

1049
01:52:00,654 --> 01:52:04,464
I thought that was pretty profound in there.

1050
01:52:06,054 --> 01:52:11,904
Next, I will discuss MSF, which is the organization that I've selected.

1051
01:52:13,044 --> 01:52:15,294
We know this has Doctors Without Borders.

1052
01:52:15,924 --> 01:52:27,264
This organization was founded in 1971 in France by a group of journalists and doctors originally to respond to the Nigerian Civil War.

1053
01:52:27,894 --> 01:52:35,634
MSF provides medical assistance to people affected by conflicts, epidemics, disasters or exclusion from health care.

1054
01:52:36,024 --> 01:52:42,084
So one of their focuses is on caring for refugees and internally displaced people.

1055
01:52:43,374 --> 01:52:51,024
I hear just a little bit of their mission and some principles they follow the MSF charter,

1056
01:52:51,804 --> 01:53:00,694
which essentially states that everyone should have access to health care regardless of their gender, race, religion, creed.

1057
01:53:02,244 --> 01:53:06,574
And then they follow these five working principles and.

1058
01:53:07,534 --> 01:53:16,924
In addition to these principles, they also follow Essence and two documents, which are the Chantilly Principles and the Montreal Agreement.

1059
01:53:19,604 --> 01:53:25,034
I. These are some of the services that MSF provides to the displaced.

1060
01:53:25,334 --> 01:53:38,174
So it ranges from vaccines to mental health treatment to primary care, nutrition, support, water, sanitation and shelter.

1061
01:53:39,824 --> 01:53:47,354
Currently the situation that I will focus on, because this is such a big organization that's focusing on so many different events.

1062
01:53:47,744 --> 01:53:50,924
I'm going to be talking about the detainees in Lithuania.

1063
01:53:52,934 --> 01:53:58,424
So as we know, we don't have between 500.

1064
01:53:58,994 --> 01:54:04,094
There are currently more than 2500 asylum seekers and migrants that are arriving

1065
01:54:04,094 --> 01:54:08,834
from Belarus and are detained in Lithuania under very inhumane conditions.

1066
01:54:09,884 --> 01:54:22,454
These detainees are folks from other countries who are hoping to come from Belarus to Lithuanian, maybe migrate to Latvia and Poland.

1067
01:54:23,324 --> 01:54:28,004
But they were they were held in these detention centers.

1068
01:54:28,814 --> 01:54:31,034
One of them actually was a former prison,

1069
01:54:32,204 --> 01:54:41,324
and they are being subjected to very hostile migration policies from Lithuania, and they're being denied fair asylum,

1070
01:54:41,324 --> 01:54:52,274
asylum procedures and they're being subjected to very serious human rights violations, including torture, sexual abuse and physical abuse.

1071
01:54:52,874 --> 01:54:56,924
And they are hoping that they will voluntarily return to where they came from.

1072
01:54:57,314 --> 01:55:03,974
And these migrants are from Cameroon, Iraq, Nigeria, Syria, countries like that.

1073
01:55:04,124 --> 01:55:16,754
So not folks from Ukraine. And then this is a very stark contrast to how the Ukraine refugees are being treated by the EU.

1074
01:55:17,814 --> 01:55:23,124
And these folks have lack of access to proper sanitation, health care and even legal help.

1075
01:55:24,364 --> 01:55:28,324
And so what is MSF doing for these people?

1076
01:55:28,654 --> 01:55:40,594
MSF is providing mental health care for these detainees because going through the process of torture and physical abuse and sexual abuse,

1077
01:55:40,594 --> 01:55:48,224
it's traumatizing. So they're offering grief sessions and individual consultations.

1078
01:55:48,994 --> 01:55:54,454
They're educating their patients on how to cope and teach them coping skills.

1079
01:55:54,994 --> 01:56:00,904
I know in the grand scheme of things, providing something,

1080
01:56:00,934 --> 01:56:07,623
unless something like mental health might not really take care of the problem of having them migrate,

1081
01:56:07,624 --> 01:56:12,514
but still leave so much trauma just from leaving your country behind.

1082
01:56:12,964 --> 01:56:16,924
You're escaping these things only to be subjected to these things again.

1083
01:56:16,934 --> 01:56:21,274
So it's very. Heavy.

1084
01:56:21,784 --> 01:56:28,294
And they also in addition to that, they're also MSF is also advocating for ending this inhumane treatment and the

1085
01:56:28,294 --> 01:56:35,854
detention of the migrants and for the EU to work on changing their migrant policies.

1086
01:56:38,814 --> 01:56:46,734
So sorry to end on such a heavy note, but I have a couple of discussion questions prepared.

1087
01:56:47,004 --> 01:56:54,984
One of the things, if you look through the principles of MSF, one of their guiding principles was neutrality,

1088
01:56:56,214 --> 01:57:00,594
but they also state that neutrality is not synonymous with silence.

1089
01:57:01,494 --> 01:57:06,354
My question that I was pondering was how can nonprofits that function internationally

1090
01:57:06,354 --> 01:57:12,964
continue to remain neutral when you have a global crisis happening or other crises?

1091
01:57:23,064 --> 01:57:28,584
I just feel like helping with, like, disturbed conditions like you were talking about.

1092
01:57:28,584 --> 01:57:35,934
Like there it can make a difference to like helping to make those conditions not inhumane and treat people like people is neutral to me.

1093
01:57:37,344 --> 01:57:41,934
But you also said that MSF is there to advocate for different policies.

1094
01:57:42,144 --> 01:57:50,154
I think that is something that's not neutral. So like, I feel like nonprofits, if they want to be neutral, can still help with like food, water,

1095
01:57:50,154 --> 01:57:55,314
sanitation and things like that that don't really necessarily give them a space I guess they don't want.

1096
01:57:55,704 --> 01:58:01,414
On the actual issue of immigration policy for their students.

1097
01:58:08,534 --> 01:58:13,634
There is a lot of debate about neutrality and how to maintain it.

1098
01:58:13,634 --> 01:58:22,123
And without some people take it as, okay, we're just going to not do it and not have anything to do with it.

1099
01:58:22,124 --> 01:58:27,344
But now everything's is so slanted, just neutral and nice.

1100
01:58:28,124 --> 01:58:34,754
And the other thing that I talked about or wanted to touch on was there was a controversy, but then I messed up.

1101
01:58:35,744 --> 01:58:37,303
I don't know if you guys have heard of it,

1102
01:58:37,304 --> 01:58:45,344
but essentially were the workers were complaining that they were not being treated fairly, they were being called racial slurs.

1103
01:58:45,734 --> 01:58:54,914
There was a difference between the treatment of local workers versus the ex-pats that were working, meaning workers that were working.

1104
01:58:56,414 --> 01:59:01,604
That we're moving to the country to work there.

1105
01:59:03,194 --> 01:59:15,194
So my question was, they were saying that there were any inequities ranged from, well, first being called names, being treated different to even pay.

1106
01:59:15,194 --> 01:59:16,273
Their pay was different.

1107
01:59:16,274 --> 01:59:26,024
And their argument was that, well, these expats have loans and and things like that back home that they have to pay for versus local workers.

1108
01:59:26,984 --> 01:59:32,234
So my question was, how can global non-profits address these inequalities and racism within their

1109
01:59:32,234 --> 01:59:38,174
workforce when they have a mix of local workers and workers that are coming?

1110
01:59:39,174 --> 01:59:42,674
From abroad. Can you clarify it?

1111
01:59:43,854 --> 01:59:48,474
Not that it matters he's being treated disrespectfully.

1112
01:59:49,134 --> 01:59:53,754
But is it local workers that are getting the brunt of it, or is that people that are being outsourced?

1113
01:59:54,414 --> 02:00:02,873
It's the it's the local workers. So they they their complaints ranged from what I mentioned and also to if they

1114
02:00:02,874 --> 02:00:06,474
were to seek health care that the local workers were just being sent to,

1115
02:00:06,474 --> 02:00:13,704
like any local treatment facility where as these ex-pats were being airlifted out for better treatment.

1116
02:00:16,204 --> 02:00:24,204
Is that so? So a couple of hands over here earlier.

1117
02:00:24,784 --> 02:00:29,124
Where in this area you had your hand?

1118
02:00:29,154 --> 02:00:32,494
I was going to answer the first question.

1119
02:00:34,854 --> 02:00:38,844
Do it. Well, thinking about the second one, I mean, I think.

1120
02:00:39,934 --> 02:00:43,803
What? You said that like structure or structural things.

1121
02:00:43,804 --> 02:00:49,144
I mean, it makes me think about like, you know, working in the hospital that, you know, you're your doctor working in the hospital.

1122
02:00:49,554 --> 02:00:53,944
Like like minorities are often getting poor treatment from patients.

1123
02:00:54,244 --> 02:00:59,344
And they're you know, there are certain ways that we can address that. But there are also like structural ways.

1124
02:00:59,344 --> 02:01:04,053
You said that like they're not getting the same. That seems like something should just be the same.

1125
02:01:04,054 --> 02:01:08,314
What you feel like it's something that needs to be sort of like.

1126
02:01:09,964 --> 02:01:13,044
You know, I feel like an obvious and obvious thing that should be done.

1127
02:01:15,474 --> 02:01:23,734
Yeah. Yeah. I feel like these questions have obvious answers, but they're more like you making you think, and you're like, Oh, no, no, no.

1128
02:01:23,744 --> 02:01:28,484
I don't mean I don't mean to your question. I mean, like, those are things that, you know, like the structural stuff, like.

1129
02:01:28,934 --> 02:01:33,463
Yeah, like those. Those should be the things people do.

1130
02:01:33,464 --> 02:01:38,144
But then there's so many other solutions that I feel like are so important. What exactly can you.

1131
02:01:41,714 --> 02:01:49,744
Yeah. I guess like. To address the second question, definitely.

1132
02:01:50,704 --> 02:01:55,354
I think one way that they can address the inequalities is to try and unite people

1133
02:01:55,354 --> 02:02:01,294
around the mission and to try to focus on that address in within a management,

1134
02:02:01,474 --> 02:02:09,124
how you would go to people and be like address, say, hey, this is occurring, we're here to serve these people.

1135
02:02:09,424 --> 02:02:16,564
X potentially be it. I don't know how much I would help, but with the difference in expats being left out,

1136
02:02:17,914 --> 02:02:24,254
that just raises a lot of questions for me because I know like if you are someone say to me,

1137
02:02:24,394 --> 02:02:35,504
what is the greater peace like if you're in peace court and if you're put in this situation, the government has an obligation to do well.

1138
02:02:35,584 --> 02:02:43,324
Like there are certain ways expats could be treated differently just because of how they got there and what organizations are representing.

1139
02:02:43,774 --> 02:02:48,543
So not to say that that's excuse is anything, but just it's like, okay,

1140
02:02:48,544 --> 02:02:56,344
what are what situations are we looking at and how do we look at those different things and accomplish our goal?

1141
02:02:56,404 --> 02:02:59,674
Also taking into account they're coming from different places as well.

1142
02:03:01,914 --> 02:03:07,274
Yeah. Yeah. Going off something that when I was in the Peace Corps,

1143
02:03:07,274 --> 02:03:14,184
something that made both volunteers and the way people works is there's like staff from the US senators,

1144
02:03:14,264 --> 02:03:24,764
local country staff, and then there's the volunteers. And it's something that made a lot of volunteers upset and made a lot of local workers upset.

1145
02:03:25,214 --> 02:03:33,074
Was the country director made like I think it was like $175,000 a year.

1146
02:03:33,434 --> 02:03:36,854
Volunteers were being paid like $250 a month.

1147
02:03:37,334 --> 02:03:42,854
And local workers were making far, far less than $175,000 a year.

1148
02:03:43,514 --> 02:03:52,604
And when somebody had asked about it, one answer was it's just government pay, like pay structures.

1149
02:03:53,084 --> 02:03:56,204
And then the other answer was this government is this.

1150
02:03:56,344 --> 02:04:02,744
This position pays a lot more than most other positions do in this country.

1151
02:04:02,984 --> 02:04:12,104
So it should like it should be good enough. But we, like I personally am along with a lot of other volunteers, thought that was.

1152
02:04:13,294 --> 02:04:20,254
Incorrect. They should be paid the same same level, the same government pay scales because they're being paid by the US government.

1153
02:04:20,794 --> 02:04:32,414
And so something too for the inequities is that depending on the organization, some people don't see that as an inequity because they're like,

1154
02:04:32,564 --> 02:04:36,664
like you said, like the country director had a home in the U.S. and they had a home there.

1155
02:04:36,664 --> 02:04:42,364
And the local workers had just like one on one job.

1156
02:04:42,664 --> 02:04:50,153
And so they were making more than most other people in their area. And so addressing those inequalities is really difficult.

1157
02:04:50,154 --> 02:04:55,104
But I think the first step, at least from what I saw, was pointing it out and asking questions.

1158
02:04:55,104 --> 02:05:01,973
Because if you don't point it out and nobody says anything, especially in this position,

1159
02:05:01,974 --> 02:05:08,873
it's like the job interview backs parts to the asking those questions because if the expats aren't the

1160
02:05:08,874 --> 02:05:15,134
ones asking the questions of local workers will never receive fair and equitable pay or treatment.

1161
02:05:15,144 --> 02:05:23,304
And so I think I think it all starts with the ex-pats and it's the duty of the expats to.

1162
02:05:24,254 --> 02:05:27,474
To. Any racism.

1163
02:05:31,464 --> 02:05:34,704
Excellent as anybody else.

1164
02:05:34,734 --> 02:05:38,554
Did you guys have a question? But more than.

1165
02:05:42,884 --> 02:05:54,794
Excellent presentation as well. Both of today's presentations again highlight some of the questions that we have to continue to consider.

1166
02:05:55,184 --> 02:06:04,423
Appreciate in your present presentation, how you're highlighting some of the key challenges internationally that these organizations

1167
02:06:04,424 --> 02:06:10,903
face and where we can see sometimes in the US some of the interstate issues.

1168
02:06:10,904 --> 02:06:16,724
When we start to lift this out of one country and introduce multiple countries into the equation,

1169
02:06:17,084 --> 02:06:22,004
it gets to be a bit more complex and we have to start asking who is responsible.

1170
02:06:22,184 --> 02:06:30,493
And that's that's a that's a very good question and also a responsibility for the organization to try and wrestle with how to make

1171
02:06:30,494 --> 02:06:36,134
sure that it gets its needs met and holds everyone accountable for the different things that they need to be accountable for.

1172
02:06:36,144 --> 02:06:42,014
Thank you for that. You can take the next okay to excellent presentations.

1173
02:06:42,014 --> 02:06:47,534
Here's what we're going to do is we had a very lively discussion today, a lot of different things to talk about, which is great.

1174
02:06:48,104 --> 02:06:52,723
We're going to take a ten minute break because we need to take a break. Take a group that's up today.

1175
02:06:52,724 --> 02:06:57,374
I want you to present your case and then we'll see how we do.

1176
02:06:57,644 --> 02:07:03,294
And we'll pick up the other half of the discussion of the case next week in our on our class session on.

1177
02:07:03,644 --> 02:07:08,324
I'm doing okay. Yeah, I think so.

1178
02:07:10,454 --> 02:07:16,044
Yeah. Well, I guess it's up to any example.

1179
02:07:17,894 --> 02:07:24,924
So just present today because I just wanted to get home from work.

1180
02:07:29,464 --> 02:07:38,904
I think we're going to have an assignment once a little bit.

1181
02:07:39,344 --> 02:07:58,694
Like it's just like, you know, become, you know, like I say, yeah, we come back.

1182
02:07:58,714 --> 02:08:12,824
I just I was want to go to 1.6 years ago.

1183
02:08:14,494 --> 02:08:29,504
So I think that's something you should just like to know.

1184
02:08:29,684 --> 02:08:34,544
And we'll pick up our 8 minutes, 628 for picking up at 628.

1185
02:08:37,454 --> 02:08:51,014
Yeah, I'll click through you'll tell me where you have my baby.

1186
02:08:51,074 --> 02:09:00,194
But I was always that. It was like I'm like, okay.

1187
02:09:05,114 --> 02:09:06,920
And I was planning on doing so.

1188
02:09:09,735 --> 02:09:14,355
All right. I will make a speech to make it.

1189
02:09:18,435 --> 02:09:22,935
Good evening, everyone. It's nice and rainy out, so we're going to get that good atmosphere with us.

1190
02:09:23,775 --> 02:09:29,625
So today we're presenting as a community center, blood center for the Carolinas, going from unity.

1191
02:09:30,285 --> 02:09:36,104
Hopefully all came and with the case read. We are on the case right all of the cases are lucky.

1192
02:09:36,105 --> 02:09:39,405
Break. Don't discuss till next week. So you have another week to refresh.

1193
02:09:40,335 --> 02:09:45,945
So we're going to go ahead and move in to kind of talk about what happened with your dad.

1194
02:09:45,945 --> 02:09:49,995
But we'll go through it again and then we'll kind of discuss strategies and such.

1195
02:09:50,205 --> 02:09:54,855
But before we do that, we want to, of course, highlight Michigan, which knows how to do.

1196
02:09:55,035 --> 02:10:07,395
Yes. And we had Isle Royale. And so Isle Royale was first established in the 1940s and it was created as a national park.

1197
02:10:07,905 --> 02:10:12,075
And Isle Royale is located just up here off of the sea up.

1198
02:10:12,075 --> 02:10:15,115
And often it's on YouTube, you know,

1199
02:10:16,265 --> 02:10:26,545
that it's actually far closer to Minnesota and to Ontario and was used as a hunting ground for Native Americans prior to colonization.

1200
02:10:26,805 --> 02:10:32,205
And it's only a 13 mile canoe ride from Minnesota to Isle Royale.

1201
02:10:32,265 --> 02:10:38,415
And so it was like a natural, wonderful place for them to go hunting, basically.

1202
02:10:39,345 --> 02:10:54,955
And Lake Superior. Lake Superior is known for being huge, but this island is the seventh least visited island or national park in the United States,

1203
02:10:54,955 --> 02:10:56,364
which I thought was really interesting,

1204
02:10:56,365 --> 02:11:05,815
but also not surprise because I am from the U.P. and I know nobody goes there willingly and so it moves that there are a lot of wolves there.

1205
02:11:06,355 --> 02:11:13,165
And so it is. The longest running trade predator study in history has been run on Isle Royale.

1206
02:11:13,615 --> 02:11:21,745
And every time the wolf population declines or the moose population declines, the study kind of tries to rehabilitate both populations.

1207
02:11:22,045 --> 02:11:28,555
And it has been it was I read a little bit about it. It was really interesting because every time the moose population drops,

1208
02:11:28,555 --> 02:11:35,035
the population drops drastically because really it's only a source of good nutrition for the wolves on the island.

1209
02:11:35,365 --> 02:11:45,735
So, yeah, that's I. Go ahead and jump in back once I start jumping far.

1210
02:11:46,065 --> 02:11:49,575
Oh. Oh, oh. Okay. I'm going to differently.

1211
02:11:49,575 --> 02:11:57,025
So I'll just read the the mission for the Community Blood Banks Blood Center of Carolina's.

1212
02:11:57,045 --> 02:12:01,845
The mission is to provide local control of blood supply, ensuring that local needs were met first,

1213
02:12:02,145 --> 02:12:10,135
and providing doctors greater choices for blood products and services that best meet the needs of their patients and for ease.

1214
02:12:10,155 --> 02:12:14,255
From now on, I will be referring to this blood center as PCC.

1215
02:12:14,475 --> 02:12:20,084
So we're on the same page. So to give a little background on the program itself,

1216
02:12:20,085 --> 02:12:25,725
it was founded by area hospitals in order to better provide for the community with the Carolinas.

1217
02:12:26,025 --> 02:12:29,984
They found they were having a hard time with one of the major players in this case,

1218
02:12:29,985 --> 02:12:35,595
which is the American Red Cross, and getting the blood that really fit the people and their needs.

1219
02:12:36,255 --> 02:12:44,835
So they formed it and then they were looking to find a way to enter the market that directly serve that mission that we just stated.

1220
02:12:45,765 --> 02:12:51,255
And so I did a little background digging because this is what I do in my free time, apparently.

1221
02:12:51,615 --> 02:12:57,685
And I went to their Facebook site and their definition there as well, says KB.

1222
02:12:57,705 --> 02:13:02,555
CC remains a primary blood supplier in the region's hospitals and patients in both Carolinas.

1223
02:13:02,555 --> 02:13:06,764
So north and south CDC collects blood from generous donors.

1224
02:13:06,765 --> 02:13:14,174
The Carolinas, each day at five donation centers are mobile blood drives, which sounds kind of empirically realized.

1225
02:13:14,175 --> 02:13:17,564
But, you know, that's good. And then every drop stays here saving local lives.

1226
02:13:17,565 --> 02:13:20,745
So mission plays a really key part in what we're looking at today.

1227
02:13:21,315 --> 02:13:24,405
Next slide, please. So we're going to set the scene.

1228
02:13:24,555 --> 02:13:27,645
A weather did it for us. It is 2010.

1229
02:13:27,795 --> 02:13:31,245
You are. I was too young to remember that time.

1230
02:13:31,965 --> 02:13:37,785
But so we are down here eight years out.

1231
02:13:38,925 --> 02:13:46,575
Don't think about where you are. Don't support us and we're here to discuss what to do moving forward.

1232
02:13:47,145 --> 02:13:51,135
So next slide, please. So we have little precedents.

1233
02:13:51,825 --> 02:13:56,115
So in the early 20, 20 thousands, so it's been about ten years.

1234
02:13:56,445 --> 02:14:04,754
That's when the hospitals came together to form this and they started taking in blood donations from the local area and they were

1235
02:14:04,755 --> 02:14:13,005
able to maintain a cost some really big about that accessibility and that includes as includes financial accessibility as well.

1236
02:14:13,335 --> 02:14:18,885
And they were able to keep all their blood prices about $50 lower than a lot of the hospitals in the area.

1237
02:14:19,095 --> 02:14:20,325
So that's really great. Right.

1238
02:14:20,955 --> 02:14:29,354
But on the other hand, Cbk has a history of not collecting enough blood for their community, so they filled in that gap with the American Red Cross.

1239
02:14:29,355 --> 02:14:34,545
So kind of seeing a little bit of tension there already. And then another thing to know, which is important,

1240
02:14:34,545 --> 02:14:39,105
because we are looking at the Carolinas as a community and they're trying to serve the community and their needs.

1241
02:14:39,765 --> 02:14:45,945
One of the major things that are going on are a lot of these blood illnesses and one of those being sickle cell.

1242
02:14:45,945 --> 02:14:52,635
And you see that one of the strategies. So we as here gathered here today at 2010,

1243
02:14:53,355 --> 02:14:58,695
we are tasked with evaluating the seven different strategies and deciding which one we want to move forward with.

1244
02:15:00,885 --> 02:15:05,924
So our potential strategies. So it was listed out.

1245
02:15:05,925 --> 02:15:10,325
We had a lot of definitions in the case which you. All right. Right.

1246
02:15:11,205 --> 02:15:12,585
Okay, good.

1247
02:15:12,615 --> 02:15:26,145
I'm going to start attestations so you can read them by increasing specialized blood services, by pooling donors, cord blood, blood storage,

1248
02:15:26,145 --> 02:15:34,695
therapeutic apheresis or transfusion service have a center that provides the reference lab, improved blood areas,

1249
02:15:34,935 --> 02:15:40,185
expand geographically, and then seven, redoubling efforts to increase donations or additional collection sites.

1250
02:15:40,845 --> 02:15:47,475
And then so the big question is what strategy should we pursue first looking at all of these?

1251
02:15:47,565 --> 02:15:51,195
It's a little hard to look at them all and go, okay, which which is great.

1252
02:15:51,975 --> 02:15:56,745
So we're going to move on to the next slide. I did a little quick calculation.

1253
02:15:57,165 --> 02:16:03,074
Addition is good for me. So this is what we saw in our packet.

1254
02:16:03,075 --> 02:16:06,195
There was like a they kind of estimated how much each would cost.

1255
02:16:06,195 --> 02:16:09,674
I just kind of added it all together. So you see it.

1256
02:16:09,675 --> 02:16:14,415
But you also note that all these asterisks I put in, it's a low estimate.

1257
02:16:14,425 --> 02:16:18,405
So a lot of these values that were given is probably going to cost more.

1258
02:16:18,975 --> 02:16:23,694
But it's really good to walk in kind of knowing the general estimates of what each strategy would look like,

1259
02:16:23,695 --> 02:16:26,955
because this is what you as the strategy board is going to be considering heavily.

1260
02:16:27,555 --> 02:16:31,685
Next slide, please. Yeah.

1261
02:16:31,695 --> 02:16:38,175
So with this we had a couple of questions that we thought were the most important and vital to this.

1262
02:16:38,575 --> 02:16:45,555
So the first is what is Cbc.ca capable of providing today with our current financial situation?

1263
02:16:46,395 --> 02:16:54,255
Which strategy makes the most sense? But aside from our current situation financially, what are our priorities?

1264
02:16:54,885 --> 02:17:01,485
And that includes what are the current needs of the community? How long does the debt or how does the demographic composition impact the community?

1265
02:17:01,995 --> 02:17:10,965
Which was really relevant and the strategy regarding sickle cell and are there underserved communities within the community that we need to consider?

1266
02:17:11,865 --> 02:17:15,075
And finally, what are CBCS long term goals?

1267
02:17:17,145 --> 02:17:21,375
What steps need to be taken either internally policy focused,

1268
02:17:21,675 --> 02:17:27,654
structural changes within the organization or financial changes in order for us to get there.

1269
02:17:27,655 --> 02:17:31,845
And this is also seen in some of the other strategies like expanding the hospital network.

1270
02:17:33,075 --> 02:17:38,025
And then lastly is how do the goals serve CBC's larger mission?

1271
02:17:39,785 --> 02:17:42,904
So this led us to our recommendation,

1272
02:17:42,905 --> 02:17:48,064
which is to first of the seven strategies needs to be to increase the blood supplies

1273
02:17:48,065 --> 02:17:52,475
in the areas that we are already currently working in as a penetration strategy.

1274
02:17:52,595 --> 02:17:57,425
If we can get all the blood supplies that we need up for all of the area hospitals,

1275
02:17:57,875 --> 02:18:07,805
then that would kind of cut the American Red Cross out, which is exactly what Cdcc was for, was to lower blood prices.

1276
02:18:08,705 --> 02:18:18,065
And as Olivia said earlier, Cbc.ca has had a history of not reaching the blood demands or the supplies for the demand in the area.

1277
02:18:18,905 --> 02:18:29,525
And so with the high scores in donor and sponsor satisfaction there, it has been proven that CBRC has higher scores than the American Red Cross.

1278
02:18:29,735 --> 02:18:34,745
Red Cross and both donors and people who are hosting them are really happy doing so.

1279
02:18:35,045 --> 02:18:41,465
And so we would like to continue to grow that because that means lower blood prices for the community.

1280
02:18:41,825 --> 02:18:52,955
And this would also be an ability for Cbrc to really expand in a lot of ways and grow their network.

1281
02:18:53,315 --> 02:18:56,105
The American Red Cross, as I stated in the case, was.

1282
02:18:57,635 --> 02:19:03,334
The reason a lot of people host American Red Cross drives is because they have greater connections.

1283
02:19:03,335 --> 02:19:09,305
They have a larger network. A lot of people from these major hosting areas sit on the board for the American Red Cross.

1284
02:19:09,635 --> 02:19:17,105
And so the goal by doing more blood drives, by getting out there and expanding our network, would be to become that same thing for the Carolinas.

1285
02:19:19,025 --> 02:19:24,265
And with this, there's a couple of costs considering which are marketing more blood mobiles possibly.

1286
02:19:24,875 --> 02:19:29,975
That's not a subsidy, but it would allow us to have more drives, new staff, volunteers,

1287
02:19:29,975 --> 02:19:35,285
and then payments for donor milestones, focusing on how many times they have donated blood.

1288
02:19:38,535 --> 02:19:46,395
Okay. So further considerations. So more things to kind of think about as we move forward in evaluating strategies.

1289
02:19:47,145 --> 02:19:53,535
Of course, the budgeting, financial statements, unfortunately, we run on money in this world.

1290
02:19:53,655 --> 02:19:59,865
I know it's a sad conclusion you'll have to reach, but that is a main way in which we can get a lot of resources.

1291
02:20:00,435 --> 02:20:03,455
So really looking at those. Another thing to look at is the stakeholders.

1292
02:20:03,455 --> 02:20:09,915
So this is going to be very important, especially if we pursue the strategy as it is a strategy that involves the community.

1293
02:20:10,125 --> 02:20:15,075
It does involve reaching out to people. It does involve getting more donors from within our area.

1294
02:20:15,975 --> 02:20:21,855
And so kind of listed subheading, some of the stakeholders that we asked you might be more interested in.

1295
02:20:21,885 --> 02:20:26,865
So local and state governments and NGOs, they're going to be really crucial in partnering with us.

1296
02:20:28,245 --> 02:20:34,535
Also looking at on the ground management, what does the people who actually go through the provision and actually collect the blood,

1297
02:20:34,545 --> 02:20:36,285
what is their kind of take on this as well?

1298
02:20:36,825 --> 02:20:42,615
They're going to have a lot to say, hopefully, and kind of give us guidance as to whether our strategy is feasible in the first place.

1299
02:20:42,615 --> 02:20:47,655
Again, harkening back to what we discussed before with like, can we manage this today?

1300
02:20:48,405 --> 02:20:54,555
Next is looking at the blood providers that's going to be our community members, kind of tying into the Carolina citizen representatives.

1301
02:20:54,555 --> 02:20:58,355
I like to call them our civil societies, all your family.

1302
02:20:59,115 --> 02:21:02,535
But kind of looking at them, what they say, is it possible?

1303
02:21:02,815 --> 02:21:09,525
Do we have more people who are willing to give blood? Are the people who are maybe giving the blood and leave the blood?

1304
02:21:09,555 --> 02:21:15,225
What do they have to say about the strategy as well? So really going through and looking at those people.

1305
02:21:15,465 --> 02:21:23,114
Yeah. And so in order and the question is what order do we establish all seven of these strategies?

1306
02:21:23,115 --> 02:21:26,535
Because as you saw in the case, all seven strategies are going to be implemented.

1307
02:21:26,805 --> 02:21:31,785
The job that we have is to decide what's what the processes we came up.

1308
02:21:32,085 --> 02:21:35,715
It's in our annex we are going to use in the discussion. We'll see it next week.

1309
02:21:36,915 --> 02:21:42,315
The the list that we came up with but sorry,

1310
02:21:43,815 --> 02:21:49,725
those who came up with a starting with increasing collections as a penetration strategy, then moving to inventory management.

1311
02:21:51,225 --> 02:22:01,215
After that would be pooling donors for sickle cell disease and then after that, adding a new hospital in the market area as a development strategy.

1312
02:22:01,455 --> 02:22:06,525
Once we have more blood, we can give more blood to more hospitals and also collect more blood from those areas.

1313
02:22:07,785 --> 02:22:14,595
And after that, creating a basic reference lab collection and public storage of cord blood.

1314
02:22:14,745 --> 02:22:18,195
And finally, therapeutic apheresis as a new service.

1315
02:22:18,615 --> 02:22:25,664
That's what the reason we did it in this order, too, is because it directly addresses a lot of the challenges that you run through in the case.

1316
02:22:25,665 --> 02:22:29,475
So the challenge is getting enough provision. That was the big thing.

1317
02:22:30,105 --> 02:22:31,845
Another big thing was the financial look.

1318
02:22:32,085 --> 02:22:40,064
This is a pretty financially feasible strategy from the get go and then we kind of the order it might seem a little what it's what's going on.

1319
02:22:40,065 --> 02:22:43,995
But again, addressing the community, the community's needs, the demographic differences,

1320
02:22:44,235 --> 02:22:47,505
we tried to take that into account as well with the strategy orders. Yeah.

1321
02:22:47,565 --> 02:22:53,115
And we also didn't want to anger any current stakeholders, which was a big deal for us,

1322
02:22:54,195 --> 02:22:57,445
the biggest stakeholders being the hospitals that originally created CBC.

1323
02:22:59,355 --> 02:23:04,785
There was a worry that if we expanded new hospitals, actually I think this is the next slide now.

1324
02:23:07,695 --> 02:23:11,325
So it's not quite, but I'll get there.

1325
02:23:12,855 --> 02:23:20,265
So for the implementation strategy, when you consider what happens today over the next fiscal quarter and over the next year and beyond then.

1326
02:23:21,165 --> 02:23:27,165
So some of the some of the things for this implementation strategy that we really want to consider is hiring new staff.

1327
02:23:27,165 --> 02:23:31,305
We think that is really important both for blood collection and inventory management.

1328
02:23:31,665 --> 02:23:39,105
And we also want to break down the steps of the strategy that we want to implement first,

1329
02:23:39,195 --> 02:23:44,205
so that when we are starting to implement the other strategies collection of blood is,

1330
02:23:44,715 --> 02:23:50,595
which is our main priority is set in stone and we understand every into the process of how to go from there.

1331
02:23:56,415 --> 02:23:59,415
So what happens after we put in place our first strategy?

1332
02:23:59,715 --> 02:24:06,845
We need to know how long we want to wait until we implement the strategy. We have most of the infrastructure right now to be able to jump in.

1333
02:24:06,855 --> 02:24:12,455
All that we will need to do is really focus on networking and more donor blood drives.

1334
02:24:13,455 --> 02:24:17,414
We also want to monitor a successful do this through counting the number of drives

1335
02:24:17,415 --> 02:24:21,555
and the amount of blood we collect and to track both quarterly and annually.

1336
02:24:22,155 --> 02:24:28,665
Quarterly Customer Satisfaction Testimonies Monitor the Carolina blood supply trends overall.

1337
02:24:28,905 --> 02:24:33,975
And we also want to check in with the public. We want to check in with the donors. We want to check in with the people who are hosting us.

1338
02:24:33,975 --> 02:24:40,175
And also we want to talk to any doctors in the hospitals that we are giving this.

1339
02:24:40,185 --> 02:24:49,725
And if we look at these, even our evaluation methods still go back again to the overall mission of maintaining our bond

1340
02:24:49,725 --> 02:24:54,025
with the community and making sure we're really serving who we're trying to serve as we get it up.

1341
02:24:54,105 --> 02:25:01,755
So please, please. Yes. Finally is our alternatives, which is what I was kind of getting at earlier.

1342
02:25:02,115 --> 02:25:06,115
So. But eliminate. Do you want to. Oh, okay.

1343
02:25:06,345 --> 02:25:09,255
Yes. So some issues with our recommendations.

1344
02:25:09,795 --> 02:25:17,444
So there's some more specific buckets of resources that we might might need to put on hold to kind of delegate or would need.

1345
02:25:17,445 --> 02:25:20,505
And is that going to, of course, cause issues within the community?

1346
02:25:21,165 --> 02:25:26,505
Blood is not something that you can just forego. So something we need to consider as well.

1347
02:25:27,195 --> 02:25:32,025
Inventory management as another strategy is going to be necessary one way or another.

1348
02:25:32,745 --> 02:25:36,855
That's just going to be something we're going to need to do, which is why it's number two on our list.

1349
02:25:37,755 --> 02:25:45,165
And then another option was to include more hospitals in which caused a lot more management issues,

1350
02:25:45,585 --> 02:25:52,904
but it could still lead to a greater blood supply so that in the same way that donor of it could.

1351
02:25:52,905 --> 02:26:00,075
So some things we were kind of lingering in the back of our mind even as we were certain that our strategy is right.

1352
02:26:00,255 --> 02:26:05,295
So yes. And I think the biggest thing is each of these come with their own issues.

1353
02:26:05,295 --> 02:26:10,905
Right. This is the our our recommendation is probably one of the cheapest sort is one of the cheapest options.

1354
02:26:11,205 --> 02:26:15,315
We have that infrastructure, like I was talking about, inventory management is necessary.

1355
02:26:15,565 --> 02:26:18,895
We have to have a lot of people to buy into that. Hospitals will need more i.t.

1356
02:26:18,915 --> 02:26:28,235
Staff we will need more i.t. Staff and it's it's expensive to create the inventory management that we need adding new hospitals.

1357
02:26:28,245 --> 02:26:34,695
Like I was saying, it can really we don't want to anger any of the original stakeholders and we want to ensure that we have enough blood

1358
02:26:34,695 --> 02:26:40,905
that when we expand to new hospitals that that those hospitals we can also start to meet their demands as well.

1359
02:26:41,205 --> 02:26:48,315
And we want to have the infrastructure with donor events so that we can collect more blood from those areas of the hospitals that we're serving.

1360
02:26:48,645 --> 02:26:52,905
Another thing we can add to is that in one of the papers we read for class today,

1361
02:26:53,415 --> 02:26:59,355
they discussed how one nonprofit advertising leads to a lot of other benefits and other nonprofits as well.

1362
02:27:00,045 --> 02:27:03,545
So this should definitely be something we kind of put on the table and be like,

1363
02:27:03,545 --> 02:27:07,305
Hey, if we do this, well, this improves everyone else in our community.

1364
02:27:07,305 --> 02:27:12,555
So something that leads us to, again, believe that our strategy is the best strategy.

1365
02:27:12,825 --> 02:27:17,175
Yes. So this is when we would go into the discussions, which we're going to start next week.

1366
02:27:17,175 --> 02:27:18,435
So be prepared. Yes.

1367
02:27:19,095 --> 02:27:24,435
If you want to know what we're going to do, we're going to break everyone into six groups and we're going to give each of you a strategy.

1368
02:27:24,585 --> 02:27:31,095
And then we will come back. We'll defend our strategy. We'll have you all defend the strategy that you're assigned as well.

1369
02:27:31,905 --> 02:27:37,995
And then simulating what happened in the paper, which is what the board did in the paper, that was brilliant.

1370
02:27:39,375 --> 02:27:45,785
And then after that, we do have a couple updates of where it is now and should we do that now or after next week?

1371
02:27:45,825 --> 02:27:49,085
That's good. That way everyone can do that. Okay. Yeah.

1372
02:27:49,305 --> 02:27:52,905
I feel like we should get everyone to weigh in before we reveal the brand.

1373
02:27:53,425 --> 02:28:00,525
Yeah. Excellent. Okay.

1374
02:28:01,365 --> 02:28:05,925
All right, so here. Here's where we are. We got, uh, 3 minutes.

1375
02:28:06,135 --> 02:28:11,835
Okay. First of all, thank you to our Isle Royale group today for an excellent presentation.

1376
02:28:12,555 --> 02:28:19,845
I asked them before if we could do it this way. So sometimes this will happen where we have to split it over depending on how our discussion goes.

1377
02:28:20,275 --> 02:28:27,465
So we have some space, and I think it's a privilege to be able to facilitate your discussion next week.

1378
02:28:28,305 --> 02:28:35,175
And we've said three times already we'll all have read the case for next week's class as well.

1379
02:28:35,865 --> 02:28:47,865
So that way when we do, their discussion will be so enjoy it because you've read twice and it was thought to be fantastic reading what's going on?

1380
02:28:49,035 --> 02:28:56,205
We will meet next week on Zoom. Um, so like I said, setting up the Zoom link, it'll be on this as well.

1381
02:28:56,455 --> 02:28:59,685
Um, and then I will add,

1382
02:28:59,775 --> 02:29:10,575
based on the feedback I'm hearing in October for you to work on that then so we can work on finishing up your papers, the projects that day.

1383
02:29:10,755 --> 02:29:17,985
The deadline remains the same. I'll be available if you need me to respond to questions on Slack, what have you.

1384
02:29:18,315 --> 02:29:24,165
I just use that day as a day to kind of get your practice down and it's a big lift, the first assignment.

1385
02:29:24,165 --> 02:29:28,695
So it's probably the biggest one, obviously. This will give you some space to work on it.

1386
02:29:29,205 --> 02:29:40,675
Um, as always, I appreciate everyone's thoughtful contributions and I hope everyone has a good week, and it's always a pleasure to meet you.

1387
02:29:41,005 --> 02:29:55,995
Next week I'm going to be ready by March 29.

1388
02:29:56,655 --> 02:29:57,115
So I.
