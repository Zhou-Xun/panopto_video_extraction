1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,870
And. Yeah, yeah.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,840
No. Know what you saw? I just didn't. I didn't.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,360
I could just go and watch.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,800
So you had everything that was interesting to me.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:33,520
So you watch those guys, you know, screaming my favorite places.

6
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,420
I mean, there were a few, but I think I suppose I couldn't sleep.

7
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,320
Think at the end because I feel happy about it.

8
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,670
Very fortunate that she got to as well.

9
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,570
All right. We'll get it started. So welcome to just a few.

10
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:03,170
So some of you need to hand in or email me your report since last week on their books.

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,840
You know, I know some of you have attended court two or three weeks ago and sort of all.

12
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,110
But you don't have a mailbox. Put it back in your mailbox, but you don't have one.

13
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,090
So you come to my office like after Clerks.

14
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:23,580
I mean, I just like checks because it's not gonna make a big difference to your life if you get it back or not.

15
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,580
But I did read it. Okay,

16
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:33,479
so today we have Andy Roberts talking and certainly will become also sort of hanging

17
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,710
out in my office 10 to 1030 if anyone wants to meet her or talk to her afterwards.

18
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,460
Questions about her material she's presenting. I tend to confide in my office.

19
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:49,500
So Emily was a is a professor at the University of Iowa.

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:57,900
And she just started that job. And it just I think this year it's being cut up in 2022 from this department.

21
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,620
So she knows about some of her work. Yeah.

22
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,370
Thanks. Thanks, everyone. And I'm happy to be here and to be back.

23
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,910
Announcements are now present on some of my work about surrogacy validation and specifically

24
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:19,799
methods that I worked on for time to event data or survival of the sexes for prostate cancer trial.

25
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,800
And I'll be describing the illness stats models that I'm proposing.

26
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:30,299
So first, I want to go through some background that sort of explains why surrogate end points are.

27
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:37,290
So that's the context of the method and also the background about causal inference for those who are not as familiar.

28
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:46,560
So the purpose of the method is to try and validate a surrogate end point, so a surrogate and point to some intermediate outcome in a trial.

29
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:54,720
So you're probably familiar that a clinical trial, we're trying to determine if there's something that we usually have some endpoint of interest.

30
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,090
I'll call that the true outcome, that we are hoping that the treatment will improve in some way.

31
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,740
And while clinical trials are great, they often can take a long time to run and can be quite expensive.

32
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,030
So the idea is that perhaps instead of measuring this to outcome that we're interested in,

33
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:18,440
maybe instead we can measure some intermediate outcome that serves as some sort of stand in or substitute.

34
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,990
Maybe we can measure it earlier and we can measure it more easily.

35
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,600
And in that way that will make the trial run more quickly or more efficiently and be beneficial.

36
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,750
So I'll be referring to the surrogate employee as us and then our true outcome as a team.

37
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,939
And so it's kind of the variables in play. I'm showing this little diagram.

38
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,229
So we have our treatment that will be referred to as Z and kind of conceptually.

39
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:51,570
And we hope that our surrogate S is sort of capturing whatever treatment effect is actually happening on the true outcome.

40
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,350
So kind of conceptually, you know, we'd hope that if there's a treatment effect on D that there's also a treatment effect

41
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,120
on us and that there's some notion that it's sort of going through the surrogate.

42
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:11,940
So a few examples of potential surrogate outcomes that are out there that people are either trying to validate or maybe are being used.

43
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,290
And one example would be an immune response for a vaccine.

44
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:23,940
So, for example, the COVID vaccines, the ultimate outcome is that they are helping to limit severe disease.

45
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:30,810
Of course, they had to wait until they observed enough people getting cold enough for the vaccine to determine whether or not that worked.

46
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,469
Perhaps instead we could measure an immune response to the vaccine.

47
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,950
That's something that we could measure relatively shortly after the vaccine is given.

48
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,030
And then you can imagine that the trial would run faster because our outcome can be measured.

49
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,379
And then in the setting of prostate cancer, a surrogate end point that has tried to be validated,

50
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,630
though not particularly successfully, is this prostate specific antigen value.

51
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:04,799
So basically this measure of PSA in men has been assessed to see if can we measure this and determine once the PSA value sort of

52
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:12,660
reaches a certain level that this is an okay and point to use for a trial to determine if a drug works for prostate cancer patients.

53
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:21,810
And there's been some problems with that. So this idea of the proper surrogate outcome for a prostate cancer trial is still a bit open, I would say.

54
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,530
So I mentioned that the idea is that we're trying to validate the surrogate end point.

55
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:34,040
So by that, I just mean is it okay to use the surrogate outcome as the endpoint?

56
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:39,740
Like the only one that you would measure in a future trial. So in general, this is like a pretty large goal.

57
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,660
I would say it's not a decision that you'd want to make lightly, to use a certain point in a trial.

58
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,150
And overall, I would say it's challenging to sort of properly validate the endpoint.

59
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:56,959
So you might think that we can sort of conceptualize what sorts of endpoints may be correlated with each other,

60
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,100
and maybe we can use that as a surrogate. But in general, that's not really sufficient.

61
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,200
We need to do something a little bit more rigorous in order to sort of check all the boxes to make sure it's

62
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,840
safe to use the service anyway and will give us valid decisions about whether or not something that works.

63
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,159
So I'm very glad we're going to be thinking about this in a causal sense.

64
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,430
So we could say that as the surrogate is a good causal surrogate.

65
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,200
And then, you know, if we say that it's a good surrogate, then we could use it in a future trial.

66
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,580
And you can talk a little bit more about like how the future trial maybe needs to be similar to the current trial.

67
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,840
But in general, we like to use it in like a similar type of trial in the future.

68
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,979
So the framework that I'm using for this work is a causal framework, as I mentioned.

69
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,100
So we're going to be using the potential outcomes framework.

70
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:51,450
So in this framework of potential outcomes, which relatedly are sometimes called counterfactual outcomes,

71
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:59,639
are going to use this notation where we designate the outcome associated with this parentheses that basically

72
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,640
says this is the potential outcome either of the surrogate or the true outcome under a certain treatment.

73
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:11,010
So you can imagine that we have a binary treatment, which is what we'll be considering.

74
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:18,970
So Z only based on the value zero or one positive outcome under treatment zero and then also the true outcome under treatment one.

75
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,860
So this is what I mean, five potential outcomes. You have to think hypothetically,

76
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:29,040
what would the outcome be under the treatment that's not given in addition to the outcome that you can actually observe?

77
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:35,849
So the idea of method I'll be working with is known as principle stratification

78
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,780
or sometimes principle surrogacy in the setting is that we're going to use the

79
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,149
collection of potential outcomes in order to sort of come up with a statistical

80
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:50,010
model in order to make some progress towards eventually validating the surrogate.

81
00:07:50,790 --> 00:08:00,149
So here again, we have a binary treatment and so we have four potential outcomes and sort of like the most basic sense you can imagine as of zero,

82
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,310
as of one zero on t of one.

83
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:11,340
And then I just want to give a little bit of motivation for the methods I mentioned that I'll be talking about time two event outcomes,

84
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,350
but I think it's a little bit nice to get some motivation about this principle

85
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,830
stratification framework and like a little bit less complicated setting.

86
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:27,030
So I'll be talking about how this joint distribution would look in like the most simple case where we have continuous outcomes.

87
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:34,049
So you consider the joint distribution of these outcomes in some way and then of course is going to be causal.

88
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:38,300
So there's this sense that we're not actually going to observe all of the potential outcomes.

89
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,910
We're only going to observe certain outcomes based on what treatment was given.

90
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:51,680
So the idea of principal stratification and in general is that we wanted to find some causal treatment effect that's conditional on strata.

91
00:08:51,690 --> 00:09:00,179
So that's where that principle stratification comes in. And the strata are subgroups of patients that we're conditioning on in the causal sense are

92
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:07,020
defined by some set of the observed and counterfactual values of S and then as I mentioned,

93
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,520
so I want to give some motive against motivation in the multivariate normal setting.

94
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:18,089
So here I want to show some examples where the expectation that we're interested in

95
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:23,160
to try and come up with a validation metric is based on this conditional expectation.

96
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,710
So I mentioned the idea of principle stratification is that we're conditioning on some subgroups of patients.

97
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,449
So here in this expectation, we have some expected treatment effect, right?

98
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:39,240
So the treatment effect on the true outcome is sort of this contrast of T one and T zero,

99
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:46,680
and then we're conditioning on some contrast that's defined by these counterfactual values of F zero and S1.

100
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,829
So again, in like a nice setting where s into your continuous,

101
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:58,260
I think that's where it's easiest to sort of conceptualize this contrast being a difference in outcomes.

102
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:06,540
We can write this conditional expectation in terms of two quick two key quantities that I am calling Yemenite and Gamma one.

103
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,750
And basically in this multivariate normal setting,

104
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:17,610
we have two quantities and we have two conditions on these that we're trying to determine cause or not.

105
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:24,059
So here how we're determining if the surrogate is valid is by essentially estimating this conditional

106
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:29,640
expectation and determining if gamma not is equal to zero and Gamma one is not equal to zero.

107
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,200
So there's sort of a lot of parameters floating around here.

108
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,709
But just to give some intuition about what these gamma non gamma one quantities are and how this sort of principle

109
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:47,220
stratification and this idea of making subgroups based on these counterfactuals looks in a graphical form.

110
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,110
There's this nice quantity or graph known as the causal effect, predictive ness plot.

111
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:58,200
So here I'm showing on the x axis our contrast on the surrogate outcome.

112
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,770
So the x axis is showing x one -0.

113
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:08,340
And then on the y axis, we're showing that conditional expectation, which again I said is equal to gamma plus gamma one.

114
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:15,120
S So basically the idea of this plot is that we can again think of subgroups of individuals.

115
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,389
So there's some group of individuals who would have some value on the x axis equal to zero,

116
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,560
where there's essentially no causal effect on the surrogate outcome.

117
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:34,020
So the idea of the quantity that gamma not is equal to zero corresponds to this subgroup where they have no causal treatment effect on us.

118
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:44,310
So in a valid surrogate, those individuals would correspond to having no causal effect on the true outcome, which is what's shown on the Y axis.

119
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:52,020
So essentially, if the surrogate is valid, we would want the individuals to have some coordinate on this plot that would go through the origin.

120
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,580
So that corresponds to the idea that this gamma not value is equal to zero.

121
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:06,750
And then we can also think about the subgroup of patients who have some positive treatment effect so that this x axis value is greater than zero.

122
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,000
So those patients would lie somewhere in this space.

123
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:17,700
And we would also hope that if they have some causal effect on us, that there's also some causal effect on T in case of a valid surrogate.

124
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,339
So in that case, they would live somewhere in this region and that corresponds to having a positive slope on this curve,

125
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,040
which corresponds to Gamma One being greater than zero.

126
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:34,170
So here I'm basically showing two potential curves that could be plotted based on our estimates of this conditional expectation,

127
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,120
one of which meets our criteria of going through the origin involving a positive slope,

128
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:47,880
which would be a valid surrogate, and then one that does not meet these one or either of these criteria, and that would be determined as invalid.

129
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:56,780
For those who are sort of interested in understanding better what are these phenomena and gamma one quantities,

130
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:05,690
we can kind of look statistically at our assumed model that we're making about these continuous potential outcomes.

131
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:10,400
So here I'm showing that again, we have the distribution of our four potential outcomes.

132
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,920
We're making an assumption that they're multivariate normal,

133
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,930
and then we can write out their distribution in terms of means variances and correlations.

134
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:23,980
And then essentially these parameters that we're trying to estimate that I showed on the C plot,

135
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,139
Gamma and Gamma One, these are functions of these parameters.

136
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:34,220
So basically what we're trying to do in the methods is estimate this is all the parameters in this distribution.

137
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,290
And then we come up with some functional form of these gamma.

138
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:46,850
And on gamma one parameters, there are some difficulties in actually doing this estimation, one of which is that we're in this causal setting,

139
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:51,890
we're raising potential outcomes that aren't observed and we have some non identified parameters.

140
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:59,420
So that's sort of a difficulty that we have to consider in the methods and how we're going to handle this idea of identify ability.

141
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:06,200
And so sort of the work that I did at the beginning of my Ph.D. was in the setting where outcomes are continuous.

142
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,669
And I did some work about sort of handling some of these identify ability

143
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,270
assumptions and different ways of trying to increase efficiency in the models,

144
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:21,650
either by making further modeling assumptions using longitudinal measures and different Bayesian methods in this case.

145
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:27,560
So that's sort of the background for surrogacy validation.

146
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:33,350
And what I've shown so far is and this one I think is more intuitive setting is outcomes are continuous

147
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:39,080
and you can sort of write things out analytically and see the C p curves in a nice closed form.

148
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:45,320
Does anyone have any questions so far about like the concept of surrogacy validation or any questions at all?

149
00:14:53,740 --> 00:15:01,629
If you have any questions as I keep going, go ahead and let me know. I want to try and keep everyone on board so the rest of what I'm going to talk

150
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:07,850
about is trying to extend these methods to the case where we have survival data.

151
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:16,840
So, of course, multivariate normal distributions are really great for a lot of mathematical reasons and otherwise.

152
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,890
Obviously, survival data has more complications, such as censoring.

153
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:27,260
And so the trial that the work is motivated by is a prostate cancer trial.

154
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:34,120
89601 divided by 760 men that were being treated for prostate cancer.

155
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,890
They received prostatectomy days after being diagnosed.

156
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:44,200
And the idea of the trial is that they're trying to determine the effect of a radiation

157
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,900
therapy being given with or without an androgen therapy after this prostatectomy.

158
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:56,410
And I mentioned that this prostate cancer setting, it's not necessarily finalized.

159
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:01,450
What a good surrogate end point is. So some different endpoints have been evaluated.

160
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:10,600
Essentially, the outcomes that we're going to be trying to look at in this work are trying to validate whether distant metastases,

161
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:17,530
which is basically the spreading of the cancer to other areas of the body as a candidate surrogate for overall survival.

162
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:21,790
So how long someone lives for any any cause of death?

163
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:29,350
So I already mentioned that time to event end points have more complexities about actually observing the outcomes.

164
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:36,190
So in everything that I showed so far, we have to assume that we have some measure of us in some measure of t for everyone.

165
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:45,250
We're adding on this layer of potential outcomes, but we at least know that we have an observed measure of SNP in the survival setting.

166
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:51,340
We can't we can't necessarily know that because not everyone in the trial will experience distant metastases,

167
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,580
nor will everyone experience a death event.

168
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:02,800
And so on top of the fact that we have the censoring consideration, we also have to consider consider that we have the stomach competing risk setting,

169
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:13,239
which means that while some individuals will go from sort of a metastases free state and then they'll develop metastases and then death,

170
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,390
unfortunately, that's not always the way that it will work for patients.

171
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,620
It's possible that someone can die without experiencing distant meds.

172
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:27,519
And so we have this setting where, you know, if someone dies first, they can't experience the surrogate afterwards.

173
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,220
So we have to be able to take this into account in our method.

174
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:39,550
And there's not a lot of existing work or kind of agreed upon way to do this sort of analysis using this principle stratification framework.

175
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:46,690
And it's not necessarily a straightforward how we can write everything in closed form when we don't necessarily observe all of the outcomes.

176
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,910
So what we propose to do in the work is to model the data using a multistate model.

177
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,100
And so basically I describe this a little bit about patients, you know,

178
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:01,549
taking some trajectory or other as far as which events they actually experience

179
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:07,120
during their time in the trial to formalize that into this illness death model here.

180
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:14,809
We can think about three states. So we start someone starts at baseline and then they can possibly but not

181
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:19,430
necessarily move into two different states so they can experience the surrogate,

182
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:25,880
the distant Mets, and then they would be in a state, as I'm saying here, or experience death and move into the state.

183
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:32,240
And so the idea is that patients can take different pathways through this multistate model.

184
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,540
And basically between all of the different transitions, as you call it,

185
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:44,360
we can model or come up with a model for the time it takes to go through each transition

186
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,060
and the corresponding hazard associated with moving through that transition.

187
00:18:50,930 --> 00:19:00,770
So here the notation that I'm using, so that's our general notation for that the gap time or the time between two states.

188
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:07,250
And so what I'll be using here is that so t12 is the time from baseline to just months.

189
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:15,860
t13 is the time if an individual went directly from baseline to death state and then t23

190
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:20,990
is the time from an individual experiencing distant months until they were to pass.

191
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,940
And so again, each of those times has a corresponding hazard.

192
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:35,599
So the proposal in this work is that we want to take sort of what I showed on the previous slide is an

193
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,960
established method for dealing with these kinds of data for some competing risks of an illness model.

194
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,110
What we're proposing is to have counterfactual models.

195
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:50,990
So on top of sort of like an observable illness death model on the previous slide,

196
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:57,080
we're going to basically double all of that and incorporate incorporate these ideas of potential outcomes.

197
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,930
So here I'm actually trying to illness death models.

198
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:07,580
So now I've sort of increased the notation that I'm using and I'm getting back to this parenthetical notation where this whole illness

199
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:15,770
death model would correspond to treatment Z equals zero and this illness death model would correspond to the treatment Z equals one.

200
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:23,510
So we basically doubled the number of times that are in these models and the number of hazards.

201
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:30,200
And so the idea here is that we wanted to hopefully come up with some sort of causal

202
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,690
interpretation and this is the idea to try and incorporate these potential outcomes.

203
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,290
And the idea that, you know, we have some observed data,

204
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:45,079
but then there's also some counterfactual outcome out there that would be possible under the opposing treatment.

205
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:54,060
I'm. So basically by using these counterfactual illness death models,

206
00:20:54,150 --> 00:21:00,030
what we need to do is come up with methods and models that correspond to all six of the transitions.

207
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,290
And the way that we propose to do this is using frailty models.

208
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,330
So frailty models are similar to random effects.

209
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,820
If you're familiar with the idea of random effects for longitudinal data,

210
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:17,430
it's basically the same thing where we have some subject specific term that

211
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:24,660
basically captures their own individual propensity for something to happen.

212
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:31,559
The idea in repeated measures is that we're capturing some correlation among the repeated measures,

213
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,719
and it's similar like that in this modeling where the reason we're using frailties is that we want

214
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,150
to capture how all of the different transitions are related to each other for an individual.

215
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,400
So the notation that I'll be using for this frailty term is Omega.

216
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:55,840
So in the most kind of general setting, this is how we could write out the hazard model for one transition or transition, Jake.

217
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,720
We have some baseline hazard that we can specify in some way.

218
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:06,450
And then within this sort of exponential term, in a general sense,

219
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:16,290
we can have some covariance and coefficients for the covariates and then we can have our frailty term and then something that we could consider.

220
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:21,230
And like the most flexible sense is that there could be some coefficient that corresponds to the frailty term.

221
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:25,709
So for example, the coefficient here, I'm denoting it as kappa.

222
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,360
One way to think about Kappa is sort of like a scaling term that determines like the

223
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,760
strength or the variability of the frailty itself and how that impacts the hazard.

224
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:44,880
So the idea or one consideration that you need to make in these frailty models is what sorts of assumptions we want to make about the frailty use.

225
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:52,920
So again, similar to random effects models, it's not something you directly observe about an individual, it's something that you need to estimate.

226
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:59,460
And so there's different assumptions you can make about the distribution itself, about the frailty terms.

227
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:04,709
There's different assumptions that we can make about how the frailties are related across the illness.

228
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:09,330
That's models and so on. And there's different reasons to make these sorts of assumptions.

229
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,450
Some are just going to be for interpretability and making sure the models are not overly complex,

230
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:20,990
and that's related to kind of computational feasibility, how well we can actually estimate the peak.

231
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,649
So I have a I have a couple of slides where I'm just going to show what the hazard models

232
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:30,760
are that we're going to be using for those who are interested in seeing the models.

233
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,830
They're all going there are mostly going to follow the general form that I showed on the previous slide.

234
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:40,290
But remember, we're going to have six hazard models, so there's going to be six of these.

235
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,659
So it may be a little overwhelming to see them all,

236
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:52,239
but they all follow the same sorts of logic where here I'm showing them where this is for the transition one two.

237
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,860
So the time from baseline to ask and I do want to say that in this slide I'm not

238
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,790
considering any baseline covariance just to try and use the notation a little bit.

239
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,030
So again, so from baseline to us,

240
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:11,500
we'd have these two hazard models under the Z zero arm and Z equals one arm and we have this baseline hazard in this exponential term.

241
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:16,930
And then building on top of that, we have our models for the baseline to T,

242
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:23,530
which is denoted as one three that hazard model same set up we have Kappa and Omega.

243
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,280
And then where it gets a little bit more complicated,

244
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:36,940
I would say is this model where we're going from S to T or the time from distant max to the death outcome, which is the two three transition.

245
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:42,670
So there are some different decisions that we considered about how to model this hazard.

246
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:50,170
So something I do want to note is that so this hazard is really only applicable for individuals who do experience distant matters.

247
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:58,590
So if someone ever experiences our surrogate, we don't have any information about how long it takes for them to go from the surrogate to the outcome.

248
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,440
Okay. So in general, this is kind of, I would say,

249
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:09,280
the more difficult transition hazard to conceptualize or estimate because we don't have data from everyone,

250
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,760
not even a censored version that just doesn't exist for some people.

251
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:21,489
So some different assumptions that we made in coming up with this hazard model is that we have this sort of special term in here,

252
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:30,520
which I'm denoting as theta two three. So you can see that theta two three is a coefficient that is associated with t one, two.

253
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,380
So T one, two of you remember is the time that it takes for someone to experience just two months.

254
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:41,200
So we made the decision that in the model we would kind of link the both the time to

255
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,670
the surrogate and then time from surrogate to true outcome using this term here.

256
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:51,220
And then another sort of assumption that we made is this idea of time reset,

257
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,440
which essentially means that once that once the individual is enrolled in the trial,

258
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:00,040
the clock is counting all the way through their time in the trial.

259
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:08,170
But in the illness death model, the way I label the Gap Times is that we have one specific time from S to T,

260
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,100
so that time starts when they experience S.

261
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:18,190
So that's kind of the idea of time reset that we're going to restart the clock once they experience s and then

262
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:25,040
the random variable associated with this hazard model is three set to start at the time that they experience.

263
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:34,300
Okay. So these are a six hazard models that we're proposing to use with the illness death models on the previous slide.

264
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,430
Hopefully, even though there's like a lot of terms, they're a little bit intuitive.

265
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:46,180
It's mostly we have a bunch of frailties floating around that are sort of key that we're interested in.

266
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:53,110
And then we have the counterfactual version of the illness death models leading us to have six transition models.

267
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:03,780
Okay. I'll get a little bit more into some of the assumptions that we made about how the frailties are associated with each other.

268
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:13,290
So as I showed on the previous slide, we have basically six frailties for an individual in the counterfactual sense,

269
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:17,700
when we have the most general models, which is really going to be a heavy lift.

270
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:25,080
I mentioned that we don't actually observe data for all three transitions, even considering counterfactuals.

271
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:32,610
So we want to make some assumptions for how these frailties are related to each other in hopes that we can actually do some estimation.

272
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:41,490
And so the assumptions that I'm making in this work are that the frailty is for the transitions into t are actually equal for a given treatment.

273
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,570
So that means that omega two three and omega one three are equal to each other.

274
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:54,360
And then another assumption that I'll make about how the frailties are related to each other is that for a given treatment arm that omega one,

275
00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:04,170
two and omega three are actually independent. So again, so the first assumption we sort of limited the number of total frailties from 6 to 4.

276
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,000
And then we're going to make this assumption where some of the frailties are independent from each other.

277
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:13,860
And then on top of that, we're going to assume that the frailties are normally distributed.

278
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,470
So then at this point, after making those assumptions,

279
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:24,330
these are the distributions that where our sort of key that we're making about the frailties that are important for a model,

280
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:30,180
this might look like a little bit similar to what I showed on sort of previous

281
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:34,620
slides about assuming that some of the outcomes are normally distributed here.

282
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,950
We're assuming that the frailties themselves are normally distributed.

283
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,629
And again,

284
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:47,900
we're we're in the same sort of setting where we're making assumptions about how basically how counterfactual frailties are related to each other.

285
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:51,540
So this is not something first of all, we have to estimate the frailties.

286
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:57,899
They're not directly observed. And then further, where we're thinking about the idea of a counterfactual frailty,

287
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,620
where we don't actually observe the outcomes associated with the frailty.

288
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:07,260
So there's kind of a few levels of things we don't directly observe and assumptions that we're making about them.

289
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:14,249
And so that, again, we still have some not identified correlations where no matter how much data we have,

290
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,070
we don't actually have any information about these correlations.

291
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:26,450
Any questions about the set up of the illness, death models or anything about the hazards?

292
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:44,060
Okay. So the the data that I mentioned with the prostate cancer trial again our asses distant metz and t is our true outcome.

293
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:50,030
So bringing that all together and the models that I showed on the previous slides into some notation,

294
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:56,780
we have a set of basically observed data that we would get when we run the trial for an individual.

295
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:03,770
So this is more or less standard notation that I'll start with for our survival data where we have assigned.

296
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,320
That's our time to S or the surrogate outcome.

297
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:13,489
And then Delta PSI, which is our censoring indicator that goes with whether or not we observe S and then we have a tie,

298
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:18,260
which is our time to death and the corresponding censoring indicator delta time.

299
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:24,470
And then we can have some baseline covariates if we do want to incorporate those which are x and then our treatment Z.

300
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:32,540
So and then I guess on top of that, though, I want to talk about this a lot is that we can we can consider that there may be some random

301
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:38,600
or administrative censoring time on top of this sort of complicated illness death model.

302
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:46,640
Um, so that's that's why. One way to represent the data that sort of standard with survival literature.

303
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,979
And then you can, you can think that that's one way to represent it.

304
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,469
The way that we've been representing it so far in illness,

305
00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:04,549
death models corresponds to this set of observed data down below where we've kind of separated out the data by transitions.

306
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:09,260
And so we have these three time two events, two, one, two, two, one, three, two, three.

307
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:16,100
And then we still have the corresponding censoring indicator and treatment and baseline covariance.

308
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:20,059
So this is, this is the way that I've been talking about the data so far.

309
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:25,740
But if this is what you're more used to, can really the likelihood for the data is going to be the same?

310
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,260
It's just how we're representing it.

311
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:36,410
So in our illness death formulation, there's actually four combinations of the censoring indicator, of course, based on whether or not we observe S.A.

312
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,349
So a little bit more about sort of the likelihood that we're assuming.

313
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:46,390
So we're going to assume that the baseline hazards follow viable distributions.

314
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:54,310
So here I'm showing for a given treatment, we would have our do you want to teach one, three and 2 to 3?

315
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:59,350
And we assume that all of those follow a viral distribution with some shape and scale parameters.

316
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:06,160
Okay. So based on sort of all of the hazard models that I have talked about so far,

317
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:12,669
and then our combinations of whether or not we actually observe s of t this what this slide is showing,

318
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:19,270
what the likelihood contributions are for each sort of possibility of what events we actually observe.

319
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,920
So I mentioned this is sort of a.

320
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:27,190
Yes. Factorial based on whether or not someone experiences S.A.

321
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:31,720
So we can imagine that for some individuals they don't experience us.

322
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:37,580
So of course the censoring indicator of zero and then t23 is not defined.

323
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:43,030
This is the form of what that likelihood contribution looks like.

324
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:50,020
And then for individuals who do experience us so we have our indicator equal to 1 to 3 is defined.

325
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:54,180
And then on top of whether or not they experience s, they may or may not experience.

326
00:32:54,910 --> 00:33:05,319
And then this is the form of what that likelihood happens. So the way that we're going to try and estimate all of these parameters that I showed

327
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,120
so far in the slides is that we're going to take a Bayesian approach using CMC.

328
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:16,090
I won't go too far into the details other than I think that the Bayesian approach is nice

329
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:21,760
because we're in a setting where we have a few layers of things that we're trying to estimate,

330
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:28,419
like the frailties are making some assumptions about the frailties and how they're related to counterfactual frailties.

331
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:37,690
And by doing draws of parameters within the CMC, we can incorporate the variability that arises from these assumptions that we're making.

332
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:43,149
So sort of standard assumptions, prior distributions about the parameters.

333
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:46,300
Again, we're assuming the frailty is following normal distribution.

334
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,800
And then I guess specifically you're using a Metropolis Hastings algorithm.

335
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:55,900
So I won't get too much into the details, but that's like the estimation that we're taking.

336
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:02,380
This is this is a diagram to try and show how everything ties together that I showed on the previous slides,

337
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:08,350
if you like, seeing this type of a diagram. So again, sort of in the middle,

338
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:14,500
the core of all the models that we have is are different time to events both in the observed and the counterfactual arm.

339
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:23,470
There are frailties that we're trying to estimate that are associated with these times that are linked by some unidentified correlations.

340
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,780
On top of all those models,

341
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:35,140
we have all of our parameters from the label distribution and any coefficients that we're trying to estimate associated with baseline covariance.

342
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:38,200
And then, of course, we have all of our priors and hyper parameters.

343
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,790
On top of that is just a diagram of basically when they're fitting the Beijing method.

344
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:51,430
This is everything that we're trying to, um, well, this is sort of like the whole conceptual idea of everything involved in us.

345
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:57,190
So this is I've spent a lot of time, I guess, talking about the models that we're proposing,

346
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:01,060
but I haven't talked to as much about the actual metrics that we propose to use

347
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:05,860
or saying whether or not Distance Mats is a good surrogate for overall survival.

348
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:18,010
So it's not necessarily obvious, I would say, how we would construct RC app lot that I showed earlier when we have this illness death model.

349
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:27,069
So we know that on the x axis, we want to have some sort of contrast that's related to a treatment effect on X or Delta.

350
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,709
X is what I'll call that value on the X axis.

351
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:37,210
And then on the Y axis, we want to have some sort of delta T that corresponds to whether or not there's a treatment effect on T overall.

352
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:42,130
So we need to define what Delta S and Delta T are in the setting.

353
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:52,690
And then basically what we're proposing is that for Delta s, we would use this loss ratio of the cumulative hazards.

354
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:59,680
So so far I have been talking about lowercase lambda in terms of the happy brief transition.

355
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:06,550
So basically, we can come up with the cumulative hazard by integrating over time for some time.

356
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:13,480
So that's the second component of defining what Delta S is, is that since we have time to event data,

357
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:19,000
we are going to choose some time at which to evaluate whether or not S is a good circuit.

358
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:28,320
So how we propose to do that is incorporating this tell us which is the time at which we'll evaluate, evaluate the value of the surrogate.

359
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,470
So here the cumulative hazards are integrated up to the time.

360
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:42,580
S And then on the Y axis, what we're proposing for the Delta T is that we have some difference in probabilities between T one and zero.

361
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,240
And so this is sort of a complex expression.

362
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:57,760
The reason that we chose this to be the value to use on the Y axis is that, again, we're in the setting where we may or may not observe s.

363
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,410
And so we wanted to have a quantity that was not conditional on whether or not S is observed,

364
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,950
but rather this quantity sort of integrates over whether or not S is observed.

365
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:15,280
So this is basically kind of a complex expression that's based on the total probability of t happening, whether or not S actually happens.

366
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:25,380
So these are proposed metrics for surrogacy. So the overall idea is that we want to basically come up with a scatterplot.

367
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:32,490
So what I showed before for the C paper, I would just show two lines because things were in closed form for that conditional expectation.

368
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:40,680
Here, things are going to be in closed form. These are, you know, we're estimating all these parameters and how to calculate Delta S and Delta T.

369
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:46,800
And what's important here is that each subject, ie, has their own frailty.

370
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:52,740
And so the fact that they have their own frailty terms means that they'll have their own hazard term.

371
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,140
You can see that this depends on EI.

372
00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:02,910
So each person is going to have their own coordinate on the CFP plot based on all of these parameters and their estimated frailties.

373
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:12,390
So our idea is that we'll actually create a scatterplot of this Delta T and delta ACI and then draw some sort of best fit line through this.

374
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:22,140
And what we think is that we want to carry forward the nice properties of a curves and whether or not S is valid for T,

375
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,580
and this idea that in order for it to be valid, that's on the C p curve,

376
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,660
sort of our best fit line would go through the origin and have a positive slope.

377
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,070
So that's that's the idea of what our proposed curve is.

378
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:41,050
I'll just briefly say that we do have to deal with the fact that we have these

379
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:45,820
unidentified parameters that are linking kind of the two halves of our model together.

380
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:52,360
And so how we propose to do this for now is to fix these non identified parameters.

381
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:59,620
So in the algorithm we actually estimate the frailty as our draws of the frailty is for the observed data arm.

382
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:05,110
And then instead of doing any like really complicated imputation for all of these data,

383
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:12,760
we're just taking these non identified parameters and the prior distribution and getting counterfactual drawers of the frailty.

384
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:24,870
Okay. So I'll just go ahead and go a little bit to sort of what what these plots look like.

385
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:28,400
So basically, we spent some time, as I mentioned,

386
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:35,719
trying to like define an ideal curve and kind of figuring out like in what ways with

387
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:41,590
the parameters be related to each other such that there would be an ideal curve.

388
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:49,730
So this is this plot is just showing some simulated data based on some different modeling assumptions that we made.

389
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:59,719
And basically, the way that we do this method is that for each drop like round of the CMC,

390
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:05,180
we have some draws of the frailties and some estimated best fit line.

391
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:13,550
And then you can imagine that over many iterations of the CMC we can take sort of posterior mean of all of the subjects specific coordinates.

392
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:19,490
And then here I'm actually showing all of the best fit lines over the CMC algorithm.

393
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:26,870
So this is under a scenario that we, we think that we would say that the surrogate is valid because there's a treatment effect

394
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:33,620
on us and sort of that effect on asses the only pathway that the effect is happening.

395
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:37,220
So that's what we think of. It looks like a valid surrogate in what we're proposing.

396
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:44,280
So this is an example of what the curve would look like. I do want to get back to the data example.

397
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:51,560
So in the prostate cancer trial that we're interested in here, I'm just showing some of the kaplan-meier curves.

398
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:59,190
So again, we're comparing the outcomes when we're doing a radiation therapy with or without anti-androgen therapy.

399
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,360
So here we can see that there is a treatment effect on the surrogate.

400
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,950
If we're just looking at the time to, as you can see, separation in the curves.

401
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:13,920
We also see that there is an effect on t. Not quite as pronounced, but mean still a treatment effect.

402
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:20,880
And here i'm also showing a curve specifically for the transition that would go from S to T.

403
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:27,510
So this plot at the bottom here is only only including individuals who did experience the surrogate.

404
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,360
And so you can see that at some points in the curve that the curves are not separated.

405
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,960
There's sort of some time here where they are.

406
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:42,930
There is some treatment effects, but it's not necessarily as clear in this plot whether or not there's a treatment effect going on for that time.

407
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:53,350
Okay. So this is this is the plot that I came up with when I ran all these methods and the algorithm on the data set.

408
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:01,860
And basically, here again, I made some different modeling assumptions and I picked what I thought an okay,

409
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:10,360
how centrality was based on sort of like average times that it was taking people to the experience just in months or overall survival.

410
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:15,120
And so this is showing what the estimated C D curve would look like.

411
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:22,690
Again, the posterior mean of all these delta, cyan, delta T are shown in the corresponding best fit lines.

412
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:31,480
And what we're saying is about the AP curve is that sort of the posterior mean of all of these would go through the origin and have a positive slope,

413
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:40,570
which it does in this case. I did want to comment a little bit on doing sensitivity analysis, which is kind of a common,

414
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:49,809
common idea in different models that we're making some assumptions that we can't necessarily ever observe whether or not they're true.

415
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:56,470
And so we do sensitivity analysis by sort of assessing our results over a range of possible assumptions we can make.

416
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:02,500
So here, this is just sort of a simple version of one way to do that is that I mentioned we

417
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:07,240
had these correlation parameters that we are going to assume some fixed value.

418
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:14,200
In my setting, I've been assuming that there are fixed values equal 2.5, just halfway between zero and one.

419
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,469
And then basically this plot is showing the values of Gamma and Gamma One,

420
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:26,620
which I'm still defining as intercept in the slope of a linear best fit line.

421
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:31,689
For that, you see P coordinates that I have been showing and then we can see that across

422
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:37,389
different assumed values of these correlations that the results are somewhat stable,

423
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:45,400
at least in the sense that all of the estimated permanent values have some credible intervals that cover zero and all of the gamut.

424
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,790
One values are positive, which are two conditions that we are trying to meet.

425
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:57,549
So in this type of a way, we can get some confidence that this assumption was not going to drastically

426
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:01,460
change our results based on what value we were to fix these correlations to.

427
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:09,880
So you chose Delta SS five. I don't see is something else yet to tell us.

428
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:15,770
Yes. Keep in mind. Plus what does that. You just what's the justification for that?

429
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:25,170
What was the justification? I mean, they didn't reach the median survival time, which is makes it a little bit difficult.

430
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:30,230
I mean, that's just a decision that I made, certainly. Okay.

431
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:38,040
So the first thing is that we know that Delta et al. We want it to be smaller than Tao te that sort of the idea of a good surrogate is that

432
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:44,609
we're going to have less follow up time on ask than we would t but also at the same time,

433
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:52,349
we want to make sure that we've observed enough events to estimate these parameters and that if we're actually running the trial,

434
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:56,340
that we would actually be observing events by the time that we're proposing.

435
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:03,300
So beyond that, I guess that that's something I could change or assess.

436
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:11,709
How sensitive it is to that. I guess partially it would be context dependent if someone were to actually pick off a

437
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:16,000
clinician or to have some ideas about what they would reasonably do on a future trial,

438
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:24,590
maybe would form that for them. Okay.

439
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:26,900
So I'll briefly just mention covariance.

440
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:35,029
I'm not going to show any plots where we're using covariance, but that's sort of built into the model that we can incorporate baseline covariance.

441
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:43,970
So in this data, we have information about PSA baseline places for our which is measured and these prostate cancer patients and age.

442
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,630
And so there's a few different reasons we would include covariance.

443
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:59,240
So I mean, one is that these frailties are sort of measuring some subject's specific variability from like the average rate.

444
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:07,700
So these including these covariates may sort of explain away some of that variability and make these frailty terms less variable.

445
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:13,130
And I guess on top of that, there's like a few additional considerations.

446
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,740
So different covariates, we may expect to play different roles in different transitions.

447
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:26,810
So in this data example in particular, I would expect age to play more of a role and time to death than time to distant mets, perhaps.

448
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:29,959
Whereas more of the prostate cancer specific variables.

449
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:38,720
I would expect to be more important for how long it takes for someone to experience just in Mets and I guess on top of that.

450
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:47,060
So I mean these covariates, including them in the models, will impact the C p curve if they are strongly associated with time to events.

451
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:55,780
And then sort of on top of that, you can imagine using covariance could be one way to sort of evaluate subgroup subgroup effects.

452
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:00,110
So they really quick that I made in our shiny app,

453
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:05,060
you guys have probably seen our training apps in this class so far, but I think that they're a really nice tool.

454
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,690
So in particular, in the apps that I made,

455
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:18,650
this is like a screenshot where I'm showing like a C P curve that there's no estimation involved, but it's just like the true C p curve.

456
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:26,780
If we were to know what the frailties were under certain sets of parameters, you can vary the parameters and see how the c p plot changes.

457
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:34,690
So this is one tool that we've been using to try and define like what an ideal surrogate is as far as when would it have a positive slope?

458
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:42,350
And when it goes through the origin based on the different scale parameters of the Y well distribution and different treatment effects that exist.

459
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:50,870
Let's see, this is just a slide. This talking about some different endpoints that have been considered for prostate

460
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:55,460
cancer and are potentially being evaluated as far as being good surrogates.

461
00:47:56,210 --> 00:48:01,190
I think overall that this illness, nice illness, death formulation is nice,

462
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:06,200
that we can sort of try and understand the mechanisms that are at play between how

463
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:11,600
an individual would go from baseline to experiencing just in that amount of death.

464
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:17,989
Some of the other outcomes that are being considered oftentimes are composite end points where it

465
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:23,360
would be like the minimum time to either distant mass or death and their combined in that way.

466
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:28,520
And I think that makes it a little bit more difficult to sort of understand the mechanisms when things are being combined.

467
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:33,470
So I think that this gives some nice framework for understanding that.

468
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:41,329
Um, then I didn't talk a lot about this, but this is just one strategy for trying to say whether or not a surrogate is valid,

469
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:44,060
but there's certainly a lot of other methods that are out there.

470
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:52,040
I think that this seems similar in many ways to mediation approaches that are out there or the Prentice criteria.

471
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,780
It seems to have some similar flavor to those sorts.

472
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:58,010
So if you're interested in surrogacy validation,

473
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:04,190
I would say these are some interesting methods that I think are probably related in some way to what I presented.

474
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:09,799
So basically I guess I'll just kind of go to the last point.

475
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:16,160
So I mean, the reason for doing this work was to try and extend this principle stratification framework when we have time to event data,

476
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,550
which is really common in, especially in cancer trials.

477
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,820
And basically by trying to make this more applicable,

478
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:29,690
the more trials we can come up with more rigorous validation metrics and say whether or not these surrogates should be used in the future,

479
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:37,610
which is important both for patients and for drug development. So these are a few references from the slides, and that's it.

480
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:47,959
So let's do this over the next couple of questions.

481
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,010
I can spare some of them for later, so the other people do.

482
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,739
I had the first one question. I realized I didn't even have you at the end.

483
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:58,730
So in the setting is, is it time to see a prostate cancer specific?
