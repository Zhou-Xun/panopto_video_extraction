1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,490
Ananda Sen: yeah you might find that.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,740
Ananda Sen: you're asked to allow continuing recording so we'll record this.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,259
Ananda Sen: session and all the other sessions in the next few.

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:23,190
Ananda Sen: Days so just to make sure that if somebody's missing part or all of the lecture could still access what is what is there.

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,870
Ananda Sen: Okay.

6
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:31,680
Ananda Sen: Let me ask a couple of questions preparatory questions.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,440
Ananda Sen: Before before I.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:42,210
Ananda Sen: sort of start the course just to set the set the tone and some of you have some exposure.

9
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:53,640
Ananda Sen: To both to SAS as as well as statistics, how many of you have not used SAS before.

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,850
Geehan: I have youth spss not.

11
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,230
Ananda Sen: Okay okay.

12
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,400
Christie Flanagan: Oh yeah.

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:07,200
Zahraa Beydoun: me too I didn't I use spss, but I have no clue about SAS.

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,410
Ananda Sen: that's fine spss.

15
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:17,640
Ananda Sen: Is is is also a reasonable statistical software can do a lot of things and, in fact.

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:28,350
Ananda Sen: What we are going to talk about it can do the, especially the current versions i'm assuming because I have not used this because, for a while I can use spss but not for a while i'm.

17
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:40,590
Ananda Sen: Sure, but, but the basic principle is the same that one one nice thing about this, this is a lot of things menu driven so you don't have to actually write programs oftentimes you just put in the.

18
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:51,540
Ananda Sen: proper thing in the proper box and you're done Sasha slightly more involved in that sense it's a little bit more, but.

19
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:59,250
Ananda Sen: it's my my take on it, I I actually like this as well, because I know what i'm doing.

20
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:10,230
Ananda Sen: i'm always a little bit leery about putting things in boxes and getting the things cranked out just because it's often not sure what is happening there.

21
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:21,780
Ananda Sen: So, so, but this will be again, as they say, it is I don't think SAS will be an impediment or not knowing says, with an impediment for this course at all.

22
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,360
Ananda Sen: And again feel free to stop me ask me questions anytime.

23
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,680
Ananda Sen: Okay.

24
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,640
Ananda Sen: One last question.

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,720
Ananda Sen: Is there anybody here who even.

26
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,290
Ananda Sen: 10 years back didn't have any exposure to statistics.

27
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,820
Mehrdad Motamed: did or did not.

28
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,460
Ananda Sen: did not have any sports.

29
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,110
Yes, very.

30
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,490
Ananda Sen: You okay.

31
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,120
Zahraa Beydoun: yeah.

32
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,950
All right.

33
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,890
Ananda Sen: So so things like even you know.

34
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,200
Ananda Sen: P value and T test and that sort of thing that is also unknown to you.

35
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,810
Zahraa Beydoun: or well 10 years ago I was in in in my undergraduate studies, so I.

36
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,710
Zahraa Beydoun: was still at second year.

37
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:17,550
Zahraa Beydoun: Nutrition student at American University of Beirut, so I think it was the first time I heard something called P value.

38
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:30,630
Ananda Sen: Okay, all right so so when we come to use this of those i'll briefly quickly explain what that is and and then we'll move on from there.

39
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:36,120
Ananda Sen: The e I think you know, there is a more.

40
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:55,800
Ananda Sen: introductory Stat type of class also part of sse I forgot that number, but which which does some of those things which is always a good course a refresher course to take to if if you wanted to take that just just fyi.

41
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:10,530
Ananda Sen: um okay good, so this is what i'm going to do and let's see how this works i'm going to share screen and i'll start by sharing.

42
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,540
Ananda Sen: yeah they enter the bias that that's right yeah yeah.

43
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,310
Ananda Sen: Let me.

44
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:23,250
Ananda Sen: Let me share screen from my from my iPad and yeah yeah.

45
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:32,430
Mehrdad Motamed: i'm a Christian so last week we talked about this too, but just wanted to make sure if you have access to assess the 99%, for we don't have to go for the other SAS right.

46
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,930
Mehrdad Motamed: No, no.

47
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:46,710
Ananda Sen: No, no, I the entire SAS code which i'm going to use for this course they're already on on canvas and again as i'm assuming that we should be able to download everything once we are able.

48
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,210
Mehrdad Motamed: you're able to download those.

49
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:59,370
Ananda Sen: You can simply just download it to your computer and just run it in steps, I mean you're you're familiar with it, how to run and, of course, the data sets to add the details.

50
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,560
Ananda Sen: um so.

51
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:26,550
Ananda Sen: let's see.

52
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:34,980
Okay.

53
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:42,840
Ananda Sen: So I use a software called note ability and notable it allows you to.

54
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:49,650
Ananda Sen: write on the PDF file, so I have created these PDF files and.

55
00:05:49,650 --> 00:06:00,780
Ananda Sen: that's what you see on the screen, so this is basically the same PDF file, you have on canvas okay.

56
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:13,860
Ananda Sen: So today we will deal with linear regression and so first let's talk about what it means to have regression analysis.

57
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,720
Ananda Sen: So.

58
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,790
Ananda Sen: Most of you.

59
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:43,410
Ananda Sen: If not, all of you work in public health so so in public health what we try to do is is to look at generally the healthcare various issues with health care, as well as biomedical data and in biomedical data, there is an outcome that outcome could be.

60
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:52,020
Ananda Sen: Health related outcome, or it could be something about quality of life, I mean, these are all generally health related outcome anyway.

61
00:06:52,020 --> 00:07:13,950
Ananda Sen: And, and you want to understand about that outcome, but how can you understand, about the outcome if you do not input data from the subject level because everybody here is all the eight people who are in here are different people so even if you measure, the same thing.

62
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:29,490
Ananda Sen: about us, they will have variability Okay, and that variability could to some extent we predicted by some other information about ourselves.

63
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:52,830
Ananda Sen: could be our height could be our BMI could be a gender could be our comorbidities could be something else I mean so so that this is, this is the basic premise of regression, there is an outcome, you want to know about and you are using various information about.

64
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,250
Ananda Sen: The subjects to understand that outcome.

65
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:16,140
Ananda Sen: Okay, and you could compare outcomes between groups of interest, so if there is a racial disparity, you want to find out about so race is your grouping variable and you want to find out differences between blacks and whites and perhaps Asians perhaps Hispanics and so on and so forth.

66
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:25,560
Ananda Sen: It could be a gender difference, you want to find out about and that's your group, which you want to.

67
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:34,770
Ananda Sen: find the discrepancy between now that can be done through a regression model it's basic regression model, but can.

68
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:43,980
Ananda Sen: You also want to study association between outcome and prognostic risk factor so mortality, for example, mortality of.

69
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:50,130
Ananda Sen: Patients who are who are asr D patients dialysis patients.

70
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:57,900
Ananda Sen: How, how do their mortality profile, how do their profile survival profile very.

71
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:08,550
Ananda Sen: Because of certain things, maybe because of their comorbidities maybe because of their you know the the their.

72
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,090
Ananda Sen: Other demographic factors.

73
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:32,370
Ananda Sen: So this is this is another way of finding out so build a model build a model which includes various prognostic risk factors and the proposal is factors and with the idea that the model is a risk prediction model, I mean that's that's mainly one of the.

74
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:44,760
Ananda Sen: One of the issues with aggression Okay, so this prediction comparing between groups and the I think Sarah talked about creating scores greeting scores functions of important predictors.

75
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:54,210
Ananda Sen: That happens all the time, all of us know about framingham score framingham score is a very well known score about heart.

76
00:09:54,210 --> 00:10:03,030
Ananda Sen: Patients are the it actually tries to predict tenure risk of cardiac events.

77
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:13,230
Ananda Sen: that's one of the main main well known ones, but there are several other other scores, which are used in practice several other instruments.

78
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:20,550
Ananda Sen: So that's the idea, so you have an outcome that outcome could be any type of outcome.

79
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:34,830
Ananda Sen: And, and you have a bunch of information and those information people call them give them different names independent variables concomitant variables predictor variables, whatever it called.

80
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:41,340
Ananda Sen: and build a model which allows you to predict the outcome.

81
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:51,060
Ananda Sen: So what are the types of outcomes, we could have continuous outcomes that could be age high BMI that sort of stuff.

82
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,910
Ananda Sen: We could have.

83
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:59,430
Ananda Sen: Two types of models for those linear regression is the one which i'm going to talk about today.

84
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:13,800
Ananda Sen: There are all these other types of models which i'm not going to talk about where that the idea is that the outcome is not very symmetrically distributed distributed it's a it's a skewed outcome.

85
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:29,520
Ananda Sen: We will be talking about discrete are categorical outcome, and we will be primarily talking about logistic regression, there are some other regressions which are associated with that what what type of outcomes are those we're going to talk about those very.

86
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:39,450
Ananda Sen: Very in a very detailed manner, where the outcome is more like zero or one yes or no, do you have this condition and now.

87
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:55,080
Ananda Sen: Do you have diabetes or not, yes or no that's sort of an outcome what predicts that out, so we will be talking about regression in that context also we don't talk about regression in terms of counts.

88
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,190
Ananda Sen: Okay, so what is count count is like.

89
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,640
Ananda Sen: How many times, did you visit to your.

90
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:19,830
Ananda Sen: primary care provider in the in the last year that's account could be zero could be one I mean last year was not a typical year but, but in general zero or one or more than one maybe a person who is.

91
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:27,450
Ananda Sen: Who is was more frail who has more comorbidities that person may visit the.

92
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,440
Ananda Sen: Basic be four times, maybe know.

93
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:41,160
Ananda Sen: That his account that count, can also be predicted how many times, do you predict, why is that important I mean.

94
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:49,020
Ananda Sen: gee honey we're doing QA project, I mean this is one of the things which you want to know about about.

95
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:58,410
Ananda Sen: The system or the system, the medical system how how to build a medical system which can efficiently handle.

96
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:12,990
Ananda Sen: Patient visits right, so this is this is another important reason why you should think about modeling the count of visits or the number of visitors, but typical patient.

97
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:24,450
Ananda Sen: So we will talk about symmetric a continuous symmetric regression linear regression we'll talk about discrete of categorical regression it's called logistic regression most most typically.

98
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:30,870
Ananda Sen: And and counter aggression persona negative binomial integration, these are the three we're going to talk about in this course.

99
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:37,260
Ananda Sen: When i'm going to talk about the skewed regression models we're not going to talk about the time treatment model, but let me just.

100
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:50,700
Ananda Sen: give you one example of time prevent model because it's so common so time to end model also called survival models and models when he tried to model things like.

101
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:58,410
Ananda Sen: Time to death of maybe patients suffering from a certain disease.

102
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:16,770
Ananda Sen: Time to cancer recommends that is a model that is a type of model, why is it any different from regression model so one of the reasons it's different from regression model is that when you're looking at time you, you do not actually potentially have.

103
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:24,960
Ananda Sen: In finite time in your hand, so you you look at it over a certain period of time, two years, three years, five years.

104
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:35,700
Ananda Sen: And you want to know whether the event happened within that time or not now you could do it that way, then it's a logistic regression did it happen within that time frame or not.

105
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:48,030
Ananda Sen: Or you could actually try to pinpoint on time and see well for this patient the event happened at two years and then this patient event happened three and a half years.

106
00:14:48,030 --> 00:15:06,840
Ananda Sen: Well that's an information that's an additional information and you want to use that information to be able to predict which subgroup of patients are more prone or have a higher propensity of having the events earlier.

107
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:17,940
Ananda Sen: that's the whole idea right so so so that's why but but, but the but the really, really, the important point is in time to event, the reason it is different from a regression model is.

108
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:27,270
Ananda Sen: In time to when there's a whole group of patients, for whom you will not see the event when your time observation window window and ends.

109
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:42,270
Ananda Sen: So, after two years let's say after two years, you want to look at it 90% of the patients did not have the event so you're going to throw out those 90% the patient, then it's then it's a very selection problem, this is missing data essentially.

110
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:51,000
Ananda Sen: Ah, but what you know about the 90% of those patients is that they didn't have the have the event until.

111
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:05,160
Ananda Sen: time until two years so that's an important important information and there is so time to event models actually use that information in a very.

112
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Ananda Sen: nice way very efficient way to come up with methodology which takes care of that so that's a different type of model, no matter what model we are using.

113
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,270
Ananda Sen: No matter what model we're using we are still.

114
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:35,040
Ananda Sen: not moving away from the basic premise or basic tenet of aggression what, which is what, which is, I have an outcome, I have a whole bunch of X variables, which I will call covariance.

115
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:42,480
Ananda Sen: or predictive values so beta variables are independent variables that will try to.

116
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:52,590
Ananda Sen: explain that That premise is is the same, it remains with all the regression models.

117
00:16:52,590 --> 00:17:10,830
Ananda Sen: So we will deal with linear regression this course, this today and tomorrow, Monday after tomorrow we'll deal with the logistics so let's talk about linear regression let's set the set the stage for that responses continuous.

118
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,700
Ananda Sen: Age height BMI.

119
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:25,290
Ananda Sen: Some some if you're deriving scores, for example, if you can construct scores based on certain instrument that score that's a continuous variable.

120
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:37,800
Ananda Sen: Often, like at scale measurements are taken as a continuous variable although you might might be a little bit of a stretch if you're basing it on one single response.

121
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:45,600
Ananda Sen: And laugh often as well, what do you, what do you end up doing is that it is five point like at scale and you create is a continuous variable.

122
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:58,740
Ananda Sen: it's probably a stretch but let's say you have an instrument, where there are 20 items each of them are measured on five point scale and in some them that's your that's your final score.

123
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:15,630
Ananda Sen: that's a reasonably continuous variable so so that that is actually bullet number 12345 that's that's what I mean there that if you take many variables and sum them up, then.

124
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:24,390
Ananda Sen: Then you might end up getting a continuous variable, even if the original variables are more measured in a more discreet manner.

125
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:28,200
Ananda Sen: Alright, so.

126
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,710
Ananda Sen: i'm sorry.

127
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,820
Ananda Sen: So some some equation some model here.

128
00:18:35,820 --> 00:19:00,930
Ananda Sen: So why is an outcome and i'll start with the simplest form of linear regression, which has got one slope and intercept beta not in this in this picture is called the intercept of the of the model and beta one is the slow it's the rate of change in y.

129
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:11,280
Ananda Sen: And given single unit change in X Okay, and what is that excellent I what is that thing which is attached to this model, I mean.

130
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:20,940
Ananda Sen: Most of us recognize that the first part, the beta not plus beta one X is the equation of the line, but then there is an extra thing well that's that's where.

131
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:32,730
Ananda Sen: The subject to subject variability comes in right if you measure why your ex I is a particular let's age is the only thing you're interested in.

132
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:49,110
Ananda Sen: And, and any any any plugin age that excellent I would still measure some editor which you were unable to measure, so you take the same take two people who have the same age.

133
00:19:49,110 --> 00:20:03,030
Ananda Sen: There why you're still going to be different, mostly and that's because they are different people they have other things which you are not considering and that's all built in in the editor.

134
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:18,810
Ananda Sen: that's all there okay simple linear regression model is just a starting point it's it rarely is the situation where simple linear regression model is the be all and end all it's just a building skirting building.

135
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,440
Ananda Sen: So I find the picture.

136
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:36,000
Ananda Sen: As the same is is worth 1000 words and and the way to think about this is that it's it's a function that the average Why is a function of X now.

137
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:49,710
Ananda Sen: What do I mean by that so let's say two single X and a single y and the line is given by the the line I just talked about beaten up as they don't want exactly that's the straight line there.

138
00:20:49,710 --> 00:21:06,390
Ananda Sen: So when X is X one when the age is 20 years 20 years, then they're all these 20 people 20 year old people from the front of population universe of all 20 years old.

139
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:22,980
Ananda Sen: They would still not have the same value of why they will not have the value, which is determined by that that line, but they will vary across that mean right so so across that mean, meaning that you have.

140
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:29,850
Ananda Sen: A nice little distribution across the average so that average.

141
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,740
Ananda Sen: will vary.

142
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:39,870
Ananda Sen: depending on whether you're looking at 20 year old whether you're looking at 40 year old 60 year old or eight year old.

143
00:21:39,870 --> 00:22:03,780
Ananda Sen: And the assumption is that change will happen across a straight line, so this is the idea, this is this is basically what i'm doing is and just throw this picture trying to explain the framework of regression Okay, so when I look at X a given value of X, the average will.

144
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:15,420
Ananda Sen: actually be given by the straight line, but the actual values will vary across the average according to a normal distribution.

145
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:27,300
Ananda Sen: Okay, and that normal distribution is drawn by the little bell shaped curve and this obviously will change as as a change X.

146
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,650
Ananda Sen: said.

147
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,620
Ananda Sen: it's.

148
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:46,170
Ananda Sen: understood understanding this through a single X and a wise much easier because the moment you have multiple exits then it becomes a surface it's much harder to visualize this but visualizing this to us in the lexus is much.

149
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:49,440
Ananda Sen: Okay.

150
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,060
Ananda Sen: All right.

151
00:22:54,060 --> 00:23:05,160
Ananda Sen: Dr Bob normal distribution, this is the bell shaped curve, which has got this is this is more i'm not gonna spend too much time on this, it has really got two different things, one is the average.

152
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:20,760
Ananda Sen: And one is the spread and and in in, and we, the regression model is about the average the spread remains the same, so, if you look at this schematic picture.

153
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:31,290
Ananda Sen: it's roughly I mean i'm not saying that it's drawn very nicely but but roughly you'd see that those bell shaped curve are pretty.

154
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:46,890
Ananda Sen: evenly spread for each of those X values idea is that for regression models it's it's only the mean that will vary across very as a function of X, but not the spread not Sigma Square.

155
00:23:46,890 --> 00:24:06,210
Ananda Sen: So some pictures were what it means to have different new and different and same Sigmar same meal and different Sigma the balance point is the same different spread or same spread different meal, which is our premise same Sigma difference.

156
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:10,830
Ananda Sen: So jump to multiple linear regression in reality.

157
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,920
Ananda Sen: Especially if you're.

158
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,010
Ananda Sen: If you're dealing with human subjects.

159
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:27,330
Ananda Sen: you're not going to be able to explain any outcome measured on human subjects through one single X so there'll be multiple axes.

160
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:44,490
Ananda Sen: And so the multiple access basically means that you have all these X variables all these different covariance and and and many right out the regression model like okay so.

161
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,920
Ananda Sen: This would be.

162
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,750
Ananda Sen: Essentially, a sidebar to the whole thing.

163
00:24:51,750 --> 00:25:04,800
Ananda Sen: The indicator it's a very useful way to represent categorical predictor variable what is a dummy variable an indicator variable it's basically a variable which is.

164
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:19,230
Ananda Sen: One zero type of variable or 123 and so on and so forth it's it's very commonly used in regression to do.

165
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:30,870
Ananda Sen: depict categorical variables, so a simple example is that suppose i'm interested in comparing average horsepowers of midsize cars from three different countries.

166
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:38,070
Ananda Sen: of origin and suppose the variable is quoted as one, two and three, the three different countries.

167
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:48,690
Ananda Sen: And how do we, how do we incorporate that integration and we'll see that in SAS there is a very, very simple way of representing this.

168
00:25:48,690 --> 00:26:02,190
Ananda Sen: But let's try to understand what it means through the regression framework So what do you want to do is to create dummy variables or indicator variable so one of them is so i'll call this region.

169
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:11,400
Ananda Sen: So I will have an origin is is one, two and three, one is American to European and threes Japanese.

170
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:28,500
Ananda Sen: So I will create two dummy variables to indicator very but then you get it always means one and zero so to integrate variables if or equal to one I will call a variable which is called American That will be one.

171
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:45,540
Ananda Sen: And if we're aging is anything else, then i'll put a zero so you look at a car that's your experimental unit and an American car, yes, then American the value for American is one.

172
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:50,970
Ananda Sen: it's Japanese car value zero its European car value is zero.

173
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:57,840
Ananda Sen: I will create another indicator variable European.

174
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,730
Ananda Sen: Which is one for European cars, otherwise it's zero.

175
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,780
Ananda Sen: Do I have to create a third one, no.

176
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,010
Ananda Sen: Why not well let's.

177
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:28,860
Ananda Sen: So this is going to be my my basic model, the average of why horsepower is going to be better not plus beta one times the first indicator which is American and the second indicator and beta two times a second indicator okay.

178
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,320
Ananda Sen: let's split this up.

179
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,320
Ananda Sen: let's see what happens.

180
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:48,390
Ananda Sen: So, if it is an American car then beta not will be there in the model beta one will become American will be one any road will you do so, my average horsepower will be beta plus beta one.

181
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:53,820
Ananda Sen: For European cars, it will be better not plus beta two.

182
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,030
Ananda Sen: For Japanese cars.

183
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:07,020
Ananda Sen: I told you that we don't have to create a variable, why not, because for a Japanese car both the variables American and European will be zero.

184
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:14,250
Ananda Sen: So i'm left with we're not alone so beta not intercept actually the present the Japanese car.

185
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:27,390
Ananda Sen: Okay, what does the other, to me, what does beta one mean what does beta to me well beta one means the difference between a Japanese and American.

186
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:39,870
Ananda Sen: Right, because if I subtract the American are the Japanese from American they're not cancelled so i'm left with beta one similarly.

187
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:48,000
Ananda Sen: I am left with beta tool, if I compare European and Japanese car.

188
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,980
Right.

189
00:28:49,980 --> 00:29:03,090
Ananda Sen: What is the difference between American and European car well that's beta one minus beta so that will require a little bit more work it doesn't come from any.

190
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:13,380
Ananda Sen: Any software output directly, however, you can you can get that that easy.

191
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,180
Ananda Sen: This may be.

192
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:34,260
Ananda Sen: Straightforward basic for many of you, but I wanted to make sure that we are doing this for everybody, so I wanted to go through slow slowly, so any question on this.

193
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:40,530
Ananda Sen: Because the reason i'm saying this is because.

194
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:52,650
Ananda Sen: This happened last year, everybody was very comfortable in the first day second day onwards things started getting a little bit more involved, especially when we talk about logistic regression.

195
00:29:52,650 --> 00:30:06,930
Ananda Sen: And odds ratio things get a lot more involved so so today is is is, I want to make sure that we are in tune and and sort of like doing things in a comfortable manner.

196
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,990
oops sorry keep on doing this.

197
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:21,930
Ananda Sen: So as as we just saw for three categories, we needed to dummy variables or two indicator variables if we had key categories will need came on this one same principle basically.

198
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:39,090
Ananda Sen: And every time we we look at this the intercept is going to be what we call the reference category, everything else is a difference with the reference category in this case the reference category was Japanese.

199
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:44,610
Ananda Sen: So when we fit a model like this when we fit the model like.

200
00:30:44,610 --> 00:31:15,480
Ananda Sen: I have aging the model so X one is age and X two is gender gender is ethical to 1am equal to zero suppose I want to fit a model like this, so so my model would look like.

201
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:29,100
Okay, so.

202
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:36,510
Ananda Sen: So, if that is the case, then this is my model, what does what does that mean that means that.

203
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:47,610
Ananda Sen: The data to slopes one is happening for X to equal to zero, so when X two equal to zero.

204
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:50,280
Ananda Sen: E y.

205
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:59,820
Ananda Sen: is equal to beta not plus beta one X one when X to equal to one.

206
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:10,470
Ananda Sen: E y is equal to.

207
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,960
Ananda Sen: So another way of saying that is beta not plus beta two.

208
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,250
Ananda Sen: Plus 321 next one okay.

209
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:26,460
Ananda Sen: So if you if you see that what's happening what's happening is the following.

210
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:44,340
Ananda Sen: For the two genders for females my model looks like better not plus beta two that's my intercept and and the slope is still beta one slope of slope means what slope means is the rate of change in y.

211
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:52,020
Ananda Sen: For every year increase in age let's say i'm measuring age in ears.

212
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:56,520
Ananda Sen: For males.

213
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:17,760
Ananda Sen: My model is better not plus beta one X, one which means for males for every year increase in age, the rate of change in y average while still beta one, so they have the same slope So how do they differ they differ by the by the difference in the intercept.

214
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:31,830
Ananda Sen: So beta two is the jump, but I have forced by doing it this way I have forced them to have the same slope, which means they're parallel lines.

215
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:36,990
Ananda Sen: That are parallel lines because beta one is the same for both males and females.

216
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:40,950
Ananda Sen: Does that make sense.

217
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,130
Okay.

218
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:49,440
Ananda Sen: So, so, for example, if I, if I have to.

219
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:57,750
Ananda Sen: Compare the difference in the beta to equal to zero, will will be testing.

220
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:05,250
Ananda Sen: The difference in intercept between males and females.

221
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:09,240
Ananda Sen: So basically different intercept.

222
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:16,470
Ananda Sen: What does beta one equal to zero test well beta one equals zero just test whether this whether there is no age difference or not.

223
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:27,660
Ananda Sen: What this cannot do this model is restrictive in the sense that in does not allow for agent why association to be different.

224
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:46,050
Ananda Sen: For males and females, what if I wanted to know that what if I wanted to know that the age rate, the rate of change in y bar unit changing age is different in males and females, how do I do that.

225
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,800
Ananda Sen: Well that's where we have.

226
00:34:49,800 --> 00:35:00,990
Ananda Sen: The concept of interaction So you see the difference between the two pictures the previous pictures are two lines what happened in this picture the two lines cross.

227
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:14,850
Ananda Sen: Well, I don't know where that they will process, they will they will be parallel so maybe what I should do is allow for allow for them to cross and then see whether they're really cross.

228
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:36,690
Ananda Sen: That makes sense, why would I start with restrictive model and then essentially assume that they don't they're they're not the same in today should start with the more general model and actually let myself test out that uh how do I do, that I do that through.

229
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:57,630
Ananda Sen: A simple mathematical construct called interaction and see how this this storm is there, this is the interaction term.

230
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:03,360
Ananda Sen: Just a simple product of the two X one times X to what happened.

231
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:22,470
Ananda Sen: What happens then is now let's say I do the same math which I did before X two equal to one and X equal to zero X, to the one is females extra zeros males now they look different than is changed, both in intercept as well as in slow.

232
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:41,220
Ananda Sen: So now in this model if I wanted to know whether the rate of age is rate of change with age in in, why is the same for males and females, what would I check, I will check with a beta three equals zero now immediately go to zero, then the then the slopes of the same.

233
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:45,720
Ananda Sen: If I want to know where that they start from the same point.

234
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:53,910
Ananda Sen: I want to, I want to test with a bit of to the zero now.

235
00:36:53,910 --> 00:37:01,020
Ananda Sen: That makes sense.

236
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:08,910
Ananda Sen: So.

237
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:17,550
Ananda Sen: Let me point out something which we had not This is something which I see a lot of people making a mistake on.

238
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:24,390
Ananda Sen: So, and I have seen actually papers published papers.

239
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:29,790
Ananda Sen: where people have made this mistake.

240
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:36,450
Ananda Sen: So when we say that beta two.

241
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,760
Ananda Sen: Is.

242
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,730
Ananda Sen: Testing for beta two is testing for whether the two.

243
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:49,320
Ananda Sen: genders, have the same starting point.

244
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,830
Ananda Sen: But that's that's not entirely true.

245
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:56,820
Ananda Sen: You are testing whether the two.

246
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,330
Ananda Sen: Two people have same starting point.

247
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:04,650
Ananda Sen: Only the next one equal to zero right because.

248
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,980
Ananda Sen: If X one is still in the equation.

249
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:24,330
Ananda Sen: And it's the same and if you're dealing with two people who have different ages, then you really cannot compare beta to equal to zero cannot just test better to go to zero, and say that they are.

250
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:31,230
Ananda Sen: They are different, that the two genders different you, you have to have the same age.

251
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:37,470
Ananda Sen: You have to have the same so you pick up a female or pick up a male.

252
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:42,540
Ananda Sen: And if they are of the same age, then.

253
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:49,620
Ananda Sen: X one is the same so so you really have.

254
00:38:49,620 --> 00:39:06,960
Ananda Sen: Actually, actually even that is not going to work because because, even if it is the same age, you would have beta one plus beta three in the model for females and beta just beta one for the modern me so, how would How would be that to be interpreted.

255
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:15,000
Ananda Sen: Actually, let me, let me make this a point for discussion.

256
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,440
Ananda Sen: So, how would you interpret beta to.

257
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,700
Ananda Sen: In this model.

258
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:28,980
Ananda Sen: Look at the bigger model beta not plus beta one X one plus two X two.

259
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,100
Ananda Sen: Plus beta three x one X two.

260
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:39,360
Ananda Sen: In that model, how would you interpret beta two.

261
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:44,160
Ananda Sen: Or if I tested beta two equals zero.

262
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:55,980
Ananda Sen: What would that test tell me.

263
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:18,450
Ananda Sen: Anybody.

264
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:30,780
Ananda Sen: To the point is, if you look you look at these two equations, so let us carefully, you realize that unless you plug in X one equal to zero, you cannot really compare.

265
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:43,410
Ananda Sen: The two intercepts between the two subgroups remember X to equal to one is females, this is females.

266
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:51,780
This is meals.

267
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:58,050
Ananda Sen: So, unless I get rid of X one completely X one equals zero.

268
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:03,060
Ananda Sen: We really cannot say that beta two.

269
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:14,670
Ananda Sen: Is the difference in intercept between the two subgroups so they are a difference between the two sub groups, but only for X one equal to zero right.

270
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:18,840
Ananda Sen: Does it make sense.

271
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:35,820
Ananda Sen: I remember X one is age.

272
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:40,200
Ananda Sen: X one is age.

273
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,120
Ananda Sen: wouldn't make sense to talk about beta two equal to zero at at.

274
00:41:45,120 --> 00:42:00,870
That point.

275
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:04,350
Ananda Sen: And if not.

276
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:14,130
Ananda Sen: If not, because age equal to zero doesn't have any physical meaning, how can you rectify this.

277
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:22,500
Ananda Sen: How can you make sure that you are actually dealing with a model which has a more meaningful interpretation.

278
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:32,820
Ananda Sen: arm off the intercept.

279
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:39,360
Ananda Sen: So we deal with interaction all the time and then even if you even if you have used.

280
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,830
Ananda Sen: did not.

281
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:54,090
Ananda Sen: use it for this particular type of example, we are dealing with, we call it effect modifier oftentimes effect modifier or moderate.

282
00:42:54,090 --> 00:43:02,700
Ananda Sen: Okay, something which changes things it's all sometimes also called difference in differences.

283
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:07,530
late.

284
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:22,440
Ananda Sen: So, for example, let me ages, is a little bit of a strange way of looking at interaction, but let's say I have to grouping variables, I have gender, which is more like.

285
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,160
Ananda Sen: More like the.

286
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:42,030
Ananda Sen: main grouping variable and then there is also randomization so I have got an intervention group in a control group and agenda Okay, so if I have an interaction between randomization.

287
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:56,460
Ananda Sen: and gender, then what happens then interaction means that I want to know whether the gender difference for the control group is the same as the gender difference in the intervention.

288
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:12,120
Ananda Sen: So it is actually a difference in differences well in this case age is a continuous variable so it's not quite a difference in differences, it is the same same idea I mean age increased by one year.

289
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:20,040
Ananda Sen: that's the difference you're looking at increased by one, what is the difference is it the same for males for and for the fields.

290
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,430
Ananda Sen: So here's my question to you.

291
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:36,240
Ananda Sen: So, you know that age equal to zero is meaningless, so I can throw away completely this this this test of beta two equals zero which actually is, is a very reasonable thing to do.

292
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:52,890
Ananda Sen: But to make this equation more meaningful, what can you do.

293
00:44:52,890 --> 00:45:02,520
Ananda Sen: Well here's a hint can we change the reference of age from zero to something else.

294
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,780
Ananda Sen: something meaningful.

295
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:12,060
Ananda Sen: If these are all adults, aged men and women.

296
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,970
Ananda Sen: Can we think about.

297
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:18,060
Ananda Sen: Age.

298
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,820
Ananda Sen: 60.

299
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:31,980
Ananda Sen: Such that the intercept now becomes something where where I can talk about things in in that manner.

300
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:37,770
Ananda Sen: That that's actually a method which is often pursued.

301
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:40,410
Ananda Sen: And it's called centering.

302
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:45,330
Ananda Sen: So, for example, if I change this model.

303
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:52,140
Ananda Sen: Where I would call X one star.

304
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:57,960
Ananda Sen: X one star equal to X one minus 60.

305
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,900
Ananda Sen: So make that change.

306
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:15,030
Ananda Sen: i'll make that translation change the origin to 60.

307
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:18,240
Ananda Sen: If I do that.

308
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:24,570
Ananda Sen: and write this equation is y equal to.

309
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:27,960
Ananda Sen: beta one.

310
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,120
Ananda Sen: times.

311
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:43,920
Ananda Sen: X one star actually and now everything will change a beta not star beta one star one star plus.

312
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,740
Ananda Sen: beta two.

313
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:52,950
Ananda Sen: Time to start times X two.

314
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:57,570
Ananda Sen: Plus beta three star.

315
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:11,250
Ananda Sen: X one star see what I did was this I changed from X two X one star that's a subtraction of 60 and I created this model.

316
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:19,440
Ananda Sen: What it will find out is that beta three Star and beta.

317
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,960
Ananda Sen: Three actually are the same they don't they don't change.

318
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:38,970
Ananda Sen: What changes is beta not in beta not star that's the one that changes everything else remains the same, that you can mathematic control, but the point I wanted to make is that, by changing this to.

319
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:50,100
Ananda Sen: X one star next to beta two now suddenly become.

320
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,670
Ananda Sen: A gender difference in.

321
00:47:53,670 --> 00:48:08,070
Ananda Sen: Why, for age equal to 60.

322
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:15,900
Ananda Sen: This is important, this is this is now changing the interpretation.

323
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:26,670
Ananda Sen: Otherwise you wouldn't even worry about the intercept at all and that's fine too that's fine.

324
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,290
Ananda Sen: Does that.

325
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:33,720
Ananda Sen: make sense it doesn't make confusing.

326
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,360
Ananda Sen: And you can be honest about it.

327
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,230
Ananda Sen: or ask questions about.

328
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:56,700
Ananda Sen: My next few pages actually talk about that, but i'm not I part of mentioning this through example to an example, and in fact this goes over the whole thing.

329
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:03,570
Ananda Sen: Exactly true treatment versus gender differences.

330
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:11,130
Ananda Sen: So it does show you all that, I mean that this this particular page actually does show you the agenda and treatment.

331
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:13,140
Ananda Sen: interaction so.

332
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:20,280
Christie Flanagan: It does make more sense now when you show what each item is because I think that's where I was getting lost I didn't know.

333
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,620
Christie Flanagan: What like beta one like I was getting lost in keeping track of what each week each variable was so.

334
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,750
Christie Flanagan: This means really helps yeah.

335
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:28,800
Christie Flanagan: Thank you.

336
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,660
Ananda Sen: Sure sure not a problem, not a problem at.

337
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,210
Ananda Sen: All and and, again, I think.

338
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:43,440
Ananda Sen: One of the things which, which is, which is important, so this is so, this, unlike the regular class I teach in by step.

339
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:55,230
Ananda Sen: By step students are homogeneous they're all have the same type of experience exposure and so on, so forth, this group is heterogeneous you have your own exposure, you have your own type of.

340
00:49:55,230 --> 00:50:15,660
Ananda Sen: Examples you have used so one thing I would encourage and and and you can ask me the question to that I work with a data like this and, in this case it if Is this something which is similar to what you're saying and that's absolutely great in fact that's what I encourage.

341
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:24,720
Ananda Sen: I give the treatment intervention versus gender example because that I see that all the time.

342
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:34,830
Ananda Sen: randomized control trials little treatment and intervention intervention and control group set up and they want to do it stratified by male and female.

343
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:45,990
Ananda Sen: And then want to see whether we're in males the effect was the same versus the same in the females and that's how you set that up by just looking at that interaction.

344
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:51,780
Ananda Sen: This is this is this page actually the page i'm showing you right now expense exactly.

345
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:59,340
Ananda Sen: But you may have a different example where you or you look at look at things in that manner.

346
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,910
Okay.

347
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:09,690
Ananda Sen: Other questions.

348
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:18,060
Ananda Sen: Okay, so let me see.

349
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:20,250
Ananda Sen: Sorry i'm uh.

350
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:27,630
Ananda Sen: I just had an eye surgery last week, nothing, nothing, nothing major it's it's just a cataract surgery.

351
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:31,410
Ananda Sen: So i'm still.

352
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:35,490
Ananda Sen: Trying to adjust my eyes to.

353
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,920
Ananda Sen: The new vision but.

354
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,450
Ananda Sen: So one thing I was going to say that.

355
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:45,780
Ananda Sen: This is a four hour class and.

356
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:52,440
Ananda Sen: And, and the way I function, you may be much better than me.

357
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:58,800
Ananda Sen: After maybe an hour 75 minutes, or so I completely.

358
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:06,750
Ananda Sen: blocked myself off and I can't understand anything so, so I would like to give breaks.

359
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:18,150
Ananda Sen: And normally what i'll do is i'll do one hour 15 minutes and give a 10 minute break and other one hour 15 minutes 10 minutes break and then go to the end.

360
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:30,810
Ananda Sen: So we started off by doing some preliminaries and in one hour 15 minutes would have been at 245 but still 15 now why don't we come back at three o'clock.

361
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:43,890
Ananda Sen: And perhaps start with the with the lab and then get some preliminary ideas of how to set things up and so on okay so okay.

362
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:53,910
Ananda Sen: Good so back at three o'clock or three o'clock Eastern time i'm sorry, a lot of you are in different time zones, but yeah so 10 minutes late.

363
00:52:53,910 --> 01:01:53,610
night.

364
01:01:53,610 --> 01:02:16,980
Ananda Sen: alright.

365
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:24,000
Ananda Sen: hi.

366
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,700
Ananda Sen: Okay.

367
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:33,840
Ananda Sen: So this is the lab.

368
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:40,260
Ananda Sen: set of slides a lab slides which I just pulled up um.

369
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:48,120
Ananda Sen: And from time to time, I will use different data sets for different days I will use different data sets.

370
01:02:48,120 --> 01:03:07,980
Ananda Sen: But the low worked with data which i'm going to use probably across multiple multiple days, just because it's a it's a very nice data set, not a large data sets a small data set but has enough to talk about and and explain.

371
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:21,570
Ananda Sen: Various regression techniques, based on this, so the data is actually described on a book by postmodern lemma Shaw and stood event in 2013 and it is.

372
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:25,860
Ananda Sen: It is a data set.

373
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:36,210
Ananda Sen: It is a data set that is conduct collected at Springfield Massachusetts a while back and and essentially.

374
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:47,520
Ananda Sen: It is a data of on low birth weight, so the outcome is low birth weight that has been a concern to physicians for four years and.

375
01:03:47,520 --> 01:04:02,190
Ananda Sen: And this this particular data set actually has let's see hundred and 89 see how many doesn't say here but yeah it has Scott hundred and 89 women.

376
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:16,140
Ananda Sen: And and it's got a lot of variables so so let's look at those variables first so it does have identification code low birth weight, which is actually defined by.

377
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:19,740
Ananda Sen: If the if the baby is.

378
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:31,830
Ananda Sen: Less than 2500 grams, it will be called a low birth weight and the baby is over 2500 grams, it will be it's it's labeled as zero.

379
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:53,100
Ananda Sen: So that's not low birth weight aged mother weight of mother at last menstrual period race and it's it's a it's a simplified version of race white black and other smoking status history of premature Labor history of hypertension presence of uterine instability.

380
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:57,930
Ananda Sen: Number of physician visits during the first trimester and birth weight.

381
01:04:57,930 --> 01:05:12,120
Ananda Sen: In action in grams actual continuous variable so that's that's what it is so So the first thing I wanted to point out, is how do we, how do we.

382
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:24,090
Ananda Sen: prepare the data, so this is this is more of a data management, not for from a data cleaning perspective, but more as getting the data ready and for those of you who are already.

383
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:40,860
Ananda Sen: familiar with says no, this this is kind of the step which you do before it's a precursor to everything, and I want to show you a couple of things well, the first thing this is something I actually.

384
01:05:40,860 --> 01:06:09,180
Ananda Sen: was doing on my computer, which is why i've got a very long bath name um which, which is, which is something you've got a gotta replace, and I will show you later, a little later in the day, how to change that, but the first step, the first line creates what is called a library.

385
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:22,620
Ananda Sen: And in that library it's like the ticket for this, this is is a regular library, where you have books and your book is your data set that's what you want to access.

386
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:35,310
Ananda Sen: So you you basically ask SAS go to that library, so the so any any give it give the library a name, even if you do not give the library and name.

387
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:52,560
Ananda Sen: It it will it will create a default library called work so, but you can give it a different name I just gave my name and and again, you can choose what whatever you want to give there so that live name amanda.

388
01:06:52,560 --> 01:07:04,500
Ananda Sen: For example, if you knew he was using it know she could call it live name uni or are are if Marcello is using it could call it lignin Marcello.

389
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:15,180
Ananda Sen: Whatever, that is, but then just remember to follow that through later and this back name should be the path name designated by.

390
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:25,890
Ananda Sen: Either your computer or if you're doing it on SAS on demand, there is a unique path name there, which is actually a very simple path name which, which is what i'm going to show you.

391
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:37,560
Ananda Sen: arm but that's something which you have to you have to be careful, be careful about that's the only change, you need to make once you have done that.

392
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:50,070
Ananda Sen: Then you set up a SAS data set so you have a SAS data set which has a certain name and you will, if you have managed to download the.

393
01:07:50,070 --> 01:08:03,240
Ananda Sen: The corresponding low birth weight data set from from data sets sub folder in canvas there is a data set called lbw SAS seven beat that.

394
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:25,110
Ananda Sen: The lbw stands for low birth weight and because i'm attaching it to this is only in the library called anaconda I will need to locate point towards that particular book and my book is an under dot lbw lbw is the name of the SAS status.

395
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:35,850
Ananda Sen: But now I want to run it like a SAS program, and for that I need to assign it something and incest, the way SAS work, this is actually For those of you who are.

396
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:50,160
Ananda Sen: familiar with spss unlike spss SAS actually likes to create its own says data sets and and work with that and it's very typical to just call them by single letters.

397
01:08:50,160 --> 01:09:06,060
Ananda Sen: So in this case i'll just call this by data a set a non data lbw what is going to change here if you use the light name, which is not amanda something else, then that name should come here.

398
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:17,700
Ananda Sen: So, for example, if this were like name Marcello and then the BAT, then it will be data, he said marcella lbw so point clear.

399
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:25,800
Ananda Sen: i'll show you this later through the portal.

400
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:29,880
Ananda Sen: Okay, everything after this.

401
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:39,120
Ananda Sen: is universal anybody will be able to be able to do this, so this is all part of.

402
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:43,830
Ananda Sen: Codes day one codes in SAS.

403
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:55,140
Ananda Sen: And I want to qualities differently, I want to make sure that I know which is which this part is optional, but this.

404
01:09:55,140 --> 01:10:10,950
Ananda Sen: sets out, for a good practice, this is all good SAS practice if you may so i'm calling this is like in spss you have this in the in the in the.

405
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:29,340
Ananda Sen: When you when you create those variable labels you do that, in the in that excel like spreadsheet right you do that here on the part of the program So these are basically creating the labels if you're familiar with spss that's exactly what it is doing.

406
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:31,020
Ananda Sen: So.

407
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:34,380
Ananda Sen: i'm basically what i'm seeing is modify a.

408
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:47,400
Ananda Sen: label ID equals identification code local department and so on and so forth, one thing I want to point out about spss SAS is that SAS ends with a colon to the semi colon.

409
01:10:47,400 --> 01:11:12,570
Ananda Sen: that's for SAS it is, it is for SAS to know that I have ended that particular line here you don't seen as a micro that means it's not done and it does go through the whole thing and then at the end of the very end, it puts a semi colon and then say quit.

410
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:21,750
Ananda Sen: Then I ran a small proxy in SAS everything is Brock which is short form for procedure.

411
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:32,550
Ananda Sen: So Brock contents did a call to a run, I want to know what I have there, and this is what I have.

412
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:56,580
Ananda Sen: I have 11 variables and they are the variable names are given their age, be wtf TV and so on and so forth the type of the variable is in there and the length of of those This is again very similar it's not at all different from spss when you create that data.

413
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:07,230
Ananda Sen: than the data part of the data that not the way when you when you actually described the variables and there is a.

414
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:26,160
Ananda Sen: There is a place for selecting whether it's numeric or its string or something else that's that's what is automatically done here, and also, you can select the length there, and this is what is done here automatically and you see that last column that's the label, they just created.

415
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:30,540
Ananda Sen: So that's basically.

416
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:36,930
Ananda Sen: You would see that directly from matching up with the codes.

417
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:40,800
Okay.

418
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:54,870
Ananda Sen: Again, this step is optional, but it's a good practice format, I want to make sure that I know what i'm talking about what is one what is zero is one white is white one black.

419
01:12:54,870 --> 01:13:09,390
Ananda Sen: Is is does one mean yes there's one mean no, I want to know that I want to know whether, whether those are those are things so so I create this little format procedure this format step.

420
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:21,750
Ananda Sen: And I say about value value is basically how i'm going to call it call this format variable the moment I call it by formatted variable.

421
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:40,320
Ananda Sen: It will actually print out the yes, no so value and certain one equal to zero equal to no value efforts one equal to white to equal the black three equal to other what does it mean in my data set race is 123.

422
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:44,700
Ananda Sen: I want to make sure I know what is one what is to what is three.

423
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:50,670
Ananda Sen: In my data set one for for low birth, with the.

424
01:13:50,670 --> 01:14:00,240
Ananda Sen: One is but but less than 2500 zero is but with more than 2005 when I want to remind myself that that I know that that's the case.

425
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:08,070
Ananda Sen: Simple data sets you probably ran it a few times you remember it but it's it's always a good practice to do something like this.

426
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:26,970
Ananda Sen: Are this formatted variable is interesting, unless you call it, it will not print it, it will it will print the one zero value, it will not print the the yes, no, but you can you can call it, for example, that's the step, which is which came next Brock print.

427
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:34,830
Ananda Sen: Data equal to a but I only want to do it for the first 10 observations I don't want to do for all 189.

428
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:38,190
Ananda Sen: Just to see how things are happening.

429
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:42,180
Ananda Sen: And you see that format statement there.

430
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:59,190
Ananda Sen: Low is the variable, but I want to call F law, because I have already created that es lo formatted variable race F race hd answer hd is the original variable in the data set answer is the format.

431
01:14:59,190 --> 01:15:03,330
Ananda Sen: Smoke answer you I answer.

432
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:17,820
Ananda Sen: Okay, and then I ended with a semi colon, and all this end, a procedure, with around what did I get what I got is on the right, I don't know how much of the sequence see, let me just try to.

433
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:23,280
Ananda Sen: nurture them, so the first observation is one.

434
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:35,220
Ananda Sen: Observation one ids 85 law is the value law is bought, with more than 2500 grand because I call formatted values it's actually going to print the labels.

435
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:50,400
Ananda Sen: ages 19 elevate is 182 those are numeric values racist black say it didn't print to, which is what the variable is where it actually printed black smoke, no.

436
01:15:50,400 --> 01:16:02,130
Ananda Sen: Then all the other variables either it's numeric or it's yes, no and then the last one birth weight is actually numeric value 25.

437
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:08,370
Ananda Sen: And this is, does it for the first 10 observations.

438
01:16:08,370 --> 01:16:13,320
Ananda Sen: Again, the subjects that women were giving birth.

439
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:21,540
Ananda Sen: So all the values, you see, are actually sorry not subjectively.

440
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:45,690
Ananda Sen: subjects are the babies and so, for each value, you see, they are the weight, corresponding to the babies so so is the the baby was the baby born with birth, with less more than 2500 or less than 2500 and what is the age of the mother so age is actually job amanda.

441
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:52,320
Ananda Sen: Last waited last menstrual period of the mother so it's a it's.

442
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,090
Ananda Sen: there.

443
01:16:54,090 --> 01:17:17,190
Ananda Sen: Were mothers information in the child's information our our kind of like mixed together the bar Twitter first of the child's information age elway race smoking status these all refer to the mothers and.

444
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:20,310
Ananda Sen: All right.

445
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:32,490
Ananda Sen: And this data set didn't have any multiple births or anything like that so So these are all like birds to unique mothers.

446
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:46,950
Ananda Sen: Did the data set is the data set understandable, is there any question about the data set because we are going to work with this data, not only today but tomorrow.

447
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:53,340
Ananda Sen: Any question about creating the formatting and.

448
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:58,140
Ananda Sen: labeling.

449
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:04,080
Ananda Sen: Is there anybody who has done this before.

450
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:14,430
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Well i've done it in a class so i've never done it I did it a little bit So when I said I graduated 2015 that's last time I really use SAS like formatting.

451
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:15,060
Ananda Sen: I used it a.

452
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:25,920
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: little bit after probably up until 2017 for descriptive statistics but formatting I remember is tricky I don't know.

453
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,070
Ananda Sen: For these two is always tricky.

454
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:30,240
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: So.

455
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,860
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Here I was like.

456
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:41,580
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: whoa oh yeah you have to put the F and then every to set the formats and then you have to put the format on the variables, so this is not good to remember those.

457
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:49,800
Ananda Sen: yeah yes, yes, so yeah, so it is, it is, it is going to be a refresher for many of you for many of you, this is the first time you're going to.

458
01:18:49,800 --> 01:19:07,230
Ananda Sen: look at it, but that doesn't that doesn't stop us from discussing this because you know I mean again, there is no presumption that that you have seen this before um one thing I want to point out is that.

459
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:08,790
Ananda Sen: That.

460
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:15,240
Ananda Sen: In in in SAS.

461
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,980
Ananda Sen: It.

462
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:36,840
Ananda Sen: The the issue with SAS is that it's it gives you a lot of stuff gives you a lot of stuff when you ask for something, but it also requires you to sort of like set it up in a certain way and and part of SAS actually does it through a men.

463
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:49,890
Ananda Sen: But it's not as extensive as spss so it's it's a little little different from that respect but, once you once you get a hang of it and want to have an example, you can you can just one minute.

464
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:51,510
Ananda Sen: So yeah okay.

465
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:51,900
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Can I ask.

466
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,030
Ananda Sen: Another question really is yeah.

467
01:19:54,030 --> 01:20:06,150
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: You mentioned using this data set this week is there a code book that has all the variables are are all the variables we're getting used the ones that you've labeled the beginning.

468
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:07,980
Ananda Sen: This data set those are.

469
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:10,380
Those are the variables.

470
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:11,460
Ananda Sen: yeah yeah.

471
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:25,800
Ananda Sen: yeah this this particular data set the actual data set is bigger but, but I have taken this one from the example and the example actually that the published example that has only these datasets so so, so this is, this is all there.

472
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,170
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Perfect Thank you.

473
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:35,730
Ananda Sen: And you know one way to find that out, is this through this prop contents because prop contents will tell give you everything.

474
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:48,780
Ananda Sen: Even if I have not labeled it, even if I have not formatted it, it will actually give you that so that prop contents would would give you everything about the data is because i'm asking for the data to be.

475
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:52,080
Ananda Sen: Just printed out yeah.

476
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,390
Ananda Sen: Okay, good good.

477
01:20:54,390 --> 01:21:16,050
Ananda Sen: yeah feel free to ask me questions, I mean, even if you think that the question don't don't be afraid that you have not seen says before because again that's I am working with the premise that some of you may not have seen SAS which is true in this case so.

478
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:26,100
Ananda Sen: But you have a structure, you have you have a way to go about you have you have the codes and for your problems you all you have to do is to modify those codes.

479
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:41,160
Ananda Sen: Just copy and paste and you know I do this, all the time for our first data for fast for anything else for that matter, our best friend best teacher is Google.

480
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:46,980
Ananda Sen: So just just type it in and then he will get the answer.

481
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:49,920
Ananda Sen: Believe me, somebody somewhere.

482
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:59,550
Ananda Sen: had asked the same question some somewhere in the university lab with as the same question, which is currently in your mind so yeah i'm.

483
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:08,130
Ananda Sen: Okay, so now let's get to the descriptives so, as I said, SAS actually works with procedures products.

484
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:20,400
Ananda Sen: So how do I get the descriptive the basic descriptives is given by means so if I say proc means did equal to a if I don't have that statement very.

485
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:31,800
Ananda Sen: Variable statement that their statement bw to lwt it will do it for everything and in one day so so I said okay why don't you just give me this for these two variables.

486
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:48,660
Ananda Sen: And that gave me basically the ones that gave me that that that this particular these two lines just which has got the number of observations, the mean the standard deviation the minimum and a maximum.

487
01:22:48,660 --> 01:23:05,250
Ananda Sen: Both for birth weight as well as for the weight as at the last menstrual period, though, that way it is engaging the lwt is again kilograms and, but it is in grams, which is why there's a discrepancy.

488
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:19,890
Ananda Sen: But do you feel you want more can you do that, and then the answer is yes, so there are all these different SAS tricks, you can do, for example, this is the one SAS trick, which I, which is useful here is to use.

489
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:46,380
Ananda Sen: What is called ODS ODS is is basically it is asking says, to use an output device, and in this case, you can get more things out, so what, what are the other things I got it got here we 525 5075 of the four percentiles with percent 25% of into personnel and 75%.

490
01:23:46,380 --> 01:24:05,940
Ananda Sen: And you have to use that ODS command inside probably means your data set is going to be percent i'll give it a name it doesn't have to be that name but everything when I assign something that name can be changed so in this case I just said summary percentile out.

491
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:16,710
Ananda Sen: And then it created that says data set, which is what I have to print you see the see that the way SAS works is, you have to create a data set and then print the data.

492
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:25,470
Ananda Sen: So I created the data set percent elder out and I printed the data So what does it give me first, it gives me the same.

493
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:43,500
Ananda Sen: thing which I had before Brock means statement and then it gave me that extra thing, so what is an extra extra thing is the variable label fifth 25th 58 and 73% that's the extra.

494
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:48,120
Ananda Sen: So yeah so you can get a lot of extra things.

495
01:24:48,120 --> 01:25:00,570
Ananda Sen: medians goodness got roses and stuff like that all sorts of descriptive things for a data using that will be a staple.

496
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:07,020
Ananda Sen: OK, so those are the continuous variables, what about categorical variables I don't want.

497
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:17,670
Ananda Sen: The mean is OK, but it's a but really what he wanted the percentages so for that the procedure is called proc frick prop frequency.

498
01:25:17,670 --> 01:25:27,360
Ananda Sen: Frequency is actually a very, very powerful procedure, it does a lot of things with with categorical data.

499
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:33,660
Ananda Sen: It does many tests for categorical data it does.

500
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:49,050
Ananda Sen: Agreement measures for categorical data, so it is actually a very powerful statement, but even for simple descriptives you can use it, so in this case it's a very simple descriptive so I have got.

501
01:25:49,050 --> 01:26:00,870
Ananda Sen: Proper frequency the record a tables low res smoke, so all it does is it goes for the individual variables.

502
01:26:00,870 --> 01:26:17,190
Ananda Sen: Those are the ones which are in the white boxes on the towards the left of your screen, it does it for each individual one bird with less than 2500 grams race and then.

503
01:26:17,190 --> 01:26:20,580
Ananda Sen: And then small and he noticed something.

504
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:33,360
Ananda Sen: Suddenly the formatting is gone well I the formatting is gone, because I have not asked for F race, I asked for race, so it will it will go back to the original label 123.

505
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:48,510
Ananda Sen: If I asked for F race which I have some some examples with that later, then it will give me white black and other that sort of smoke is also 01 so.

506
01:26:48,510 --> 01:27:02,610
Ananda Sen: that's all there and then on the right, I have got a slightly different information, what is the difference look at the second statement under prop freak the second statement stables know stories.

507
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:11,130
Ananda Sen: What is asking for is a cross classification and that's what you have on the right table of law babies.

508
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:18,150
Ananda Sen: So law is birth, with less than 2500 grams races race and.

509
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:28,590
Ananda Sen: Then what you what you see are the following so, for example, under zero when the low birth weight is.

510
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:37,950
Ananda Sen: zero, which means the birth weight is not lower than 2500 grams, you see a race distribution, so the race distribution is.

511
01:27:37,950 --> 01:27:42,300
Ananda Sen: Basically 73.

512
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:49,230
Ananda Sen: so effectively the way to read the stable would be something like this out of the.

513
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:52,260
Ananda Sen: hundred and 80 930.

514
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:55,860
Ananda Sen: Of the birds would not be.

515
01:27:55,860 --> 01:28:00,450
Ananda Sen: considered as low birth weight 59 would be.

516
01:28:00,450 --> 01:28:16,290
Ananda Sen: Now, out of those hundred and 3073 will belong belong to white mothers and 15 will belong to black mothers and and 42 will be, but to.

517
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:18,960
Ananda Sen: Other category.

518
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:27,360
Ananda Sen: Now, if you go to actual low birth weight, then you will see 2311 and 25.

519
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,970
Ananda Sen: Now comes the percentages.

520
01:28:29,970 --> 01:28:49,470
Ananda Sen: The first draw percent is actually a percentage when you do it under hundred under 189 so it's 73 out of 189 is 38.62.

521
01:28:49,470 --> 01:28:52,200
Ananda Sen: same is true with the.

522
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,650
Ananda Sen: Low bar to it equal to one.

523
01:28:55,650 --> 01:29:09,360
Ananda Sen: row percentage is simply look at the total number of people in the in that particular role, what does what is a row row is zero.

524
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:13,230
Ananda Sen: But we're less than 2500 so basically.

525
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:14,970
Ananda Sen: All.

526
01:29:14,970 --> 01:29:20,580
Ananda Sen: birds which are not low birth weight off those.

527
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:24,180
Ananda Sen: 56.15%.

528
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:32,730
Ananda Sen: were attributed to white mothers 11.54% will ever was attributed to.

529
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:58,350
Ananda Sen: Black mothers and 32.31 attribute it to other mothers and when I when I went to the low birth weight category, then those percentages that 38.98 18.64 and 42.37 every time you add on the rules are all percentages, you should get hundred.

530
01:29:58,350 --> 01:30:04,950
Ananda Sen: So 450 6.15 32.31 11.5 for a person.

531
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:14,460
Ananda Sen: so on and so, and then the last row is the column percent so column percent is, if you just simply look at.

532
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:27,060
Ananda Sen: The white mothers, one is white 76% of the birds to white mothers were not low birth weight.

533
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:39,690
Ananda Sen: 57.69% of birds to the black mothers were not low birth weight and so on, so.

534
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:45,540
Ananda Sen: So the three percentages are looking at the same data.

535
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:50,430
Ananda Sen: In in different manners.

536
01:30:50,430 --> 01:30:58,980
Ananda Sen: it's a bit more involved, but that's that's What it means is that sort of makes sense.

537
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:10,260
Ananda Sen: Any question.

538
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:15,870
Ananda Sen: So for the cross classification, you need to put a star.

539
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:22,140
Ananda Sen: Between the two variables that's almost like an interaction, so to speak.

540
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:27,150
Ananda Sen: And, and if you don't put a star, then it will do it individually.

541
01:31:27,150 --> 01:31:50,130
Ananda Sen: By the way, you can add on stars, so you could do lori's smoke than this whole thing will be stratified farther by smoking status.

542
01:31:50,130 --> 01:32:06,090
Ananda Sen: Now, can you block them and answer is yes, you can can do a Brock as G blood vehicle to a scatter ethical to age y equal to be wt it's a scatter plot why versus explored.

543
01:32:06,090 --> 01:32:09,630
Ananda Sen: Right so.

544
01:32:09,630 --> 01:32:18,630
Ananda Sen: Then I then I threw in a couple of lines, one is called regression or egress X equal to age Why could be wt.

545
01:32:18,630 --> 01:32:22,470
Ananda Sen: And then smoothing.

546
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:26,220
Ananda Sen: lois is a line.

547
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:30,360
Ananda Sen: Locally weighted smoothing spline paper file.

548
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:32,340
Ananda Sen: smoother.

549
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:42,030
Ananda Sen: do the same thing so essentially What it does is the following What it does is it blocks the age of.

550
01:32:42,030 --> 01:32:50,130
Ananda Sen: Mother versus birth weight and it seems like there is not much going on there if I wanted to fit a.

551
01:32:50,130 --> 01:33:02,160
Ananda Sen: Simple linear regression line I could fit it to the data you don't see much of a slope, the more the slope is the higher the slope is you would expect to see.

552
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:15,420
Ananda Sen: More association, but you see almost a flat line not exactly a flat line but almost a flat flat i'm that data driven plot that the red one.

553
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:25,410
Ananda Sen: is just to throw in there to see if there is any pattern, we are missing a non linear pattern we're missing, and I would say that it's not it's just going up and down.

554
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:37,440
Ananda Sen: i'm going to talk about noise here but it's a it's something where instead of fitting an overall thing you just take parts of the data and try to fit.

555
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:47,970
Ananda Sen: Small regression through that part of the data and then extend the window that's how it operates so it did it captures it tries to capture any.

556
01:33:47,970 --> 01:34:01,920
Ananda Sen: ups and downs bumps kinks and things like that in the data and how it happens, as it happens, but you don't see a pattern it's going up and down going up and down and then the end there is.

557
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:04,440
There is a.

558
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:10,830
Ananda Sen: outlier which it's trying to catch and that's about it.

559
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:12,540
Ananda Sen: Okay.

560
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:19,410
Ananda Sen: This is a very useful as G scatter so St scatter.

561
01:34:19,410 --> 01:34:23,040
Ananda Sen: Is.

562
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:28,740
Ananda Sen: Looking at the relationships and one of the by relationships and i'm seeing here.

563
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:32,940
Ananda Sen: So there are three variables, but wait.

564
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:38,400
Ananda Sen: weight of the mother, the last menstrual period age of the mother at birth.

565
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:43,050
Ananda Sen: And I want to do this matrix plot.

566
01:34:43,050 --> 01:34:53,490
Ananda Sen: which actually looks at the pairwise relationship so if you look at this matrix.

567
01:34:53,490 --> 01:35:04,920
Ananda Sen: And look at this, so you would notice that, for example, if you look at the very first top middle panel.

568
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:11,070
Ananda Sen: that's the relationship between birth weight and waited last menstrual period.

569
01:35:11,070 --> 01:35:19,860
Ananda Sen: The the top right hand panel that relationship between birth weight and age of mother.

570
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:28,800
Ananda Sen: Okay, this is the this is supposed to be symmetric so age of mother and.

571
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:32,490
Ananda Sen: A way to last menstrual period.

572
01:35:32,490 --> 01:35:36,540
Ananda Sen: is given by the second.

573
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:47,100
Ananda Sen: Rule very right panel and then the Left panel is birth weight versus.

574
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:51,210
Ananda Sen: But with versus age of mother.

575
01:35:51,210 --> 01:36:02,760
Ananda Sen: So, so this gives you some impression of if there is any any relationship, there is there is lurking there which you did not see before.

576
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:08,760
Ananda Sen: What do you can do some interesting and useful.

577
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:21,780
Ananda Sen: pattern recognition from here, so what I did was I did actually a little bit more what I did is I actually wanted to stratified by race to see is there anything going on, by race.

578
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:39,180
Ananda Sen: And if I had found clusters, where these are these are different colors and I don't know how much you can see those colors but the colors the way they were they were done is that the red is other.

579
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:52,590
Ananda Sen: White is green and then there are probably says black is just a regular regular whole just a black hole but.

580
01:36:52,590 --> 01:36:54,660
Ananda Sen: The other ones are.

581
01:36:54,660 --> 01:37:03,900
Ananda Sen: Other one other is rat hole and then white, is it green, but you know it is.

582
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:12,540
Ananda Sen: It is, I don't see any bad and then that pretty well mixed, and if there are well mixed, then it would say there are no clusters, if you would see.

583
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:25,110
Ananda Sen: You know the Greens are on one side of the of the plot they're all clustered towards the right upper corner of the plot, then I would say, there is a cluster.

584
01:37:25,110 --> 01:37:39,450
Ananda Sen: So this is all trying to visualize if there are patterns in patterns in the data which you didn't see quick again it's a graphical way of of things.

585
01:37:39,450 --> 01:37:49,050
Ananda Sen: That that make sense.

586
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:57,390
Ananda Sen: All right, let's look at some.

587
01:37:57,390 --> 01:38:02,580
Ananda Sen: Quick Start of regression.

588
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:07,230
Ananda Sen: So in.

589
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:10,170
Ananda Sen: In.

590
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:12,450
Ananda Sen: SAS.

591
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:21,420
Ananda Sen: There are three things you can do to do a regression.

592
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:32,910
Ananda Sen: linear regression one is called prob glm the other one is called procreate and the third one is called Brock gen mode.

593
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:37,950
Ananda Sen: i'm almost not going to use problem gen mode.

594
01:38:37,950 --> 01:38:45,360
Ananda Sen: For linear regression, this is primarily.

595
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:51,510
Ananda Sen: For logistic.

596
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:53,820
Ananda Sen: and count.

597
01:38:53,820 --> 01:39:08,070
Ananda Sen: But will often go back and forth between glm and progress, progress was originally devised for doing for linear regression problem glm does more but.

598
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:10,920
Ananda Sen: But doesn't do it.

599
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:19,440
Ananda Sen: In a in a default way you have to ask for it but problem has other advantages for example.

600
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:28,410
Ananda Sen: Well we'll come to that in a moment we'll see but but probably element proper are the two will be using quite a bit so here is the first example.

601
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:43,260
Ananda Sen: First introduction of simple linear regression prob glm data equal to a model be wt equal to age so let's try to understand what this what this means.

602
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:51,990
Ananda Sen: This is a simple linear regression where bw T is my.

603
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:59,460
Ananda Sen: y and age is mine.

604
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:00,870
Okay.

605
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:15,420
Ananda Sen: So it fit the model what didn't fit it fitted intercept and it fit in age and then standard editor and T value and probably bigger than TV okay let's try to first see what it fit.

606
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:39,810
Ananda Sen: Here is what it fit.

607
01:40:39,810 --> 01:40:57,330
Ananda Sen: So a little while back, we talked about beta not in beta one, this is exactly my beta not beta one right, so the 265 7.33 is my intercept but, again, this is for unfortunately for age equal to zero, I did not do any.

608
01:40:57,330 --> 01:41:03,840
Ananda Sen: Any origin change here 12.36 is the rate of change.

609
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:24,240
Ananda Sen: In Berkeley an average birth weight for every year increase of of the mother so that's what I draw this interpretation for every year increase in mother's age child's birth verses 12.44 grams higher on an average.

610
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:26,460
Ananda Sen: that's the interpretation.

611
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:42,540
Ananda Sen: Now, is there a significant association, what would determine that the very last column this column is p.

612
01:41:42,540 --> 01:42:02,610
services.

613
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:17,130
Ananda Sen: And why is not statistically significant again a quick refresher be value is compared with point or five.

614
01:42:17,130 --> 01:42:31,620
Ananda Sen: So I would say it is not statistically significant because P value is bigger than 5%.

615
01:42:31,620 --> 01:42:45,630
Ananda Sen: Okay, so 5% is the cutoff point oh five if it is less than point 05 yes it's significantly good is not less than point 05 that is not significant that's a very rough way of using the be that.

616
01:42:45,630 --> 01:42:50,250
Ananda Sen: question.

617
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:56,160
Ananda Sen: Simple setup just want to make sure that you understand this.

618
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:59,520
Mehrdad Motamed: Mr T T T.

619
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:00,600
Ananda Sen: T T value.

620
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:35,100
Ananda Sen: Is what you would construct based on based on this and the key value the way to So if you have a calculator you can do this just take the estimate so let's see.

621
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:41,040
Ananda Sen: So how big how how big or how big.

622
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:44,190
Ananda Sen: It is from zero.

623
01:43:44,190 --> 01:43:47,760
Ananda Sen: standardize to its variable.

624
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:56,490
Ananda Sen: So if I want to do a standardized value, what is the standardized effect size that's the bad.

625
01:43:56,490 --> 01:44:01,740
Ananda Sen: So I think they estimate divide by the standard editor that's my TV.

626
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:07,140
Ananda Sen: And the TV Allah will come into play, only to calculate the p.

627
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:16,770
Ananda Sen: Okay, so for each, for example, you have 2.4 divided by 10 point or two you get 1.23.

628
01:44:16,770 --> 01:44:23,250
Ananda Sen: And the p value really says is that a significant P value, can I say that.

629
01:44:23,250 --> 01:44:27,510
Ananda Sen: That statistically that association is.

630
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:34,380
Ananda Sen: Basically, saying that they have a significant rate of change, and the answer is no.

631
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:42,720
Ananda Sen: Because your your P value is much higher than point five, so there is really no association between Asian but.

632
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:45,960
Ananda Sen: It is based on this.

633
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:53,010
Ananda Sen: Other question.

634
01:44:53,010 --> 01:45:02,100
Mehrdad Motamed: um this has always been in question to me very rarely does that point 05 come come from.

635
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:04,020
Ananda Sen: So the point 05.

636
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:08,550
Ananda Sen: Is an arbitrary threshold which is.

637
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:19,650
Ananda Sen: Which is this, this goes back to the basic principles of statistical hypothesis testing testing hypothesis so.

638
01:45:19,650 --> 01:45:23,460
Ananda Sen: If every testing hypothesis problem.

639
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:29,220
Ananda Sen: is set up in a certain way, and the end the way it is set up, is that.

640
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:38,370
Ananda Sen: There is a no and there is an alternative alternative is what you're supposed to prove or sharp demonstrate.

641
01:45:38,370 --> 01:45:43,050
Ananda Sen: Are the two drugs different are the drug is doing best better.

642
01:45:43,050 --> 01:45:46,200
Ananda Sen: The new drug is doing better than the old drug.

643
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:56,700
Ananda Sen: The there is an association between agent birthweight that's that's the alternative hypothesis what is not know.

644
01:45:56,700 --> 01:46:06,780
Ananda Sen: All you did is is not true, we don't have any association we don't have any relationship that drug is not better things like those.

645
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:28,050
Ananda Sen: So that's the nullifying the research hypothesis that's where it's not now how is this conducted it's conducted under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, so in this case I didn't tell you what the test is and so on and so forth, but it's it's doing a test in the background.

646
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:35,100
Ananda Sen: Under the assumption that there is no association between age and birth weight.

647
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:39,090
Ananda Sen: that's the assumption that's the underlying assumption.

648
01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:42,480
Ananda Sen: Now doing that.

649
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:45,240
Ananda Sen: Have I got a result.

650
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:54,570
Ananda Sen: that's the question and I got a result which refutes that starting point, starting premise.

651
01:46:54,570 --> 01:46:58,710
Ananda Sen: So another way of saying that is.

652
01:46:58,710 --> 01:47:02,910
Ananda Sen: If the null hypothesis with true.

653
01:47:02,910 --> 01:47:05,340
Ananda Sen: How rare.

654
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:08,520
Ananda Sen: Is the outcome.

655
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:11,790
Ananda Sen: I haven't got.

656
01:47:11,790 --> 01:47:33,690
Ananda Sen: and generally accepted threshold is 5% so I say if based on the fact that the night hypnosis through what I have got can only happen less than 5% of the times i'll call it significant, otherwise I will not call it.

657
01:47:33,690 --> 01:47:44,280
Ananda Sen: Testing hypothesis is not symmetric it is, it is done, you know we're such that you have to prove the onus is on the experimenter.

658
01:47:44,280 --> 01:48:00,870
Ananda Sen: For this to be overwhelming and it's it is related to the two types of were a Type one and Type two error and so on and so forth, it is, it is like a like a court case right the the the defendant is not guilty.

659
01:48:00,870 --> 01:48:04,260
Ananda Sen: Unless you have strong evidence.

660
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:08,910
Ananda Sen: in favor of the guilt that's the idea here.

661
01:48:08,910 --> 01:48:21,030
Ananda Sen: It is you do not show the association unless you have found the scenario which can happen only in like one in a million case.

662
01:48:21,030 --> 01:48:33,870
Ananda Sen: Under the fact that the null hypothesis is true well in this case you don't have to go that far, not one in 1,000,001 in 20 years is the threshold so 5% is a threshold that's where the fight.

663
01:48:33,870 --> 01:48:40,290
Ananda Sen: But I have to tell you this, they have asked a very interesting question because.

664
01:48:40,290 --> 01:48:46,710
Ananda Sen: When you do large testing or large scale testing I don't know how many of you have.

665
01:48:46,710 --> 01:48:54,180
Ananda Sen: been involved in a project with genetic testing but genetic testing actually does large data.

666
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:57,840
Ananda Sen: Big data high dimensional data.

667
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:02,820
Ananda Sen: 5000 genes 500 subjects.

668
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:20,250
Ananda Sen: Then, when you do this 5000 genes every time you do a test, then you any any only look at 5% by some chance 5% of the genes could come out to be significant by chance, just because you're doing 5000 as possible right.

669
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:22,410
Ananda Sen: So.

670
01:49:22,410 --> 01:49:33,180
Ananda Sen: they're the 5% is typically reduced to a much smaller number, so the so the be better threshold is much smaller there but that's something which.

671
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:46,830
Ananda Sen: Is a different different matter or different subject matter altogether, but but coming to your basic question is the p value is is simply measuring.

672
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:58,680
Ananda Sen: How rare the the findings, we have got could be given that the null hypothesis two and 5% is the characters for.

673
01:49:58,680 --> 01:50:00,150
Ananda Sen: Okay.

674
01:50:00,150 --> 01:50:13,140
Ananda Sen: Good question other questions.

675
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:16,830
Mehrdad Motamed: Our next raid you mean 20 minutes right.

676
01:50:16,830 --> 01:50:20,520
Ananda Sen: yeah yeah yeah yeah I was thinking of.

677
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:37,890
Ananda Sen: Well, actually, I was thinking of going until 410 or so is that is that Okay, or do you want to take a break at four what what, what do you want.

678
01:50:37,890 --> 01:50:39,480
Geehan: For 10 is fine okay.

679
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:48,900
Ananda Sen: And then we'll we'll have a 10 minute break and after that I want to actually show you some of the SAS thing in the in the portal so.

680
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:53,670
Ananda Sen: So okay right.

681
01:50:53,670 --> 01:50:55,200
Ananda Sen: Okay.

682
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:59,490
Ananda Sen: So.

683
01:50:59,490 --> 01:51:05,130
Ananda Sen: So then categorical covariance categorical covariance is you know.

684
01:51:05,130 --> 01:51:17,160
Ananda Sen: could be what drugs are controlled treatment intervention smoking status raise treatment has two levels smoking status and race each have three levels three categories.

685
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:24,210
Ananda Sen: And SAS by default assigns the highest numerical value is the baseline of the reference level.

686
01:51:24,210 --> 01:51:37,680
Ananda Sen: Okay, that so if it is 1233 is the baseline three is the one can change the reference level, and one can create one's own indicators for each level so let's see.

687
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:43,350
Ananda Sen: let's ask the question is smoking status associated with birth weight.

688
01:51:43,350 --> 01:51:47,850
Ananda Sen: And there are two ways of answering that question if it's just that.

689
01:51:47,850 --> 01:51:50,190
Ananda Sen: One is through.

690
01:51:50,190 --> 01:52:09,750
Ananda Sen: Something called a T test, and there is a property test to do that and i'm going to just skip this one, because i'm thinking of doing it through regression, probably the best way of doing it so So if I wanted to do it through regression, then I will use Prague glm.

691
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:15,570
Ananda Sen: And here is the thing which I was talking about before.

692
01:52:15,570 --> 01:52:23,040
Ananda Sen: I want to use a categorical thing so so categorical.

693
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:29,790
Ananda Sen: Variable so I don't want to create I don't have to create the.

694
01:52:29,790 --> 01:52:37,680
Ananda Sen: The indicator variable so prompt glm has a very nice feature called class.

695
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:48,690
Ananda Sen: The moment I say class and I, and I mentioned, which variable i'm thinking of is categorical it knows that the variable is categorical.

696
01:52:48,690 --> 01:52:57,060
Ananda Sen: So when I say model of be wt equal to smoke, it has already created that indicator variable.

697
01:52:57,060 --> 01:53:03,930
Ananda Sen: And I need I need that solution statement there to give me the estimates.

698
01:53:03,930 --> 01:53:08,040
Ananda Sen: And I also do the format.

699
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:17,730
Ananda Sen: So why do I get as a result, I get the estimates to 773 point 34243243.

700
01:53:17,730 --> 01:53:37,500
Ananda Sen: that's the intercept and for smoke no and smoke, yes, I get the value is two at 1.713 to seven, eight and let's try to see what this means, by the way this is significant so let's try to interpret this.

701
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:44,940
Ananda Sen: Children of non smoker mothers have on an average.

702
01:53:44,940 --> 01:53:55,620
Ananda Sen: To at 1.7 grams higher birthweight compared to their peers born to smoking mothers.

703
01:53:55,620 --> 01:53:59,910
Ananda Sen: that's one statement let's understand that statement.

704
01:53:59,910 --> 01:54:11,040
Ananda Sen: That to at 1.71 really the first to remember that that little thing we did when we were first talking about.

705
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:21,030
Ananda Sen: indicator variables is that every time it's being compared all those beta coefficients we're comparing things with.

706
01:54:21,030 --> 01:54:25,740
Ananda Sen: With a reference reference terrible.

707
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:27,750
Okay.

708
01:54:27,750 --> 01:54:44,550
Ananda Sen: So that so the reference category is children of non smoker mothers have on an average to at 1.7 grams higher birth weight compared to their peers born to smoke mothers.

709
01:54:44,550 --> 01:54:49,170
Ananda Sen: higher birth weight so it's a difference.

710
01:54:49,170 --> 01:54:57,600
Ananda Sen: Not the actual well.

711
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:03,240
Ananda Sen: Clear.

712
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:08,340
Ananda Sen: All right, that's one statement.

713
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:18,930
Ananda Sen: The second statement this difference is a mystical a significant with P value of point 0092.

714
01:55:18,930 --> 01:55:29,310
Ananda Sen: Point and any any put a footnote there it same as all method, the school method is referring to the T test which we just.

715
01:55:29,310 --> 01:55:37,830
Ananda Sen: printed out the results for in the previous page previously.

716
01:55:37,830 --> 01:55:51,450
Ananda Sen: So P value is point 0092 and it says that children have nonsmoker mothers have an average 21.7 grams higher Berkeley.

717
01:55:51,450 --> 01:55:54,210
Okay.

718
01:55:54,210 --> 01:55:59,610
Mehrdad Motamed: Would you please go off until.

719
01:55:59,610 --> 01:56:05,190
Mehrdad Motamed: How, how do we assign knowing me as to how fast.

720
01:56:05,190 --> 01:56:06,660
Ananda Sen: I felt was that.

721
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:12,120
Mehrdad Motamed: How do you do this, how did he is saying no and yes to our class here.

722
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:23,790
Ananda Sen: That format statement remember I created that for formative and long back there was I I say this is going back.

723
01:56:23,790 --> 01:56:25,500
Mehrdad Motamed: yeah.

724
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:27,990
Ananda Sen: See so.

725
01:56:27,990 --> 01:56:38,130
Ananda Sen: I saved that will I will create a state, yes let's create a format called answer, where one stands for, yes and zero stands for now.

726
01:56:38,130 --> 01:56:46,020
Ananda Sen: And now I went back sorry actually I think I did that here, then I.

727
01:56:46,020 --> 01:57:02,220
Ananda Sen: yeah so that's all I did, and then I go to this right here, and I say well take the variable smoke and apply the format answer.

728
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:09,870
Ananda Sen: It takes a one and changes it to yes, it takes a zero and 10 is it.

729
01:57:09,870 --> 01:57:12,510
Mehrdad Motamed: OK now we're those babies.

730
01:57:12,510 --> 01:57:15,030
Ananda Sen: On the third call that's ignore that.

731
01:57:15,030 --> 01:57:26,190
Ananda Sen: that's actually Prague glm has has this thing about estimate ability and all of those things i'm not gonna worry about those just ignore that.

732
01:57:26,190 --> 01:57:32,700
Ananda Sen: estimate standard at evaluate and probably bigger than absolutely love to the two things.

733
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:34,710
The things.

734
01:57:34,710 --> 01:57:40,560
Mehrdad Motamed: We can, what does that Shaw illusion do and, at the very end of the third row.

735
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:50,160
Ananda Sen: It creates a table and creates this table, otherwise it will not provide this table it will just give you an overall and Nova table.

736
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:59,460
Ananda Sen: So I want to, I want to point out something here, and this is, this is where running it in SAS yourself helps this is.

737
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:07,710
Ananda Sen: Where i'm only giving you the relevant part of the output i'm not giving you the full output.

738
01:58:07,710 --> 01:58:14,880
Ananda Sen: This is basically the output generated from from this, which is relevant to us for our discussion.

739
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:17,790
Ananda Sen: So it gives it prints lot more.

740
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:32,310
Ananda Sen: And one thing you can obviously do is to just play with this and and how do you play with this remember every time anything I put after a slash is an option.

741
01:58:32,310 --> 01:58:41,970
Ananda Sen: And you can remove that option, but then you also have to remove the Flash and do not remove the semi code.

742
01:58:41,970 --> 01:58:50,250
Ananda Sen: So, for example, this I could easily have taken out that slash solution, but then I will not get this table.

743
01:58:50,250 --> 01:58:52,470
The one I got.

744
01:58:52,470 --> 01:59:11,280
Ananda Sen: So these are things you can play with and then see what what you get.

745
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:16,170
Ananda Sen: And the questions okay.

746
01:59:16,170 --> 01:59:33,450
Ananda Sen: So let's do this for three category variable so a little bit more precise a little bit more involved, because one of two categories is easy, I mean, whether you do it without creating a class statement or not it's the same it's the same thing it's.

747
01:59:33,450 --> 01:59:46,620
Ananda Sen: Just a single variable but now we have got three categories, which means, if I had to create those dummy variable syndicated very but I needed to do two of them.

748
01:59:46,620 --> 01:59:57,750
Ananda Sen: But here I bypassed that by just stating the race as a class the class variable.

749
01:59:57,750 --> 02:00:09,960
Ananda Sen: And I have a model which says birthweight let's throw in another variable age and race and again solution format races F race.

750
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:14,820
Ananda Sen: What do I get that table you see right there.

751
02:00:14,820 --> 02:00:17,220
Ananda Sen: We have an intercept.

752
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:23,670
Ananda Sen: We have.

753
02:00:23,670 --> 02:00:36,030
Ananda Sen: We have race black and race other So how do you interpret this, so the way to interpret this is.

754
02:00:36,030 --> 02:00:50,700
Ananda Sen: For a fixed race for a fixed rate, whether it's black or white or other for every year increase in mother's age child's birth with weight is 6.2 grams higher on an average.

755
02:00:50,700 --> 02:00:58,830
Ananda Sen: So that's the rate of change it doesn't matter which race, are we looking at black or other white.

756
02:00:58,830 --> 02:01:04,560
Ananda Sen: Is that is that the right right way to look at it.

757
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:06,480
Ananda Sen: well.

758
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:18,840
Ananda Sen: Whether we want to have an interaction or not is a different issue, but with this model age is age rate is going to be the same for each of those.

759
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:21,720
Ananda Sen: races.

760
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:31,200
Ananda Sen: Is that significant no it's point to one ad not too different from the p value is point.

761
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:37,890
Ananda Sen: stock point to one again sorry that's that's wrong that's wrong soon as point 539 sorry.

762
02:01:37,890 --> 02:01:40,500
Geehan: yeah I was wondering about that.

763
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:42,690
Ananda Sen: yeah.

764
02:01:42,690 --> 02:01:51,450
Ananda Sen: That was my mistake, I think I was copying things so this should be Point five.

765
02:01:51,450 --> 02:02:04,590
Ananda Sen: Fortunately, the conclusion didn't change in fact it's stronger that it's not left to discipline.

766
02:02:04,590 --> 02:02:07,680
Ananda Sen: And, and then.

767
02:02:07,680 --> 02:02:22,890
Ananda Sen: Looking look at the other two black and others so children have a black mother of a certain age way on an average 367 grams lower than children have a white mother of the same image.

768
02:02:22,890 --> 02:02:28,410
Ananda Sen: You can do a similar conclusion children of.

769
02:02:28,410 --> 02:02:34,650
Ananda Sen: race or killing off a mother with other race.

770
02:02:34,650 --> 02:02:44,940
Ananda Sen: of a certain age we on an average to 87.95 grams lower than children have a white mother, the same age, so a couple of things happening.

771
02:02:44,940 --> 02:02:51,720
Ananda Sen: All those interpretations are with respect to the white mother, because they are the reference reference category.

772
02:02:51,720 --> 02:03:09,150
Ananda Sen: One two i'm keeping age, constant, what does it mean of the same age see i'm making comparison when I say children have a black mother of a certain age we're on an average 367 grams lower than children have a white mother, the same age that same age is a crucial point.

773
02:03:09,150 --> 02:03:16,680
Ananda Sen: I will choose to mothers in the same boat, or 25 years old, three years old doesn't matter, they have the same age.

774
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:19,980
Ananda Sen: Then I can make the fence.

775
02:03:19,980 --> 02:03:24,060
Ananda Sen: Keeping the other value constant is how.

776
02:03:24,060 --> 02:03:31,350
Ananda Sen: regression coefficients are interpreted.

777
02:03:31,350 --> 02:03:33,750
Ananda Sen: What about the intercept.

778
02:03:33,750 --> 02:03:43,530
Ananda Sen: Well, the intercept is a problem right because remember the intercept can only be interpreted as the.

779
02:03:43,530 --> 02:03:49,680
Ananda Sen: The average for the white if the ages zero, but he cannot be zero.

780
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:59,550
Ananda Sen: So it's a little strange way of looking at intercept but, as I said before, let's do an age centering.

781
02:03:59,550 --> 02:04:02,820
Ananda Sen: So this is what I what I what I mean so.

782
02:04:02,820 --> 02:04:10,800
Ananda Sen: White mothers at eight zero, on average, have babies who weighed 295 3.5 grams at birth.

783
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:15,480
Ananda Sen: So the intercept is the average.

784
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:23,100
Ananda Sen: Age of the babies of white mothers, but only 480 that is completely meaningless.

785
02:04:23,100 --> 02:04:36,990
Ananda Sen: So let's send her the age and how do I sent her age well let's take it at the mean age what's the median age, I want to do a proper means to make sure that the data that.

786
02:04:36,990 --> 02:04:40,500
Ananda Sen: I know the mean the mean is 23.23.

787
02:04:40,500 --> 02:05:00,150
Ananda Sen: So if I create a variable, so this is another another thing you need to understand about SAS the SAS the way it works is you can create and recreate data so here i'm recreating a data taking a.

788
02:05:00,150 --> 02:05:04,800
Ananda Sen: and creating a new data set called also called the.

789
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:11,670
Ananda Sen: But then it has the additional variable what is the additional variable age Center.

790
02:05:11,670 --> 02:05:18,600
Ananda Sen: Which is age minus 23.

791
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:28,530
Ananda Sen: So the new variable now aid Center is age minus 23 alright so let's see.

792
02:05:28,530 --> 02:05:41,880
Ananda Sen: What happened rob gielan data a class race model be wt but now I have not age, but age centered.

793
02:05:41,880 --> 02:05:59,220
Ananda Sen: What changed, let us look at the, let us look at the this table and compared to so remember this 3095 is intercept eight Central 6.18 race black minus 367 race other minus 27 and so on and so forth.

794
02:05:59,220 --> 02:06:08,400
Ananda Sen: Exactly the same other than the intercept intercept is the only thing that changed.

795
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:19,980
Ananda Sen: But now it has a meaning, what is the meaning white mothers of age 23 on average have babies who weighed 309517.

796
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:23,880
Ananda Sen: Now you don't have to Center it at me.

797
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:29,730
Ananda Sen: You could come up with a meaningful clinical age let's say you want to know what.

798
02:06:29,730 --> 02:06:32,430
Ananda Sen: What a 30 year old.

799
02:06:32,430 --> 02:06:39,630
Ananda Sen: Woman an average birth weight of a 30 year old woman is for a 30 year old.

800
02:06:39,630 --> 02:06:54,360
Ananda Sen: You could subtract 30 natalie.

801
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:59,040
Ananda Sen: What about interaction throwing the interaction.

802
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:01,500
Ananda Sen: race.

803
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:05,490
Ananda Sen: Each Center aid Center and race interaction.

804
02:07:05,490 --> 02:07:11,970
Ananda Sen: i've got a bunch of things so let's see what it means.

805
02:07:11,970 --> 02:07:14,130
Ananda Sen: First.

806
02:07:14,130 --> 02:07:17,250
Ananda Sen: Look at estimates carefully.

807
02:07:17,250 --> 02:07:25,380
Ananda Sen: With the p value and the p value.

808
02:07:25,380 --> 02:07:34,320
Ananda Sen: Black mothers of age 23 have children, who are 416 16.6 grams lighter than the white mothers of the same age.

809
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:45,270
Ananda Sen: Mothers of other race of age, so when I was a foreign 16.6 coming from in that column in a drawer corresponding to black.

810
02:07:45,270 --> 02:07:49,740
Ananda Sen: The mothers have to have the same age.

811
02:07:49,740 --> 02:07:56,670
Ananda Sen: And the age is 23 because I have centered everything to 23.

812
02:07:56,670 --> 02:08:21,900
Ananda Sen: So it's black mothers of age 23 have children, who are 416.6 grams lighter than the white mothers of the same age so it's age 23.

813
02:08:21,900 --> 02:08:32,310
Ananda Sen: Mothers of other race of age 23 have children were 275.2 grams lighter than the white mothers of the same inch.

814
02:08:32,310 --> 02:08:45,570
Ananda Sen: White mothers of age 2300 average have children with 3076 grams per click what changed.

815
02:08:45,570 --> 02:08:56,370
Ananda Sen: What changed.

816
02:08:56,370 --> 02:09:04,920
Ananda Sen: And this, I think, is one of the most crucial take home messages for today's class.

817
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:13,650
Ananda Sen: Something change the way i'm interpreting something changed.

818
02:09:13,650 --> 02:09:28,020
Ananda Sen: Again, I said black mothers of age 23 have children, who are 416 Point six months later than the white mothers have the same age if we if we go a little a couple.

819
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:29,760
Ananda Sen: yeah right.

820
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:41,370
Ananda Sen: So this speech should enough a black mother for certain age way on an average 367 grams lower than children have a white mother, the same niche.

821
02:09:41,370 --> 02:09:46,680
Ananda Sen: Remember, I said same age, I did not specify 23.

822
02:09:46,680 --> 02:09:49,230
Ananda Sen: here.

823
02:09:49,230 --> 02:09:52,380
Ananda Sen: i'm specifying 23.

824
02:09:52,380 --> 02:10:10,410
Ananda Sen: Why.

825
02:10:10,410 --> 02:10:12,840
Geehan: Because you Center the drain.

826
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:15,600
Ananda Sen: that's right not only centered the.

827
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:21,570
Ananda Sen: Age but it's not just Center so for example here.

828
02:10:21,570 --> 02:10:25,950
Ananda Sen: If I just look at this one.

829
02:10:25,950 --> 02:10:48,570
Ananda Sen: I would not have to bring in the 23 I could see that black mothers would have babies, who are on an average three six or seven rooms lower than a white mother off the same age, I would never have to mention 23.

830
02:10:48,570 --> 02:10:53,970
Ananda Sen: it's a very subtle point I would never have to mention 23.

831
02:10:53,970 --> 02:10:59,340
Ananda Sen: Here I must mentioned 23.

832
02:10:59,340 --> 02:11:01,590
Ananda Sen: And the numbers change do.

833
02:11:01,590 --> 02:11:06,690
Ananda Sen: Which is also an indicator that it's not the same model.

834
02:11:06,690 --> 02:11:16,050
Ananda Sen: So it's not just that not just the fact that have sent it at 23 it's also the fact that I have an interaction term in the model.

835
02:11:16,050 --> 02:11:28,590
Ananda Sen: anytime you have an interaction term in the model, the only way I can talk about the effect is add the reference value for the other variable.

836
02:11:28,590 --> 02:11:38,070
Ananda Sen: And the reference value for eight Center is when he becomes zero it Center becomes zero which said 23.

837
02:11:38,070 --> 02:11:48,870
Ananda Sen: What is the corresponding thing for what happens to the age Center now so 21 1377174.

838
02:11:48,870 --> 02:11:55,440
Ananda Sen: Remember that is also different from the aid Center value here.

839
02:11:55,440 --> 02:12:01,530
Ananda Sen: So what does that mean that means what I wrote here.

840
02:12:01,530 --> 02:12:11,430
Ananda Sen: For each year, increasing the age of white mothers, the birth weight of the child increases by 21.

841
02:12:11,430 --> 02:12:14,190
Ananda Sen: White mothers.

842
02:12:14,190 --> 02:12:19,110
Ananda Sen: What happens to the black mothers.

843
02:12:19,110 --> 02:12:29,640
Ananda Sen: The for each year increase in the age of black mothers, the birth of a child decreases by 41 grams, what did they get the 41 grams.

844
02:12:29,640 --> 02:12:39,690
Ananda Sen: So the 41 grams comes from the fact that I have 21 here.

845
02:12:39,690 --> 02:12:49,500
Ananda Sen: And then look at that corresponding interaction term aid Center and black just add boost.

846
02:12:49,500 --> 02:12:52,620
Ananda Sen: 21 minus 16.

847
02:12:52,620 --> 02:12:59,820
Ananda Sen: Similarly for other mothers, the birth weight of the child decreases by five grams.

848
02:12:59,820 --> 02:13:08,340
Ananda Sen: 21 minus 26 you see how the interpretation changes, it is a different.

849
02:13:08,340 --> 02:13:12,840
Ananda Sen: Different model altogether interaction is not an.

850
02:13:12,840 --> 02:13:23,070
Ananda Sen: issue you have to be very careful and this is, this is what I was saying, I I look a lot of statistical papers for for medical journals and.

851
02:13:23,070 --> 02:13:32,940
Ananda Sen: either as a reviewer or as just trying to understand what they were doing in the study and I see this mistake all the time.

852
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:43,170
Ananda Sen: The interpretation actually changes, when you have an interception the model and interaction the monster interaction, you can only interpret.

853
02:13:43,170 --> 02:14:00,840
Ananda Sen: These are called main effects the ones which are which are just the variables themselves and not the interaction terms, those are called main effect, the first product terms, the main effects can only be interpreted as the baseline category for the other variable.

854
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:06,840
Ananda Sen: So age sent can only be different for the reference.

855
02:14:06,840 --> 02:14:10,920
Ananda Sen: race well, which is white.

856
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:38,190
Ananda Sen: The the race variables, the difference in the race variables when a black and white, can only be interpreted 4048 cents, which is 23.

857
02:14:38,190 --> 02:14:44,160
Ananda Sen: This is a I don't know what this is this is.

858
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:49,560
Ananda Sen: This is not for this particular.

859
02:14:49,560 --> 02:14:52,920
Ananda Sen: day of smoke here.

860
02:14:52,920 --> 02:15:10,980
Ananda Sen: I don't think that smoke here, this is for some some other thing I don't know why.

861
02:15:10,980 --> 02:15:19,320
Ananda Sen: yeah right and I cannot, this is probably another example I was using him I just.

862
02:15:19,320 --> 02:15:24,150
Ananda Sen: didn't take it out i'm sorry.

863
02:15:24,150 --> 02:15:29,340
So confusing.

864
02:15:29,340 --> 02:15:31,890
Ananda Sen: Okay.

865
02:15:31,890 --> 02:15:34,020
Ananda Sen: Take a break.

866
02:15:34,020 --> 02:15:41,850
Ananda Sen: we'll come back at 425 think about it, ask me questions once we come back.

867
02:15:41,850 --> 02:26:43,290
Okay.

868
02:26:43,290 --> 02:26:48,690
Ananda Sen: Okay.

869
02:26:48,690 --> 02:26:52,770
Ananda Sen: let's get back to the.

870
02:26:52,770 --> 02:27:03,840
Ananda Sen: Last part of today's lecture.

871
02:27:03,840 --> 02:27:07,890
Ananda Sen: So.

872
02:27:07,890 --> 02:27:12,150
Ananda Sen: i'll just put it up, one more time just to make sure that.

873
02:27:12,150 --> 02:27:16,710
Ananda Sen: You understand what.

874
02:27:16,710 --> 02:27:24,030
Ananda Sen: This output means and i'm going to clean up this output, a little bit a some my tree legs.

875
02:27:24,030 --> 02:27:26,550
Ananda Sen: And would update the.

876
02:27:26,550 --> 02:27:31,080
Ananda Sen: The file and put it back on the.

877
02:27:31,080 --> 02:27:36,570
Ananda Sen: On canvas um.

878
02:27:36,570 --> 02:27:53,730
Ananda Sen: Any question.

879
02:27:53,730 --> 02:27:56,280
Ananda Sen: Whether we.

880
02:27:56,280 --> 02:28:02,070
Ananda Sen: It does make a difference when we when you.

881
02:28:02,070 --> 02:28:08,520
Ananda Sen: interpret a categorical variable as a category specify a categorical variable is categorical variable versus not.

882
02:28:08,520 --> 02:28:10,800
Ananda Sen: For example.

883
02:28:10,800 --> 02:28:16,710
Ananda Sen: If you didn't use the class statement and he was prob glm, this is what you would end up getting.

884
02:28:16,710 --> 02:28:25,230
Ananda Sen: The intercept and the age and and race which does not show anything other than an overall.

885
02:28:25,230 --> 02:28:36,900
Ananda Sen: Corresponding coefficient thinking off race as a as a linear continuous variable with values 123, so it is a very different interpretation so it's.

886
02:28:36,900 --> 02:28:43,740
Ananda Sen: Definitely, something you have to get.

887
02:28:43,740 --> 02:28:46,950
Ananda Sen: So.

888
02:28:46,950 --> 02:28:52,050
Ananda Sen: There are some more examples so but with MTV.

889
02:28:52,050 --> 02:29:01,260
Ananda Sen: But with MTV solution So how do you interpret the findings so i'll let you read these.

890
02:29:01,260 --> 02:29:06,300
Ananda Sen: And then, it comes to hypothesis testing so.

891
02:29:06,300 --> 02:29:12,660
Ananda Sen: This is the time when I would switch from here.

892
02:29:12,660 --> 02:29:26,400
Ananda Sen: In fact, what i'll do.

893
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:30,060
Ananda Sen: let's stop the screen broadcasting here.

894
02:29:30,060 --> 02:29:32,280
Ananda Sen: and

895
02:29:32,280 --> 02:29:35,640
Ananda Sen: ask you the following question.

896
02:29:35,640 --> 02:29:39,870
Ananda Sen: Which is how many of you have.

897
02:29:39,870 --> 02:29:44,550
Ananda Sen: The SAS on demand running.

898
02:29:44,550 --> 02:29:47,610
Ananda Sen: Or how many of you okay.

899
02:29:47,610 --> 02:29:50,130
Geehan: One two.

900
02:29:50,130 --> 02:30:09,510
Ananda Sen: And three okay good, so what I was going to do is to show you how to operate this and SAS on demand for those of you who want to use SAS outside SAS on demand it's fine you can use the same thing.

901
02:30:09,510 --> 02:30:11,100
Ananda Sen: And then.

902
02:30:11,100 --> 02:30:14,400
Ananda Sen: For others.

903
02:30:14,400 --> 02:30:33,300
Ananda Sen: If you don't have SAS on demand running and we're thinking of doing it now everything is on on canvas it's not the you don't even have the chords, I just wanted to show you initially how to start this so.

904
02:30:33,300 --> 02:30:39,720
Ananda Sen: So let me just pull it up from my side.

905
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:42,090
Ananda Sen: So I would start.

906
02:30:42,090 --> 02:30:47,100
Ananda Sen: Sharing screen in a moment.

907
02:30:47,100 --> 02:31:10,980
there.

908
02:31:10,980 --> 02:31:16,410
Ananda Sen: Alright, so let's do this.

909
02:31:16,410 --> 02:31:32,040
Ananda Sen: Let me share screen.

910
02:31:32,040 --> 02:31:57,870
Ananda Sen: Can you see my screen, this is on demand for academic signing okay wonderful so um, so this is what you would see if you if you pull on says on demand i'll start from the beginning, so i'll use my email address which i've been using for thing and then.

911
02:31:57,870 --> 02:32:01,260
Ananda Sen: And do not forget to accept the terms.

912
02:32:01,260 --> 02:32:04,410
Ananda Sen: And that's how you sign in.

913
02:32:04,410 --> 02:32:28,230
Ananda Sen: I don't know how yours will show up mine shows up with two options and I don't have any access to this, so I will just go to a studio.

914
02:32:28,230 --> 02:32:33,270
Ananda Sen: So I had a few things already there.

915
02:32:33,270 --> 02:32:35,280
Ananda Sen: Which.

916
02:32:35,280 --> 02:32:46,800
Ananda Sen: Basically FAB lab one chord success, and the reason I wanted to show this is because everything else in the chords are the same, except for the lightning.

917
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:57,330
Ananda Sen: command so home your 493-476-8628 where did they get that from.

918
02:32:57,330 --> 02:33:01,350
Ananda Sen: So let's do this.

919
02:33:01,350 --> 02:33:13,950
tasks and utilities.

920
02:33:13,950 --> 02:33:20,310
Ananda Sen: or server files and folders.

921
02:33:20,310 --> 02:33:31,890
Ananda Sen: So I had the data file already there, but I wanted to show you one example where you would get.

922
02:33:31,890 --> 02:33:40,350
Ananda Sen: How would you get a SAS five, for example, so let me get rid of this one.

923
02:33:40,350 --> 02:33:46,290
Ananda Sen: I mean delete this I right clicked and I deleted this.

924
02:33:46,290 --> 02:33:49,560
Ananda Sen: So there is no so now.

925
02:33:49,560 --> 02:33:56,190
Ananda Sen: I will bring one in from outside So how do I do that so.

926
02:33:56,190 --> 02:33:59,550
Ananda Sen: files home.

927
02:33:59,550 --> 02:34:04,920
Ananda Sen: Then you see this icon.

928
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:09,300
Ananda Sen: or not, that I can i'm sorry this one upload.

929
02:34:09,300 --> 02:34:23,820
Ananda Sen: So upload and it will upload files to that's my directory home you 49347686 that will be my.

930
02:34:23,820 --> 02:34:25,410
Ananda Sen: Bad.

931
02:34:25,410 --> 02:34:27,780
Ananda Sen: Now.

932
02:34:27,780 --> 02:34:35,040
Ananda Sen: In your case you don't have your 4934768 to get something else.

933
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:57,690
Ananda Sen: that's the one you'll have to put in there, so if you're doing this with me, I am going to choose files and i'm going to do it from my computer so under July 2021 you have it under data sets and I wanted to sell lbw so.

934
02:34:57,690 --> 02:35:06,630
Ananda Sen: And I would say upload.

935
02:35:06,630 --> 02:35:11,850
replace.

936
02:35:11,850 --> 02:35:20,190
Ananda Sen: Oh sorry I didn't I didn't mean that what what I meant was, I wanted to get them.

937
02:35:20,190 --> 02:35:25,530
Ananda Sen: Not that not the data sets dataset was already there.

938
02:35:25,530 --> 02:35:29,550
Ananda Sen: I wanted the software code.

939
02:35:29,550 --> 02:35:51,600
Which is left one good success.

940
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:56,790
Ananda Sen: Right now, one God success.

941
02:35:56,790 --> 02:36:01,200
Ananda Sen: Obviously, the first line has to be changed.

942
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:18,060
Ananda Sen: And let's see how a change there again if you want to know where you should what should it be, then the best way to do is.

943
02:36:18,060 --> 02:36:24,330
Ananda Sen: copy and paste from here.

944
02:36:24,330 --> 02:36:30,360
Ananda Sen: This entire thing and on one second.

945
02:36:30,360 --> 02:36:47,580
Ananda Sen: So this entire thing.

946
02:36:47,580 --> 02:36:49,200
Ananda Sen: Okay.

947
02:36:49,200 --> 02:36:52,260
Ananda Sen: that's it that's the only change.

948
02:36:52,260 --> 02:36:59,820
Ananda Sen: And after that everything is the same, so let us run this first make sure I.

949
02:36:59,820 --> 02:37:03,450
Ananda Sen: have got everything.

950
02:37:03,450 --> 02:37:11,040
Geehan: Question when I tried to download the clothes it's not opening for me do I just hit save file.

951
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:12,450
Ananda Sen: i'm sorry was that.

952
02:37:12,450 --> 02:37:14,790
Geehan: When I tried to download the codes.

953
02:37:14,790 --> 02:37:17,580
Geehan: The lab on the website.

954
02:37:17,580 --> 02:37:20,970
Geehan: It says open with browse or then save file do I just.

955
02:37:20,970 --> 02:37:26,130
Ananda Sen: click on save, save five say file to your computer.

956
02:37:26,130 --> 02:37:27,360
Geehan: Okay.

957
02:37:27,360 --> 02:37:38,220
Ananda Sen: yeah So if I do a computer whatever you're you're saving them save them there and then then pull it through the way I did that i'll wait i'll wait for you worry.

958
02:37:38,220 --> 02:38:06,540
Okay.

959
02:38:06,540 --> 02:38:07,140
Geehan: Go ahead.

Geehan: Thank you.

961
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:10,770
Ananda Sen: anybody else have any other question.

962
02:38:10,770 --> 02:38:14,490
Ananda Sen: Okay, so always go to home.

963
02:38:14,490 --> 02:38:15,810
Ananda Sen: And, and then.

964
02:38:15,810 --> 02:38:16,710
Ananda Sen: downloaded.

965
02:38:16,710 --> 02:38:30,240
Ananda Sen: At home don't don't don't use any of these things my courses my shared file links all of those do not work for me I just go to home downloaded there from my local computer.

966
02:38:30,240 --> 02:38:36,390
Ananda Sen: And then it is stored in the SAS user dot V 94.

967
02:38:36,390 --> 02:38:37,950
Ananda Sen: folder.

968
02:38:37,950 --> 02:38:49,350
Ananda Sen: And, and then I just I have this three things code log and results, the results is showing the test results and code is the code.

969
02:38:49,350 --> 02:38:57,300
Ananda Sen: So, so I basically ran through some of the initial ones and the way to run through it is to just highlight it.

970
02:38:57,300 --> 02:39:04,350
Ananda Sen: So see highlighted and there is this little guy running there.

971
02:39:04,350 --> 02:39:16,740
Ananda Sen: So that's the run so run all or selected code, so I have this selected it and it's running.

972
02:39:16,740 --> 02:39:21,510
Ananda Sen: And, and the results are showing showing the.

973
02:39:21,510 --> 02:39:25,500
Ananda Sen: results from this drum now.

974
02:39:25,500 --> 02:39:31,620
Christie Flanagan: When I tried to run mine I got an error code and i'm wondering if I did something wrong it.

975
02:39:31,620 --> 02:39:32,970
Christie Flanagan: Let me go back so I.

976
02:39:32,970 --> 02:39:37,620
Ananda Sen: Did you did you did you do the live name first.

977
02:39:37,620 --> 02:39:45,000
Christie Flanagan: I did, but maybe I did that wrong I changed I copied it.

978
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:46,740
Christie Flanagan: Where is it now.

979
02:39:46,740 --> 02:39:53,460
Christie Flanagan: it's great yeah I changed it to the backslash home backslash and then my you number.

980
02:39:53,460 --> 02:40:00,090
Ananda Sen: And, did you put the quotes back should be in the quotes.

981
02:40:00,090 --> 02:40:01,980
Christie Flanagan: I can you show me your.

982
02:40:01,980 --> 02:40:04,620
Christie Flanagan: Mind doesn't have the it's not highlighted in.

983
02:40:04,620 --> 02:40:06,180
purple.

984
02:40:06,180 --> 02:40:07,830
Christie Flanagan: Do I need to put those.

985
02:40:07,830 --> 02:40:10,920
Ananda Sen: You have to put this coats yes.

986
02:40:10,920 --> 02:40:12,960
Ananda Sen: And then the semi colon.

987
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:15,870
Christie Flanagan: How do I enter the those.

988
02:40:15,870 --> 02:40:20,370
Christie Flanagan: yeah yeah the part it's not letting me enter it.

989
02:40:20,370 --> 02:40:22,650
Christie Flanagan: Oh, here it is now it's doing it okay.

990
02:40:22,650 --> 02:40:24,030
Christie Flanagan: I got it sorry about that.

991
02:40:24,030 --> 02:40:24,960
Ananda Sen: Oh no problem.

992
02:40:24,960 --> 02:40:26,280
Christie Flanagan: Okay, thank you.

993
02:40:26,280 --> 02:40:27,930
Ananda Sen: Getting routed now.

994
02:40:27,930 --> 02:40:29,190
Christie Flanagan: yeah, let me just double check.

995
02:40:29,190 --> 02:40:47,640
Christie Flanagan: yeah yeah.

996
02:40:47,640 --> 02:40:48,990
Christie Flanagan: copying the wrong section.

997
02:40:48,990 --> 02:40:55,050
Christie Flanagan: Okay, let me, let me, let me, let me point out something I just realized that this is this could be part of the reason.

998
02:40:55,050 --> 02:40:56,820
Ananda Sen: So I did something.

999
02:40:56,820 --> 02:41:06,540
Ananda Sen: I actually cheated, I actually also downloaded the data sets here that's why it's reading the data set.

1000
02:41:06,540 --> 02:41:15,570
Ananda Sen: Because it's already seeing them there, for example, this lbw are you are you having problem, even in the first line or.

1001
02:41:15,570 --> 02:41:16,890
Christie Flanagan: I fixed that.

1002
02:41:16,890 --> 02:41:18,060
Christie Flanagan: let's go down.

1003
02:41:18,060 --> 02:41:19,080
Ananda Sen: So so.

1004
02:41:19,080 --> 02:41:25,410
Ananda Sen: You need to have a data set called lb w dot.

1005
02:41:25,410 --> 02:41:36,330
Ananda Sen: SAS SAS seven be deck which I already have, if you look at my screen you'll see that it's it's i'm pointing towards towards my left and that I did not, you did not.

1006
02:41:36,330 --> 02:41:50,670
Ananda Sen: Have that before unless he had already downloaded it before but that's something you have a download download also so you those data sets are in data sets folder.

1007
02:41:50,670 --> 02:41:56,190
Ananda Sen: In in the Web you do the same thing as you did, for the.

1008
02:41:56,190 --> 02:42:17,280
Ananda Sen: For the SAS file sorry I should have mentioned that earlier.

1009
02:42:17,280 --> 02:42:25,410
Christie Flanagan: Okay, have it uploaded now into SAS so what what data do I run What did you run to get what you had.

1010
02:42:25,410 --> 02:42:25,950
Ananda Sen: Oh.

1011
02:42:25,950 --> 02:42:28,560
Christie Flanagan: I like to highlight to run.

1012
02:42:28,560 --> 02:42:36,210
Ananda Sen: um so So do you have this on your on your on demands folder now so w okay good.

1013
02:42:36,210 --> 02:42:37,200
Christie Flanagan: I just uploaded.

1014
02:42:37,200 --> 02:42:47,190
Ananda Sen: yeah so so just highlight let's say let's try this first just highlight.

1015
02:42:47,190 --> 02:42:51,180
Ananda Sen: Up to this quick.

1016
02:42:51,180 --> 02:43:00,360
Ananda Sen: actually just go down a little farther let's do up until proc contents, so that I know.

1017
02:43:00,360 --> 02:43:04,920
Ananda Sen: Then do run select that and then Dora.

1018
02:43:04,920 --> 02:43:07,230
Christie Flanagan: Okay, it works perfectly that time, thank you.

1019
02:43:07,230 --> 02:43:14,460
Ananda Sen: Very well, as I think I think it was that was the problem I forgot to mention that you also have to have the data set obviously.

1020
02:43:14,460 --> 02:43:16,230
So.

1021
02:43:16,230 --> 02:43:23,340
Ananda Sen: yeah so that's that and then, once you have this, then everything is.

1022
02:43:23,340 --> 02:43:30,210
Ananda Sen: The way it should work and and the nice thing about this is this entire thing is running on the cloud, so you don't have to.

1023
02:43:30,210 --> 02:43:41,760
Ananda Sen: it's not on your computer it's not clogging your computer by any means, of course, you have the data set there and the end but that's that's not big and the code isn't smaller so.

1024
02:43:41,760 --> 02:43:45,330
Ananda Sen: So yeah so um.

1025
02:43:45,330 --> 02:43:53,850
Ananda Sen: What we were doing were things like you know Brock format and, probably, we could we could.

1026
02:43:53,850 --> 02:43:59,280
Ananda Sen: Try highlighting, at least up on.

1027
02:43:59,280 --> 02:44:05,850
Ananda Sen: prop freak and see if things are working fine, yes, those are the means.

1028
02:44:05,850 --> 02:44:15,330
Ananda Sen: then see there are these three tabs on the top one is called Code, the second one is called log and the third one is results.

1029
02:44:15,330 --> 02:44:26,010
Ananda Sen: So anytime you have to run the code go to the code button anytime you have to see the results go there anytime you want to see the error message go to log file.

1030
02:44:26,010 --> 02:44:31,200
Ananda Sen: So so right now, things are running so there are no error messages.

1031
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:38,910
Ananda Sen: And then, and then go from there, so, so what were what we were doing at the very.

1032
02:44:38,910 --> 02:44:47,460
Ananda Sen: Most recently, are things with Prague glm where we were we had the.

1033
02:44:47,460 --> 02:44:50,760
Ananda Sen: Prague glm running for for.

1034
02:44:50,760 --> 02:44:54,780
Ananda Sen: For the data and then we're calculating the.

1035
02:44:54,780 --> 02:44:58,230
Ananda Sen: The race and so on and so forth, so.

1036
02:44:58,230 --> 02:45:01,170
Ananda Sen: um.

1037
02:45:01,170 --> 02:45:09,510
Ananda Sen: One thing I did not mention on that particular.

1038
02:45:09,510 --> 02:45:15,870
Ananda Sen: Variable.

1039
02:45:15,870 --> 02:45:20,700
Ananda Sen: Details glm okay.

1040
02:45:20,700 --> 02:45:27,750
Ananda Sen: So right about here which you see on my screen, there is a prop glm statement.

1041
02:45:27,750 --> 02:45:50,340
Ananda Sen: I have a class statement for race, I have modeled Bart with age race and then have a different statement, you have not seen this before Ls means race adjust equal to bond for only mark So what does that be ignored that just tickle the bond for only put first, but what does Ls means racecars.

1042
02:45:50,340 --> 02:46:02,490
Ananda Sen: And i'm using the formatting bag so let's run this and see what happens.

1043
02:46:02,490 --> 02:46:06,540
Ananda Sen: Okay, so it first of all, gives me.

1044
02:46:06,540 --> 02:46:17,070
Ananda Sen: An overall, no one model, the first table basically says well this model has a three category variable.

1045
02:46:17,070 --> 02:46:27,510
Ananda Sen: Which is race and then also there is a continuous variable called each and each of them has certain degrees of freedom so ages one.

1046
02:46:27,510 --> 02:46:42,630
Ananda Sen: Because it's a continuous variable grace is too, because there are three categories so it's always the number of categories minus one, and the first table stays overall the model has some significant.

1047
02:46:42,630 --> 02:46:44,190
Ananda Sen: Variable.

1048
02:46:44,190 --> 02:46:58,260
Ananda Sen: The second thing R square says what is the proportion of variability explained by using age and race and the answer is not much because our square is typically can go up 200%.

1049
02:46:58,260 --> 02:47:11,910
Ananda Sen: The closer to 100% is higher and here is only 5% with clinical data with medical data R square of 30 to 40% is probably pretty good.

1050
02:47:11,910 --> 02:47:17,760
Ananda Sen: With engineering data, you can expect our square to be in the 70% range.

1051
02:47:17,760 --> 02:47:21,720
Ananda Sen: Now, in this case it's actually.

1052
02:47:21,720 --> 02:47:27,060
Ananda Sen: Not much explained at all and and he turns out to be.

1053
02:47:27,060 --> 02:47:40,290
Ananda Sen: Non significant anyway, which is explained in the next next table see that probability bigger than F that's an alternative version of P value.

1054
02:47:40,290 --> 02:47:48,720
Ananda Sen: And race is point 0142 that's also be value, but that actually says that there is a significant difference.

1055
02:47:48,720 --> 02:47:52,740
Ananda Sen: Now.

1056
02:47:52,740 --> 02:48:00,480
Ananda Sen: So that whole bunch of pictures and stuff like that i'm and i'm going to go there much.

1057
02:48:00,480 --> 02:48:17,100
Ananda Sen: But glm procedure gives you the least squares mean for the three categories so birthweight in the three categories average but within three categories adjusting for age, so this is a nice thing.

1058
02:48:17,100 --> 02:48:29,850
Ananda Sen: Adjusting for the age means that, basically, for the same it is it's like the regression variables regression coefficients but it gives you all of those in one stroke you don't have to calculate those.

1059
02:48:29,850 --> 02:48:39,300
Ananda Sen: that's a nice thing you can ignore that next next one next table that's a little bit extra provides.

1060
02:48:39,300 --> 02:48:41,700
Ananda Sen: All these pictures are.

1061
02:48:41,700 --> 02:48:47,310
Ananda Sen: Not needed at this point, but.

1062
02:48:47,310 --> 02:48:55,050
Ananda Sen: But Ellis means actually provides that extra thing which I, which I did not mention before now.

1063
02:48:55,050 --> 02:48:59,910
Ananda Sen: If I had to use.

1064
02:48:59,910 --> 02:49:11,160
Ananda Sen: The same thing, but now, with Brock read I need to create dummy variables remember the way we said in the first example we started off with.

1065
02:49:11,160 --> 02:49:27,150
Ananda Sen: The car status said, we had to create dummy variables for American and European cars, well, we have to create dummy variables here to for that the different races, if I have to use it as as as that So how do I do that.

1066
02:49:27,150 --> 02:49:36,270
Ananda Sen: Well, this is the SAS trick of doing this, I wanted to do it in a in a separate database because.

1067
02:49:36,270 --> 02:49:49,680
Ananda Sen: I wanted to have this variable this dummy variables created in a separate data so so I said data be sect a what does that mean it means I am creating a database called be.

1068
02:49:49,680 --> 02:50:08,370
Ananda Sen: i'm extracting everything from a and i'm creating these two additional variables I don't have to do database at a data a could also be that could I could, if I could recreate a the way I did before, but here I just creating a separate database.

1069
02:50:08,370 --> 02:50:22,770
Ananda Sen: Black that's my indicator variable race equal to two this bracket means create a variable called black where whenever race equal to to have one.

1070
02:50:22,770 --> 02:50:45,060
Ananda Sen: Otherwise zero other equal to within parentheses race equal to three, that means race equal to three put other equal does one elsewhere it zero it's a very nice trick, and I think those of you who are spss users spss does the same thing.

1071
02:50:45,060 --> 02:50:57,450
Ananda Sen: So, so if you are in spss user and you have used a strict before it is creating those indicator variable it's it's a very useful thing to have in most most.

1072
02:50:57,450 --> 02:51:02,910
Ananda Sen: Standards mystical software, this is the way to creating.

1073
02:51:02,910 --> 02:51:06,150
Ananda Sen: Okay.

1074
02:51:06,150 --> 02:51:12,150
Ananda Sen: Alright, so let's see what happened, so if I did that.

1075
02:51:12,150 --> 02:51:21,030
Ananda Sen: and try to make sure that i've got the right one, so let's see did I do that right.

1076
02:51:21,030 --> 02:51:26,700
Ananda Sen: So black.

1077
02:51:26,700 --> 02:51:39,330
Ananda Sen: So so black is one and zero right, so if black is zero that means race equal to two and three.

1078
02:51:39,330 --> 02:51:41,790
Ananda Sen: When black is one.

1079
02:51:41,790 --> 02:51:55,170
Ananda Sen: Racist to one and three and sorry racist or so, so it did did do the right spreading it only extracted the ones which which correspond to a sequel to do so that's the right thing to do, okay.

1080
02:51:55,170 --> 02:52:06,180
Ananda Sen: So I know I did the right thing, once they know it did the right thing let's run a prop glm without the class statement, but this time it's black and other.

1081
02:52:06,180 --> 02:52:15,420
Ananda Sen: So we'll do the same thing as the class let's that's a question.

1082
02:52:15,420 --> 02:52:17,730
Ananda Sen: well.

1083
02:52:17,730 --> 02:52:24,060
Ananda Sen: I think it did, except for the fact that I forgot to provide the solution thing in there, so.

1084
02:52:24,060 --> 02:52:28,140
let's do the solution.

1085
02:52:28,140 --> 02:52:38,190
oops let it go.

1086
02:52:38,190 --> 02:53:11,190
Ananda Sen: gold.

1087
02:53:11,190 --> 02:53:14,190
Ananda Sen: There you go.

1088
02:53:14,190 --> 02:53:21,690
Ananda Sen: Here is the intercept here is the black and here is the other what you do not see is white.

1089
02:53:21,690 --> 02:53:53,820
Ananda Sen: White is the reference I did not put the white in there because white that would have made redundant, so that minus 384 and minus 299 those numbers should correspond to the same comparisons, as we did before, there is an easy way to check that keep on doing this, this.

1090
02:53:53,820 --> 02:54:05,190
Ananda Sen: is an easy way to check that so remember that minus 384 and minus 299 they go back to code and.

1091
02:54:05,190 --> 02:54:15,120
Ananda Sen: Oh, actually, I do have it here so class race model me wt race.

1092
02:54:15,120 --> 02:54:27,390
Ananda Sen: ignore that estimate big for the time being.

1093
02:54:27,390 --> 02:54:47,280
Ananda Sen: See race black race other intercept race white is now in there, but that's 0.000 so the same value exactly the same bed so either you can create those indicator variables, which is absolutely not necessary, because you have.

1094
02:54:47,280 --> 02:54:54,300
Ananda Sen: You have the class statement or you could just simply.

1095
02:54:54,300 --> 02:55:01,830
it's only showing me the last bit that's okay.

1096
02:55:01,830 --> 02:55:04,440
So.

1097
02:55:04,440 --> 02:55:09,270
Ananda Sen: All right, so it is, it is either.

1098
02:55:09,270 --> 02:55:12,810
Ananda Sen: Either putting in.

1099
02:55:12,810 --> 02:55:27,960
Ananda Sen: This the class statement or putting in there and then, if you have proper read for property, you do have to create the integrator variables, there is no other no other option.

1100
02:55:27,960 --> 02:55:31,050
Ananda Sen: Okay.

1101
02:55:31,050 --> 02:55:38,880
Ananda Sen: Is there any question on this, this is kind of like how you would do the do the.

1102
02:55:38,880 --> 02:55:48,990
Ananda Sen: thing on SAS and says on demand, but other than that everything else, we are explaining will we can explain through the.

1103
02:55:48,990 --> 02:55:54,420
Ananda Sen: Through the slides, so I will go back to the slides now, but unless there is a question.

1104
02:55:54,420 --> 02:56:11,280
Joshua Bosman: That you're saying we're having we're having some issues with unity being able to load in her library it's saying error user does not have appropriate authorization level for library, she was using amanda I don't know if that matters.

1105
02:56:11,280 --> 02:56:17,100
Ananda Sen: um.

1106
02:56:17,100 --> 02:56:23,580
Ananda Sen: yeah so you and he did you.

1107
02:56:23,580 --> 02:56:29,010
Ananda Sen: So let's go back to the previous one.

1108
02:56:29,010 --> 02:56:33,690
Joshua Bosman: I think the issue is with her unique value.

1109
02:56:33,690 --> 02:56:36,300
Ananda Sen: You mean that even the BAT.

1110
02:56:36,300 --> 02:56:40,080
Joshua Bosman: The number that comes after the you.

1111
02:56:40,080 --> 02:56:40,470
Ananda Sen: Know yeah.

1112
02:56:40,470 --> 02:56:44,100
Ananda Sen: that's that's her unique.

1113
02:56:44,100 --> 02:56:45,810
Ananda Sen: that's what you should use.

1114
02:56:45,810 --> 02:56:48,930
Ananda Sen: yeah not should not be using this.

1115
02:56:48,930 --> 02:56:52,530
Joshua Bosman: I think she was trying to use that one but we're not sure what Hers is.

1116
02:56:52,530 --> 02:57:04,620
Ananda Sen: So unique tell me what's what's going on, so so you should be used, using yours and how do you know which one is yours, if you go here.

1117
02:57:04,620 --> 02:57:20,070
Ananda Sen: Or maybe here, but when you're up try to upload, then you will come up with it, it will say upload files to whatever you number, you have there is yours.

1118
02:57:20,070 --> 02:58:05,070
Ananda Sen: Everybody has a unique one.

1119
02:58:05,070 --> 02:58:37,740
Ananda Sen: cannot hear you not sure what.

1120
02:58:37,740 --> 02:58:40,260
Joshua Bosman: she's typing in the chat I think something's off the audio.

1121
02:58:40,260 --> 02:58:52,980
Ananda Sen: yeah yeah yeah I mean she I can see she's she's muted.

1122
02:58:52,980 --> 02:59:20,640
Ananda Sen: I think you're still muted rate for some something is happening i'm not.

1123
02:59:20,640 --> 02:59:28,020
Ananda Sen: yeah for some reason it's.

1124
02:59:28,020 --> 02:59:30,300
Ananda Sen: let's see.

1125
02:59:30,300 --> 02:59:32,130
Ananda Sen: Okay.

1126
02:59:32,130 --> 02:59:47,820
Ananda Sen: yeah I don't know what's happening, but yeah up one thing I can do uni is if your audio is working, then I can stay back after the class and we can try to solve this one now okay sounds good.

1127
02:59:47,820 --> 02:59:48,480
Ananda Sen: Okay.

1128
02:59:48,480 --> 02:59:49,350
Ananda Sen: Good so.

1129
02:59:49,350 --> 02:59:54,030
Ananda Sen: um any other questions any other thing So hopefully.

1130
02:59:54,030 --> 03:00:01,320
Ananda Sen: But I mean it's it's it's other than that that little thing you have to change in the beginning, everything else is based on.

1131
03:00:01,320 --> 03:00:14,610
Ananda Sen: What you're doing and just do remember to have your both your data as well as your as the codes, as well as the codes in there, so then.

1132
03:00:14,610 --> 03:00:21,930
Ananda Sen: Okay, so this is what i'm going to do i'm going to stop sharing this one.

1133
03:00:21,930 --> 03:00:51,150
Ananda Sen: And i'm going to go back to.

1134
03:00:51,150 --> 03:00:57,630
So.

1135
03:00:57,630 --> 03:01:00,780
One second thing.

1136
03:01:00,780 --> 03:01:05,490
I was looking at one.

1137
03:01:05,490 --> 03:01:08,220
Okay.

1138
03:01:08,220 --> 03:01:11,970
Ananda Sen: So one issue, we have not.

1139
03:01:11,970 --> 03:01:16,410
Ananda Sen: talked about yet is that there is the issue of multicultural.

1140
03:01:16,410 --> 03:01:27,870
Ananda Sen: See, either at the end of the day, we are fitting a linear regression model and say we are using two variables called height and weight, which are quite closely related, let.

1141
03:01:27,870 --> 03:01:31,410
Ananda Sen: Then, if you put both of those in the same model.

1142
03:01:31,410 --> 03:01:43,980
Ananda Sen: In some cases, having some cases it could could be all right, in other cases, it might be that one is masking the effect of the other because they're they're themselves related.

1143
03:01:43,980 --> 03:01:45,990
Ananda Sen: and

1144
03:01:45,990 --> 03:01:52,650
Ananda Sen: It is it is busy it's it's it's a little challenging to sometimes.

1145
03:01:52,650 --> 03:02:07,080
Ananda Sen: know about those correlations partly because sometimes it's, not a single variable which creates a correlation it's a it's a combination of many variables, how do you know about these things.

1146
03:02:07,080 --> 03:02:21,270
Ananda Sen: How do you know about what a variable to multi cornea first of all, if the variables are multiple near what what difference does it make well, there are a few things which you have to.

1147
03:02:21,270 --> 03:02:23,520
Ananda Sen: Remember.

1148
03:02:23,520 --> 03:02:34,980
Ananda Sen: If there is severe multiple linear regression coefficients could be emphasize, to the extent it might even change signs that's very worrisome.

1149
03:02:34,980 --> 03:02:42,240
Ananda Sen: Something is actually a plus or positive Oh, by the way, that's that's Another thing I forgot to mention.

1150
03:02:42,240 --> 03:02:50,040
Ananda Sen: If it's a positive coefficient That means that association is positive it's a negative person, this is a negative one increases or decreases.

1151
03:02:50,040 --> 03:02:56,040
Ananda Sen: Now, if that chain that sign changes that means you're interested in a completely different.

1152
03:02:56,040 --> 03:02:59,370
Ananda Sen: So that could happen with Monday coordinate.

1153
03:02:59,370 --> 03:03:06,840
Ananda Sen: It is primarily a problem for linear regression, not so much for logistic regression thankfully.

1154
03:03:06,840 --> 03:03:13,680
Ananda Sen: But nonetheless you shouldn't necessarily have multiple near variables in the model.

1155
03:03:13,680 --> 03:03:36,300
Ananda Sen: significance this can be can be affected standard editors could be pretty high if there are multiple linear variables one variable could have a very high standard edit so making it insignificant in the process more variable means less significant less chance of finding it to be significant.

1156
03:03:36,300 --> 03:03:48,510
Ananda Sen: One thing month ago, and it has an effect is if you're just looking at predictions you don't care what the variables, you can throw in as many mother clean variables in the model now they'll still be the same.

1157
03:03:48,510 --> 03:03:51,960
Ananda Sen: But the other problems are there.

1158
03:03:51,960 --> 03:04:15,000
Ananda Sen: How do you diagnose master coordinator, you can look for high correlations you can look for large standard editors you can look for things like maximum variance inflation factor that's an interesting concept we hadn't talked about various inflation factor is basically a function of.

1159
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:18,750
Ananda Sen: proportion of variation explained.

1160
03:04:18,750 --> 03:04:27,900
Ananda Sen: At this point, I would just mention that we will be looking for variance inflation factor more than 10.

1161
03:04:27,900 --> 03:04:42,270
Ananda Sen: And there are other issues like smallest eigenvalue condition number, and so on and so what these are all mathematical terms but it's very easily obtainable from.

1162
03:04:42,270 --> 03:04:45,240
Ananda Sen: regression output.

1163
03:04:45,240 --> 03:04:52,800
Ananda Sen: How can you get rid of Muslim community sometimes centering continuous variables can reduce collegiality.

1164
03:04:52,800 --> 03:04:56,310
Ananda Sen: And then there is also this.

1165
03:04:56,310 --> 03:05:03,870
Ananda Sen: idea of variable selection, which also protected.

1166
03:05:03,870 --> 03:05:06,120
Ananda Sen: So.

1167
03:05:06,120 --> 03:05:10,800
Ananda Sen: Basically, you should try to avoid multicolored.

1168
03:05:10,800 --> 03:05:24,660
Ananda Sen: No matter what, because if one variable is explained well through the linear combination of other variables throwing that variable in in the model can can have problems about.

1169
03:05:24,660 --> 03:05:29,100
Ananda Sen: regression coefficient interpretation.

1170
03:05:29,100 --> 03:05:36,780
Ananda Sen: Oh, but one thing I want to point out is that if X one X two or kalia kalia.

1171
03:05:36,780 --> 03:05:53,130
Ananda Sen: That having both of them in the model will not affect X three so sex three can be measured, the way it has been measured effects one excellent not related so that's one thing to understand.

1172
03:05:53,130 --> 03:05:54,870
Ananda Sen: So.

1173
03:05:54,870 --> 03:06:03,120
Ananda Sen: Let us.

1174
03:06:03,120 --> 03:06:16,920
Ananda Sen: So that's multipolarity and and and the question is how do we get multipolarity resolved, and then there are some ways to look at that I will explain that, in the in the lab part of it.

1175
03:06:16,920 --> 03:06:20,700
Ananda Sen: A model diagnostics, is the other thing.

1176
03:06:20,700 --> 03:06:39,420
Ananda Sen: How good is the model I have just fit a model with all these variables in how good the model is well that's explained through our Square, what is our square is the proportion of variance explained by the independent variables.

1177
03:06:39,420 --> 03:06:46,290
Ananda Sen: Again I just mentioned, that R square should be a number between zero and 100%.

1178
03:06:46,290 --> 03:06:53,610
Ananda Sen: Is it is, it is hundred percent achievable not really but for.

1179
03:06:53,610 --> 03:07:00,600
Ananda Sen: And many of the engineering examples I have seen it can come as high as 70 and 80%.

1180
03:07:00,600 --> 03:07:03,120
Ananda Sen: For.

1181
03:07:03,120 --> 03:07:10,020
Ananda Sen: Clinical medical data, you are lucky if you can get up to 40% that's actually pretty here.

1182
03:07:10,020 --> 03:07:12,900
Ananda Sen: So it depends on the variability.

1183
03:07:12,900 --> 03:07:24,030
Ananda Sen: you're always there always unmeasured variability which you cannot really account for us indexes so let me explain what R squared does.

1184
03:07:24,030 --> 03:07:29,760
Ananda Sen: I have a model where y is explained through X.

1185
03:07:29,760 --> 03:07:42,810
Ananda Sen: That X could be age X could be BMI X could be multi multi multi morbidity X could be race lots of different things.

1186
03:07:42,810 --> 03:07:47,190
Ananda Sen: And the question is those access.

1187
03:07:47,190 --> 03:07:52,470
Ananda Sen: should explain the variability in the wild data.

1188
03:07:52,470 --> 03:07:55,560
Ananda Sen: How much can you do.

1189
03:07:55,560 --> 03:07:58,800
Ananda Sen: that's our Square.

1190
03:07:58,800 --> 03:08:16,950
Ananda Sen: Okay, if we can do a lot, then our score should be high, if there are a lot of variables, which are not measured our school would still be low depend, despite the fact that there could be 50 variables in the model.

1191
03:08:16,950 --> 03:08:23,190
Ananda Sen: So R squared is a measure of that so high R square better fit.

1192
03:08:23,190 --> 03:08:30,240
Ananda Sen: that's one aspect of model diagnostics model and diagnosis basically means your favorite model how good is the thing.

1193
03:08:30,240 --> 03:08:32,190
Ananda Sen: that's one.

1194
03:08:32,190 --> 03:08:37,290
Ananda Sen: second thing is, I have used some model assumption.

1195
03:08:37,290 --> 03:08:42,690
Ananda Sen: i've got a why i've got a bunch of fixes I am assuming that.

1196
03:08:42,690 --> 03:08:48,900
Ananda Sen: The it's a linear regression, which means the error variable is normal, and so on and so forth.

1197
03:08:48,900 --> 03:08:50,910
Ananda Sen: Are those.

1198
03:08:50,910 --> 03:08:55,140
Ananda Sen: Direct assumptions, how do I know that.

1199
03:08:55,140 --> 03:09:04,950
Ananda Sen: Well, to know that I have to make the judgment based on something what is that what is that basis that basis is I fit the model.

1200
03:09:04,950 --> 03:09:08,760
Ananda Sen: Using using the variables.

1201
03:09:08,760 --> 03:09:12,360
Ananda Sen: And then I see what is left over.

1202
03:09:12,360 --> 03:09:15,570
Ananda Sen: What is left over.

1203
03:09:15,570 --> 03:09:23,190
Ananda Sen: I have a y value that Why could be.

1204
03:09:23,190 --> 03:09:26,910
Ananda Sen: An observed.

1205
03:09:26,910 --> 03:09:30,300
Ananda Sen: blood pressure.

1206
03:09:30,300 --> 03:09:32,280
Okay.

1207
03:09:32,280 --> 03:09:43,080
Ananda Sen: Based on the model, there is a predicted but blood pressure, so now I have got this pair of pants my own blood pressure, observed attrition and the predicted.

1208
03:09:43,080 --> 03:09:47,970
Ananda Sen: When do you think the model is good, when the predicted is close to the.

1209
03:09:47,970 --> 03:09:55,380
Ananda Sen: If not zero If not, if not exactly equal but close to the observed blood pressure right.

1210
03:09:55,380 --> 03:09:57,060
Ananda Sen: So.

1211
03:09:57,060 --> 03:10:07,050
Ananda Sen: One way to measure how good the fit is is to take the difference between the pair's observed minus predicted.

1212
03:10:07,050 --> 03:10:19,080
Ananda Sen: Those have names, those are called residuals the name suggests, what they mean they mean leftovers after you fit the model what is left over.

1213
03:10:19,080 --> 03:10:42,390
Ananda Sen: So residuals should show the what what you want to see in the model residuals should behave like a normal distribution residuals against predicted plot should show no pattern like a like a blog like a round shaped pattern less.

1214
03:10:42,390 --> 03:10:45,750
Ananda Sen: pattern this pattern.

1215
03:10:45,750 --> 03:11:02,760
Ananda Sen: You can also plot the residuals against the covariance to justify the linear structure so if there is a linear structure, you should see some kind of a linear going up or going down if you don't see that then it's good.

1216
03:11:02,760 --> 03:11:06,840
Ananda Sen: So can we see.

1217
03:11:06,840 --> 03:11:10,920
Ananda Sen: All of these things.

1218
03:11:10,920 --> 03:11:17,310
Ananda Sen: So let me.

1219
03:11:17,310 --> 03:11:30,180
Ananda Sen: Welcome to variable selection next, but at least let me do these two.

1220
03:11:30,180 --> 03:11:40,830
Sorry.

1221
03:11:40,830 --> 03:11:49,200
Ananda Sen: So model diagnostics, based on residuals so residuals must look like well actually why don't.

1222
03:11:49,200 --> 03:11:51,780
Ananda Sen: Why don't I do this.

1223
03:11:51,780 --> 03:11:54,870
I wouldn't be doing this under.

1224
03:11:54,870 --> 03:12:20,730
Ananda Sen: SAS on demand.

1225
03:12:20,730 --> 03:12:29,280
Ananda Sen: Okay.

1226
03:12:29,280 --> 03:12:51,030
Ananda Sen: So I think this was already set up that way.

1227
03:12:51,030 --> 03:12:56,070
Ananda Sen: So firstly let's do this.

1228
03:12:56,070 --> 03:13:00,330
Ananda Sen: Call linearity diagnostics so.

1229
03:13:00,330 --> 03:13:08,610
Ananda Sen: Say Colin at if you can see the middle of my codes it comes sorry.

1230
03:13:08,610 --> 03:13:15,270
Ananda Sen: It comes with pro rig Brock regress or proper progression.

1231
03:13:15,270 --> 03:13:25,800
Ananda Sen: You will notice, something I have used Okay, so there is something I should not be using.

1232
03:13:25,800 --> 03:13:29,490
Ananda Sen: i've used race as a class variable.

1233
03:13:29,490 --> 03:13:39,870
Ananda Sen: As a continuous variable I should not be using that so perhaps I will make this change.

1234
03:13:39,870 --> 03:13:42,150
Ananda Sen: data be.

1235
03:13:42,150 --> 03:13:45,330
Ananda Sen: Instead of race, they will use.

1236
03:13:45,330 --> 03:13:49,200
Ananda Sen: Black either.

1237
03:13:49,200 --> 03:13:53,310
Ananda Sen: So birth weight as a function of age.

1238
03:13:53,310 --> 03:14:00,480
Ananda Sen: hd smoke black other lwt MTV.

1239
03:14:00,480 --> 03:14:12,510
Ananda Sen: notice, something I did not worry about making the other variables class variable which are only two categories to get a good is variable you don't have to call it class.

1240
03:14:12,510 --> 03:14:23,760
Ananda Sen: they're automatically categorical I mean one zero vs one zero variable whether you use it as a continuous variable or you use it as a as a categorical variable is the same thing.

1241
03:14:23,760 --> 03:14:33,600
Ananda Sen: Because it's always measuring the difference of in the coefficient measures, the difference from going from going from zero to one either way.

1242
03:14:33,600 --> 03:14:46,920
Ananda Sen: When you have more than two categories that's when you need to worry about those things I change it to directly to be because they equal to be the one which contained.

1243
03:14:46,920 --> 03:14:50,100
Ananda Sen: The two indicator variables.

1244
03:14:50,100 --> 03:15:01,980
Ananda Sen: So let's run this first.

1245
03:15:01,980 --> 03:15:04,200
Okay.

1246
03:15:04,200 --> 03:15:14,970
Ananda Sen: So go they've got a bunch of stuff, then I have the parameter estimates and notice there is something called oh.

1247
03:15:14,970 --> 03:15:33,570
Ananda Sen: The corner has two things, this is a, this is an option called linear co co ll and then VI VI of the variance inflation factor.

1248
03:15:33,570 --> 03:15:43,050
Ananda Sen: And then.

1249
03:15:43,050 --> 03:15:47,220
Ananda Sen: Oh sorry nevermind.

1250
03:15:47,220 --> 03:15:52,950
I think it's running the whole thing.

1251
03:15:52,950 --> 03:15:58,950
No, I don't want that let's try this one more thing.

1252
03:15:58,950 --> 03:16:03,900
sorry about that.

1253
03:16:03,900 --> 03:16:10,440
yeah okay.

1254
03:16:10,440 --> 03:16:13,500
Ananda Sen: So.

1255
03:16:13,500 --> 03:16:22,560
Ananda Sen: What about the variance inflation what what it, what is it, which will be a flag, when will, I know there is a flag.

1256
03:16:22,560 --> 03:16:27,870
Ananda Sen: So here is here is the.

1257
03:16:27,870 --> 03:16:36,720
Ananda Sen: Here is a strategy on this remember any of these things, these are all ad hoc it's a practice it's a general practice.

1258
03:16:36,720 --> 03:16:43,800
Ananda Sen: So if the variance inflation is bigger than 10.

1259
03:16:43,800 --> 03:16:57,060
Ananda Sen: Then, as I mentioned before, that is the one when you have some kind of flag, so I think I think we did that we saw that example are.

1260
03:16:57,060 --> 03:17:11,010
Ananda Sen: We have the slide there, it says that maximum VI E, F is bigger than 10 is there any here, bigger than 10 no good under worry about it, what about the condition index the condition index should be.

1261
03:17:11,010 --> 03:17:36,390
Ananda Sen: bigger than 30 to actually create an a problem, but if it is between 15 and 30 sometimes people say, well, maybe there is something going on, so here, I have a I have something between 15 and 30 but then I go through the proportion of variation that call energy diagnostics and.

1262
03:17:36,390 --> 03:17:50,010
Ananda Sen: I don't find things which are that large, we should be anything for anything in the condition that in index if it is bigger than 15 we should be looking for.

1263
03:17:50,010 --> 03:18:05,370
Ananda Sen: The corresponding columns for the variables and try to find something which is bigger than 50% or point five, and I didn't find anything so so so my.

1264
03:18:05,370 --> 03:18:16,710
Ananda Sen: My take on this is that the night of the condition index, not the va would warrant any caution about multi multi coordinated.

1265
03:18:16,710 --> 03:18:20,610
Ananda Sen: But really my my main.

1266
03:18:20,610 --> 03:18:36,720
Ananda Sen: Hope was to show you one example where you could see how to use this this cannot be used in glm Prague glm if you have to use the Multi community, you have to do it in a slightly different now.

1267
03:18:36,720 --> 03:18:43,800
Ananda Sen: it's more complicated, but here in procreate you get this So what are the bottom lines pro correct.

1268
03:18:43,800 --> 03:19:05,250
Ananda Sen: No class variable so you have to be careful about more than two categories, but you get all these multi cornea diagnostics and model diagnostics as a byproduct of it prog glm categorical variable representing is very easy, but there are other other issues you have to be careful with.

1269
03:19:05,250 --> 03:19:10,110
Ananda Sen: Modern diagnostics.

1270
03:19:10,110 --> 03:19:21,870
Ananda Sen: This is something which.

1271
03:19:21,870 --> 03:19:28,320
Ananda Sen: Which is mentioned on this on this blog now it's something I want to point out here.

1272
03:19:28,320 --> 03:19:50,010
Ananda Sen: Is Brock glm so class race is used, I generally like proxy and drop the elements is a much, much more flexible way of doing things progress does things a little bit better with some of the basic regression stuff but it's still probably glm does a better job overall and it's more general.

1273
03:19:50,010 --> 03:19:55,980
Ananda Sen: um so let's look at a few things.

1274
03:19:55,980 --> 03:20:00,240
Ananda Sen: I am encapsulating this whole thing.

1275
03:20:00,240 --> 03:20:12,840
Ananda Sen: With an audience statement what is an audience statement audio statement does a lot more than the usual thing audience graphics actually allows you to.

1276
03:20:12,840 --> 03:20:21,750
Ananda Sen: Look at multiple things at once this is one thing which I will say that you know if you're if you're.

1277
03:20:21,750 --> 03:20:27,000
Ananda Sen: doing something you want to you have.

1278
03:20:27,000 --> 03:20:30,330
Ananda Sen: You want to follow for your.

1279
03:20:30,330 --> 03:20:39,690
Ananda Sen: For your projects, this is one thing you would want to follow because audience graphics allows you to do things.

1280
03:20:39,690 --> 03:20:44,910
Ananda Sen: Which is lot more than the usual usual graphics clock so.

1281
03:20:44,910 --> 03:20:55,860
Ananda Sen: Here is a model and here is the output, so in the model there's a model statement like before solution basically gives you the.

1282
03:20:55,860 --> 03:21:02,310
Ananda Sen: coefficients, then you do have this output statement.

1283
03:21:02,310 --> 03:21:09,630
Ananda Sen: out equal to with resize residuals equal to resides those are created.

1284
03:21:09,630 --> 03:21:26,910
Ananda Sen: In when the moment you start running ODS it is created with this plot sequel a diagnostic residuals command so let's see what this does.

1285
03:21:26,910 --> 03:21:29,730
Ananda Sen: Okay, so grand the model.

1286
03:21:29,730 --> 03:21:38,490
Ananda Sen: And at the end, it gave me all these blocks, which is very, very nice So what are these blocks.

1287
03:21:38,490 --> 03:21:41,310
Ananda Sen: So.

1288
03:21:41,310 --> 03:21:51,330
Ananda Sen: bw team birthweight is is the outcome that's a continuous variable residual versus predicted that's the left hand.

1289
03:21:51,330 --> 03:21:52,950
Ananda Sen: panel.

1290
03:21:52,950 --> 03:21:56,190
Ananda Sen: not seeing anything there.

1291
03:21:56,190 --> 03:22:02,310
Ananda Sen: let's it's a very, very round shape no pattern plot.

1292
03:22:02,310 --> 03:22:05,010
Ananda Sen: Then.

1293
03:22:05,010 --> 03:22:13,380
Ananda Sen: I also look at this quantel this this qq plot for the residuals this is for a normal distribution.

1294
03:22:13,380 --> 03:22:26,700
Ananda Sen: If they were normal, then they would be tightly hugging this this 45 degrees line or the straight line not nearly 45 degrees, the straight line, and it does.

1295
03:22:26,700 --> 03:22:32,760
Ananda Sen: And that's farther confirmed by.

1296
03:22:32,760 --> 03:22:42,930
Ananda Sen: This histogram with a normal distribution late over it it's it's it's pretty close and for.

1297
03:22:42,930 --> 03:22:52,560
Ananda Sen: Most medical examples, if it comes this close then i'm i'm pretty happy So these are the three things you should be looking at.

1298
03:22:52,560 --> 03:23:13,560
Ananda Sen: The personal character versus your value qq plot of residuals and this and then you can also look at things like you know let's look at residual plots residuals versus the X variables specific X variables each and every X variable to see if something is leftover.

1299
03:23:13,560 --> 03:23:26,370
Ananda Sen: I don't see anything leftover residual versus MTV residual versus age residual versus hd is versus lwt they're all pretty much.

1300
03:23:26,370 --> 03:23:38,070
Ananda Sen: Around shaped no pattern scenario and that's that's that's expected and that's anticipating that's good that's desirable.

1301
03:23:38,070 --> 03:23:46,350
Ananda Sen: If you start seeing linear plots if you start seeing things which had funnel shaped if you start seeing.

1302
03:23:46,350 --> 03:23:55,650
Ananda Sen: things which are nonlinear like carbs, then you start getting worried that that is something which is missing.

1303
03:23:55,650 --> 03:24:01,830
Ananda Sen: residual is left over in the leftover should not have anything left in it.

1304
03:24:01,830 --> 03:24:06,450
Ananda Sen: that's it.

1305
03:24:06,450 --> 03:24:20,910
Ananda Sen: Okay.

1306
03:24:20,910 --> 03:24:26,250
Ananda Sen: You could also do a jeep block this with three sides data.

1307
03:24:26,250 --> 03:24:40,350
Ananda Sen: The prodigy plot This is specifically residuals with Adrian residuals with race, a little better clock better looking plot just getting a little more fancy but.

1308
03:24:40,350 --> 03:24:45,390
Ananda Sen: Not quite.

1309
03:24:45,390 --> 03:24:48,540
Ananda Sen: not really adding much just.

1310
03:24:48,540 --> 03:24:51,930
worry about that much.

1311
03:24:51,930 --> 03:24:52,560
Joshua Bosman: Is.

1312
03:24:52,560 --> 03:24:54,420
Ananda Sen: sorry to interrupt but yeah.

1313
03:24:54,420 --> 03:25:02,340
Joshua Bosman: I think a little over half the classes left at this point, I guess, there was some confusion about whether the class was going to end at five or 530.

1314
03:25:02,340 --> 03:25:04,650
Ananda Sen: It is 530.

1315
03:25:04,650 --> 03:25:09,390
Joshua Bosman: I guess i'm a syllabus that said five, so I had a number of people asking me.

1316
03:25:09,390 --> 03:25:11,250
Ananda Sen: He said right.

1317
03:25:11,250 --> 03:25:24,690
Geehan: He did not 535 the schedule says 530 when I go on canvas I also thought it was at under five.

1318
03:25:24,690 --> 03:25:27,120
Ananda Sen: Oh.

1319
03:25:27,120 --> 03:25:41,340
Ananda Sen: Wait a minute I that I must have misunderstood the time I thought it was 530 I will, I am sorry about that I just hang on one, second, let me just stop sharing.

1320
03:25:41,340 --> 03:25:53,220
Ananda Sen: I didn't I didn't I didn't recognize that it's if it's five maybe it is five, I will make sure I was under the impression that it's four hours each each of the five days.

1321
03:25:53,220 --> 03:26:06,060
Ananda Sen: What it is it's possible that i'm have misunderstood that well that's that's fine, we can restart from here unique did you manage to.

1322
03:26:06,060 --> 03:26:08,700
Ananda Sen: me now I can hear you.

1323
03:26:08,700 --> 03:26:11,250
Yoonhee Ryder: Perfect can I share my screen.

1324
03:26:11,250 --> 03:26:16,770
Ananda Sen: Yes, yes, hang on one, second, let me just give you permission to do that.

1325
03:26:16,770 --> 03:26:27,060
Ananda Sen: Yes, go ahead.

1326
03:26:27,060 --> 03:26:27,900
Yoonhee Ryder: Maybe.

1327
03:26:27,900 --> 03:26:28,680
Ananda Sen: Yes, I did.

1328
03:26:28,680 --> 03:26:41,790
Yoonhee Ryder: Okay, so I put in this here, and this is a you here that corresponds with like, if I click here it's the same 58990100.

1329
03:26:41,790 --> 03:26:47,940
Yoonhee Ryder: yeah um But then when I run it let's see.

1330
03:26:47,940 --> 03:26:50,940
Yoonhee Ryder: Okay, it gives me this.

1331
03:26:50,940 --> 03:26:54,510
Yoonhee Ryder: I don't see like where I see everything if that makes sense.

1332
03:26:54,510 --> 03:27:01,110
Ananda Sen: But do you have not done anything else nope so So what is the other part of the of the code.

1333
03:27:01,110 --> 03:27:03,120
Yoonhee Ryder: Right that's what i'm looking for.

1334
03:27:03,120 --> 03:27:16,530
Ananda Sen: Oh okay so so day one lab codes oh you, you know what I think you actually did.

1335
03:27:16,530 --> 03:27:22,350
Ananda Sen: Did copy the do file that's a status code.

1336
03:27:22,350 --> 03:27:24,810
Yoonhee Ryder: This one here.

1337
03:27:24,810 --> 03:27:26,640
Ananda Sen: beta code so.

1338
03:27:26,640 --> 03:27:32,280
Ananda Sen: If you go back to the yeah that's the reason.

1339
03:27:32,280 --> 03:27:44,880
Ananda Sen: You go back to canvas.

1340
03:27:44,880 --> 03:27:46,680
Yoonhee Ryder: So Oh, this one.

1341
03:27:46,680 --> 03:27:51,150
Yoonhee Ryder: Yes, oh OK OK, thank you.

1342
03:27:51,150 --> 03:27:56,640
Yoonhee Ryder: i'll download that one yeah okay perfect Thank you i'm sure that will work.

1343
03:27:56,640 --> 03:28:02,580
Ananda Sen: yeah so once you have that and then change that to the way you did that, which is correct.

1344
03:28:02,580 --> 03:28:03,960
Yoonhee Ryder: Okay, thank you.

1345
03:28:03,960 --> 03:28:06,390
Yoonhee Ryder: Okay, stop sharing it.

1346
03:28:06,390 --> 03:28:15,000
Ananda Sen: Okay sorry about that I didn't realize that we're we're supposed to end at five, and then we can we can start from here next time.

1347
03:28:15,000 --> 03:28:15,990
Geehan: Thank you.

1348
03:28:15,990 --> 03:28:21,270
Ananda Sen: A lot of lot of things to absorb so we'll come back tomorrow and.

1349
03:28:21,270 --> 03:28:23,100
Ananda Sen: we'll start getting.

1350
03:28:23,100 --> 03:28:24,600
Geehan: Okay, thank you.

1351
03:28:24,600 --> 03:28:27,150
Ananda Sen: Thank you very much yeah.

1352
03:28:27,150 --> 03:28:32,610
Ananda Sen: anybody has any question, you can or.

1353
03:28:32,610 --> 03:28:36,120
Ananda Sen: Oh, how did I make that mistake I.

1354
03:28:36,120 --> 03:28:44,850
Ananda Sen: Always I thought it was four hours, maybe, maybe last year it was four hours, and this year, they have changed it to one three to five maybe that's the reason.

1355
03:28:44,850 --> 03:28:50,430
Joshua Bosman: I know yeah when I applied to the job they said it would it would take about 20 hours for five classes so.

1356
03:28:50,430 --> 03:29:00,210
Ananda Sen: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah it was it was my mistake so tomorrow actually what i'm going to do is.

1357
03:29:00,210 --> 03:29:05,430
Ananda Sen: not spend a whole lot of time on the.

1358
03:29:05,430 --> 03:29:13,950
Ananda Sen: On the audio the the on demand, because it sounds like it on demand is working for them that's what I wanted to make sure that it's working for them.

1359
03:29:13,950 --> 03:29:18,210
Joshua Bosman: Okay, great yeah we had a few issues, but I think it was mostly with.

1360
03:29:18,210 --> 03:29:22,350
Joshua Bosman: With people not realizing the unique values were like unique to them.

1361
03:29:22,350 --> 03:29:30,300
Ananda Sen: And I know that that that that is typically the most common stumping point and and so yeah.

1362
03:29:30,300 --> 03:29:42,030
Ananda Sen: So yeah so that that should be fine, I think the first day is always a little bit of this and that, and you know you'll know what what is working, what is not working, and then.

1363
03:29:42,030 --> 03:29:44,790
Ananda Sen: right next to you on what it should be smoother.

1364
03:29:44,790 --> 03:29:52,110
Joshua Bosman: sounds good so uh I recorded I hit record to the cloud so now i'm assuming I just hit stop recording and that will.

1365
03:29:52,110 --> 03:29:53,100
Joshua Bosman: Yes, spend it on.

1366
03:29:53,100 --> 03:29:57,440
Ananda Sen: Yes, yes, and I believe I can.
