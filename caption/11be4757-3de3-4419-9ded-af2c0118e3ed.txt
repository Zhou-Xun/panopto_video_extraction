1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,670
When I do that is question. Okay. So I have started here.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,550
So remember, this is the last carbohydrate lecture we saw two weeks and fold up until the midterm.

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:21,600
So still plenty of time to talk here. I mean, like you said, this now gives you, I think, a little over ten days to review and consolidate material.

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,360
So as a reminder, the class Monday on Wednesday will be a review session.

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,899
There are topics that you're confused about that you want to make sure we cover before we talk about that.

6
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:43,950
So on Wednesday, we'll we will you kind of go over the breakdown of how exams would be organized or should be simplified than I can tell you now.

7
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,700
So it'll be your overnight.

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:01:00,030
So we might get numbers and everything. So the it's about this right now it's about 65%, multiple points, 35% long in terms of first.

9
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,200
So I respect, you know, I've spent about two thirds of the time on the part of the points on that.

10
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,630
Each multiple, I think there's 30 something multiple choice questions. Each question is worth two points.

11
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,820
The long answers, not like that.

12
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:19,620
More than so, they're like, is this much space for each question moving three or four of those, it'll say how many points each one of those is worth.

13
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,299
I think a short answer.

14
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:28,710
So that'll be like I was like, actually, questioners would like me like blah, blah, blah, blah, we're three points, blah blah blah blah.

15
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,350
We're four points and pool for this question. We're 23 points.

16
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,020
I know you already said going over the learning curve. That's what's like another good way to study for your exam.

17
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,260
So I think probably that is probably good too, because it's a quick way to kind of go through and just identify gaps.

18
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,810
So probably that has, like I said, almost every multiple choice question I've ever written for this class.

19
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,270
So there's several thousand inquiries and why bother?

20
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,850
You can also set up a time where you can do probably with a group where you all get the same questions at the same time.

21
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,970
So if you find that it's more effective for you, you can set it up and then, you know, sign up for like, okay, the four of us are doing it together.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,400
You all get the same question, then you can discuss it at some point.

23
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:12,300
But definitely going specifically for probably like there are different sections.

24
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:19,120
So do you view it? Should we expect to get questions from like the background stuff or.

25
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:25,380
Yeah. So we just laid out improbabilities like hope, background, energy, balance, appetite and introduction to digestion.

26
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,010
And then everything else is carbohydrate. So definitely that stuff because after three lectures, that's what I consider background.

27
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,999
So like some of the background there might be like background biochemistry stuff that I don't

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,330
know if there's a subsection for that because I'm not going to ask general background frequency.

29
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:45,060
Those are they're more for you know, if I keep saying allosteric, I'm not sure what I mean, stuff like that.

30
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,100
So maybe. Well, no, but I mean, I would never say like what?

31
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,610
Define Alistair or define prosthetic or that would be like apart from if you're close.

32
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,650
But I would impute that if I said something about Alistair regulations, you know what that means.

33
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,180
But I'm pragmatic in the context of regulation of something. Oh yes.

34
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,840
You also get ten points for doing from ten great performances.

35
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:17,430
So if you do something and that's self submitted, so before the exam, if you've done I believe it's 100 questions, you don't get 100, right?

36
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,900
You start to try 100. I hope it's not that you get a hundred, but then you submit 90 at ten.

37
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:32,320
So for me, it's one more question about I have covered a lot of pretty intense diagrams from

38
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:39,650
the carbohydrate you that when we're looking at kind of prioritizing what you know,

39
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,190
you just say kind of like the key regulators. Yeah you'll see it when I call up today,

40
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,890
like intermittently I'll have a slide that's like here's a summary of all the regulators and all this, like not finish.

41
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,040
That's why those lines is a review of.

42
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,960
Yeah, it's just so that if you need a quick resource and remember you can bring a double sided three by five index card.

43
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:05,140
So if you have a hard time in writing that stuff, you can get that. Well, to my mind, those no questions on food of the day.

44
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:17,140
So if you don't study the food today, are you sure you're sure you might be asking where like rice started from or something, you know.

45
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,160
Okay, any other exam related questions? And you know, like I said, to move, I had sort of planned that.

46
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,030
We expect there'll be lots of questions the next week and a half, so we should have plenty of time.

47
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:35,139
So just if you need time to be with us, just email us until you get partial credit and we'll respond to the free response questions.

48
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,800
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. No, I'm like a lot of you're right.

49
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,170
And I can write the question so that like let's say you get something like catastrophically wrong at the beginning,

50
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,489
then you get everything else right. You'll probably still get the points for getting the rest of it right and certainly heart rate.

51
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,750
But so like for example, if you forget the direction by which insulin regulates gluconeogenesis,

52
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,320
you're probably wrong for the whole question, but I only market wrong for the one part.

53
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,750
And then as long as everything else is more, it's clear then yeah.

54
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:13,570
Yeah. Let me scantron spring a pencil on good reason to being any other example seems to be all right.

55
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:24,520
So onto which gluconeogenesis very very okay so first thing glucose is kind of an interesting nutrient in terms of it is not essential,

56
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,540
it is not an essential nutrient.

57
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:32,949
And by that I mean biochemically not essential because our bodies can make sufficient amounts for us even if we don't ingest any.

58
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,599
Right. So that makes it different from, say, environment or mineral or even you mean what's if you proteins are going to talk

59
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,270
to the press is one of the very few nutrients we talk about that is essential.

60
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:46,120
You know, probably, I think an interesting hypothetical debate about whether fiber is essential or not, I would argue probably not.

61
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,649
Other people would argue probably a river essential isn't necessarily for health is sexuality,

62
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,680
is can our bodies produce the thing ourselves so we can produce glucose?

63
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,180
That's kind of what the point of this lecture is,

64
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:01,840
is that you can produce glucose even if you consume the thing that comes from the conversion of primarily three substrates lactate,

65
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,890
glycerol and alanine. And I'm just generalizing it to amino acids.

66
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:10,989
So just an example of sort of how functional this is. This is a paper from a while ago, 1992,

67
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:18,360
and they looked at the relative rates of language analysis and gluconeogenesis in controls in diabetic individuals.

68
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,439
And so if you look here, you can see that linkage analysis at this point is that for 23 hours fasting.

69
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,709
So for almost a full day, you can see at that point there is still a little bit of a contribution from from glycogen, but it's much, much lower.

70
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:34,690
And at this point, at least three times more of the glucose is coming from gluconeogenesis.

71
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,540
And that's likely because after 23 hours of fasting, probably the collections quarters are are mostly depleted.

72
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,840
You can also see here total glucose production.

73
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:51,670
The total glucose production is the sum of like age analysis and gluconeogenesis is is much higher in patients with type two diabetes.

74
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:57,630
And that's almost exclusively driven or is more than exclusively driven by increases in gluconeogenesis.

75
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,950
Right. So as we'll talk about if somebody has impairment in Genesis, especially insulin resistance,

76
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,209
that's probably one of the main reasons why people may have diabetes, right?

77
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,230
Because you're making glucose in by your body doesn't necessarily.

78
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,290
So glucose is important for many things as we talked about a lot.

79
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,609
But it's especially critical for both red blood cell and brain function of red blood cells because they don't have mitochondria.

80
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,139
They're obviously input users. They can break down anything else other than glucose and for brain function,

81
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,930
because our brain relies pretty heavily on glucose because amino acids and

82
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,740
fatty acids generally can't cross the blood brain barrier in such quantities,

83
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,469
a lot of brain function if we are reduced.

84
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:38,080
So if you go if you look at somebody here after 24 hours passing, their blood glucose will drop a little bit, but not as much as you might think.

85
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,170
Right. So even somebody who's been fasting for 48 hours or something,

86
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,799
their blood glucose will still generally be in what we would consider a normal glycemic range.

87
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,330
So a healthy person their blood glucose we. Drop down to like 80 or something.

88
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:56,130
So it's not like it drops down to zero. Most people can maintain blood glucose levels in that sort of normal range if they're healthy,

89
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,800
more or less indefinitely, as long as they have these before the events.

90
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,770
So you can think of this as an hour, you know, unless you're on a ketogenic diet or you have diabetic ketoacidosis,

91
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,390
gluconeogenesis is happening, but it's not critical.

92
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:13,080
But in our history, in our evolutionary history, we had long periods of time where we just wouldn't have food is extremely important.

93
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,210
Okay. So the pathway here is very, very similar to my courses.

94
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:27,030
So all over the world I heard your saying they just kind of do it backwards and just stay there.

95
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,990
And again, it's going to start with different substrates like that.

96
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,990
Mr. Like there's really three big differences between glycolysis and the gluconeogenesis.

97
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,520
So you'll notice there's a lot of enzymatic stuff in here that I you've probably never heard me mentioned,

98
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:45,299
but they're not even on this list, just bunch of satellites. All of those steps are interchangeable.

99
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,670
They're equilibrium reactions, which means these reactions kind of people shoot back and forth between all these steps,

100
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,120
depending on which there is more. So there's more of two possibilities, right?

101
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,400
It'll just naturally go up to Mr. Aldehyde three phosphate and vice versa.

102
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,980
Right. So those are equilibrium reactions.

103
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,899
They matter in that if you don't have the enzymes the problem, but they don't matter in that they are not points of regulation.

104
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,760
So I sort of analogize this to you driving down a street, this is just a side street you're passing right there.

105
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,720
Kind of important that they're there. Otherwise you're going down that way. They don't really affect what you're doing.

106
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:20,250
The three big differences here. The first difference is instead of just having a reverse from pyruvate to fastball to no pyruvate,

107
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,850
that you actually have to go through this two step reaction where pyruvate becomes like

108
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,200
solid lots of it and then oxalic acetate gets converted to possibly a part of it.

109
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,429
So that pyruvate kinase steps, let's step here one from here to here.

110
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:38,909
And because this is not reversible. So it was sort of two enzymes, part maker moxley's and Pepsi.

111
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:44,850
Okay. And you'll be probably not surprised at this point to learn those two are extremely important regulatory steps.

112
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,280
So that's one big difference. The other big difference is here in that one regulatory step.

113
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:57,540
So instead of using one or reversible version of one, there is an enzyme called fructose one six phosphatase,

114
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,640
which occurs right here at the number three step here.

115
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:07,409
And then the last step there are Google kinase or hexo. Kind of a step is not reversible in muscle.

116
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:14,100
The next step is never reverse. Remember in muscle, once glucose gets phosphorylated, it stays there forever.

117
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:21,930
Whereas in liver this step here working for six months they can be phosphorylated into glucose is regulated by glucose six phosphatase

118
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:31,080
and that is biochemically why the liver can release glucose and muscle and that's why the liver control and muscle doesn't.

119
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,139
So the main substrates that feed into this, like I said,

120
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,860
there's three really important ones that are summarized here and I've got a bunch of different things.

121
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,359
So the first one is lactate. So lactate from the black holes.

122
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:50,400
This lecture is generated by animals. So if you are depleted oxygen or you're you manage to hide your skin.

123
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:55,319
But you have a lot of lactate culture that lactate can go in the first week.

124
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,470
You like to hear tragedies before pyruvate and that interval.

125
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:04,080
So that's the substrate if you are undergoing anaerobic recall. So if you imagine in the scenario where you were exercising,

126
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:13,900
maybe that's the primary glucose because the lactate is getting converted into inquiry and then that goes through like a Harvard application.

127
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,020
Alanine, on the other hand, is coming from protein catabolism.

128
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,930
So this would be now your muscles breaking down and releasing alanine.

129
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:28,800
We'll talk a lot more about Alli and why only alanine but the other 19 amino acids that is most important here we get to the amino acid

130
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:36,440
oxidation but alanine gets broken down from from proteins again that can feed into pyruvate go through the same the same sort of other.

131
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:46,650
So that is generally can be associated with like muscle, muscle breakdown of chronic lack of activity for these release alanine.

132
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,430
And then that obviously comes at a cost of protein function.

133
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,450
And then the third substrate is glycerol. So glycerol is coming from triglycerides.

134
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,380
So triglyceride is three fatty acids attached to a glycerol molecule.

135
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,960
So whenever you break down a fat triglyceride,

136
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,910
primarily in this case in your adipose tissue and you're going to release cholesterol along with the fatty acids,

137
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:11,100
and so that glycerol can become glucose through gluconeogenesis.

138
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:18,390
So maybe somebody who's on a ketogenic diet that's eating very high fat diet, maybe their primary source of genetic substrates might be glycerol.

139
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,260
Right. Because they're using glycerol. Kind of an important point here.

140
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:32,730
Fatty acids, which are obviously also released from during the policies or if you're eating a high fat diet, they feed into a kind of subtle way.

141
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,270
But a subtle way is actually never gluconeogenesis.

142
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,940
You cannot create glucose from a fatty acid.

143
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:46,370
And the reason for that is, if you remember from the cycle part, the subtle way feeds into the TCA cycle, but it is not analog.

144
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,499
It doesn't actually increase the number of things in the cycle because that two

145
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,800
carbons of the instead of where both eventually get released as carbon dioxide.

146
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:59,560
Right. So I said, okay, away can or fatty acids can never become glucose right now.

147
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,180
They can fuel this process by actually to partake of oxidase, which we'll talk about a minute.

148
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,320
But then since they're not and a platonic fatty acids can't actually support glucose production.

149
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:14,560
So when people say that they're getting glucose from their fat, they really mean they're getting it from their cholesterol, not from their finances.

150
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:19,480
And the fact that fatty acids are here is going to be important for another reason.

151
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:28,420
I'll come to come to it. So the key thing here is you lose all of these nutrients and most of these cases are actually not coming from the liver.

152
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,330
Right. So this involves coordination of multiple tissues, right?

153
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:38,530
Because to have your joints, what's happened in the liver or in the kidneys, you need to have an adequate supply of all of these things.

154
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:45,040
And depending on nutritional or physiological conditions, the relative levels of that might vary somewhat.

155
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:51,579
And so your regulation at the level of the liver, which is going to control sort of how efficiently these things get converted to glucose,

156
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:59,700
but then you also have a substrate supply regulation, right? So you need to have enough ounces available for that pathway to have.

157
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,690
Okay. So that's sort of my intro to Gluconeogenesis.

158
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:09,830
So what I want you guys to do here is another sort of long list of terms for concept.

159
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,879
And so we'll spend about 15 minutes or so in kind of going through this. Again,

160
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,590
the goal here is for you to try to connect as many of these things as you can and

161
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,889
then hopefully identify things that you're like not 100% sure how they relate.

162
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:33,910
And we try to go, I think you'll submit this individually before the people you work with, people around us to try and get, you know, circle around.

163
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,220
And happy don't have to you.

164
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:55,050
I know. Yes. I mean creative as well.

165
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:09,470
So, I mean, I don't think that I mean, I feel like that's a group of people.

166
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:24,070
But, you know, some people will continue to be.

167
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:40,370
This is one reason that I was admired.

168
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:53,830
Well, you know, cause it was the same.

169
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:08,930
You know, there's always something that we should go to make a connection.

170
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:37,260
And I think as a business has become such as Muslims are, you know, it's okay, you know, because.

171
00:16:49,350 --> 00:17:14,080
She? They don't anything like this.

172
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:20,540
Think you can use some of these things sometimes?

173
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:28,310
I don't know. I'm sorry I didn't wear my shirt.

174
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,490
I feel that that's what caused the strike.

175
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,570
I know we can probably meet with him.

176
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,860
I he industries here.

177
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,210
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's really just all right now.

178
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:52,220
Oh, it's going through. It's not out there. But it would be New Jersey.

179
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:04,520
Yeah. The video he claimed he was, like, with a few tears, and I was like, Oh, this is the thing I'm going to be offered.

180
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,530
I really didn't want to do it.

181
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:27,390
Yeah. So, like, we'd have to have something. Yeah. Cause I think that's what happens when you take, like, could you when I saw that, you know,

182
00:18:28,770 --> 00:19:03,229
that's like I'm sure it increases your all you need to watch construction work so I want you to confirm that I can have tickets to anything like that.

183
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:13,590
Doesn't make sense. Oh, yeah. If you want me to do things like do it.

184
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,380
Yeah, I'm just saying something to. Maybe we should just connect.

185
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:29,580
Yeah. Yeah. You know what it is?

186
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:40,690
Yeah. I don't think he's going to put in any more.

187
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:53,390
Yeah. So. So because of your psychology approach, you get to make what's actually reaction something because these people are helping you.

188
00:19:54,180 --> 00:20:11,890
So it's so it is gluconeogenesis. Yes, it isn't gluconeogenesis, but it's not it's a lot of it actually gets you does not take us to the races.

189
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:19,280
Yeah. So I think it's a smarty that says Greece for instance.

190
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:28,600
Oh yeah. I come across. It was only two things.

191
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:47,190
It wasn't that I did the types of things in the last few seconds.

192
00:20:50,310 --> 00:21:00,810
I mean, it's definitely something to see that was really pushing the regulations, which I just wouldn't be here at the moment.

193
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,120
And what does that mean?

194
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,870
Yes. Yes. Oh, that sounds good. Crisis to personal touch.

195
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:29,630
Since he. Powerful forces eventually breaking down.

196
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:38,490
Yeah. So let's. Oh, they all do.

197
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,770
All the time. Yeah.

198
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,260
I'm listening to Google Doc today.

199
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:58,570
I gather when you have a muslim presentation about it, but I'm going to let some countries the process Iranians are.

200
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:07,180
Even if so how does insulin. It was like this kind of to internalize wealth and so and so.

201
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:22,290
So I don't like it because it's something that when you're presented also makes you want to draw something like I suppose it's not the result of life,

202
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:31,590
I suppose. So that's what I was doing with an insight.

203
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:37,560
So those are like those three years.

204
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:43,469
Academy is like that. Like the reason why we're in a decrease in global.

205
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:51,720
Yes, we should increase because a lot of it it's like it was with your example of what we're asking.

206
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,549
And that's what I sometimes think job is for me.

207
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:02,000
I can remember where I spent in a year fixing things.

208
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:09,960
I always believe my time orientation of my budget. That's what I was like.

209
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,680
What happens, I guess what I mean, I was a student now.

210
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,969
And then I'm pretty straight. Yes. You're more soldiers, so.

211
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,080
Yeah. And then. Right.

212
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:41,729
Oh, she scratches something strange as strange to me.

213
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,480
It is that we can do it.

214
00:23:45,480 --> 00:24:04,080
You can keep going on in my area, which is essentially really one section over there.

215
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,340
I know you. Yeah.

216
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:32,430
Do you feel like you just need to talk to someone else if you can, to diet and exercise?

217
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,810
Yes, I think he's his team.

218
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:43,660
What does that say again? I mean, I was rushed in New York.

219
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,330
She didn't want you leaving. Yeah.

220
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,550
You know, there are always connections with something else.

221
00:24:50,850 --> 00:25:01,410
So should we put vest is always going to go to stressful situations like that, which is a good word.

222
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:06,540
Yeah. Needs to go on.

223
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:13,430
Misconceptions in the news. Yeah.

224
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,860
It would go it was, you know, it was right down like a journalist and it was only a genesis.

225
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:31,860
Would you have you would do both of those, which is what's happening in life and society,

226
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:37,620
just because that's going to determine what's gonna happen in this process.

227
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:44,860
Because either way, I would be like, Oh, really?

228
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:54,720
I think I'm going to start being a journalist and this is gonna happen.

229
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:10,750
Secondly, I believe that when you're an opener, like it's like, Oh, that's so you're like you're like, Freeze you.

230
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:19,530
She knew that. Yeah. So we'll spend a couple more minutes on this in the month of reading about something.

231
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:33,600
Yes, I'm sick of this for sure, because American swimming is just us.

232
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,730
It's really people like.

233
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:44,670
Like causes and things.

234
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:58,100
Yeah. I know this is.

235
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:15,400
You need to do something so you can learn your steps.

236
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:21,900
My personality, I really get to learn.

237
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:39,990
I know it's stupid. Mistakes, things. Everything is okay between you and me.

238
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,629
Okay. All right. So like I said, you know, I've got this complaint.

239
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,140
If you don't find it useful, if you submit it, even if it's incomplete, that's fine.

240
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,900
You get the points circle or put a little arrow or something.

241
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,600
If you're like, I'm not sure about this and we're trying to give you feedback that really isn't working.

242
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,800
So, okay, so here's a here's a lot of words here.

243
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,070
This is sort of one of those big summary slides I'm not going to read,

244
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:10,080
but it's kind of a good for key thing what is going on with the regulation of leukemia and cancer.

245
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:18,810
So like I said before, points that are different like Hep C, K, PC, EPAs and G6, those are the points of regulation, right?

246
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:24,540
So those things that are distinct are unique, are the points of regulation and it's multiple layers of regulation here.

247
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,660
So the first layer, this metabolic regulation of enzymes, so that's that allosteric reaction.

248
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,220
So it's very similar to what we talked about with K one and the glycol section.

249
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:41,640
These are very quick, very rapid changes. And so the main ones here are private carboxyl is which you see is activated by some way

250
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:50,290
and atpase which is the inverse k one is inhibited by all the things that activate one.

251
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:57,830
So sorry this ATP here. Shooting range is quite easy.

252
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:03,559
So that's one whole layer of regulation. The next whole layer of regulation is through hormones.

253
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,590
So rather than intracellular responding outlets, there's hormones.

254
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:11,720
The most important things here are going to be glucagon, insulin, cortisol, which we'll talk about a few minutes.

255
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:19,900
One unique thing about this compared to glycolysis is much of the regulation, especially by cortisol and by insulin is by transcription.

256
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:24,800
So we're going to be making whole new proteins, right, rather than rapidly activating inactivating protein.

257
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:29,360
There is some rapid activation of just this K2 API step,

258
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,749
but most of the regulation is actually transcriptional and that makes sense because gluconeogenesis is kind of a slow process.

259
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:40,190
It's energy consuming. So the idea that you're going to make all new enzymes makes a lot more sense.

260
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:44,200
And then the third line of regulation is by regulating the flow of substrate.

261
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:51,980
So like I said, it doesn't matter how all these enzymes are turned on, you have to also have supply of cholesterol, lactate and Albee, right?

262
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:57,860
So you control that. And then how do you signal to those other tissues? So, again, lots of information here.

263
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:03,649
This is really just to show you all the things that are regulating glycolysis are inversely regulating gluconeogenesis.

264
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:11,060
Right? These are reciprocal pathways. If something activates glycolysis, it almost certainly inactivates mutagenesis and vice versa.

265
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:14,750
So that's kind of a good just general concept to break down in case you ever get lost.

266
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,569
Trying to think about these things just be like, Well, I can't remember what's going on.

267
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,740
Click on your genesis, but I do remember what's going on in terms of a call system.

268
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:26,630
And so the signals are are all all inverted for the two.

269
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:32,990
And again, that's because it would be sort of catastrophically energy wasting to generate a lot of glucose and then immediately turning to it.

270
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:40,910
Right, you would principal ATP. Okay, so what happens if you take a person and you constantly pass?

271
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,550
So this is like a hypothetical person. This is not a real person story.

272
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:53,600
And what I want to kind of get your perspective on here or your draw your attention to here is sort of these worlds that are given eugenic hormones.

273
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,270
They sort of happen somewhat sequentially, right?

274
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:02,149
So as you go through, you imagine somebody who starts in the postprandial state as they get out of the postprandial state,

275
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,040
to me, they eat lunch with those couple of hours ago.

276
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:10,429
Now their insulin levels are dropping down, right, because the insulin spike after their meal is going to fail as glucose keeps dropping.

277
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:14,569
After that, you'll get induction of glucagon and epinephrine. Those are the average agonists.

278
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:18,920
They're going to activate both glycogen analysis and contingencies in the liver.

279
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:25,940
We'll talk a lot more about growth hormone then. That's kind of the next one on the list. When we get to protein metabolism, let's be clear here.

280
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:33,320
It doesn't really play a big role to looking at cancers as time goes on, if your blood glucose keeps dropping your cortisol, the metabolic rate.

281
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:39,920
So cortisol is not really a hormone that responds to chronic stress but is also a chemical regulatory and IT response to hypoglycemia.

282
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,270
And it'll also promote and as you get down here,

283
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:50,059
as you start sort of noticing symptomology lot like there's what they call it here that it goes out of regulation.

284
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,870
This is reduced autophagy or breakdown of the absolute liver to find it.

285
00:31:54,450 --> 00:32:01,370
So at that point, obviously it starts to appear and people go into a coma if their blood glucose gets too low.

286
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:04,910
Now, for the vast majority of people, you never get beyond I like about here.

287
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,000
Most people, even if they undergo a very, very prolonged fast,

288
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:13,489
all of these hormones being kicked and all this looks like the glucose levels are really dropping.

289
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,930
This is from an example where they block your genesis to follow the production of these controls,

290
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:21,050
what happens, and most people never drop below 50 or 60.

291
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,010
So we've talked about two of these three hormones, two of the three gluconeogenesis promoting hormones already.

292
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:34,490
So adrenalin, glucagon, they will work indistinguishable on a number of different effects on the muscle and the fat,

293
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,490
but they both work the same on the liver and they're going to promote the activation of the spice up.

294
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:45,620
And the activation of the new hormone for now is cortisol.

295
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:51,260
So using sort of the same schematic here, adrenaline's goal is to provide glucose to the muscle, right?

296
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,840
So that's why it affects the liver, but it doesn't affect the muscles.

297
00:32:54,170 --> 00:33:02,149
Glucagon for all is just for increase blood glucose for any reason, usually because of hypoglycemia and cortisol is also doing the same thing.

298
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:06,020
It's sort of like you can think of cortisol as like a super active version of glucagon.

299
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,760
The difference between cortisol and glucagon is called well, glucagon only really affects liver.

300
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:18,260
Cortisol will also provide the substrate. So the hourly number from the muscle and of cholesterol and fatty acids coming from the adipose tissue.

301
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,590
Right. Glucagon will do that. Right. So if you undergo a short period of fasting,

302
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,069
glucagon is not going to engage any breakdown of fatty acids to the extent that

303
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:30,230
only happens in response to either adrenaline or one of these keeps more relevant.

304
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,350
And at the same time, cortisol is also promoting the drive to eat.

305
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:40,160
So that's the other way. The cortisol is also kind of promoting elevations in blood glucose.

306
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:44,360
Now cortisol is a so cortisol is a hormone.

307
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:50,779
It binds to a receptor called the glucocorticoid receptor. So almost all of the effects of cortisol in the body are transcriptional.

308
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,870
So that means if cortisol is doing something, it's probably by generating.

309
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:59,999
Some new amount of protein. So is the transcriptional response to treatments relatively slow and expensive?

310
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,570
And the key cortisol targets here are 6%.

311
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:09,419
And perhaps you may not remember this because as much attention to my side as I do,

312
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:15,299
but we talked about glucose, six phosphatase and Google kinase deficiency.

313
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,800
One of the things that I pulled out of my genome wide association studies of that was those particular

314
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:27,870
a level of multi and what it did was interrupted the utility of Google or sorry cortisol my G6 gene.

315
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:35,850
It turns out that the way that cortisol activates these genes here is through us another transcription factor called FOXO.

316
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:42,479
So basically what happens is cortisol binds to glucocorticoid receptor that causes there to be a transcriptional

317
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,290
increase in this thing called FOXO also is then the thing that goes on and binds that Pepsi K and G six is promoter.

318
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:56,399
So it's sort of a two step. So as one transcription factor gets activated by cortisol, that then causes another transcription factor to get made,

319
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,630
which is called Foxo, and then Foxo goes off, enters the system.

320
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:06,230
It turns out that insulin actually also regulates Foxo as well.

321
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,950
So in this case, insulin promotes the phosphorylation of Foxo and turns Foxo off.

322
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,520
Right. And again, if you imagine that cortisol is promoting gluconeogenesis,

323
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,950
that means phosphorylation of foxo by insulin is going to also prevent gluconeogenesis.

324
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,290
Right. It's going to do the opposite thing.

325
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:29,520
So Foxo, the transcription factor Foxo is, is really important for this process as we'll get to amino acid metabolism in the third unit,

326
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:37,830
we'll talk about Foxo as well as it's also the thing that's going to promote muscle breakdown and that supply of alanine and look up to 2 billion.

327
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,190
Okay. So that's sort of cortisol in terms of how the hypoglycemic response,

328
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,610
but I think most people probably think of cortisol in terms of this stress response.

329
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,340
So what I'm showing you here on the left is the axis of the hypothalamus, pituitary adrenal axis.

330
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:59,429
And what happens here is in response to some stressor or as I just mentioned, you have an eyeball.

331
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:07,680
In fact, it's going to activate this cascade of hormones, cortical corticosterone, releasing hormone and then cortisol.

332
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,089
So these are all released and then these serve always to alleviate the metabolic effects, right?

333
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:20,580
So you can think of this unit. Hypoglycemia occurs, cortisol is made, cortisol promotes gluconeogenesis, that alleviates hypoxemia.

334
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:24,930
Therefore, cortisol can go away. But that also happens in terms of chronic stress, right?

335
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:29,310
So if somebody is undergoing chronic psychosocial stress, they'll be elevations of cortisol as well.

336
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,940
And so there's been a lot of studies that have looked at this idea of stress and how it relates to diabetes risk.

337
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:40,730
So many of you noted from the Bad Sugar documentary, those of you who did that activity,

338
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:44,520
that there was a relationship to the chronic stress levels in the Indians and there,

339
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,800
I think, sevenfold increase in diabetes rates relative to their crossover counterparts.

340
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,760
So we know for a long time stress is related to diabetes risk,

341
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:59,009
but the mechanisms of that are somewhat complicated because remember, cortisol is doing two things here.

342
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:05,220
It's promoting gluconeogenesis. Maybe when we are not in a hypoglycemic condition and it's also promoting appetite

343
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:10,559
and appetite is going to increase BMI and BMI is also increased risk for diabetes.

344
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,830
So cortisol is kind of working through both of these both of these mechanisms.

345
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:18,990
So I wanted to kind of get a more tangible example of what this might look like.

346
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:25,410
So in this study here, this was done in England and they were looking at a general level of this stress.

347
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:30,630
And so rather than actually ask people like, how stressed are you like given the term coming up,

348
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:36,450
what they did was they categorize people based on their jobs and what they how stressful the jobs were.

349
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:42,000
Right. So like firefighters, emergency responders, like high stress jobs, like university professors,

350
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:45,870
I don't know, people think farm kids, whatever would be like low stress jobs.

351
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,220
Right. So they categorize people based on their job type. So this is not an objective measure of individual stress.

352
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:56,560
It's sort of a job type related stress. And what they found is that people who had higher stress jobs had higher, higher rates.

353
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,840
Right. So you should always be cautious looking at this in terms of like, are we sure this is the only thing going on?

354
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,830
Could there be other confounders? Could there be socio economic differences between these groups?

355
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:09,630
But this does suggest that prospectively, if you followed for ten years, 50 years later,

356
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:15,480
people were experiencing high job related stress, also had a higher risk of developing diabetes.

357
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:20,399
Did you say that cortisol increases appetite?

358
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,820
So yeah, of course all will increase. That makes sense.

359
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:32,010
Okay, so this was the first study and this is again that British household study is called Whitehall to.

360
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:36,120
So the first study they showed this, some people are like, oh, that's cool, not cool, it sucks.

361
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,840
But like that makes sense. That explains why diabetes rates might be different in different populations.

362
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:45,300
They didn't directly measure cortisol here, but then in a follow up study, which I actually kind of thought was more interesting,

363
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:50,610
and then what you might want to do is let's just try to stratify these people based on are they obese or not?

364
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,880
And maybe is there any sex differences. Right. And so I think.

365
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,510
The first time I saw this lady, when I was just talking about love, I was like, Oh yeah, this makes sense.

366
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,379
People who are higher stress jobs probably have higher rates of obesity.

367
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:06,010
We only know higher rates with the economy, and that's probably what was going on.

368
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,540
So this is the same data.

369
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:12,820
This is just in a follow up study that came up a couple years later where they stratified this into into a few different groups.

370
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:19,360
So men and women obviously left, right. And then what they're stratifying is, are the people at time of follow up.

371
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,460
So that time of diagnosis of carriers are they are not.

372
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,540
And then what is their stress level? So a few things I want to highlight.

373
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:29,740
We'll start with men. Number six is really the reasons to study here.

374
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:37,000
So if you look at men, you can see it's pretty straightforward that if they are obese, no matter their stress level, they have a higher diabetes risk.

375
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:41,260
So that was sort of my initial thought was that, well, if you're more obese, you're more likely to diabetes.

376
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:49,330
So that seems to have an effect. Now, interestingly, again, in men, it wasn't really that big of an effect of stress within the within the obese.

377
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:55,360
And in fact, the medical stress actually reduced diabetes rates a little bit in non-obese group.

378
00:39:55,510 --> 00:40:02,170
So it's a little bit counterintuitive here. If you jump over to women, we actually see something I think ultimately pretty good.

379
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,450
So again, we see a difference here between non-obese and obese.

380
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:10,750
And again, we know that we know for sure that obesity is the strongest risk factor for diabetes.

381
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:17,080
But the big difference we see is now stress seems to have a disproportionately high role in obese women, not so much in obese men.

382
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,840
Could like a co-founder for like the like the opposite relationship being shown,

383
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:28,270
like the stress the opposite direction for men that the co-founder would be like exercise like for me I don't I'm stressed.

384
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:32,169
I like exercise. Yeah. It could be it could be job type, right?

385
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:36,720
It could be. Maybe the stress of the job is more related to higher income between men and women.

386
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:41,649
Possibly there could be a lot of explanations for that. But this is you know, the could also be a biological explanation.

387
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:47,240
We know, for example, that cortisol reactivity, for sure advice is really, really differently in male and female.

388
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:53,560
It likes to just respond to cortisol really different. Right. In terms of in male voice was actually less of a repetitive drive than you know.

389
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:57,970
And we don't really know why, but we can measure that could happen. So there's a lot of possible.

390
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:03,159
Can you bring up a good example? There's a lot of plausible explanations for this. Again, this is sort of a longitudinal observational study.

391
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:10,630
There's no intervention. It's actually quite hard to study things like this because it's like pretty unethical to just like cause stress in people.

392
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:16,930
So most of the other studies have looked at this are looking at it from the other perspective, like things like including mindfulness or meditation.

393
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:22,509
In Canada, we get stress. And again, what you see is a similar sort of thing in those kinds of studies.

394
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,290
I don't have the data here,

395
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,660
but where you see a disproportionate effect on people with obesity and then a pretty mild effect on people without obesity.

396
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,580
So my takeaway from data like this is, first of all, we shouldn't just presume things are the same between men and women.

397
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:41,170
And then second of all, that obesity may be synergistically acting alongside with stress, especially in women, maybe not so much in men.

398
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,690
Right. So the mechanisms here could be could be a little bit different.

399
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:52,030
So this is a follow up study from the one where they kind of grouped a job as higher level stress right over.

400
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:59,589
Because I was just thinking about in terms of stress and job related, like you might be in a quote unquote like low stress job.

401
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:07,270
But all of the external factors about like if you have weird hours or if it's like low income is going to lead to a lot of stress,

402
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:12,250
even though like your job itself isn't stressful. Like, what was that accounted for?

403
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:15,370
Well, no, all they were looking at you, but you're right. Like there's you know,

404
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:18,189
you could have the most stressful job in the world and have like a very supportive family

405
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:22,569
and lots of resources and live in a town that is amenable to a little stress lifestyle.

406
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:28,180
Right. So it's really just looking at that. But you're right, the things that drive stress, an individual's going to vary pretty widely,

407
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:33,940
typically also on the other side of things and think of like women in the workplace,

408
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:41,440
more stressful jobs all ready systematically is associated with more male dominated jobs than females in

409
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:47,230
those roles already have a higher level of stress because maybe they're the only one in that specific field.

410
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,069
There's a number of other external factors.

411
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:57,250
Yeah, for sure. So yeah, you're right. So like we could categorize that as like lack of like within the workplace,

412
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:03,460
which is the worst sex based discrimination for sure, but yet it could be multiple demands on your time, right?

413
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:06,650
One still cannot be the primary caregivers for for many children. Right. So we're talking about that.

414
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:12,819
Yeah. That could be a lot of why we have obesity in there, too. There's a whole different I mean, we make a deal differently, right?

415
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:21,100
So that that I feel this way that when we talked about it, it was kind of like five minute part of of Warren's lecture.

416
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:27,700
But this idea that stress can exacerbate obesity, too, right? Because, you know, that can affect body image and then that can exacerbate cortisol.

417
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,959
I think worse because you need more. And then that can exacerbate diabetes, too. Yeah, well, there's a lot of explanations.

418
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,050
It's sort of like I said, it turns out studying stress is is pretty good. Right.

419
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:40,810
Even if you're looking at objective biomarkers of stress, like, like, okay,

420
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:48,940
so I'm going to move on now from cortisol to sort of the first regulatory enzyme, which is PepsiCo, fossil fuel of it.

421
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:53,830
So it is not at all regulated elsewhere. So there's no rapid turnover.

422
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,230
Turn off of a Pepsi can, which is this which is a separate here.

423
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:04,020
It is regulated almost exclusively transcriptional. So it's regulated by insulin negatively and involved positively.

424
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:14,840
Now, this enzyme here is actually quite. Overall can be quite categorized because what you're doing is you're pulling oxalic acetate out of the tea.

425
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:18,860
Right. So one thing that can happen here and I mentioned this a little bit when we were talking about

426
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:24,620
ketogenic diet a couple classes ago is if all you're doing is pulling out acetate from the TCT cycle,

427
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:31,219
that's really, really kind of plural. But if you're constantly you feed in either a lactate or an allergy and then you pull out an ox,

428
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:35,030
I'll ask the on balance, it should be neutral because you're adding one thing and you're taking one thing away.

429
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:43,670
So Pepsi cage activity sort of get into it needs to be balanced by part of it collapses right if you're trying to get the nutrients from alveoli,

430
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:51,349
if it's not, let's say the lactate or alanine levels are insufficient to meet the supply or to meet the demand.

431
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:56,870
Pepsi K Then you become really kind of chronic and that's why people when they undergo fasting or chronic

432
00:44:56,870 --> 00:45:02,509
starvation and there's not another fuel source coming in become ketogenic because it has nowhere to go off.

433
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:06,470
The exhausted is gone. So that's sort of the first key step.

434
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:13,940
Like I said, it's transcriptional PC, which is, like I said, the pair that goes along with Pepsi K is now an operative, right?

435
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:19,769
Because if all you have going on was was this reaction but not that reaction, you would just keep filling up the tissue cycle.

436
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:26,450
And indeed, that's how most and the process occurs. If your T-shirt gets really low, you're a subtle quit, can't go anywhere.

437
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:32,270
It might become a ketone body but actually will end up building up. That'll activate allosteric lee Pepsi.

438
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:32,779
Right.

439
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:39,440
So that's how there's internal signaling where if you have too much a subtle way you'll divert pyruvate into the TC cycle through subtle acetate,

440
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:44,510
not through acetylcholine. Right? So if you go this way, it's an erotic but not energy producing.

441
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:48,540
If you go this way, it's energy producing, but not for all right.

442
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:54,830
So that's how internally this circuit here can influence these ongoing levels with the cycle.

443
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:01,610
And it's again, its main regulator is some way and that's coming from from frequencies.

444
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:06,140
Okay. And you may not be surprised. The next thing we talk about is like, what happens if the system goes wrong?

445
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:12,860
What happens if you don't have power? Come on. It's again, unfortunately pretty rare, one in 250,000 people.

446
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:18,590
But in the area that I'm from, it's actually quick comments. Only one 100 people in our company create native Canadians.

447
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:25,790
So it's actually pretty common. So this is the thing that people notice. It's not tested systematically because of our Native American help.

448
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:30,080
Our new Canadian culture is also pretty terrible, but it's pretty, pretty common occurrence.

449
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:34,850
So three things are happening when you are frequently deficient.

450
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:40,630
So one is you for gold of lactic acid, one of you have muscle weakness and one is you have hyper ketones.

451
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,590
So I forget anemia. What I mean is that you've got a buildup of ketone bodies.

452
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:48,620
So you may notice this is actually pretty similar to what would happen if you

453
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:52,699
had Parvati androgynous deficiency or beriberi or if you first got syndrome,

454
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:57,859
which was the same thing. So you have lactic acid buildup because that lactate has nowhere to go, right?

455
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:02,120
Because it can't go through this process here. It's it can't go through botulism.

456
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:06,260
There's muscle weakness because as you become kind of product,

457
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:10,250
you're not going to be able to utilize the fatty acids or the anything else for energy activities.

458
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:16,940
This cycle is not going to work. And then you're hypo anemic because the supply of fatty acids isn't enough to activate carbon carboxyl.

459
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:23,240
Remember, carbohydrate carboxyl is is trying to balance the needs of the TCA cycle with the influence of the acetylcholine.

460
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,950
All right, if that doesn't work, then you have all these fatty acids coming in. They have nowhere to go.

461
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,790
They get they still get broken down in a simple way, but then those just get released as as people.

462
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:38,150
So if you met somebody like this, what is the diet that maybe they should try and a diet they should definitely not try.

463
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:47,690
If somebody presented with a PC deficiency. Probably not a high fat diet.

464
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:53,270
Probably not a high fat diet. Yeah, not high fat diet for sure. There's a subset of hybridize.

465
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:58,050
It would be particularly bad here. Yeah.

466
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:07,070
Thinking like a higher carb diet that amino acids and fatty acids all confused.

467
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:12,900
So you need to focus on carbs. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So they're they're recommended a very high carb, high protein diet.

468
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,920
Very low fat diet. Absolutely not. A ketogenic diet.

469
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:20,250
Ketogenic diet would be absolutely catastrophic here. Right. Because you already have anemia to begin with.

470
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,559
You already can't use the fatty acids.

471
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:30,540
So people who are on this, and even if they undergo prolonged fasting, can have very, very dangerously high ketosis.

472
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:35,340
And and Elizabeth. So definitely would avoid that.

473
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:47,970
Okay. So moving up now, so we just we've talked now about PC and Pepsi games almost all the way up here to fructose is positive one.

474
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,280
So this one is the reverse of pack one.

475
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:58,169
Right. It's been a few minutes on that because I can only tell you have this story we were talking about glycolysis.

476
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:06,260
This is the other half of what's going on with glycolysis. So at the step of glycolysis, what's happening is you're going from here to here, right?

477
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:10,620
You're adding the okay, one step is more to the left. So this is the reverse of the kinetic one.

478
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:14,550
So if you're taking one of these phosphates away, that's what a positive step is.

479
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:19,410
It takes one phosphate away. Now it's inhibited by f26 BP.

480
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:25,710
So fructose two six plus phosphate, which is that allosteric regulator of k one and by AMP.

481
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:28,980
And I'll try to bring around to why that matters in a bit.

482
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:32,640
So I showed you this diagram here when we talked about glycolysis.

483
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:39,060
So if you look at PFOA one activity, in the absence of the activator, two six BP is very, very, very inactive.

484
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:47,790
However, if you add the two six BP, which is the product of PBC two, you get a strong activation of K one activity.

485
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:53,060
So the strongest regulator people want to actually be close to six is phosphate.

486
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:58,770
All right. And that comes from the PVC two system. If you look at at BPA, EPA activity.

487
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,370
So this is now a eugenic version of that. It's exactly the opposite.

488
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:06,390
Right. So in the absence of two six BP, you have a high level of that EPA activity.

489
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:10,889
But if two six BP goes up now you have suppression of that.

490
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:17,620
BP isn't right. So two six BP, which is the main regulator of PFOA, one is also the main regulator of that.

491
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:22,740
BP is right. So that one step is regulated by both of these in the same place.

492
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:32,730
Now, it turns out PFC two and at BPA two are actually the same enzyme, what's called a pipe control enzyme.

493
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:34,740
So it's an enzyme that has two different active sites.

494
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:41,460
One active site is the phosphatase reaction of a tiny fraction, and then one site is the phosphate production.

495
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,200
So because this is just one enzyme,

496
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:50,759
it actually turns out that regulation of this enzyme becomes pretty straightforward because all you need to do is fast forward the enzyme.

497
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:58,230
If it's phosphorylated, now you have this being active and this being inactive and if it's phosphorylated calcium two is active,

498
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:07,470
atpase is, you know, right. And so that's how insulin can promote the activity of K2 and adrenaline can suppress the activity of K2.

499
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:14,870
By regulating K2, you can control the regulation of K1 and thus glycolysis and convergences and signals the reverse.

500
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:20,190
Right? So both of these are feeding into the same the same internal regulator, right?

501
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:28,200
So this regulatory circuit, APF, K2 and two are the main regulator of both FP one ATP is one, right.

502
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,880
And so like I said, it can get it get a little complicated because these things are so similarly named.

503
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:38,730
But the ones of K1 Epsilon, they're the glycolic and gluconeogenesis regulated enzymes,

504
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:45,990
and the two happens to PV, K2 and fructose two six plus phosphate are the regulators of the process.

505
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:47,610
Right. So one side is the regulators.

506
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:54,179
You can have think of those as the gas bottle and then the other is the ones are the actual engine for the actual car.

507
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:59,130
That was actually. Okay. So I'm going to move on to sort of this idea of energy.

508
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:02,540
So gluconeogenesis is pretty energetically expensive.

509
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:06,660
So, for example, if I followed glycolysis collected, which we talked about before,

510
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:12,060
you get a plus two ATP, and if you follow it like glucose through a paradox, you generate three ATP.

511
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:15,360
However, when you go through putative genesis.

512
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:22,429
Depending on what your substrate is coming from, you may be using six or 11 ATP just to make one click right.

513
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:28,930
So it's very, very energetically expensive. So if you just take one example, let's say you take glucose market.

514
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:37,420
What's going on here. So glucose, the last thing you would be plus two ATP and if you took that lactate brought it back to glucose for example,

515
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:41,150
in the Corry cycle, you would be burning an extra four ATP every time.

516
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:43,240
Right. So that's why that's an inefficient process.

517
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:48,960
If you're doing it through alanine, through the whole cycle, it's even worse because that's no net -11.

518
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:54,310
Right. And so you'd be breaking down much more. So I guess the question is, where do you think this energy is coming from, this ATP?

519
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,910
Right. If you're going to make glucose, you're in a fasted state. Right.

520
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:02,610
But you need all this energy to make the the glucose from.

521
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:06,110
So what? Nutria do you think is providing that energy?

522
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:21,280
Providing free financing. Yeah, it all elegantly has to be the free fatty acids.

523
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:26,310
Now the reason for that is if you had enough glucose, you wouldn't be undergoing gluconeogenesis, right?

524
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:33,190
So it can't be glucose. And chances are if you had enough amino acids, you would be using those with gluconeogenesis, right?

525
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:37,990
So those two things are being used. As I said before, fatty acids cannot be used to make glucose, right?

526
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:42,910
So they're not useful for that perspective, but they're extremely useful for the energy producing perspective.

527
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:48,700
Right. So fatty acids don't become glucose, but they're really the things that power gluconeogenesis in almost every case.

528
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:55,750
Right. So that's why it's important to cortisol and to lesser extent adrenaline are promoting the lipolysis to provide fatty acid.

529
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:59,620
Those fatty acids don't become glucose, they become the ATP that then powers.

530
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:06,580
This whole reaction to fatty acids are really important from an energetic perspective, even if they're not important for a substrate perspective.

531
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:11,250
All right. So that's all sort of the direct effects.

532
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:18,520
Everything I've talked about so far until this point, mostly talk about what's going on at the level of what's actually happening in the liver.

533
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:23,230
So those are all like direct effects. So they're really transcriptional effects.

534
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:26,979
And then, like I said, the evaporation, kick it. All right.

535
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:31,840
I'm going to take a shift away if I'm a little bit about diabetes and you switch back to the indirect effects,

536
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:35,290
which to me are lasting for for today and for the target market.

537
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:41,469
Okay. So this first study here is what they wanted to look at is actually a couple of different things that are important for diabetes.

538
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:46,690
Actually, I think told you three. One question is how avidly are you absorbing carbohydrates from your gut?

539
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:52,000
Right. What is that postprandial glucose spike? Are you absorbing a lot of carbohydrates or not very many carbohydrates?

540
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:55,810
What kind of carbohydrates you using? Are they high glycemic index or low glycemic index?

541
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,820
Those are all affecting absorption. The second question is, are they being disposed of different?

542
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:04,530
Right. So how effectively is carbohydrate being squeezed out?

543
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:08,320
And if you remember from the glycolysis lecture almost exclusively in the muscle, right?

544
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:14,350
So effectively is the muscle taking up glucose and then either using it for energy or storing it as glycogen.

545
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:21,420
So that's the sort of the second part. And then the third part is how effectively are you suppressing glucose production, right?

546
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:26,010
If you are diabetic cancer, your glucose production very high.

547
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,290
So this was again, this is a pretty old status from like 1980 something.

548
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:35,380
So if for some of your report and what they looked at was those sort of two things independently.

549
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,910
So they took a bunch of patients that were either diabetic. So they're diabetic.

550
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,920
As you can see, their fasting glucose is elevated. You're on the right.

551
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:45,070
So all these thoughts here, all right, are the diabetic people.

552
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:53,230
And then they looked at the rates of glucose production on the Y axis, glucose oxidation here or lipid oxidation here.

553
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:59,139
So what you can kind of see if you look at this somewhat carefully is if you start with lipid oxidation, these are about the same, right?

554
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:02,170
So the average of these dots here is about the same as the average of these.

555
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:08,410
Naturally, maybe there's slight increases in lipid oxidation. And as we'll talk about, this is probably due to unrestrained lipolysis.

556
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:16,000
Yeah, right. But there's not that big of a difference. There is a slight decrease if you compare it here to here in glucose oxidation.

557
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:22,450
Right. So if you look at the average of these points, the average of those points, there's a little bit less glucose oxidation in the diabetics.

558
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:27,790
Why do you think that? Why would there be less glucose oxidation in people who are diabetic?

559
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:39,460
Is it because of the insulin not promoting the glucose spreading through the cell?

560
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:43,599
Exactly. Because you would have an impairment of insulin dependent glucose uptake in the muscle cell.

561
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,230
And then the muscle is the primary site of postprandial glucose oxidation.

562
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:52,630
Yeah, exactly. So this is probably almost exclusively due to muscle glucose oxidation impairments.

563
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:56,080
However, the most prominent effect you can see here is in terms of glucose production.

564
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,349
So in this case, it's a full plate analysis and gluconeogenesis.

565
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:02,830
But if you combine that with the very first one I showed you, this is mostly from Genesis.

566
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:08,020
And you see gluconeogenesis tends to be much higher in diabetic people compared to non-diabetic people.

567
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:11,410
Again, that's because insulin should be suppressing gluconeogenesis.

568
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:15,370
If you are insulin resistant, insulin is less able to suppress food and go Genesis.

569
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:19,210
So you have gluconeogenesis occurring even though you don't need to.

570
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,290
So again, if you look at people here, their fasting blood glucose is somewhere around 208,

571
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:26,470
which is quite high, but they're still producing more glucose than this group here.

572
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:31,430
Right. They don't need glucose. They have plenty of chemicals already. But that's something that carnism is not working.

573
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:34,359
They keep creating extra points. Right. So that is suggested.

574
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:43,090
That may be a good target for for individuals of this particular nature is trying to find ways to impair their their glucose production,

575
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:46,180
which people have been trying for a long time. It hasn't been an option.

576
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:51,249
The other thing I want to point out about this study here is you could see in general,

577
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:56,730
it's true that glucose production is higher in the diabetics versus the non-diabetic, but it's not always true.

578
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:05,230
Right. You can see this little group here of four people, they have about the same amount of glucose production as as a control group.

579
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:12,670
Right. As the non-diabetic group. Right. So they're diabetic, but they're probably not diabetic because of their overhead over glucose production.

580
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:17,140
And in fact, if you kind of follow this down and you look there, probably a bunch of these people here,

581
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:21,040
which is they're primarily diabetic because of impairments in glucose oxidation.

582
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,940
And that actually turns out to be generally true.

583
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:30,910
So and a lot of the time before class today. So I did a very tiny research project of pulling out of all that.

584
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:38,110
She was so genome wide association studies things or wheels that are associated with these are compared to our glucose

585
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:46,420
tolerance so that would be postprandial equivalent sorry if I to get five if I did something for me it's like that.

586
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:51,190
And then if you look at that she was for people who had elevated casting glucose.

587
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:55,690
And so what you can see is there's 225 genes that are significantly associated with politicians in

588
00:58:55,690 --> 00:59:05,030
fasting glucose and which are 246 genes involved in fast glucose and the like and 38 with elevated FAS.

589
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:09,370
Now the important thing here is there's actually a very small overlap between the two, right?

590
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:16,270
The genes that are associated with fasting glucose are generally not always associated with impaired glucose tolerance and vice versa.

591
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:23,829
Right. So there is some overlap. There's 21 genes in the middle, but that's like less than 10% of the entire entire set of fast glucose genes.

592
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:28,240
Right. So let's suggest there's two different sets of mechanisms that are going on here.

593
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:32,770
And broadly, that's what we think is true. So people who have elevated fasting glucose,

594
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:37,030
so they're diabetic because they have elevated passive glucose generally we think this is because

595
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:42,040
of liver and adipose function and generally because of this increase in gluconeogenesis,

596
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:50,260
right? So their particular problem, the reason they're hypoglycemic is because of generally liver and adipose function, liver function.

597
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:53,950
Hopefully at this point you can appreciate why insulin resistance of the liver will cause that.

598
00:59:53,950 --> 01:00:00,820
We'll talk about adipose function in a couple of slides. However, those are largely distinct from the people for paired oral glucose tolerance test.

599
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:05,770
These genes, if you look at where these genes are expressed, tend to be in the pancreas or in the muscle, right?

600
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:13,059
That's because in the postprandial state, getting rid of blood glucose after a meal is largely insulin and a muscle glucose uptake function.

601
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:17,260
Right. So the of impairments in insulin production or you have impairments in muscle glucose uptake.

602
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:23,020
Now, you'll be more likely to have impaired oral glucose tolerance, but not necessarily increased gluconeogenesis.

603
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:26,320
Right. So these are two more or less distinct subtypes of diabetes.

604
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:38,290
So our livers in diabetic patients are those kind of dysfunctional, not dysfunctional, are they kind of like like that because they're just.

605
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:45,540
There's a lot of work is happening in the liver, like because they're doing gluconeogenesis when they don't need to.

606
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:49,379
I'm saying, like, is there liver damage? I think that's what I was waiting for.

607
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:53,910
Yeah, because you could argue they're not functioning properly because they're making glucose when they don't need.

608
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:57,630
Yeah, right. And that's like, certainly true. Now, does it cause liver damage?

609
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:01,290
Yes, for sure. The problem is, is that the primary cause of liver damage,

610
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:09,330
we don't actually know because many people who have diabetes also have fatty liver disease, like something like 35% and also fatty liver.

611
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,880
So, yes, there is a high risk of liver failure.

612
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,430
But is that due to increased fatty liver disease increase in fatty acids, primarily getting to the liver?

613
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:21,630
Or is that due to the energy demands on the liver or those two things inextricably tied?

614
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:25,139
Right. Because remember, to fuel the liver, to make the glucose you need,

615
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:29,549
the fatty acids includes some of the process of putting all those fatty acids is what's causing the liver.

616
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:32,770
And we don't actually know that yet.

617
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:36,390
So where do type one diabetic fall into that?

618
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:42,990
Yeah. So type one diabetic would be different. So type of that is all generally higher fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance.

619
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:46,140
Right. Because their primary function is is pancreatic.

620
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,010
Right. But in that case, it's usually so strong. Often we find that.

621
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:55,719
Yeah. Oh, and I guess I didn't say so.

622
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:01,450
These are the reason these numbers are pretty small in terms of seem to be genes and these are all already adjusted for BMI.

623
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:07,360
So there's another whole category of genes that cause diabetes risk that are primarily driven by increasing somebodies body size.

624
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,250
All right. So if you have a higher body weight or diabetes,

625
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:15,580
so most of the G was not on here are are from the amount that these are all using the adjusted estimates.

626
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:22,450
So the question so if you are insulin resistant or have type two diabetes and you take these tests, you.

627
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:28,580
They are better off one versus the other. So it's indicative of one process. So many other things.

628
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:31,910
Are there different ways of managing it at that point or is it still like?

629
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:43,220
So it's a really good question. It's a really good question. So let me let me reframe that in like a like a more concrete term.

630
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:47,209
So let's say somebody comes in and they are diabetic. Remember, if you looked at the diagnosis for diabetes,

631
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:53,630
you could be diagnosed based on passing glucose they'd be able to eat or tomorrow, let's say they're okay on two of those tests.

632
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:58,520
Let's say they're fine on if you want to eat and or a glucose tolerance, but they bypassing blood glucose or whatever.

633
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:05,989
And then you identify that. Then you can imagine there could be a nutrition or pharmacological treatment that could be different between eating right.

634
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:12,260
So somebody who has higher of classic low glucose, would you want to focus on reducing things that are going to promote Genesis rates?

635
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:13,820
Maybe you want to reduce fats a little bit more.

636
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:21,679
Maybe you want to have smaller meals, for example, whereas somebody who has postprandial insulin resistance like this,

637
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:26,030
you might want to absorb, say, carbohydrates, because it's not bulls that carbohydrates that's causing a problem.

638
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:29,209
I've never heard of somebody actually doing this. Right. It makes sense to me,

639
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:35,610
but I've never seen that used diagnostically and I've never seen this being used in terms of pharmacology you mentioned before, right.

640
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:43,490
Are certain drugs better? Metformin actually works generally better in terms of hepatic gluconeogenesis and a little bit less here,

641
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:45,230
but they're certainly not prescribed that way.

642
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:54,010
Specifically for anyone seriously to go differentiate to see which one it was, because it gives you an estimated average rate.

643
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:57,630
So if you want to see the reasoning behind that one, here is this kind of right.

644
01:03:57,670 --> 01:04:02,730
You could have ideas if you want to see because you have peak postprandial glucose or because you have high strength.

645
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:06,190
So that averages you out, which is good I guess. But then again,

646
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:11,950
I think that gets away from what I was getting at in terms of the question of like these are fundamentally different physiologies right.

647
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:17,909
So if you get the average antibiotic, but that being said, that doesn't dictate treatment, it some effect doesn't differentiate you.

648
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:23,920
Yeah. Whereas I honestly do think that as people will move forward and they start doing pharmacol what say people are doing?

649
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:28,990
They are I know for sure they are pharmacology of different drugs in which drugs, for better or worse, for which patients.

650
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:32,680
My guess is it's going to coordinate with what type of diabetes they have.

651
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:37,959
Right. So, for example, if metformin works really well for these people who have higher passes like Google's,

652
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:42,970
you'll notice people with those appeals that cause them to have higher levels are going to respond better to metformin.

653
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:47,740
So my guess is that pharmacogenomics will solve this sort of question for us.

654
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:54,910
But like I said, as far as I know intimately, I feel that clinically it happens, but not systematically.

655
01:04:55,390 --> 01:05:01,150
Yes. And not in a in like the level before, not checking beforehand,

656
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:08,980
but managing the patient as you go and seeing all the fasting are messy, the postprandial or not as much and titrating.

657
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:09,699
Yeah, no, you're right.

658
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:14,859
And like also the advanced people wearing CGM right where they're getting better resolution data so they don't just know they have a high age.

659
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:20,830
We want to see they know like, oh, I have a high frequency after I eat phonetics, then that becomes more informed.

660
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:22,390
And that's a that's a really good example.

661
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:28,689
Like I make jokes sometimes about things like anecdotal, but like that is the value of like patient oriented service, right?

662
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:34,149
So if you're a provider and your person is telling you, like, I know when I didn't say like sleep,

663
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:37,750
I wake up and my fasting like glucose is really high because maybe I'm not sleeping.

664
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:41,139
My cortisol is dropping my fast like glucose. That's a thing a person knows.

665
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:44,049
And that's true for that person. It may not be generalizable hydration,

666
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:48,760
but that is true to that person and to me is what that is probably actually part of general treatment in terms of,

667
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:53,230
oh, we've learned that we should like work on your sleep or something because that seems to be the driving factor for you here.

668
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:59,319
But it's like I said, it's not like if you did that activity that looked at the type two diabetes, but it's not that, right?

669
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:04,030
So it's not broad based guidance, but it probably does occur, you know, even in a way, it's just trial and error.

670
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:07,420
You should I mean, what you're alluding to here.

671
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:13,400
Okay. All right. So that is is that what that is?

672
01:06:13,830 --> 01:06:18,840
So the other main regulatory point of gluconeogenesis is by this indirect regulation.

673
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:24,360
Like I said at the beginning, having a sufficient substrate supply is is actually critical to the process.

674
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:28,109
I believe that you're going to have to go to the coffee cycle.

675
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:34,200
You need to make sure that you're finding enough lactate. If you're undergoing the clinical cycle, you need to provide sufficient amino acid.

676
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:40,350
And because of that, the rate of gluconeogenesis is actually highly, highly dependent on on substrate.

677
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:44,910
So likely amino acids and glycerol. As I've kind of been alluding to already,

678
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:51,270
Lipolysis plays a particularly unique role here because you strip away activates part B carboxylic acid and it provides energy.

679
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:54,360
It's providing the ATP because you're not using that to make glucose.

680
01:06:54,480 --> 01:07:03,000
You can preserve that and use that to make energy. And it's also providing the glycerol backbone substrate to arthritis.

681
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:11,580
Now, there been debate for for many years about like what is the relevant portion of indirect versus direct regulation of gluconeogenesis,

682
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:17,010
which you clear and so I alluded to 10 minutes ago or something about how people have been trying

683
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:20,430
to come up with inhibitors of gluconeogenesis in the liver thinking that might help people.

684
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:24,720
And that's been pretty unhelpful in terms of the protocol.

685
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,739
So when we hear that, for example, we study glucocorticoid signaling.

686
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:33,210
And so we had made mice that didn't have the glucocorticoid receptor in the liver.

687
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:36,980
And we know the glucocorticoid receptor does stuff in the liver, causes these transcriptional changes.

688
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:41,550
And I'm sure on the exams, I'm not saying are not important, but we knew cortisol had activity on the liver.

689
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:46,680
It turned out if we knocked out the g r in the liver, those mice were like totally fine, totally, unbelievably,

690
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:51,899
frustratingly, annoyingly, completely fine, boring enough that we couldn't even publish how not set these mice.

691
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:58,050
But it turned out the glucocorticoid receptor in the liver was entirely dispensable for glucocorticoid induced diabetes.

692
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,810
They got the same rate of diabetes, whether they had the signaling or not.

693
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:07,290
However, surprisingly, when we knocked it out in the fat tissue, it completely blocked the cortisol induced hyperglycemia.

694
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:09,300
Right. Because in the case of cortisol,

695
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:17,430
what's going on is the main effect of cortisol is driving little policies and that is what is indirectly regulating gluconeogenesis.

696
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:23,100
And so we knew we were getting more glucose production because we could measure that by radioisotopes, because the mice in all sorts of things.

697
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:27,719
Then we knew there was more glucose production. But now we know that it actually has nothing to do with the signaling in the liver.

698
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:32,820
It's only because of the signaling in the fat. And we published this in a few other people, published the sense, right?

699
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:38,550
So it really does show you how important this indirect regulation is in the case of exercise induced hypoglycemia.

700
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:42,030
We think the key role is muscle not adequate for all reasons. And you probably.

701
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:49,350
Okay. So how does this happen? How does insulin in particular indirectly regulate gluconeogenesis?

702
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:55,620
Again, I alluded to this a little report. So protein breakdown insulin is a really important suppressor of protein breakdown.

703
01:08:55,650 --> 01:09:01,979
There's also very active beta protein synthesis. This is one reason somebody mentioned this in perusal yesterday or today,

704
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:05,650
but this is one reason why type two diabetics tend to have muscle wasting because they

705
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:09,150
are shifting the balance away from protein synthesis and towards protein breakdown,

706
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:13,620
primarily because of the same muscle insulin resistance that we've been talking about.

707
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:22,860
There's also the direct effect of cortisol through FOXO to activate these outer genes which cause protein breakdown, which in the case of Lipolysis,

708
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:28,530
which will be in the next unit, LIPOLYSIS is strongly suppressed by insulin and promoted by adrenaline and cortisol.

709
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:32,460
So by a very similar token. When I told you the story about cortisol.

710
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:38,250
People have shown that if you knock out the insulin receptor in adipose tissue, that disproportionately affects glucose production.

711
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:40,560
So if you add insulin, glucose production goes down.

712
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:47,190
So if you had insulin in a mouse that doesn't have insulin receptors in their fat, glucose production doesn't go down very much at all because again,

713
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:52,440
the main driver here is the indirect supply in this case of those strong fatty acids that is provided.

714
01:09:53,220 --> 01:10:00,150
So this indirect regulation is is really, really important. That's also why I think a lot of these pharmacological efforts targeting the liver

715
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:04,379
are not that effective because quite often the deficit is actually upstream.

716
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:08,700
Right. It can be adapted in the articles or in the muscle. And that's why you're seeing more gluconeogenesis.

717
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:12,720
Even though the liver may be functioning within its sort of normal parameters.

718
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:20,350
Right. So there is direct effects on the liver, but it seems increasingly more of the effects tend to be kind of ignored.

719
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:24,240
Okay. So that is it. That is all I know about carbohydrates.

720
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:29,910
Your whole carbohydrates help and energy balance to a smaller extent.

721
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:36,270
So like I said, you have a couple of weeks and following that here, we're going to have until the midterm plenty of time to consolidate review.

722
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:41,489
Please take advantage of your to health professional team if you only questions

723
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:45,890
and like I said to you after your fall break potential break on Wednesday,

724
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:49,980
February 1720.
