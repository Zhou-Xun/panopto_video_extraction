1
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:18,670
Okay. Good morning, everyone. We are going to start our lecture about life, history and developmental plasticity.

2
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:26,230
Before we start, I just want to go over some housekeeping.

3
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,320
The issues are not. I posted the instructions for the final project.

4
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,130
You can find that in Compass in the home page.

5
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,570
Is due December 12 of 5 p.m.

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,990
That's a week after our last day of class.

7
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:57,490
Our last day of classes. December 5th. Then you will need to them get this done.

8
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:03,220
Yes. To upload your report by by these web now.

9
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:18,280
Basically, what I want you for you is to answer this question, but more like a now, like in a paper, like a scientific paper.

10
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,020
Then the first question is about obesity and diabetes.

11
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:30,310
So one of the topics that we have discussed here then I came to this call from an evolutionary perspective why rodents,

12
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:42,520
obesity, that they keep increasing. And also with this ongoing war about this by a one, four, four year for this report, go beyond that.

13
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,389
I would also I strongly advise looking in reference,

14
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,970
you can look in to the reference that we use here in the class about you are more than welcome to use more reference.

15
00:01:52,510 --> 00:02:01,629
Also you are using more reference. Please, you will need to cite the reference and also these in for the whole that part of that

16
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:09,250
question is more for you to think about according to what we have to learn here,

17
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,300
what the new approach that you will suggest or you can imagine to try to solve the problem of obesity and type two diabetes.

18
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,510
You can you you can reference any of the topics that we have discussed yet in class and or that we're meant to discuss.

19
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:35,530
Now, the second question is all about your diet and health. Then this is the last topic that we are going to cover in this class value diet.

20
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,820
However, you are more than welcome to read the paper.

21
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,600
Before that, you want to start writing your report.

22
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:54,910
The question is first, what is the theoretical basis or the the potential of postulated beneficial effects of the paleo diet?

23
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,420
Also, what we know about the diet of our ancestors.

24
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:06,160
Please refer to all the paper that we have discussed here about geographical variation and temporal variation,

25
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,370
and also where there was a single Paleolithic diet.

26
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:20,800
Also, I want to go for to to think about these, whether what we call paleo diet right now, what you see in popular,

27
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:29,140
for example, magazines or in the news about paleo diet, whether that is really a Paleolithic diet or not.

28
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,810
And also and then also, what is the evidence regarding health, regarding the paleo diet?

29
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:41,680
What went to this? Got that in the talking when we talk about your diet in our last class.

30
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:50,799
However, again, you can establish in the papers andtheir waist uniform if more for you are going to

31
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:58,450
think about whether this evolutionary approach has any importance in public health.

32
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,270
What we are learning these are feel free to say no.

33
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:12,630
You feel thought that this is a nice topic is very entertaining but doesn't add any value for people to talk to say.

34
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:22,570
But you think that the evolutionary approach a new perspective, a new value to your practice, to your research.

35
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,740
I would like to know that another place are these calls.

36
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:37,360
Then there is no maximum or minimum the length of the report.

37
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:55,649
It's up to these to do you have where I used back at the discussion now that we had up in Hong Kong where I worked short circuit answers but here

38
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:07,230
other one for you to go deeper and also to your reference there are I don't want to suggest any any length because that is at least up to you.

39
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,810
But again, but my interest to devote for you to do a discussion about these topics.

40
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,009
Any questions? I have a question, Professor.

41
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:25,920
When I do this white paper, do I just do the according to the flow, get all these points covered, or do you want me to go like that?

42
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,410
It's up to you. You can put examples of what and what is it?

43
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:41,190
And I'd be with you. And if I do, if I went before you'd talk to Wal-Mart, for example, for the first question to go it these two points.

44
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:53,190
But you can can say for example I got it exactly like A or B it is up so many students in previous classes are like to do a more

45
00:05:53,670 --> 00:06:04,559
instructor answer you don't have any other questions because this some would you say it related exactly some of these have released.

46
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:12,570
So I would probably answer each one of a separate paper and then bring them into the final paper.

47
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,100
Looks like, okay, they are again, you have any question, let me know.

48
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:25,200
Feel free to send me an email, email or you want to discuss in person or words to let me know how we can set up a meeting.

49
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:36,690
Okay. And then today we are going to do our developmental plasticity.

50
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,590
Then first, we need to define what we understand.

51
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:50,910
Like history being like history is basically the physical changes or the development of an organism during his lifetime.

52
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,810
For example, we can think, okay,

53
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,150
what he died first dying of when that landed the organism again in a normal

54
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:07,230
human is reproductive or what is that time when that reproductive life ends?

55
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:20,480
Or when that time when? So if we talk about human, for example, childhood or adolescence and start an end, then that's what we understand.

56
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,140
Half life story, this series of changes of an organism.

57
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:35,490
Now, as you can imagine, natural selection is going to shape the organism like history to optimize survival by reproduction.

58
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:44,120
Remember that from the point of view of natural selection, what is important is that we transmit our genes well.

59
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:52,980
And again, it is thus that natural selection from that point of view.

60
00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:02,370
Now then, how different organisms reach this optimal point vary from a species to species.

61
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:10,050
I went to this goal here, so I wonder if that is. The humans have evolved during our history.

62
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:16,980
Now, also important, these are like history must be responsive to the environmental challenges.

63
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,710
For example, we had this course at new infections. We had this coffee at the starvation.

64
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:35,730
Then somehow, even though our life history is, quote, in our genes, but he has to be flexible enough to respond to those changes.

65
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:43,020
And that is what we call developmental plasticity and also an optimal life.

66
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,560
History must involve balancing of multiple trade off.

67
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:53,700
For example, an organism has to decide I keep growing or I reproduce right now.

68
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,410
How many was pregnant? Going to have a few.

69
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:07,260
A lot. How we are going. What is the optimal interval between one birth and the other?

70
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:17,100
Then that kind of trait of our characteristic feature of the like history that God went to be saved by natural selection and the environment.

71
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,350
Question So far. Now.

72
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:33,890
I think we discussed the fear. I mean, one of our previous classes that we can have, basically we have variations on these two extremes.

73
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,800
But let's say these are the two basic approaches of like stories.

74
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:50,370
First, we are going to have in the in down to your left that figure, number one, more allocation of energy and resources and time to reproduction.

75
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,050
Then we are going to focus on an ideal location to maintain, to grow.

76
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,530
But most of them are going to be to reproduction.

77
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:08,120
Then this type of orphan species, they are going to have a shorter lifespan because most of them are going to reproduce among going to life,

78
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:17,000
or their species can have more allocation of energy or resources,

79
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:24,520
time to maintenance and also to growth and less to reproduction than this type of work.

80
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:28,970
Because they are going to live longer. They are going to take more time to mature.

81
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:36,820
They are going to take more time to reproduce. Even as we know, as in humans, even after reproduction, we are going to spend.

82
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:41,660
I had been able to to raise our kids.

83
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,980
Okay. I already told you about what is our life history of humans here had one or two.

84
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,670
What is most similar to that? Like studying humans to.

85
00:10:53,630 --> 00:11:00,740
To whom we spend more time, we spend a big proportion of our lifetime in maintaining and growth.

86
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,200
Now, how do genes and environment affect that phenotype?

87
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:18,720
And by phenotype, I mean any trait he like history and I want to introduce this this important concept here or react reaction then what genotypes.

88
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,510
What do you. This is how our plant is called Akeelah.

89
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:35,490
These are species. What we have here in the x axis are different clones of different species.

90
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:40,530
These are by clones I mean plant that they are genetically identical.

91
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:55,440
Now we have, for example, clone one long to free up to clone saving and they will grow in different altitudes, low elevation,

92
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:03,690
medium elevation and height elevation, for example, let's say here to the sea level and here to high elevation in the mountains.

93
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:11,610
We measure the height of the plants under the different altitudes.

94
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,560
Then what do you observe here in this field?

95
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:24,600
I know that you said you're going to be the faint, but the yellow is whether you accept that in the future.

96
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:36,150
Just please the high elevation. There are two shoots per plants and the low elevation, the one single shoe, but taller.

97
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,059
Yeah. Any other observation? Okay.

98
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,680
I apologize by the screen, but you can look into your laptop.

99
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:53,640
That would be better. Isn't in the higher elevation is colder.

100
00:12:54,270 --> 00:13:00,690
He could be colder. Less oxygen. Buy more flowers.

101
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:17,520
Let me ask you this question, rather. Is the is there any type of this plan to having any of these clones, clones that had the data highest?

102
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:29,040
Well, if you mean whether these clones from 1 to 70, the highest human toll is good at all is because it's warmer climate.

103
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,810
Who grows periods longer? Yeah. Which one from this?

104
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,440
From 1 to 7 one one. Okay.

105
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:46,050
We see that one, for example, that all is in low elevation and also in high elevation in the middle, however immediate elevation, the tallest.

106
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,780
Then on before the crazy we see some plant, for example.

107
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,800
Number two, we see that we see all of those up tall plant in low elevation,

108
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:05,120
but seem to have rather a medium height, even medium elevation, high elevation.

109
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:10,739
That what I'm trying to show you here is this particular phenotypic trait.

110
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,360
That height with that plant is going to depend both on the gene and the environment.

111
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:23,580
Hmm. And you can see also that again, remember, each of these are known but represent plant with that exactly the same genotype.

112
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:32,460
And we can see here that a same genotype can produce different phenotypes under different environments.

113
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,140
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And this is what we call reaction.

114
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:46,530
Normal genotypes, e.g. no type has a whole ranges of possible phenotypes that can be produced based on that environment.

115
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,940
And then basically and again, this I tried to, to my right that results from the previous figure.

116
00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:01,470
Usually we've and this is the wrong way to think usually.

117
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:09,930
But again we tend to think that we have had genotype when to have only one phenotype.

118
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:18,330
There is that direct line from that phenotype to that from the genotype to the for the genotype to the phenotype.

119
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:29,430
However, what we know is that if we have one genotype, that genotype can produce different phenotypes, a whole ranges of phenotypes.

120
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:36,000
And that will be depends what the environment will depend on.

121
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:43,830
For example, from life, historic events of every life event can depend from interacting with their genes.

122
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:49,560
And this is the right way to think that we have a DNA type that can produce different phenotypes.

123
00:15:50,700 --> 00:16:02,300
Now also, i.e., I say these because is used while in popular media, for example, or you can then use you should look to see, okay,

124
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:11,280
we discovered that gene for these that you for that or that gene for high IQ or that even for I don't know for any trait that you can imagine.

125
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:20,220
But really what we have here, rather than depending on the environment and depending on interaction with other genes,

126
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:29,370
we are going to have a whole range of phenotypes and this is what we call that reaction wrong of that phenotype.

127
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,930
Now, what do you think is the advantage of this?

128
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:42,330
What whether you think this or not, are better to have this type of scenario here, one genotype producing just one phenotype?

129
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,810
Yes. Adaption, not action. Exactly. Any other for.

130
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,270
More varieties. More vitality. Exactly.

131
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:08,490
You can thin let's say this to what went through your scenarios and they're under what conditions.

132
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:17,880
Will be more will be more beneficial to have that first scenario what one genotype leading to one phenotype.

133
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,820
But if you ask, let's assume that these are two different scenarios.

134
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,070
The final one, well, we have one genotype leading to one phenotype.

135
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,610
And the other scenario, we have one you don't type producing a whole ranges of phenotypes.

136
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,180
And what I'd be romantic, this scenario is the first one.

137
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:53,670
This one would be more beneficial, more abundant from a selective point of view where there are advantages,

138
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,540
environments or specific aspects of the environment.

139
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,650
Mm hmm. Maybe if you're closer to the equator, the temperatures aren't bearing as much.

140
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,670
Or if you're in a very flat area. Exactly.

141
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,880
Exactly. We have a more or less complex environment. More or less predict the environment.

142
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,320
Then maybe it is better to have these type of a scenario here.

143
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,640
And this is what we call in genetics, genetic analyzation,

144
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:33,000
because you can imagine also that there are certain phenotypes that they they need to be within a very narrow range of values.

145
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:44,970
Then we need an a strong Canadian or rather and a strong genetic effect to do to respond to environmental challenges.

146
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:51,630
Can we imagine any trait, any phenotypic trait that we need to have in a short range of values?

147
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,950
Thinking in humans, for example, you're talking about specific genes.

148
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:13,920
No, not a trait, but a trait. Like people have very narrow nose for north colder weather and a wider nose for the warmer weather could be a bad thing.

149
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,210
Rather, denial is a lesser trait that there is too much change.

150
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,470
This is a little like, hmm, exactly.

151
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,090
The kitchen. The lot has to be configured in a very specific range.

152
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,219
Glucose in the blood. That is a low threshold.

153
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,700
Now, if we go below that, we can die.

154
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:41,370
Then there are certain traits that need to be highly analyzed.

155
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:50,430
And by highly analyzed, I mean they need to have a very strong genetic component to be has to be consistent,

156
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,270
consistent through ambient mental challenges. Okay.

157
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:01,440
Now, again, this is another way to to look in this in that.

158
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,469
Exactly. We had the environment in the Y axis.

159
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:11,400
We have that phenotype. And you see that we can have certain phenotype that they are highly plastic or highly flexible.

160
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:18,240
That genotype number three, you'll see that in this particular environment has a high value for the phenotype.

161
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:25,580
You can imagine the phenotype, but then we're going to have a low value for under another MM.

162
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,100
Conditions, the genotype number one we rather the contrary.

163
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,060
And genotype number two is rather more or less constant and dependent on movement conditions.

164
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:45,510
Now again the again remember this can depend also for that type of phenotype.

165
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:53,340
If there is a phenotype that has to be get into certain narrow ranges, then we went to this condition.

166
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,420
Because imagine what happened if I what exactly would be in the upload changed.

167
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,760
Hmm. Then is most likely going to be little question so far.

168
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:13,500
Now this has very important consequences for evolution.

169
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:26,970
And this is our arm. This was a novel idea that was proposed to leave my family in the 2000.

170
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,210
What we call phenotypic plasticity. And let me explain to you this.

171
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:43,050
Initially, when we think about natural selection, we think that we have the genetic variation.

172
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:54,360
All different genome types are going to have different phenotypes, and then natural selection is going to select based on phenotypes.

173
00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:07,230
Now that one Darwin advantages, however, what we know now here is how these diamonds represent a genotype with an environment.

174
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:15,030
We have phenotype that imagine that we have an environment that is constant.

175
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:23,850
We have in that in that scenario a but we can have and be romantic if a change in the environment.

176
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:31,980
Imagine, for example when I went on set or they started to eat goat meat that we have achieved,

177
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:45,210
then this genotype is going to respond to the new environment, to the new target, for example, producing adi fitting phenotype.

178
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,330
And we discuss, for example, reasonable friendliness, pressure.

179
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:59,160
Remember the experiment in being mouse when we saw how different diets can produce different human genes.

180
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:12,929
However, after several generations, if the environment is kept constant, then this genotype is going to lose.

181
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,750
The plasticity that you just going to produce.

182
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:25,470
That particular phenotype, even in the actions of the phenotypic signaling, is clear this concept of phenotypic plasticity.

183
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,360
Then the idea is that following that he said, I'm below mentality of change.

184
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:38,370
They are going to produce that is going to produce a change in the phenotype in that right now.

185
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:46,890
So how then that genome adapt to that gene, to that change is going to to produce that new phenotype.

186
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:56,580
But after several generations, that particular phenotype can be produced even in the accent or the environmental segment,

187
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:06,719
because now that that you're not instructed to produce that new phenotype and you see what we call phenotypic plasticity, says professor in graph.

188
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,250
See, the starting point has changed. Yes, exactly.

189
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:18,630
But yet now we have a new environment. But these new these new this genotype, rather,

190
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:27,240
has been adapted to this new environment then is going to produce that same phenotype, even in the accent of the new environment.

191
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:32,519
Now, this is a problem that we have discussed here in class,

192
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:41,730
and we will keep this course of evolutionary mismatch because now these genome type has been adapted to certain environment,

193
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,930
but now we have had these big fast changes in our diet,

194
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:54,510
in our physical activity, our defeating are three environments in the Mother Society,

195
00:24:54,510 --> 00:25:01,800
toxins in the environment, then our genomes on how we adapted to those new to the due to these new challenges.

196
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:09,650
Now then there are two important ones that they one you for you to understand.

197
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:19,880
Firstly, that genetic accumulation. Let's say here we have thank Wang in the past on time to film how in the future.

198
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:35,690
Now know I think commercial refers to the process for which our genomes adapt to ambient mental changes.

199
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:48,200
Then we are going to have over time higher or greater ambient mentally influence due to these ambient mental changes.

200
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,940
And this is what we call genetic accumulation, because somehow that genome is behind the environment,

201
00:25:53,660 --> 00:26:00,410
the environment is changing in the genome is going to adapt to those changes in the environment.

202
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:07,400
The order is generally what we call genetic assimilation, that being.

203
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:22,000
We are going to have greater genetic influence because after many generations, after a long time of ambient mental changes that, you know,

204
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,430
is going to produce the phenotype phenotype trait, even in the accent of the body,

205
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:33,850
the environment is clear to complex genetic accommodation and genetic assimilation.

206
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:47,050
Hmm. Now, this is this is important because are many, maybe some of the chronic diseases that we are seeing right now.

207
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:58,480
Mm hmm. We don't know whether they are example of genetic accommodation, what, you know, going behind or from the environmental challenges, or rather.

208
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,570
Our genome has already been fixed. Is producing these chronic conditions.

209
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,020
They are. These are two important points to try to understand chronic diseases.

210
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,889
Mm hmm. You know, let me give you this example.

211
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:30,340
And this is has to be also with the changes in the in the development of of humans, with our like history in the concept of interaction.

212
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:39,770
Okay. So pull that here. We have original development of this species.

213
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,750
So in these species we have an onset of development.

214
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:55,930
You can imagine that this is an organ or may be different in life stages than we have onset and we have an opposite when and this development.

215
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:08,050
Now we can have different scenarios. You can imagine, for example, that development of this particular organ is going to start rather earlier.

216
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:13,900
Again, remember, this is the ancestral scenario in the past,

217
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:28,749
but we can have some changes during the evolution leading to our earlier onset or the development of this particular organ or beginning,

218
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,200
meaning organ life, if there is any trait that you can imagine.

219
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,170
Now as consequence, we are going to have a longer development for that.

220
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:58,820
Can you imagine anything, any threatening human does that have earlier onset compared to, say, two primates that one that we had these calls or.

221
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:11,780
I think why I went to this cause winning in you York. But yes. Yet.

222
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:19,609
Now, in the second part of that, Gladwell went to winning that enterprise,

223
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:27,800
feeling that in humans these are shorter period and earlier compared to, for example, the chimpanzee.

224
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,820
Oh, well, there's a little bit of feeling.

225
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:41,900
We do need to use this along with you. Oh, yeah.

226
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,739
When I went to this building, humans is ants earlier compared to other primates.

227
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,790
How long do they do? I think it was like a five, seven years.

228
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,210
Oh, my goodness. And you need to consider that they live also.

229
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:59,160
You know, they have a shorter lifespan than humans at one time.

230
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,210
So it's it's shorter for human beings.

231
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:08,490
Yes. But it starts later because we give birth later because we live longer.

232
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:13,080
Right. Yeah, we do a lot better. Exactly. But I mean, that the the exactly.

233
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:23,340
For the baby is okay. Now, here, the another scenario is that rather that we have to delay onset or the particular development,

234
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:29,760
the sponsor will be able to have a short term development. We can have an early onset.

235
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,450
I suppose we have to have a shorter development.

236
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:42,120
Oh, we can have a delay offset with that and are getting this think humans are going to happen to this childhood too.

237
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,920
I'm not not okay about that.

238
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:53,160
To let you know that in humans, if you think that childhood is just particular out of the human lineage,

239
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,720
I think chimpanzee, they don't have cycle to stage.

240
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:07,560
They go from the infant to the juvenile. Huh. But in human evolution, first I see I have a few at the end.

241
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:17,700
But during evolution, childhood is a new stage in that human development has been getting longer and longer during the revolution.

242
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:25,290
Okay. I would say to automation here that we had discussed before in the opening that we can have that

243
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:31,049
same time of for the development but is going to be a deceleration of the whole that will derail,

244
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:35,129
for example, the ultimate. Hmm. Yeah.

245
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:44,220
To be more clear, if they see that different type of interaction, we can have more forces when the adult has a child shape,

246
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:53,010
a bit more forces when that mean beyond shape, whether we have an extra way of administrative work in certain stages.

247
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:58,540
And maybe these are the weekends here. Here. This is the ancestral.

248
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:04,570
I imagine these these are these imaginary species.

249
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:12,100
We have three stages here. This is the ancestor. And you see that the end went to have dialog with the song wins on that song.

250
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:16,360
HORN Here we have this car detail. This is not normal.

251
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,900
They say the ancestor, not the normal, this system.

252
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:38,080
Now, if we have a bit more forces in general, you'll see that the adult is more similar to the juvenile from the ancestor.

253
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,250
You'll see, for example, here in the adult, we had the wings.

254
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:47,109
They are small. We don't have a lot of we have a lot of dots.

255
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:55,209
But they don't they don't know a lot like these. The horns, they are small then they are different way that that came from our interest.

256
00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:05,350
And the opening is one because not only what what means that there is a deceleration the that rate of that growth is a slower.

257
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:22,560
Can you remind me any example of the opening humans. We are at its lowest rate of development of any organic ice.

258
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:33,660
Ice to go a little slower. We have discussed this a lot, putting in the job.

259
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,320
The job. But there is also the brain. The brain.

260
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:41,589
Remember, I will not die. I will brain growth.

261
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:47,159
This law takes more pain. And also that that rate of development is low.

262
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:52,110
Because, remember, the brain needs to have a lot more energy because of their size.

263
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:55,740
They need more time. I mean, four times as long.

264
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,649
Four times the exposure to issues. And then we can have also this other scenario.

265
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:11,420
But are more forces where you see the adult has accelerated it rather goes well beyond the adult shape in the ancestor.

266
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:22,230
You'll see that that cycle the harms that we call the tail more that I can't right now I don't remember any trade in human that can

267
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:34,560
have these let's say like a compared to our ancestors that are by maybe in some other species we can have this type of of of girls.

268
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:44,220
Now boys to consider for our interest first was diet may have led to added of chronic changes.

269
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:49,890
For example, remember that kokumi will facilitate the enlargement of the brain.

270
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:59,100
Then also remember that energy needs for a larger brain will be in part by toning the authentic development.

271
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:06,960
Now remember that we discussed different strategies how to how humans during our evolution get this extra energy.

272
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:14,540
We discuss about the the track getting us more there.

273
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:23,100
Also with this course about walking in two legs that is more efficient for not energetic point of view.

274
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:34,080
Also, we talk about cooperative or that feeling between social groups, but all that important formed all also you just in the authentic development.

275
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:37,050
Our our brain takes more time to develop.

276
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:48,300
Now another important point is the archaic human genomes will need to have required these reaction norms to allow for it run.

277
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:54,270
Now, if this new environment is kept constant long enough.

278
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:05,670
Then genetic analyzation will occur. And this it may be it may be here is clear the what we mean by genetic analyzation that

279
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:17,790
right now any humans can be vegetarian they say not going to eat meat during her life.

280
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:26,430
However, that brain is going to follow the same pattern of the group of any other humans, even in the accident of meat.

281
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:35,880
Because right now our genome is completely analyze to allow for the development of the brain.

282
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:40,770
Is that do you understand this concept, genetic analyzation?

283
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:46,500
Because imagine that in the past what our sister is started to eat more meat,

284
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:54,780
cooking meat that you not have to do some changes to allow for wolves but for for that for the expansion, the brain size.

285
00:36:56,110 --> 00:37:04,379
However, because now we have a thousand generations after that, you know, you remember that five year we started to use fire maybe.

286
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:11,940
I mean, you know, when you talk about the past, I wouldn't say so. Then right now we have that genes to allow for that growth.

287
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,860
Even in axim of meat, we have a complete analyzation.

288
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,780
However, our modern genomes,

289
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:27,060
if you have enough phenotypic plasticity regarding their developmental traits and I think in the in the lecture about reproduction,

290
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,770
we are going to this course may not be for example how I change over time.

291
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:46,100
Okay. You know, we don't have time questions so far. Now here I want to adjust to qualitatively the maybe more molecular.

292
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:46,830
Yeah.

293
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:59,780
To talk about a little bit about the mechanisms of developmental plasticity because remember developmental plasticity, you we go back to the fear.

294
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,480
We have the same genotype. But I said, you don't have to produce different phenotypes.

295
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:15,320
Then what are the what are the mechanisms that are mediating these low whole range of phenotypes?

296
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,639
Because we have that and you know,

297
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:25,720
they then can know be explained by changes in frequencies because we are seeing genotype produce in a whole ranges of phenotypes.

298
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:34,130
Then what are the mechanisms, you know, who are these?

299
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:42,560
Did you watch that movie, Napoleon Dynamite? Okay.

300
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:49,610
You say comedian then? I think the answer is this one.

301
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:57,229
And they say his twin brother. Now, they are not twins.

302
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:04,550
They identical twins. They had nothing. And, you know, even though wheelchairs difference, some sort of difference in the face.

303
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:11,420
Also are we know monotheistic twins.

304
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,560
They are not completely equal regarding phenotype.

305
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:21,080
Now they are not regarding phenotype traits.

306
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,190
They're not identical. Their genome is identical.

307
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:31,400
Their genome. However phenotype. That trait, they are not completely identical.

308
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:40,500
Now from the beginning. I mean, maybe they evolved to be different, but from day one, were they identical?

309
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:47,220
The genome is the same. The genome, the genetic information that was Fino found that they weren't they the same before they.

310
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:55,440
I think even if even if we are, I mean, yet if we are able to follow this even from the very beginning of one section,

311
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:01,830
I think even we can identify difference maybe as bridging levels in.

312
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,800
Exactly. In growth rate.

313
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:15,750
Well, okay, now but then as an adult, if we are, for example, interesting in diseases, we see that they are not completely concordant.

314
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:20,810
Hmm. For example, for mental diseases like a disease or Freema, they are 50%.

315
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,750
I mean, is very high. Mm hmm. It very high. 50%.

316
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,530
Gordon, I think this offering I mean, I know that we in Casualties of Premia,

317
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:33,450
the other half, 50% probability to having multiple schizophrenia is high.

318
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:41,819
But, you know, 100% of these only 60% bipolar disorder, 80, 40% for cancer,

319
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:50,910
metabolic diseases is that it is lower than what is explained of differences between monotheistic twins,

320
00:40:50,910 --> 00:41:00,690
even if they had the same genome, but they are not completely concordant regarding phenotype, then they are differing different mechanisms.

321
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:05,940
One other mechanism that I want to discuss with you are the epigenetic mechanisms.

322
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:15,059
Now what is epigenetic what we understand by epigenetic modifications they are

323
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:20,730
yes heritable changes in the expression without changes in the DNA sequence.

324
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:26,310
Remember, we can have that same DNA sequence. That's a genome, but we can have different levels of genus Brazil.

325
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:38,280
Now, these changes, when you get separation, they can be heritable through mitosis, mitosis from one side to the other.

326
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:47,640
When they go under mitosis in some plant, in plant, even in some animals, there is say within that can be transgenerational,

327
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:56,040
meaning that parents can transmit their epigenetic changes to their offspring inserted in plants.

328
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:02,969
We know that that it occurs in certain animal, but in humans it's still unclear whether that is possible.

329
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:09,720
The transmission of epigenetic modifications now they are different mechanism, the DNA methylation,

330
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:18,540
keystone modifications, micro RNA and the important thing that the environment can produce these modifications.

331
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,850
Again, these are some of these modifications.

332
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:33,839
The DNA methylation can get somatic groups in the fetal seeing the DNA sequence we can have of Keystone modifications.

333
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,270
I don't want to go over this a lot.

334
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:45,680
That's just to know that we had that DNA sequence and we can have chemical communications that are going to affect that the

335
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:56,130
and expression these are in more detail we have societal and metastatic is one of the nucleotides in the DNA sequence.

336
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:01,290
Then we can have the attachment or summative group to that cytosine.

337
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:15,500
Now, what is important with these? Well, we has what we know is that high methylation is associated with recollection, repression or low expression.

338
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:19,290
You know, we have high methylation. We have low expression.

339
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:30,360
We know that also aberrant or problems in DNA methylation are associated with cancer, atherosclerotic disease, mental disorders.

340
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:37,350
And also, I think there is evidence for type two diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and yet help put up theories of all diseases.

341
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:51,640
Now. Also importantly, diet during pregnancy can affect that phenotype of deals.

342
00:43:52,960 --> 00:44:06,580
And you see that the classical experiment of the agouti mice it is a little mouse yellow is obese that is prone to cancer and diabetes.

343
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:12,460
Now there is another variety of this mouse die brown.

344
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:20,680
Brown eating unhealthy. Now, what is interesting, the difference between these two ideas,

345
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:28,360
the aspiration of a gene that is called the agouti king and that expression and that gene

346
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:35,499
is mediated to through changes in mutilation that the gene that in this experiment,

347
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:40,520
let's say we here we have our pregnant mother yellow.

348
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:55,270
If we give the in pregnancy food that is reaching methyl donor groups, then a big part of her offspring is going to be brown and feeding on her.

349
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:05,140
However, if we gave to the mother a few days rather poor methyl donor groups,

350
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:13,510
her offspring is going to be yellow, obese and more prone to cancer and cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

351
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:23,980
Then then they see an example how diet during pregnancy can affect the phenotype of the offspring.

352
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:34,960
Now in humans we know that also that will be the case. The results are different results from different studies.

353
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:40,470
I just wanted to show you here a researcher and a student here in the department.

354
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:51,430
She did her MSC Theses using data from the element this study this study that they recruited mothers during pregnancy.

355
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:58,570
They collected information about diet or mental contaminants or that type of information.

356
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,940
And now they are following their offspring. I think they are speaking out now.

357
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:09,129
They are in the late teens. But here in in this study,

358
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:19,510
what they found is that maternal saturated fat intake during pregnancy and I think this was during the first trimester of pregnancy,

359
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:30,310
was associated with low methylation of certain genes in their offspring up in the teenage years.

360
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:40,420
Then again, remember, this is are they measure intake of saturated fat during pregnancy during the first trimester, first trimester.

361
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:52,620
Yes. And they followed their offspring and then they observed low methylation in that in their offspring after.

362
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:56,259
So that gives because I think these are these kids.

363
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,950
They are now adults at the moment with this blood collection.

364
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:08,470
They were 14 or 15 years old. So, Professor, you're saying the hypo methylation, therefore, is higher expression?

365
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:13,299
Yes, exactly. It will be highest separated by still, I think.

366
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:19,620
Still we don't know which can be highly spread by these hypermethylation.

367
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:22,059
These are studying where these two sites are located.

368
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:29,740
But I think they still need to measure expression of these genes to see what will be the effect, seriously.

369
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,330
But yeah, exactly. That's what just maybe low pressure digits.

370
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,000
Can you just say once again, can we write in high pressure?

371
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:42,520
Forgive me? What I don't remember.

372
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,980
Just twitching. Do you have that on your slides?

373
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:52,000
I think these these are I don't have it here, but I think they are what we call transcription factors that they are.

374
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:57,280
They produce proteins that bind to the DNA and going to regulate expression of other genes.

375
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:05,470
Okay. And also they found mono unsaturated fat.

376
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:12,970
Maternal mono and saturated fat was associated again with hypermethylation in this gene.

377
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:25,270
Mm hmm. Now, again, this showed da da early life environment in during life can have long term effects.

378
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:29,890
Now, I still we don't know the implications of these decisions depending on methylation.

379
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:38,920
We don't know whether this is going to be related to any health outcome, for example, diabetes or obesity.

380
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:44,530
But this team is suggestive that this could be a mediating mechanism.

381
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,540
Now then the idea is down the epigenome.

382
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:57,430
Remember, diaper, you know, he's going to be all this set of chemical modifications in that genome that they are going to respond to.

383
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:04,270
The environment is is a very dynamic entity.

384
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:09,590
However, as we age, you become playful.

385
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:20,890
They damage is going to have a rather mutations somatic mutation leading to diseases, aging, etc.

386
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:31,780
So but now also I wanted to mention to to to mention this study went down in Africa, in Ghana, in Gambia, sorry.

387
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:51,910
In Gambia. They measure again DNA methylation in different genes, in babies that were conceived in differing, uh, different rainy seasons.

388
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:57,190
Rather, we had two different seasons there in Gambia, the dry season and the rainy season.

389
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:07,840
Now, what they found is that depending on what kind of sexual, there were difference oil methylation with 17 genes.

390
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:18,129
Now what that means, we don't know what the integrity that again, some of these genes are related to our immune system.

391
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:21,730
For example, interleukin thing is that inflammatory gene.

392
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:31,680
We had that interesting bit of factor to see how another gene related to insulin that also regulates glucose metabolism is t.

393
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:41,170
We don't know the implication of these, but what is interesting is that they found these epigenetic modifications in different type of cells.

394
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:48,830
Each color here represent different things in the way.

395
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:52,630
Actually, we have materials. They were measure in blood cells.

396
00:50:56,110 --> 00:51:01,180
In the y axis, we have methylation measure in hair follicle cells.

397
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:09,150
Mm hmm. Now, then they did this because these two types of cells, they developed very early due to an abnormality.

398
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:14,710
Life. Hmm. Then back to you. They have similar methylation patterns.

399
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:26,050
Then that means that these effects, they happen very early in life, and they can be present later in life.

400
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:33,339
Mm hmm. Question so far. Now to end on,

401
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:43,000
I think where went to this got this in that second part me so of that how early life environment can be associated with diseases later in life.

402
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:54,770
Why not all the other markers or early life they say, for example, poor nutrition, birth weight.

403
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:03,760
And we know that very low birth weight is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, type two diabetes.

404
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:09,819
We had done when I when I used to work at Boston University,

405
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:14,680
we did see that the studies are looking in that relationship between birth weight and type two diabetes.

406
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:21,700
And we found that the person that were born with low birth weight as an adult have higher risk of type two diabetes.

407
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:37,360
Hmm. Then this maybe can help us to think about another apathy approaches to to try to improve health.

408
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:45,620
Because usually when, when we talk about diseases, we try to intervene in the disease after the symptoms are evident.

409
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:57,230
However, we can think if we think in the genome and the epigenome as a plastic entities and by plastic I mean that they are flexible,

410
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:01,640
they can respond to changes, but that plasticity changes over life.

411
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:06,979
And the older we get that less plastic are these that, you know,

412
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:16,190
I'm not for that but you know there may be some early life interventions can help us to ah to try to reduce the burden of chronic diseases.

413
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:27,470
Question. We actually have learned a lot of this important, important cancer before the break.

414
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:36,160
What is life history, what is developmental plasticity,

415
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:53,910
and how also and how potential molecular mechanisms linking, for example, the environment to phenotypic changes?

416
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:57,460
What would be, for example, DNA methylation? Hmm.

417
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:02,800
Okay, then let's take a five minute break and then we will get back for the second part.

418
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:09,989
To recording went to pause. Yeah.

419
00:54:13,639 --> 00:54:22,099
Maybe people listen to what someone who is doing them all.

420
00:54:23,299 --> 00:54:27,419
Yes. Okay. We are going to continue in the second part time.

421
00:54:27,499 --> 00:54:31,669
For this part, please discuss a question.

422
00:54:32,399 --> 00:54:35,439
Participate. Okay, Alison.

423
00:54:37,099 --> 00:54:45,049
Hi, everyone. So I will give you guys like the pre-warning that I have not taken a genetics class in a very long time.

424
00:54:46,219 --> 00:54:49,519
So bear with me on this. Hopefully I'm not going to get myself confused.

425
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:54,679
So I think I think we can do it. Oh, yes.

426
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:59,509
Okay. Also, this is a very pretty green color. You can't tell, but it is.

427
00:55:01,759 --> 00:55:08,568
Okay. So just kind of reviewing. So life history. It's kind of the way that they choose,

428
00:55:08,569 --> 00:55:15,439
whether whether it's a short lifespan and lots of like offspring or along the lifespan, lifespan and less offspring.

429
00:55:16,339 --> 00:55:23,298
And so just a reminder, so life histories have a lower mortality risk and longer lifespan.

430
00:55:23,299 --> 00:55:28,609
So that's like humans. Less energy is spent on reproduction and more energy is spent on each offspring.

431
00:55:28,609 --> 00:55:36,678
And living a longer life versus like fast life histories have higher mortality risk, shorter lifespans, a lot of births.

432
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:40,429
But the survival rate of those offspring are pretty low,

433
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:48,049
and then a larger fraction of the energy goes towards reproduction rather than life expansion and taking care of the offspring.

434
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:50,959
I don't know. I don't think any of you guys are going to want to see it.

435
00:55:50,959 --> 00:55:57,879
But I started out here that's just like a kind of an example of what that looks like from species to species.

436
00:55:57,889 --> 00:56:02,809
So an oyster is like on the very far end of the fast life histories.

437
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:06,529
So they have 500 million bees being a year.

438
00:56:06,829 --> 00:56:11,148
This is crazy. And then it's like fish and frogs and things like that.

439
00:56:11,149 --> 00:56:18,889
And then as you get as you get further to the right, you have things like large cats, elephants, chimpanzees, apes, that kind of thing.

440
00:56:20,149 --> 00:56:26,628
So we are slow at history, but the weird thing about humans is that we do have a slow life history,

441
00:56:26,629 --> 00:56:31,309
but parts of our history or life history are don't necessarily line up with that.

442
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:40,368
And so we do have like the lower how would you rate the the slow childhood growth, delayed onset of maturity and nutritional independence?

443
00:56:40,369 --> 00:56:46,789
So we're relying on our parents for a long time, but we have more offspring than other primates do.

444
00:56:46,909 --> 00:56:51,859
So in comparison to like chimpanzees and things like that,

445
00:56:52,399 --> 00:57:01,999
we have we can reproduce more often because we have that short time period between like when we give birth and we're able to get pregnant again.

446
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:08,329
Um, so I find it really crazy that we can reproduce almost twice as fast, which is really fast.

447
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:16,129
And despite that fact, we also can still invest heavily in our offspring, which is obviously super important.

448
00:57:16,369 --> 00:57:26,059
And the reason for that is early weaning. So early weaning and our parents, so human infants are weaned from the mother earlier than other primates.

449
00:57:26,059 --> 00:57:32,449
Like we said, like somewhere in the range of 1 to 3 years versus like five years plus for other primates.

450
00:57:33,649 --> 00:57:39,619
And it shortens the entire birth interval, which means like the time for where you have one baby to bear, you get pregnant with another.

451
00:57:41,779 --> 00:57:47,089
And so that's like partially like one thing that I didn't really see mentioned that I thought

452
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:55,279
was interesting is like how much like breastfeeding impacts like the restart of menstruation.

453
00:57:56,569 --> 00:58:03,889
So that's just like, okay, but once weaned, special foods are given, so baby foods.

454
00:58:04,819 --> 00:58:09,049
But the thing about the special foods is that those don't have to be provided by the mother.

455
00:58:09,799 --> 00:58:13,279
So the mother doesn't have to be present for that. She doesn't have to expend energy in producing those.

456
00:58:14,209 --> 00:58:18,409
So that means that grandparents, older siblings, community members, relatives,

457
00:58:18,589 --> 00:58:23,748
all that kind of thing can assist with feeding so that the mother is able to expend

458
00:58:23,749 --> 00:58:29,029
more energy towards reproduction again and less energy towards the specific offspring.

459
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:35,319
Yeah. Any questions so far? Yeah. What?

460
00:58:35,339 --> 00:58:39,918
What do you think? Add to that to a group. Okay.

461
00:58:39,919 --> 00:58:43,639
We had he saw. But can you think of other.

462
00:58:45,969 --> 00:58:49,329
And let me rephrase the question.

463
00:58:52,439 --> 00:58:55,529
Um. Okay. Fair.

464
00:58:55,829 --> 00:59:02,739
What selective advantages can you think about early weaning if you want to go back to their primaries?

465
00:59:03,869 --> 00:59:11,789
What we gain by winning earlier. Started intravenous fluids.

466
00:59:15,799 --> 00:59:21,119
With you actually think? I think they don't have to be around here much.

467
00:59:22,689 --> 00:59:25,869
It's like the other day.

468
00:59:26,169 --> 00:59:33,579
Mm hmm. Yeah. What would be the advantage to a mother that doesn't need to be around the baby yet?

469
00:59:33,819 --> 00:59:37,889
I went. And you see that typo or what connection they want you to make here?

470
00:59:37,899 --> 00:59:44,558
Because then that that then is related to that. There are multiple reasons for that is that motherhood,

471
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:51,249
I think is required to be there without mothers can take care of that with that baby now that from the point of view of

472
00:59:51,249 --> 01:00:01,959
the mother because then the mother can do all that things we imagine as the sexual scientist King gave birth again.

473
01:00:03,009 --> 01:00:09,009
But from the point of view of the baby, uh, what do you think?

474
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:18,088
Winning early. Winning is an advantage from the point of view from debate one day when children

475
01:00:18,089 --> 01:00:22,769
are exposed to different foods and they stimulate different brains development,

476
01:00:23,339 --> 01:00:27,659
so they will start growing their own brains rather than just later.

477
01:00:27,929 --> 01:00:37,499
But that's one year. That could be another reason that may be just maternal, being small enough to support that brain.

478
01:00:38,459 --> 01:00:44,669
Then after that, say, two years. But the extra help that would actually depend on the mom.

479
01:00:45,419 --> 01:00:51,419
If the mom only eat a lesser type of diet, the breast milk produced the same,

480
01:00:51,749 --> 01:00:59,939
and those children will end up not be able to be more diversified in their choices.

481
01:00:59,939 --> 01:01:05,069
Food and thinking too. So is a lot of limitations.

482
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:13,139
So it has a choice. But yet. But I want you to think about because now and maybe that type of myth much that we're having now.

483
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:24,009
But but when we start to move earlier that I would die that mother had that at the time where that was enough to to support the brain growth

484
01:01:24,009 --> 01:01:33,189
with that breathe then rather was required more type of foods more variety to make grandma and babysitter bring different kinds of foods to.

485
01:01:33,479 --> 01:01:44,519
So you could is where my idea for the exposure of the brain the affected language part of the brain as it is also like greater independence.

486
01:01:44,669 --> 01:01:46,769
Mm hmm. Is that, like, part of it, too? Yeah.

487
01:01:46,799 --> 01:02:02,189
We say more independence because our future humans see that we have these are we learn compared to other primates and then the ability to

488
01:02:03,269 --> 01:02:13,259
do we that type of food to be around whether or their individual or even into a word mother which we can imagine different advantages.

489
01:02:16,089 --> 01:02:24,028
So kind of jumping away to jump back in second like timescales of human adaption adaptation.

490
01:02:24,029 --> 01:02:32,749
I mean, so this is kind of a graph showing the different cycles with the different types of adaptations.

491
01:02:32,759 --> 01:02:36,028
So ones that we've mostly been learning about in this class are down here.

492
01:02:36,029 --> 01:02:41,879
So over millions and centuries of years, that's natural selection, genetics, all of that fun stuff.

493
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:51,359
But then as you go in smaller cycle duration, so less and less time of the week changes for better necessary to adapt to.

494
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:56,609
That's where we see kind of this like epigenetic influence.

495
01:02:57,089 --> 01:03:03,298
So in this like years and decades area is kind of where the different developmental plasticity comes.

496
01:03:03,299 --> 01:03:06,539
And so that's why we see like generational changes.

497
01:03:07,499 --> 01:03:11,549
And so relating it back to a lot of what we talked about in pathophysiology,

498
01:03:12,749 --> 01:03:19,679
this is like when whenever we refer to the like change in diet that we see across a couple of decades,

499
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:26,939
that's like what's happening is this developmental plasticity is occurring and then in these shorter amounts of times, like days,

500
01:03:26,939 --> 01:03:34,109
hours, seconds, that's just homeostatic control, such as like your body maintaining blood sugar levels and things like that.

501
01:03:35,669 --> 01:03:37,708
Yeah, you get that.

502
01:03:37,709 --> 01:03:46,979
That's important to remember because these are the you remember we plasmon we do that visual changes, somatic frequency can make times,

503
01:03:47,879 --> 01:03:53,278
but our genome needs to be able to respond to mental changes in that,

504
01:03:53,279 --> 01:03:59,129
you know if you're individual enough you would use even in in these days today then that important developmental.

505
01:04:01,229 --> 01:04:11,669
Yeah. So no I think that you know, the definition of phenotypic plasticity again is just this is like one of the ones from our papers.

506
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:19,739
And the ability of an organism to react to an internal external environmental input with the change in form state movement or rate of activity.

507
01:04:21,209 --> 01:04:29,639
So it's really just that like in between time adaptation, so they all have the same genotype, but then they result in different phenotypes.

508
01:04:31,469 --> 01:04:35,009
So one thing that I like was struggling to understand,

509
01:04:35,009 --> 01:04:41,459
so I added it in here so that hopefully it helps you guys understand is that the evolution in this case is the ability to be elastic,

510
01:04:42,089 --> 01:04:47,219
to like have that plasticity. And so it's because humans have that ability.

511
01:04:47,399 --> 01:04:52,979
It like that is the technical longer term advantage kind of thing.

512
01:04:53,429 --> 01:05:02,878
And then this is just like a very like straightforward like show of what plasticity does and what its advantages are.

513
01:05:02,879 --> 01:05:11,219
So if they all have the same here, but then there's a, there's a change in the environment, changing weather or whatever.

514
01:05:12,509 --> 01:05:22,249
The ones that are more plastic are able to adapt more quickly without needing the, like, generational change of like.

515
01:05:23,699 --> 01:05:26,069
That's what I'm trying to think of. Yeah. Not that good.

516
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:40,859
And also I yes, I think once we have this idea about when we decide that it's not exactly what, you know what we should buy that.

517
01:05:42,659 --> 01:05:48,719
But when we have to decide, do I want to know a lot of everything or.

518
01:05:49,469 --> 01:05:56,699
Or I rather I want to not. I go to just one thing, you know, then what is the best strategy?

519
01:05:57,209 --> 01:06:01,319
Then we can think that we want to be plastic.

520
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:04,859
Maybe you better to have to know about everything.

521
01:06:05,339 --> 01:06:08,878
Maybe thinking, for example, enumerating job opportunities.

522
01:06:08,879 --> 01:06:13,919
You're not like with everything. Maybe you can move this way of this way when things change,

523
01:06:14,819 --> 01:06:19,618
but maybe in some cases it's better to not a lot of just one point because maybe

524
01:06:19,619 --> 01:06:25,829
that's just going to give you a bunch of value or their views in particular feel.

525
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:35,069
Then I think of the urbanism they have these like what choices do do they are able to, let's say,

526
01:06:35,069 --> 01:06:43,819
eat the availability of foods or they just personalizing, eating a particular type of food then depending on the environment.

527
01:06:43,819 --> 01:06:47,449
So and if that then you can be better than older. Yeah.

528
01:06:47,699 --> 01:06:53,489
I feel like and it also depends on what kind of life history they have because they have those faster life histories,

529
01:06:53,489 --> 01:06:58,318
then genetically they're able to change fast enough to keep up with an environmental change.

530
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:04,239
So plasticity isn't quite as necessary as like longer term systems.

531
01:07:05,459 --> 01:07:12,539
So then developmental plasticity is like a subset of that is irreversible, which is an important part too.

532
01:07:13,859 --> 01:07:19,198
So irreversible modifications to growth and development. It's a way to adapt to something in that middle of the timescale.

533
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:25,769
So something that's not able to be controlled homeostasis like by homeostasis or by evolution.

534
01:07:26,429 --> 01:07:31,528
And then it's from those gene environment interactions that we talked about.

535
01:07:31,529 --> 01:07:36,809
So I'm going to mention this again in a second, but things like the histone modification and things like that.

536
01:07:37,949 --> 01:07:42,629
So these I thought were interesting. So these are different guys which are like really concerned.

537
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:47,639
Yeah. But based on the temperature at which they were born or.

538
01:07:49,019 --> 01:07:52,209
Yeah, yeah. Pretty different temperature. Yeah.

539
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:58,769
They vary in size. So that's like they all have the same genotype, but depending on when they're born,

540
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:04,289
what season they're born into and like the location of that, they're, they vary in size.

541
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:12,729
So same genotype, different phenotype than the in my, my, my grandmother used to look at me.

542
01:08:12,729 --> 01:08:22,539
I remember when deciding when to plant that the Nazis thought that they would move the moon.

543
01:08:23,459 --> 01:08:26,559
Yeah. Did they believe that, do they not. Absolutely.

544
01:08:27,249 --> 01:08:34,408
I remember my grandmother that in my mind they say, look, you want to, for example, to have nice roses,

545
01:08:34,409 --> 01:08:41,439
you need to plant it even though they made it with a yeah, yeah, yeah blues about those.

546
01:08:41,519 --> 01:08:46,888
And then I don't know whether it's if you think about but I went well I when you put that you'll use

547
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:54,119
down that in organism we know that middle mental factors can affect you they affect you better.

548
01:08:54,689 --> 01:09:00,359
Sure. We saw the example of Vietnam. This flag, the temperature is going to affect size.

549
01:09:00,749 --> 01:09:03,849
I think it is. It's crazy that they adapt that quickly.

550
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:08,339
So then a developmental mismatch is kind of what we're experiencing now.

551
01:09:08,339 --> 01:09:15,179
So it's when the phenotype does not match with the environment. And so like we talked about, that's a it's a permanent change or modification.

552
01:09:15,809 --> 01:09:23,399
And when you have developmental plasticity and so if you experience one environment during like

553
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:29,519
intrauterine development and then the environment in which you are born into doesn't match that,

554
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:36,359
that's where that disconnect starts to happen. And it can also happen like along the road in life.

555
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:45,598
So if you're born into this like more difficult to find food situation, I mean that's like how you develop.

556
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:52,079
But then later in life, like midlife, you move to an area that has like a higher availability of food.

557
01:09:52,889 --> 01:10:01,288
We can also see the changes start to happen when or if you start to see the

558
01:10:01,289 --> 01:10:03,929
environment during development differs from the environment that is current.

559
01:10:03,959 --> 01:10:10,889
One really good example of this that we've talked about in like half of our classes probably at this point is the Dutch famine.

560
01:10:11,719 --> 01:10:14,389
And what happened there. So just as a reminder of the Dutch famine,

561
01:10:15,289 --> 01:10:24,289
mothers were experiencing famine at various points of their pregnancy and based on the trimester that they experienced.

562
01:10:24,289 --> 01:10:26,899
The famine influenced the baby differently.

563
01:10:26,899 --> 01:10:32,869
And so we do know that the first trimester tends to be the most influential, at least in this case it wasn't.

564
01:10:33,499 --> 01:10:36,569
So then we have a and ears.

565
01:10:36,639 --> 01:10:40,999
So an AI is an immediate adaptive response. So that's based on survival alone.

566
01:10:40,999 --> 01:10:47,449
So that's a very severe environmental change. So something like a famine and that leads to something like reduced fetal growth.

567
01:10:48,199 --> 01:10:54,049
That's like really just like the mother's body, like trying to survive and keep the fetus alive.

568
01:10:54,709 --> 01:11:03,169
And then papers are predicated of adaptive responses are not necessarily immediate survival like mechanisms.

569
01:11:03,169 --> 01:11:11,059
So it's not absolutely necessary. But there would be a fitness advantage from that adaptation later in life.

570
01:11:12,949 --> 01:11:16,489
So this depends on correct anticipate environment after birth.

571
01:11:16,489 --> 01:11:21,589
And so what that means is that that intrauterine environment does match up with the environment

572
01:11:21,589 --> 01:11:27,708
in which you are raised and grow up because that mismatch is kind of what happens here.

573
01:11:27,709 --> 01:11:35,779
So basically the body predicts, based off of its own experiences, what the future for the fetus is going to be.

574
01:11:37,369 --> 01:11:43,189
And if that prediction is not correct, then that's where we start to see this mismatch.

575
01:11:43,189 --> 01:11:54,799
And so for situations like the one that really came to mind was just like mothers with eating disorders who are restricting food,

576
01:11:56,239 --> 01:12:02,149
the fetus is getting at, receiving the information that is going to be birthed into a situation with low food availability.

577
01:12:02,449 --> 01:12:11,069
And so it can do things like lead to reduced fetal growth and then that can kind of lead to other people being blessed.

578
01:12:12,499 --> 01:12:20,989
And then these are usually been always associated with each other, usually like an irate i, i r happens first and then a PR kind of follows.

579
01:12:22,339 --> 01:12:29,749
So this is a good example because I keep doing that because I got a little lost when I was trying to figure this out.

580
01:12:30,529 --> 01:12:37,189
So an infant born with fetal growth restriction due to placenta dysfunction or like inadequate nutrition during pregnancy,

581
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:44,748
things like that, maybe insulin hypersensitive and then develop insulin resistance at the age of 2 to 3 as a R, right?

582
01:12:44,749 --> 01:12:48,949
So it's like R is the immediate like survival mode.

583
01:12:49,219 --> 01:12:56,149
Like we don't have enough food, so we're going to decrease the fetal growth and insulin hypersensitivity sensitivity and resistance.

584
01:12:56,149 --> 01:13:05,109
It's kind of as a result of that. So then plasticity and the human like story, kind of how all of this comes together.

585
01:13:05,499 --> 01:13:09,009
So we talked about DOE had a lot and other classes as well.

586
01:13:09,639 --> 01:13:14,499
I feel like I'm kind of repeating some of our lectures of the developmental origins of health and disease.

587
01:13:15,609 --> 01:13:20,859
So we know the first 2000 days is considered very important, and that includes the time during intrauterine growth.

588
01:13:22,179 --> 01:13:28,208
And so kind of like a timeline of what this might look like is a mother has poor nutrition intake and then the

589
01:13:28,209 --> 01:13:33,549
baby receives signals that is going to be born into a harsh environment because the mother's body is saying,

590
01:13:33,939 --> 01:13:35,378
hey, this is what we have available.

591
01:13:35,379 --> 01:13:43,179
Even if it's not accurate that we have that that's what's available, but that's what's being that's the feedback that's being given to the baby.

592
01:13:43,449 --> 01:13:47,329
Does that make sense? Yeah. And then the baby is born.

593
01:13:47,349 --> 01:13:53,849
Adaptations to try to help survive the expected harsh conditions, even if those harsh conditions are actually reduced.

594
01:13:53,989 --> 01:14:01,478
And so adaptations are usually like low body weight and then usually with like poor nutrient intake,

595
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:05,989
they're adapted to a low diet, low in carbohydrates and fat and higher in protein.

596
01:14:06,669 --> 01:14:12,729
But then if you're born into like a Western diet culture, you're going to have to try that high in calories and fat.

597
01:14:13,369 --> 01:14:18,159
So that's kind of where we start to see issues with like chronic disease later in life.

598
01:14:19,719 --> 01:14:25,839
Yeah, it's very interesting because you can imagine down the block, these people,

599
01:14:25,839 --> 01:14:35,399
they think of their epigenome or our metabolism in general is changing over time except for, you know, when you had a blast,

600
01:14:35,419 --> 01:14:46,619
did you see that the background with that theory and that people's is going to interest you in this sequence but you can we somehow can can

601
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:58,959
because the problem he's down with my view is that there is a moment with the the the beginning or the metabolism is no longer plastic.

602
01:14:59,619 --> 01:15:12,199
Then there is a mismatch. Then we think how can one we can extend the period of plasticity to allow for a better match to the environment.

603
01:15:12,219 --> 01:15:18,669
I don't know whether people are researching that, but thinking these are the type of material that we discuss.

604
01:15:19,029 --> 01:15:23,529
We believe what we said, the area of onset of a particular development.

605
01:15:23,799 --> 01:15:30,459
It was on how we can extend the plastic period to allow for for one version.

606
01:15:31,539 --> 01:15:36,759
After what example? How do you think like what would the science look like there?

607
01:15:36,759 --> 01:15:46,119
Like do you have any ideas? If we think about it, begin ethically, we can reverse somewhat epigenetic changes.

608
01:15:49,059 --> 01:16:00,849
If we think also about insulin sensitivity, what are the insulin sensitivity?

609
01:16:00,849 --> 01:16:09,248
Depends so many factors. One, for example, how many is we can risk that we have in the cells if we can modulate the number of insulin receptor.

610
01:16:09,249 --> 01:16:12,579
But they would be like an extended period of plasticity.

611
01:16:12,669 --> 01:16:17,798
Okay, to allow for because the problem that we have this short period of plasticity and

612
01:16:17,799 --> 01:16:21,969
then after that we got to have that mishmash because you had already program here.

613
01:16:22,419 --> 01:16:32,669
But what happens if we extend that these. So that would be like by preventing as much as like drive or DNA somehow,

614
01:16:32,689 --> 01:16:38,709
which is I feel that I lead from and I see this it that type of wait on for due to thing

615
01:16:38,919 --> 01:16:44,709
using this approach of this idea maybe is not feasible it may be is practically impossible.

616
01:16:44,839 --> 01:16:58,959
You know maybe it's unethical. Yeah but by saying that is in a hypothetical scenario that we can then we can add new interventions.

617
01:16:59,559 --> 01:17:05,349
I was I actually was kind of like looking linking this to what you mentioned earlier about twin studies.

618
01:17:05,469 --> 01:17:12,878
Mm hmm. Like, how can we use twin studies as a way to compare, like, what's genetic versus what's not?

619
01:17:12,879 --> 01:17:17,259
If we know that, like, epigenetics influences it so much.

620
01:17:18,099 --> 01:17:29,558
Yeah, the idea that a lot of twins started because twins, many thing they had known Gene about.

621
01:17:29,559 --> 01:17:34,028
So they they share intrauterine environment and there is a huge I mean,

622
01:17:34,029 --> 01:17:43,769
with the component that they also which are also firing the arrow raising that saying how full they tend to adapt in clothes.

623
01:17:44,299 --> 01:17:49,719
Yeah that's a boys that's a like a three very share.

624
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:53,169
Mm hmm. I get that a lot of is like that to disentangle.

625
01:17:53,499 --> 01:17:59,109
Yeah. As I say like especially the ones that use like twins that lived together versus twins that are.

626
01:18:00,299 --> 01:18:06,119
I like that option. I think this really makes that a lot more complicated in my head than it originally was.

627
01:18:08,369 --> 01:18:13,709
All right. I'm going through this way faster than I thought I was going to to bear with me.

628
01:18:14,909 --> 01:18:21,479
Okay. So maternal and child nutrition can lead to size in adulthood because of those adaptations.

629
01:18:22,219 --> 01:18:29,079
So that's a lot of what we've learned about in terms of the genetic components of weight and things like that in popovers.

630
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:40,779
And then another thing to kind of like relate it to is in the conversation that we've been having lately about Samoa and that the mismatch though,

631
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:46,019
like change in body size that's happening there could be due to a mismatch because the food environment

632
01:18:46,349 --> 01:18:50,909
is different than the food environment that they were raised to expect their body was raised to expect.

633
01:18:52,409 --> 01:18:56,189
And then another thing that's sensitive to nutrient availability is the maturation timing.

634
01:18:56,189 --> 01:19:01,168
And so this is kind of where it all comes together in terms of like how this

635
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:09,238
plasticity can affect the human life history in that the changes in like maturation,

636
01:19:09,239 --> 01:19:11,939
timing and size,

637
01:19:11,939 --> 01:19:22,978
all of that stuff like can be influenced by like the previous generation because of environments in which the intrauterine environment,

638
01:19:22,979 --> 01:19:30,239
in childhood environments, if that exists. And then one thing that I found interesting was males are more sensitive to

639
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:34,919
environmental changes like this than females are likely because of body size,

640
01:19:34,919 --> 01:19:42,298
but they're not actually sure. And so what that means is like if like a male born to a mother that had experienced

641
01:19:42,299 --> 01:19:45,269
famine versus a female that was born to a mother that experienced famine,

642
01:19:45,329 --> 01:19:52,859
the males may have like a larger difference in body size than females do, which I thought was really interesting.

643
01:19:52,889 --> 01:19:57,449
You know, Kyra, I didn't know about that.

644
01:19:58,169 --> 01:20:17,749
But my more sensitive. You mean the the say the least, these example, the maturation timing is more sensitive to when life signals.

645
01:20:17,759 --> 01:20:24,419
Yeah. Mm hmm. Yeah. Like the changes tend to be more drastic for males and females.

646
01:20:24,929 --> 01:20:34,559
Mm hmm. Yeah, I really want to discussing that in that class about human reproduction, how age and may not can change over time.

647
01:20:34,739 --> 01:20:38,249
Mm hmm. But that is in females.

648
01:20:38,249 --> 01:20:45,779
But we cannot see anything about males to see whether there is any response about that, because they a lot of it is, like,

649
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:50,038
hard to compare males versus females in conversations like this just because

650
01:20:50,039 --> 01:20:55,939
there's no like good way to like detect maturation for males unlike females.

651
01:20:56,599 --> 01:21:03,419
Um, and then changes in reproductive scheduling from extrinsic mortality cues in childhood can also occur.

652
01:21:04,529 --> 01:21:13,289
And so like being raised in a high stress environment or experiencing a famine, experiencing low food insecurity,

653
01:21:13,379 --> 01:21:18,948
low food security, things like that can change the scheduling of reproduction.

654
01:21:18,949 --> 01:21:23,819
And so it can either push reproduction back or bring it forward. I think it brings it for a lot of the time.

655
01:21:23,819 --> 01:21:27,509
Like more stress tends to make you have offspring sooner.

656
01:21:28,199 --> 01:21:33,449
Um, and then interestingly enough, it also can lead to less investment in offspring.

657
01:21:33,929 --> 01:21:39,118
And I don't know if that's like I'd assume that's at least partially like psychological,

658
01:21:39,119 --> 01:21:46,198
but it seems to like maybe have a physiological component to it as well in that like a more stressed

659
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:52,589
child will pay less attention and less and offer less investment into their future offspring.

660
01:21:53,539 --> 01:21:56,919
Um, it could be a psychological component.

661
01:21:57,839 --> 01:22:07,209
Yeah, well, one that's ah, good that you mention that because that they're funding through the ocean to the animal adoption.

662
01:22:07,469 --> 01:22:08,639
What are the factors.

663
01:22:09,299 --> 01:22:20,759
And again, thing we've got now in Mother Society, we have seen that increasing HIV in Asia have been decreasing in the last maybe century.

664
01:22:22,589 --> 01:22:28,048
Now something that is are something that normal, however,

665
01:22:28,049 --> 01:22:35,038
that is say within Dutch does suggest that rather we're going back to the let's say to our ancestral

666
01:22:35,039 --> 01:22:43,679
estate is that they say within that Neolithic I wouldn't say that age of menarche is was younger that

667
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:53,698
were during the start of agriculture or society with the farm means infection diseases that you dealt

668
01:22:53,699 --> 01:22:59,059
with rather than was the age menarche was increasing for allow for more time for migration because of.

669
01:22:59,489 --> 01:23:07,859
These poor, more creative. But now that we are more fluid, affluent societies are being left is going to be left to the UN system.

670
01:23:08,309 --> 01:23:16,319
Yeah, I don't think I completely understand why that would happen because like so if we're affluent,

671
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:23,789
like why does it develop like in terms of like producing offspring?

672
01:23:24,149 --> 01:23:32,218
Why would it make sense to decrease or to get be younger that I in the upcoming society.

673
01:23:32,219 --> 01:23:46,319
Yeah yeah because people tell me you saw in this frenzy trying to get the point of view then are the the the organism is receiving the signal.

674
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:50,399
Okay that is enough food is going to be more food in the future. There is that revolution now.

675
01:23:51,449 --> 01:23:56,489
Okay. I the then we don't need to spend a lot of time growing people.

676
01:23:56,549 --> 01:24:06,538
We have that sort of right now, even if we have poor nutritional conditions, then that's, you know, will be okay.

677
01:24:06,539 --> 01:24:09,629
We need to do wait. Now we have a time. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

678
01:24:09,659 --> 01:24:13,889
Now for a billion people, most likely or going to die or your offspring is going to die.

679
01:24:14,489 --> 01:24:27,299
Now, how? Where, where? If enough food and society is all for the iPhone five production, that can delay?

680
01:24:27,749 --> 01:24:31,829
I mean, we went to this contact with marketing human reproduction.

681
01:24:32,049 --> 01:24:35,969
Okay. But yeah, but what is interesting is that that you things and again,

682
01:24:35,969 --> 01:24:43,859
you see hypothetical and there are some discussion going on but there are some researchers that suggest that are decrease

683
01:24:43,859 --> 01:24:50,399
or may not be that we had also been right now is yeah I would be going back to the UN system is an interesting.

684
01:24:52,679 --> 01:25:01,048
Yeah. So then this like quote I feel like kind of help to sum up where I'm going with this,

685
01:25:01,049 --> 01:25:08,339
which is overwhelming importance of environmental and developmental plasticity as a source of contemporary human life history variation.

686
01:25:09,659 --> 01:25:21,509
So basically things that we experience environmentally that we respond to because of our ability to like have or because of our ability to be plastic.

687
01:25:21,769 --> 01:25:30,298
Plastic. This affects the human life history and what that looks like and is probably one of the reasons

688
01:25:30,299 --> 01:25:36,869
that we have such a weird human life history instead of like a classic slow life history.

689
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:42,479
Yeah. So then human life history is a result of phenotypic plasticity.

690
01:25:42,839 --> 01:25:45,958
So changes in food, environment, things like that.

691
01:25:45,959 --> 01:25:56,699
Because I think it's also interesting because I feel like this could be different the longer like as we like, as life expectancy has increased.

692
01:25:57,299 --> 01:26:08,489
So I wonder like how using studies from previous like human communities affects like how that affects does that make sense?

693
01:26:08,689 --> 01:26:12,089
You mean how informative they are. Yeah.

694
01:26:12,809 --> 01:26:17,759
Like how applicable they are to now with such a longer life expectancy years.

695
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:23,189
Yet what we know is that life expectancy has been increasing.

696
01:26:23,619 --> 01:26:27,139
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

697
01:26:27,629 --> 01:26:33,509
For example, right now they've been in Western Europe is about two years advance.

698
01:26:33,659 --> 01:26:39,839
The US is a little bit lower. Um, but the maximum is seen.

699
01:26:39,839 --> 01:26:42,549
That is in Scotland. Mm hmm. Okay. Yeah.

700
01:26:42,599 --> 01:26:48,269
You can imagine, for example, a belt or for this in our model or things like that, the, the average not being moving.

701
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:52,559
Right. The average. Yeah, but the, the objective. You mean the same.

702
01:26:52,859 --> 01:27:06,148
Okay. Yeah. And then I have this other put in here in my note and it's novel phenotypes were first generated by behaviorally or environmentally

703
01:27:06,149 --> 01:27:12,519
driven plasticity and related clip gradually stabilized into species defining traits through genetic accommodation.

704
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:20,399
And so that's kind of what we were talking about, where it's like the phenotype happened and eventually the genotype kind of catches up with it.

705
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:26,669
Yeah. And that is. Oh, I have a thank you with my resources.

706
01:27:28,829 --> 01:27:31,978
Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Alison.

707
01:27:31,979 --> 01:27:43,859
That was great. Before we leave, I just want to just to recap summarize what we discussed today.

708
01:27:51,309 --> 01:27:57,639
You have these these as allies in combat. You want them to look into it after this.

709
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:03,699
We're going to discuss more these in.

710
01:28:08,599 --> 01:28:12,769
Because these are some of the topics that we have been discussing and they are all out there.

711
01:28:12,769 --> 01:28:18,349
They are interrelated. These are some of the characteristics of human life history that we discuss.

712
01:28:18,649 --> 01:28:24,829
But what I want you for you to try to make all these connections are the different

713
01:28:24,829 --> 01:28:32,359
factors that have contributed to our our current history that are achieved.

714
01:28:32,869 --> 01:28:37,309
Cook meat consumption most likely that contribute to this background, that brain size.

715
01:28:38,359 --> 01:28:42,709
Brain size imply that we're going to have more complex welfare groups.

716
01:28:42,949 --> 01:28:48,769
We have language now. We have we're able to write to transmit knowledge to to we're able to transmit knowledge

717
01:28:48,769 --> 01:28:55,209
to even to a generation that we're not going to to meat through to books and to our.

718
01:28:56,389 --> 01:29:05,479
Now, because of that extended learning process, then most likely that is why we have these extended childhood in humans.

719
01:29:06,349 --> 01:29:13,129
Although I will wait. Maybe this is another topic that I will make for the following next years.

720
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:20,869
We have been talking about domestication, what animals, how we have shaped the evolution, for example, of that dog.

721
01:29:21,799 --> 01:29:28,439
But also I think. Okay, but how does no mitigation of dogs that shape up already what we show up.

722
01:29:28,699 --> 01:29:39,229
Let me explain you because we we use dogs as a companion healing.

723
01:29:39,409 --> 01:29:45,019
Yes. Like a heating. You can imagine in the past how that was affecting, for example,

724
01:29:45,379 --> 01:29:54,399
the psychological mental development of our kids, for example, how that affects our social structure.

725
01:29:54,409 --> 01:29:56,609
Then that maybe that will be a topic that I will in.

726
01:29:56,629 --> 01:30:07,069
I will I'm putting them next to you, because this have to be the entirety of how the domestication of animals also affected our own evolution.

727
01:30:07,879 --> 01:30:15,909
And the people like to go to the dog club when the dogs are running and the people are socializing is also healing for them.

728
01:30:15,949 --> 01:30:20,159
And we are going to discuss these in the Human Reproduction Club,

729
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:32,118
but this is what I mentioned before that if things and we know because we had data about that the age menarche had been decreasing that are centuries

730
01:30:32,119 --> 01:30:37,309
maybe are however many things that in the past and again I want to make the

731
01:30:37,309 --> 01:30:42,319
limitation of these data are based on this political remains bonds remains.

732
01:30:42,889 --> 01:30:52,399
But if in the Asia menarche at the beginning of the agriculture period was rather younger than we are right now,

733
01:30:53,329 --> 01:31:03,798
are now the degrees of Asian menarche that we are being observed in the last maybe half and half a half century and a half in the

734
01:31:03,799 --> 01:31:10,669
past is our specie is going back to the ancestral state where went to this country because this is a very interesting topic,

735
01:31:11,569 --> 01:31:16,219
especially if they want people to be more be more like vegans.

736
01:31:17,149 --> 01:31:20,489
There's so many issues against meat eating right now.

737
01:31:21,499 --> 01:31:28,968
So we eventually we have to go back to the beginning of the questions, this comment, I was like, okay, thank you.

738
01:31:28,969 --> 01:31:34,369
I listen, that was great. And then I think next Monday we're going to discuss about sleep.

739
01:31:35,419 --> 01:31:38,629
Please read the papers. That's a new topic, is it?

740
01:31:38,659 --> 01:31:45,739
And if you had any topic that I including these what did you sleep then are then I have also to learn together with you.

741
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:50,028
All right. I'll see you next Monday. I'll see you.

742
01:31:50,029 --> 01:31:53,419
Afternoon. I will. I will. Both homework later today.

743
01:31:54,169 --> 01:31:57,379
I have like homework and also paper.

744
01:31:57,649 --> 01:32:01,669
The final paper. You just start working on that now, okay?
