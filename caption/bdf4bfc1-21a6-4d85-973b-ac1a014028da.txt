00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:13,629
First, we'll do a very brief recap, summarizing why we randomized and randomized controlled trials.

2
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:19,629
Then we will introduce methods of randomization, methods of blinding and introduce the concepts of superiority,

3
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:29,629
not inferiority and equivalence and randomized controlled trials. So as a brief recap, as we discussed in part one of this session,

4
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:33,629
randomization attempts to equalize differences between treatment and control or placebo

5
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:39,629
groups with respect to known and unknown risk factors for the outcome of interest.

6
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:46,629
In other words, we want the treatment group and the control group to be exchangeable with one another on all characteristics,

7
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:50,629
with the exception of their treatment versus control receipt.

8
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:57,629
This means that the only differences that are observed between the treatment and control group on factors such as age,

9
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:04,629
sex or any other characteristics should be due to random error.

10
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,629
So how do we achieve randomization?

11
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:16,629
Well, generally, the most common way of achieving randomization is through using a simple random number generator to assign participants to a group.

12
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:20,629
There are other methods, and this is really straightforward. A simple coin toss.

13
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:26,629
If you want to have a 50/50 allocation to a treatment group versus a control group or the roll of the dice.

14
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:32,629
For example. What I just described to you is simple randomization.

15
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:35,629
There are other methods of randomization as well,

16
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:43,629
which I've listed here and now I'm not listing these because I want you to memorize them or learn every aspect of the details about them.

17
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:52,629
I don't want you to do this. Please don't memorize this or get into really crazy depth on the details of these different types of randomization.

18
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:57,629
The reason that I'm showing them here is I want you to be familiar with these methods of randomization.

19
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:05,629
If you read about them in the literature and to have a brief idea of what they actually mean and situations in which we use them.

20
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:10,629
So in addition to simply randomization, there is also block randomization.

21
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:14,629
And so we would often do this if we have multiple arms in a trial.

22
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:19,629
So in the examples given so far, we have a treatment group and a control group.

23
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:25,629
That is what is referred to as a two armed trial. But sometimes we may have three arms and a trial or four arms and a trial.

24
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:28,629
If we are comparing multiple treatments, for example,

25
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:34,629
and we use block randomization to keep the numbers of participants and all study groups as close as possible.

26
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:42,629
So in addition to having similar distributions of covariates or characteristics across people in the different arms of a trial,

27
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:48,629
we want to have a similar number of people in all arms of a trial usually.

28
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:55,629
So in block randomization, we create blocks of sequences. An example here, if participants are being allocated to three arms,

29
00:02:55,629 --> 00:03:01,629
the investigators may create six blocks and then randomly select a number to determine which block to use.

30
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:09,629
Again, we don't need to get into depth about this, but this is just a method that is used when we have multiple trial arms.

31
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:16,629
Another approach to randomization is stratified randomization. This is useful in trials that have a small sample size in order to improves

32
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:21,629
to his tical power and reduce the chance or reduce the likelihood of chance.

33
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:28,629
Non-exchange ability. So recall from part one of this session that when there is a small sample size in a trial,

34
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:34,629
we are increasingly likely to have chance imbalance in participant characteristics across trial arms.

35
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:38,629
This is also referred to as chance confounding or chance non-exchange ability.

36
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:40,629
And we don't want this to happen.

37
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:48,629
So we may then use a small number of baseline variables and conduct a stratified randomization, which looks like this.

38
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:52,629
So in this example, we have 1000 patients enrolled into an RC T,

39
00:03:52,629 --> 00:04:04,629
which has two arms and we want to stratify by sex and by age to ensure that sex and age have definitely equal distributions across the two trial arms.

40
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:14,629
So here the investigators have stratified by sex into males and females and then within each category for sex they have stratified by age.

41
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:19,629
So according to whatever definition they would like to use to define young versus old,

42
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:24,629
they have then stratified age within levels of sex and then they have performed the randomization

43
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:29,629
within each of these four subgroups that are defined by combinations of age and sex.

44
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:37,629
And this ensures that age and sex are equally distributed or balanced across the trial arms.

45
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:42,629
The next is weighted randomization. This is also referred to as unequal randomization.

46
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:47,629
And we use it when investigators do not form. Sorry, you do not wish to form equal groups.

47
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:52,629
So, so far, up until this point, we're assuming a 50/50 randomization.

48
00:04:52,629 --> 00:05:01,629
A given individual who is enrolled into an RC T has equal likelihood of being part of the trial arm or sorry, the treatment arm or the control arm.

49
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:06,629
But sometimes we don't wish to do 50 50 randomization. We may wish, for example,

50
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:12,629
to do a 60 40 randomization or a 70 30 randomization with respect to the probability that a

51
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:18,629
given individual enrolled into the study ends up in the treatment arm versus the control arm.

52
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:21,629
And there's a few reasons why we may wish to do this.

53
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:27,629
So, for example, if investigators wish to expose fewer participants to an experimental treatment,

54
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:32,629
sometimes this happens in very early phase trials when the safety is unclear.

55
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:38,629
We may do a weighted randomization where there is a lower likelihood of being assigned to the treatment arm.

56
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:48,629
We may also do this one study. Treatments are especially costly and we may wish to enroll fewer participants into the treatment arm of the trial.

57
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:54,629
And finally, adaptive randomization, and this occurs when the probability of being assigned to a group varies with covariates.

58
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:59,629
And so only the first assignment is truly random and often adaptive.

59
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:01,629
Randomization is done iteratively over time.

60
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:12,629
So, for example, if an individual's treatment group assignment changes on the basis of level of comorbidities, for example.

61
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:18,629
And pseudo randomization. OK, this is the final one. So this is the use of nonrandom methods to assign participants to study groups.

62
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:25,629
And so often this is done through using the birth year of the participant, the day of the week that they present to the clinic.

63
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:33,629
The number of the clinic or hospital records. This would be a non randomized controlled trial when pseudo randomization is used.

64
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:39,629
It can be effective in producing well-balanced groups. But there is still the risk of the knowledge of which group that are the participant

65
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:44,629
will be assigned to could influence whether the investigator enrolls the participants.

66
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:49,629
So, for example, the investigator knows which day of the week an individual presents to the

67
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:54,629
clinic is going to result in which trial arm they the participant ends up in.

68
00:06:54,629 --> 00:07:03,629
And so this is why pure, a straightforward randomization is always preferable to pseudo random or non random methods of trial participation.

69
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:09,891
But there are situations in which true randomization is not possible. And so this would be considered the next best thing.

70
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:15,946
You may have heard the phrases single blind trial or a double blind trial in the literature on randomized controlled trials.

71
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:24,946
And what this refers to is the level of knowledge that parties involved in the trial have about which group the participants have been assigned to.

72
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:32,946
There are basically four levels of blinding going from completely open to triple blind or even quadruple blind.

73
00:07:32,946 --> 00:07:36,946
So let's go through very briefly what each of these mean in an open trial.

74
00:07:36,946 --> 00:07:42,946
All groups, which are namely the investigator, the participants and the analysts know what group the participants were assigned to.

75
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:46,946
So in an open trial, there is no blinding.

76
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:55,946
The next level is a single blind trial where one group, which is often the participants, does not know what group the participants were assigned to.

77
00:07:55,946 --> 00:07:59,946
The next does a double blind trial, which is the one you may hear about the most often.

78
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:04,946
And this is where two groups do not know what group the participants were assigned to.

79
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:07,946
And these groups are often the participant and the analyst.

80
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:12,946
It can be difficult to blind the investigators since they are the ones conducting the trial.

81
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:15,946
And the next level of blinding, which is the highest level of blinding,

82
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:21,946
typically is a triple blinded trial whereby three groups do not know what group the participants were assigned to.

83
00:08:21,946 --> 00:08:28,946
And these would be all three of the investigators, participants and analysts.

84
00:08:28,946 --> 00:08:35,946
And finally, I just want to introduce you to these types of testing that can be done in a randomized controlled trial,

85
00:08:35,946 --> 00:08:40,946
and namely these are superiority, non inferiority and equivalence trials.

86
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:44,946
And they refer to the type of comparison that the investigator wishes to make

87
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:50,946
about the nature of the effect of the treatment on the outcome under study.

88
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:59,946
So in a superiority trial, the aim is to test that experimental treatment is better than the standard or control treatment,

89
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:07,946
and the aim here is to detect a clinically meaningful difference that rather than a simple, statistically significant difference.

90
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:10,946
So we want to make a we want to make a difference on the outcome.

91
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:16,946
That is of a magnitude that is considered to be clinically meaningful for our part, for our patients outcomes.

92
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:19,946
The next is a non inferiority trial,

93
00:09:19,946 --> 00:09:27,946
which aims to test that the experimental treatment is not clinically worse than the standard treatment by a predetermined margin,

94
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:37,946
which we will indicate. Using the symbol Delta and this predetermined margin would be of the magnitude that we consider to be clinically meaningful.

95
00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:42,946
An equivalent trial is used to demonstrate equivalence between two treatments.

96
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:52,946
So where we want to demonstrate that an experimental treatment has an equivalent effect on the outcome as the standard treatment.

97
00:09:52,946 --> 00:09:58,946
Both non inferiority and equivalence trials are useful when we already do have an existing treatment,

98
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:06,946
but we want to test and compare a new treatment which may be easier to use, has fewer side effects or is less costly than the existing treatment.

99
00:10:06,946 --> 00:10:16,946
And so there is a benefit for this treatment, which is maybe not necessarily about the magnitude of its effect on the outcome.

100
00:10:16,946 --> 00:10:20,946
And when we test hypotheses and ask t's the way that we set up our hypothesis and these

101
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:26,946
statistical power that is necessary differs based on whether we are conducting a superiority,

102
00:10:26,946 --> 00:10:31,946
non inferiority or equivalence trial. So what we do for all three of them, however,

103
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:36,946
is we set a margin of difference that we'd like to observe between the experimental treatment

104
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:41,946
and the standard treatment based on a margin that is considered to be clinically meaningful.

105
00:10:41,946 --> 00:10:49,946
With respect to the outcome that is under study. Visually, here's what this looks like on the x axis.

106
00:10:49,946 --> 00:10:58,946
We have the magnitude of treatment difference, so zero would indicate no difference in the experimental treatment and the standard treatment.

107
00:10:58,946 --> 00:11:08,946
And then Delta goes from a range of negative delta to positive Delta, whereby Delta is the margin for equivalence or non inferiority.

108
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:12,946
So negative Delta is in the direction where the treatment is better and positive.

109
00:11:12,946 --> 00:11:20,946
Delta is in the treatment where the control is better. And then we show superiority, non inferiority and equivalence.

110
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:24,946
And what we're trying to do with each of these three types of comparisons.

111
00:11:24,946 --> 00:11:35,946
So in a superiority trial, if we we would want to observe a difference associated with the treatment of negative Delta.

112
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,946
That is not consistent with the null or zero.

113
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:45,946
And so the blue dashed line would indicate the magnitude of difference on the outcome associated with the treatment.

114
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:50,946
And the Arab bar indicates the 95 percent confidence interval in this example.

115
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:57,946
The ninety five percent confidence confidence interval does not include the null or no effect,

116
00:11:57,946 --> 00:12:04,946
which would indicate superiority of the treatment over the standard or control treatment.

117
00:12:04,946 --> 00:12:08,946
The middle bar shows what non inferiority looks like.

118
00:12:08,946 --> 00:12:19,946
And so we have a magnitude of difference that lies in between zero, which is the null and negative delta, which would be superiority of the treatment.

119
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:24,946
But the 95 percent confidence intervals, as you can see, are not consistent with positive Delta,

120
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:30,946
which would indicate that the control is better, meaning that the treatment would be worse.

121
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:37,946
So in order to demonstrate non inferiority, we would hope to see a magnitude of effect and the 95 percent confidence interval.

122
00:12:37,946 --> 00:12:41,946
That does not include positive Delta within its bounds.

123
00:12:41,946 --> 00:12:44,946
And then finally, where equivalence is demonstrated,

124
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:51,946
we observe a treatment difference which is very close to the null and the range or bounds of the 95 percent confidence interval.

125
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:57,946
Do not include either negative delta, which would indicate superiority or positive delta.

126
00:12:57,946 --> 00:13:07,946
Which would indicate inferiority of the treatment. And that's it for part two, part three focuses on the conduct of intervention trials, or RCD,

127
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:14,646
and is in the line of Zoome session that takes place on September, September 22nd, beginning at ten, thirty a.m.
