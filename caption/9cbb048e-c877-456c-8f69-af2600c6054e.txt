1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,820
I've been trying to find it. Now.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,540
Oh, really? Okay. Good morning.

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:26,410
All right. So hopefully, once the recorded lectures, I rewatched them.

4
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:34,450
I mean, they're tough, too. I was like watching. I'm like, oh, my gosh, I need to like, I don't know, it's a little dry.

5
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,889
So I know that those are a little tough listening to me go over these slides,

6
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,640
but it's helpful to have that background so that we can spend a little bit more

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,890
time in class doing like some case studies as opposed to like just all lecturing.

8
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:55,000
So hopefully that's okay. Not every session will have as many videos to watch ahead of time.

9
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:02,680
But today we're going to talk more about like the mentee involved with this facial GERD and peptic

10
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,260
ulcer disease and then work through a case study and try to apply some of the MCP process as well.

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,360
So has anybody ever does anybody work in the hospital by chance?

12
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:22,629
In like the call center. There's always a number of students that do that.

13
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:31,810
So you guys are probably familiar with orders. Couple of years ago, we transitioned to this international dysphagia diet.

14
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:41,260
It's like a standardized initiative. So this is just kind of showing where what we used to do in terms of diet orders.

15
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,030
And now essentially what it should be, is that how it is in the hospital?

16
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:55,690
So what the seven seven regular actually does have some limitations at the hospital is just like a plate, right?

17
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,620
Yeah, I think that's the only thing. Okay. Yeah.

18
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,780
So, you know, this isn't as applicable now because two years ago when we were there,

19
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,819
right when we were teaching this session, they were in the middle of transition.

20
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,200
So but you still may see some of these different levels referred to.

21
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:25,850
Yes. Right.

22
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,830
That's like putting like and sometimes it's called like something.

23
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,130
That's essentially my understanding is like no liquids.

24
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:51,270
It's more have. I think it would be hard to.

25
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,720
Can things like fluids to that level with commercial paper.

26
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:05,760
So that would be like severe dysplasia where they even any consistency wouldn't work for them.

27
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:16,209
So what? Sure if that level does well, it could be a whole host of things.

28
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:22,960
So people that have some type of neurological insult, like maybe a stroke,

29
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:36,450
any type of neurological insult that affects the nervous system can in fact like damage to the nerves that affect swallowing,

30
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:43,690
essentially, even if it's like in the brainstem, but that it can be more peripheral in terms of the the nerves that affect swallowing.

31
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,700
So sometimes it's called stroke.

32
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:55,030
Um, sometimes folks have head, neck cancer where there's like tumor burden in the esophagus that can significantly affect swallowing.

33
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,370
It kind of depends on where their decision is happening.

34
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:07,540
It can happen in the oral pharyngeal phase or more proximal to the mouth, or it can be lower in the esophagus.

35
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,640
There's a condition called appellation. Has anybody heard of this?

36
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,610
Probably not. But what it is, is it's just a narrowing of the esophagus.

37
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:23,899
So if we are going to include a like an X-ray or a radiography of Achilles, but we see that a lot in the hospital,

38
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,390
it's just that the esophagus as it gets toward the stomach is very narrow.

39
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:40,180
So like food can move down, but then it just stops. Usually when there is an issue with liquids, the concern is for aspiration that they can't.

40
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,980
And we'll look at a video. So it might be more in this world.

41
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,570
They're happy for the damage incurred, and it could be due to a variety of things.

42
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,729
There are some progressive illnesses and there's Parkinson's, those types of things,

43
00:04:53,730 --> 00:05:00,299
scleroderma that can affect muscle contraction in esophagus or in the oropharynx.

44
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,720
So that can also be a reason why people have dysphagia. Okay.

45
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:12,790
So we'll take a look at some of the diet education. I know today's campus page had so many things posted,

46
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:20,860
but that's just kind of for your reference because a lot of times we do provide some diet education to patients in the hospital.

47
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:29,860
And whenever possible, we try to standardize education materials from the nutrition care manual, which is by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

48
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:41,680
Okay. So I'm not going to go into this too much. The reason we have transitioned to this more international standardization process is because.

49
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,110
We want it to translate in any environment.

50
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,259
So if you look at these tools or these resources,

51
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:59,450
you'll see that there's a way to measure if the the food or the liquid is correct, regardless of what type of utensils people use.

52
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:07,320
So there is like a fork test, there is a chopstick test. Different countries are cultures may be more likely to eat with their hands.

53
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,430
There's a test for to make sure you have the right consistency with just your hands.

54
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:21,290
So it really should be able to be applied to any region of the world, any type of cultural food practices.

55
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,710
That was the whole goal so that it could be highly applicable in any setting.

56
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:31,229
So if you're if you're interested in any of that, you can look at the different information they have,

57
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:36,750
how to measure if the food is at the right consistency depending on your ordered level of dysphagia.

58
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:45,130
Okay. So why is there a different prescription for food in liquids?

59
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:56,160
Usually when a diet order is put in for dysphagia, we'll have the solid food diet water levels consistently and then a separate order for liquids.

60
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:12,930
We know why we might do that. Yeah.

61
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,899
There. They may have different needs.

62
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:24,770
So some patients may not be safe for any level of like we're kind of like we just talked about they have to be on very second period food.

63
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:33,130
Some people may be on a caring diet where their actual solid foods have to be blended off with no lumps or chunks that they can tolerate thin liquid.

64
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:38,280
So it's highly variable. Some people only ask for liquid.

65
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:45,810
Some only ask different consistency as a food. So they you will see those ordered separately because everybody's pretty individual at that.

66
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:53,430
Okay. What do you guys think? Will the patient always have to be on this phase of nutrition therapy?

67
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,480
Right. Many people over time will advance to regular eating.

68
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,170
Remember, dysphagia is not like a disease. It's more of a symptom.

69
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,430
And it can improve over time for some, for many people.

70
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,760
Some situations that may be more of a permanent situation,

71
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:25,720
but it's not just because they're on a period level diet immediately post-stroke doesn't mean they're going to be on that forever.

72
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,700
A lot of times that the muscle contraction and all of that can get a lot better.

73
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,930
Okay. So let's talk about how the spatial is identified.

74
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,470
If dysphagia is suspected, we usually have a swallowing evaluation order.

75
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:52,270
So sometimes this can be done at the bedside. Usually this is done by a speech and language pathologist.

76
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,980
So if you see in my notes somewhere, it says F, l, p or two, s, l, p.

77
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:03,530
That's the speech pathologist. And that is the person that most often is going to do this quality evaluation.

78
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:11,320
Sometimes they can do it at the bedside. Most often, though, they will do it with what we call a.

79
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:22,070
SS This is a video fluoroscopy swallow study where they're going to have the patient, the patient's going to drink some what we call barium,

80
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:30,079
just so that the swallowing mechanism will kind of light up as they look at it on their video, and then they'll have them try different consistencies.

81
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,900
And we'll see an example of that.

82
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:43,469
So if a patient comes in and we're suspecting dysphagia, they can either tell us that they're having difficulty swallowing foods.

83
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:49,110
They feel like they're choking on foods. Things are difficult to swallow, or they have regurgitation.

84
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:57,720
Or if they come in with frequent aspiration pneumonia, that could be a sign that they're having some dysphagia and some swallowing dysfunction.

85
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,270
And then they'll usually go for a swallow study. So let's take a look.

86
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:11,000
Some examples of what this might look like. And I would tell you. If you go on.

87
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:23,650
Pause it for a second. Try and try and get as many opportunities to see other procedures that may affect your nutrition plan.

88
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,620
So like when I was an intern, I got to watch some swallow studies and it was just kind of like,

89
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,960
Oh, the dietitian I was working with was like, Do you want to go watch this patients the sets?

90
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:42,280
Yeah, definitely. Like trying to seek out those opportunities if they're not offered to you try and like feeding tube placements.

91
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,329
I think this is really helpful to watch any of those things in the hospital.

92
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,440
They're happening all the time. So I would say really seek those out.

93
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,570
Even though we're not directly involved with these, it does affect how we care for patients.

94
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:30,889
Let's take a look at this. Okay.

95
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,850
So that's like a normal swallowing study.

96
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,110
Then liquids going down pretty smoothly. You can see that none of it's really rotating.

97
00:11:40,550 --> 00:12:21,160
And then we'll take a look at a different example. Okay.

98
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:28,080
So that's hard to watch. See how difficult that is to get the thin liquids down.

99
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:34,080
You can see some protein with maybe the epiglottis not closing all the way and then it's going to stay in the esophagus.

100
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:43,149
So really uncomfortable for people you could imagine. And it's potentially not safe if if the epiglottis isn't closing in,

101
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:49,330
there is some fluid or food material that's going down the trachea and into the lung.

102
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:55,780
That's where we can get aspiration. And that can be very dangerous, especially in our older population.

103
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,750
Okay. So let's take a look at some of the education materials I provided.

104
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:15,090
Was a couple of years where I was able to bring in examples of the peri diet and thickened liquids for you guys to try.

105
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:20,339
Haven't really done that since COVID, but you know,

106
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:26,219
I think it's also good to try these things that our patients are going to have to eat in the hospital.

107
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:32,600
They really do their best. But. You know, this is it's not always easy to.

108
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,950
Get enough nutrition just because it might not be super appealing.

109
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:45,209
Plus, it may be uncomfortable still to eat, even if they're on appropriate diet and especially the kids liquids.

110
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:53,310
In my experience, working with patients that require taking liquids, very difficult to get them to take enough for hydration purposes.

111
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:58,200
It's just kind of yeah, I wish I had the question.

112
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,350
Why is it thick and water? It's just it's.

113
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:07,830
Think of like a honey consistency of water. It's really not super appealing.

114
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:16,560
So dehydration is a big problem. When when are some of our older patients are on these restrictive diets that require especially thick liquids.

115
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:28,190
Okay. Let's take a look at this from right. Okay.

116
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,720
So you see all these handouts down here.

117
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:39,650
What these are these are, again, client education from the nutrition care manual, which is part of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

118
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,530
You guys will have access to that as interns. I don't think you have access to it now.

119
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:50,520
You have to have like level two hospital access. Well, let's take a look at what this might look like.

120
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,940
So let's say a patient's going home. They have to go home on a pure diet.

121
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:05,280
This might be something we would give them, just as kind of like some survival skills before they leave the hospital.

122
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,299
And sometimes we get, like, 10 minutes or you get a page like patient is just charging.

123
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,890
They need education on a period diet. And you go up there and you talk to them and.

124
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,770
But on all of these handouts, this first section here that has like the TIPS section.

125
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:30,040
These are kind of equate to like our interventions on our for our care plan.

126
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:37,090
Like you can take some of these that might be pertinent to your diagnosis or smart goals,

127
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:43,920
and then these could be kind of like some of your interventions. So think of that is as more of like the specific intervention section.

128
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:55,390
Some things important to know, like is is if the patient is prepared to be able to handle this type of diet at home.

129
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,030
There's been a number of times I've had to go up, you know, again,

130
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:04,460
getting the page like they're being discharged on a period diet and they don't even own the blender.

131
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:10,129
You know, like this is important to know that if they're going to be able to actually do this

132
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,630
at home because everything needs to be blended ups and with no one third chance.

133
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,070
So this can help give them some tips on how to do it.

134
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,920
You know, what exactly the kind of goes back to group and what what would have to be done.

135
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,260
This is pretty straightforward because it is pureed,

136
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:36,770
but you can see some of these are a little bit more complex when you get into like minced food for millimeters by four.

137
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:40,849
Mm. I mean that's kind of hard to visualize.

138
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,210
That's why some of those like fork tests might be more applicable.

139
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:48,860
But it tells you like if you pushed her fork through it, what does that look like?

140
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,610
So just like take a look at these and just make sure you kind of have to review them

141
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,390
a little bit to get an idea of what these different levels of diet might consist of.

142
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:23,620
Okay. Let's go back to our case. So we had this patient and a couple of case studies now.

143
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:30,700
So this was our ROV feeding case study. So MH is a 73 year old nursing home resident.

144
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:39,100
She had a history of a cerebrovascular accident, which is just a stroke approximately four months prior to admission resulting in dysplasia.

145
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:43,420
She's been on a diet with thickened liquids since that time.

146
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:48,730
Her medical history has included hypertension, atrial fibrillation and asthma.

147
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:53,770
She was admitted to the hospital with fever, aspiration, pneumonia and dehydration.

148
00:17:54,550 --> 00:18:01,570
She was made NPO so nothing by mouth. And she was on those IV fluids containing 5% dextrose.

149
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:10,760
She had a modified barium swallow, which is essentially that video swallow study, very similar.

150
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,200
And that showed that she was had aspiration at any consistency.

151
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:22,760
So that's when the nasogastric feeding tube was placed in and trophy's were started according to standard protocol.

152
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,450
We know she had lost weight. We were worried about feeding.

153
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,950
And we talked about that when we started the the actual nutrition.

154
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:38,569
So now she's about ten days. She's been in the ICU for ten days and she was activated.

155
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:44,780
So she's off the ventilator. Her electrolytes are stable and she remains on these two feedings.

156
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:54,830
She went for another swallow study and was cleared by the speech and language pathologist for a level four diet with level one liquids,

157
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:03,090
so slightly thickened liquids. So the Ardi is we consulted because now she's going to be able to eat and she's so antique beings.

158
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:13,220
So her two fittings are held with the initial initiation of an oral diet and a calorie count in order to assess if the feeding tube can be removed.

159
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,379
So this may be a situation where a calorie count could be appropriate because we really need

160
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:24,920
to know if she's able to eat enough from the oral diet before we take out the feeding tube.

161
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:31,060
Or else we're going to be in trouble again, where she's going to potentially go backwards with her nutritional status.

162
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:41,250
So if you're trying to determine if removal or placement of a feeding tube is warranted, that could be when a calorie count could be very helpful.

163
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:50,700
Okay. So here's her calorie count data. Day one, this is just what she's taking in orally.

164
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:58,620
She took in about 800 calories, 40 grams of protein, and you can see about 620 miles of fluid.

165
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,200
Day two, she did better. She had 11, around 1100 calories and a little bit more protein.

166
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:12,180
And we know that her family was there that day. And then day three, she's at 513 calories and 26 grams of protein.

167
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:21,490
So here's your current weight 57.5 kilograms, and you go up to talk to her and she reports that she does have a poor appetite,

168
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,299
doesn't feel hungry, doesn't like the taste of the period.

169
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,500
Foods says the period foods do not have a lot of taste.

170
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:35,170
And she prefers the colder foods in the foods compared to the period vegetables and meats.

171
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,450
She does not like drinking. The thickened liquids in her mouth feels dry.

172
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,080
So this is the information we have based on our kind of reassessment.

173
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:51,820
We talk to the patient, see what's going on, and we have this calorie count and anthropometric data.

174
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:03,940
Okay. So I want you to think about what would your first step be in terms of before you write your nutrition diagnosis?

175
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,960
What are you going to do first? Like, what would be a good first step here?

176
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,850
Then I want you to write a nutrition diagnosis or a statement for this patient.

177
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:19,690
And then we're going to write a smart goal and at least two interventions into monitoring and evaluation goals.

178
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,370
So this is a lot to consider. We'll take some time.

179
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:32,150
We'll take about 15 minutes or so and just think about how you would approach this patient.

180
00:21:32,170 --> 00:22:17,360
Now that we have all this data available. You can work together if you want.

181
00:22:40,630 --> 00:23:08,540
Oh. I don't know about you, but.

182
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:58,290
Burger King.

183
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:54,590
Yeah. But.

184
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:52,100
I don't it? I mean, I think.

185
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:06,820
For the time part. We are.

186
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:33,000
I'll be worried about. Four months earlier.

187
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,810
She was. I don't want.

188
00:26:51,110 --> 00:28:50,860
It doesn't. And due to.

189
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:19,640
Absolutely. Oh, yeah.

190
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,840
Take about five more minutes. I know it's not a lot of time, but just get through as much of this is you can.

191
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:22,310
This like. There's.

192
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:48,240
Yeah, they might. Really?

193
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:54,260
Yeah. So I think your partners are in the same. Got.

194
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:08,160
Day. Yeah. And.

195
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,970
And I would encourage that. That would be first that. My.

196
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:41,410
Yeah. I.

197
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:52,460
Good nutrition education on how to make other whole foods that you likes or.

198
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:03,020
We have this large intervention.

199
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:11,740
She was discharged. Yeah. Okay, let's talk this out.

200
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:16,250
I heard a lot of really good thought processes over on this side.

201
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:25,540
So much quieter over here. Okay, so you have this information, um, as you go up for your reassessment,

202
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,890
what's the first thing you would do if you got back to your office and were ready to put in, like, a journal for this patient?

203
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:40,560
We have her calorie count data. It seems inadequate, but how do we know for sure?

204
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:43,590
What would be the first thing you do before you write a diagnosis?

205
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,850
This to be that, you need to see how much she's actually taking.

206
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,649
Yeah, exactly. We would estimate her calorie needs, her protein needs, her fluid needs.

207
00:34:52,650 --> 00:35:01,620
So it's like we first need to know how much does she actually need and then how does her intake compare to what she we assess her.

208
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,960
So I would go down, estimate her energy needs protein for me.

209
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,500
I would take an average from that three day calorie count.

210
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:17,810
We always average it out to get like a snapshot of their overall intake and we'll see how it compares to what we think she needs.

211
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,430
So let's take a look at that.

212
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:31,980
Now you could do different methods for this, but let's say she needs around here somewhere in the range of 1400 to 1600 calories,

213
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:39,300
70 to 80 grams of protein, and then about 2060 miles per day.

214
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:48,370
We average out those three days for her calorie count. She had an average of 815 calories, 39 grams of protein.

215
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,560
609 milliliters a day.

216
00:35:53,980 --> 00:36:01,960
So now we have some some really helpful information in order to write diagnoses, interventions and keep an eye on what we need to monitor.

217
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:09,730
So what did you guys come up with for a PSA statement or a diagnosis for this patient?

218
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:24,570
Yes. What encourages you to identify for?

219
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:38,480
Yeah. So that would work, right? She has an moral intake based on what she told us from the assessment and that we know that she isn't eating as well.

220
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:46,280
What else could you do there? What else what other diagnosis could you do that maybe would have a little bit more specific information?

221
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:59,650
Yes. Inadequate. I've been trying for all the time, disinterested and very tired.

222
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:08,380
Approximately 60% of us. Yeah.

223
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:16,209
So because we have the calorie count data, which is essentially a direct estimate, it's all an estimate,

224
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:22,900
but an estimate of her what she's taking in in terms of energy, we could use that inadequate energy intake.

225
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:28,479
And now this was not meant to be tricky, but remember what I said.

226
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,610
If malnutrition is present, you have to do much to identify that.

227
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:45,969
And I would say this let's go over this line of thinking. So so when I say malnutrition, severe related to inadequate protein energy intake.

228
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:49,990
So that could be the etiology why she's malnourished, she's not taking in enough.

229
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:58,189
Poor appetite, swallowing difficulty as well, because evidenced by we do have that 11 and a half percent weight loss over four months,

230
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,590
even though she's been in the ICU and we've been feeding her through a feeding tube.

231
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,820
She still, I'd say, would qualify as an operation.

232
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:10,700
She has a history of this major current dropping significantly less than 6% of.

233
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:19,850
So this diagnosis, if present, will always trump an intake diagnosis.

234
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,040
This will just kind of encapsulate all of that. And then a lot of times I use the intake portion as the allergy.

235
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,899
I think you could also do so.

236
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:39,330
If you do military, if your patient is malnourished, you don't then have to do an inadequate intake diagnosis really because this captures it.

237
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,170
But there might be other things going on that you could identify.

238
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:50,460
I think specifically what we just talked about, the patient being on can liquids not drinking a lot,

239
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:57,030
not liking that they can liquids reporting having a dry mouth which is a sign of dehydration.

240
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,720
I think we could also diagnose inadequate fluid intake here.

241
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:08,760
And I would say that's related to dysphagia within liquids, dislike of thickened liquids as evidenced by patient consuming.

242
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,820
On average, only 30% of estimated fluid needs by mouth.

243
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,959
Plenty of other diagnoses we could use.

244
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:28,530
But I would just try to whenever you see somebody has had some weight loss, they're not eating well, go to that malnutrition diagnosis sheet and see.

245
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:35,130
Don't try and make them meet the criteria. But if the criteria is there, we do want to diagnose that.

246
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:45,570
Does anybody have questions on that kind of process for calculating what she actually needs?

247
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:52,620
How does her current intake compare to what she's taking in? And that would kind of be the basis for how we we pick a diagnosis.

248
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:57,990
Yes, it's going to be a lot more.

249
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:07,790
Yeah. Could everybody hear that. Yes, I think that might come up in the the intervention part.

250
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:14,060
Yeah, that's important. I heard some of you picking that out, like she's doing much better when her family's there.

251
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:20,040
So maybe there's, like, a social motivation. Okay.

252
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:27,269
So the nutrition prescription, again, you guys don't have to do this, but we'll give examples just overall for this patient.

253
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:33,810
What do we want? I want her enteral nutrition and her oral diet to meet 100% of her nutritional needs.

254
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,960
So the biggest goal is that we want her nutritional needs met.

255
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,750
So maybe it's a combination of these things until we know she can eat adequately or on her own.

256
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:53,160
Smart call. So smart is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time bound.

257
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:58,560
So those are the think of that acronym in terms of how you want to set up your goal.

258
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:07,049
I wouldn't expect you to have a goal like this, but what we're going to do is you don't have to have this first part.

259
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:14,670
But I would recommend transitioning for her enteral nutrition to a nocturnal infusion and decrease the

260
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:21,460
total calories provided by her nutrition by at least a quarter until her oral intake is adequate.

261
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:30,330
So they have turned off her enteral feeds, which sometimes can be helpful because patients are less full and maybe their appetite improves.

262
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:38,820
But she is malnourished. She's not eating enough yet, so I don't think we should totally stop her to feedings in this instance.

263
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:44,730
We can just run them overnight and leave her off them during the day so that she can eat other meals.

264
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:51,459
And then we'll kind of follow that intricate as needed. Okay.

265
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:57,460
So let's talk about some interventions. These are some headings I pulled from our intervention terminology sheet.

266
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,170
Remember, these have to come from serialized language from those sheets, but then everything right after them is going to be in your own words.

267
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:09,970
So these might be really variable depending on what you have for the patient.

268
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:19,400
So in terms of meals and snacks, we know she's on a period level for quiet with mild liquids per se.

269
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:24,830
Few recommendations. I always like to write what they have been ordered or prescribed to, so it's in my notes.

270
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:31,500
And that way when I go for my assessment, I know what they were before because it might be a little bit difficult to ascertain that.

271
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:37,300
So we know she told us that the foods that she does prefer.

272
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:42,189
So maybe we can optimize the nutrition in those foods that she actually does like.

273
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:47,290
So we could encourage mixing the fruits with something.

274
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:49,179
They contain some some protein.

275
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:58,030
So maybe smooth for over for a period of time stays in order to increase the calorie and protein content of those foods that she does like.

276
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:01,549
And then other ways to optimize calories.

277
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:08,500
We can use whipped cream, cream cheese, sour cream, all these things that are similar that could be wanted in both as well.

278
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:15,350
If you get some preferences on some things that she might like, that would also increase calories.

279
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:19,880
Now, sometimes we have to be careful with things like ice cream on a peri diet.

280
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:28,730
Usually I think it's whatever it is and when it's melted at room temperature is,

281
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:33,350
if that's appropriate for the liquid level, then that's going to be okay, I think.

282
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:38,120
Ice cream. I don't know. I think that counts as a semi thickened liquid.

283
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,720
It's not like considered a thin liquid. It's a bit. Is it there?

284
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:47,260
Yeah. Okay. Like a magic cup when amounts of pudding then that.

285
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,839
Okay. So there you see, that's why it's so helpful.

286
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:57,620
You guys know so much more. So there maybe it's a specific ice cream that could be said that if it were to melt, it would still be safe.

287
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:04,670
But own it is considered a. All right.

288
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:08,869
I think we'll be close to another threat. As always, we have to use these sparingly,

289
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:18,980
but it might be appropriate for this patient to do another calorie count at some point before he'd pull out the feeding tube once they take that out.

290
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,549
The medical team is highly resistant to putting it back in.

291
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:28,500
So we really want to make sure that the patient is in a good place, that they're off nutrition before we start.

292
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:36,959
Before that. We can do some like nutritional supplements between the meals.

293
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,130
We'll talk to the patient and see maybe what they'd be interested in trying.

294
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:54,140
We do rely on these a lot in the hospital. And the reason is because it is a way to get some good calories and protein in between meals.

295
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:57,450
So liquids will empty the stomach faster than solids.

296
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:01,799
So we're hopeful that if we can get a good amount of calories in between meals,

297
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,180
it's not going to fill up the patient too much to where they're then they're then going to skip their meals.

298
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:13,160
So it's a really a supplement. And these may need to be thickened to make sure that they're at the right.

299
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:20,400
That can help with fluid intake as well. More like a milkshake.

300
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:25,230
And then we're going to modify the schedule of the enteral nutrition.

301
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,639
So I would recommend starting Nocturnal Two Feedings. We'll talk about this next semester,

302
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:42,690
what that means to just deliver them overnight and a cycle until she's able to meet at least 75% of her calorie intake alone.

303
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,319
That might be okay. We're not expecting her to be at 100%.

304
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:52,430
But if she can consistently be in about 75% of her needs from oral nutrition, then we can stop those feeding.

305
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,770
I always like to have a specific goal.

306
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,120
That's what we want to see that way if we have the calorie count data.

307
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:07,610
We know if she's about that or not and whether or not we can take out that.

308
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:14,210
Okay. So some examples of monitoring and evaluation.

309
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:21,530
These headings are from that standard terminology sheet and then anything you write after it is just going to be your own words.

310
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,070
So think of these also as goals.

311
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:31,760
It's like, what do we want to see when we're following up to the patient to assure that those interventions could work?

312
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:35,420
So her total energy intake, kind of what we just said,

313
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:43,610
why don't we at least 75% of energy needs be at all and take four the snack supplements prior to his continuing mental attrition.

314
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:52,660
Wanted to meet at least 75% of her fluid needs through beverages and fluids derived from fluids and oral supplements.

315
00:46:54,830 --> 00:47:01,970
I always have a wait change that many in there me personally, because that's something we can easily monitor.

316
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,740
I don't want to see any more weight loss.

317
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:11,780
I don't expect this patient is going to build a lot more lean body mass or maybe gain back that weight to that 65 kilograms.

318
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:16,940
But as long as we're not seeing any more weight loss, sometimes that's a good goal to show.

319
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:21,440
Okay, we're giving an adequate amount of calories and protein that they're not losing weight,

320
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:28,810
that eventually over time, you know, depletion can happen. They also included eating environment.

321
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:35,910
You guys brought this up. So we noticed when we saw the calorie count, she did much better when her family was president.

322
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:44,059
So maybe we want to recommend that having a caregiver or companion present for at least two meals per day to help encourage and offer assistance.

323
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,020
So we can do that at the hospital even if their family is not there.

324
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,569
There are people, volunteers often that can come and sit with people during meal times,

325
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:58,060
just help them with their tray, set up, opening things, sit with them while they're eating and purge and take.

326
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:02,590
Sometimes that can make a big difference as opposed to just sitting in their room.

327
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:09,880
Sometimes, you know, you go up there and the tradesman sitting there untouched and it's just as simple as they can't open something.

328
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:14,080
And so it's been sitting there for hours and they haven't been able to eat anything.

329
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:19,930
So that could be an example of how we would set up our plan for the patient.

330
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,980
Does anybody have questions or other thoughts on what we could do?

331
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:33,130
Yeah, I don't. Passionate about. The latest.

332
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,740
Yeah. You could ask, like any time someone says, like, a preference.

333
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:50,090
Try and dig a little further. In my experience of trying the period diet, the colder foods don't have.

334
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:59,900
They have less of an odor and they are a little bit more pleasing, like the warmer period meats and vegetables.

335
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,160
You know, some people do just fine, but they're they can be off putting.

336
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:08,730
So the colder foods have less odor, less strong of a taste.

337
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:15,510
But fruits are they're not terrible. But that's going to be inadequate in terms of total nutrition.

338
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:19,740
So kind of maybe dig a little further. Why do you like those foods more?

339
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,370
Could we find other foods that are colder that might work.

340
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:31,469
Got. Oh yeah, definitely.

341
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:35,070
There's different types of utensils.

342
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:41,490
If people have a hard time, especially post-stroke, if they're having like some risk drop or a little bit of shaking,

343
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:46,530
there are there are like utensils that are easier for people to get the food to their mouth.

344
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:52,210
So that might be something to investigate as well. Okay.

345
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:56,600
So you may have any questions just on dysphagia in general.

346
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:04,160
You will see it during your internship. You'll see patients on these diets that they are not eating well.

347
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:08,210
And sometimes it's just in the hospital.

348
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:12,589
They don't like the food. They do fine at home. They go home, they kind of get in a groove.

349
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:17,299
Maybe they have some assistance with making the meals. And they do they do just fine on these diets.

350
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:27,170
But. Don't assume that we have to maybe really make sure we set them up for success if they have to go home on a therapeutic diet and thicken liquids.

351
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:31,100
Very difficult to meet hydration. That's what I would say.

352
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:36,770
So we always kind of want to assess that. Okay.

353
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:41,660
So we're we're sticking with more of like upper GI, but this is like a totally.

354
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:45,140
Well, not totally. It's it can be related to dysphagia or this.

355
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:53,059
Sometimes people with GERD can have dysphagia due to the damage that's done to the esophagus.

356
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:58,100
But why do we care about gastroesophageal reflux disease?

357
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:04,670
Well, nutrition and or diet considerations are usually not the first line of therapy.

358
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,239
Usually people will be put on like some type of medication management.

359
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:13,370
So antacid therapy. But this affects a large number of people.

360
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:15,820
So very high morbidity with this.

361
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:23,660
It's about more than 20 million people in the US suffer from symptoms of GERD, while more than 100 million have occasional symptoms.

362
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,239
So GERD is notable for its prevalence.

363
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:36,520
A variety of clinical presentations, I would say under-recognized morbidity from GERD and substantial economic consequences.

364
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:43,729
So how many of you guys, if you're watching TV, I know there's a lot of pharmaceutical ads,

365
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:52,520
but used to be a lot more than recently put up like antacid commercials, Zantac, Pepcid, Prevacid.

366
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:59,870
I mean, we still see a lot of it's huge business, the antacid kind of therapy because so many people struggle with it.

367
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:10,280
So. And it won't prevent Gerhard. Their role is really limited to intermittent or on demand use for the relief of mild GERD.

368
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:15,210
So that would be something like a Tums. That might be more like occasional use as needed.

369
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:23,160
There's other agents that are used more for like daily use or chronic chronic symptoms.

370
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,240
And a lot of times we'll hear proton pump inhibitors and PPIs.

371
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,750
A lot of patients in hospital are put on a for a variety of reasons.

372
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:36,000
But this is the most potent inhibitor of gas it gastric acid secretion.

373
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:43,290
So this will help prevent further release of gastric acid.

374
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:47,700
So that can help with symptoms. But there's also potentially other consequences to long term use.

375
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,280
All right, so what do we tell our patients? Let's say they're.

376
00:52:55,490 --> 00:53:02,360
Not really responding fully to the medication or maybe they want to avoid medication where there was a study a

377
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:08,930
couple of years ago that came out that showed long term use of PPIs was associated with increased mortality.

378
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:15,350
So there then was a push to get people off these people as a long term solution.

379
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:21,310
That study was flawed. I don't think we know the real risk of long term use of that spirit.

380
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:26,600
A lot of primary care physicians and a lot of patients that didn't want to take a medication.

381
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:36,450
Wasn't know what the outcomes are. A lot of people really ask what can they do with their diet?

382
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:46,070
So far as it is warranted to trial some food restrictions or take out certain things that we know can trigger GERD.

383
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:51,649
So some foods will promote the release of gastric acid.

384
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:58,459
So a trial of food restriction to reduce gastric acidity might be helpful in the foods

385
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:05,810
that are most implicated in increasing gastric acidity is black and red pepper.

386
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:16,850
Coffee. Whether it's caffeinated or decaf, decaf is better, but half the caffeine can trigger the release of gastric acid and then alcohol as well.

387
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:25,969
So for some people, they know they're triggers of reflux and they know no coffee is a problem or alcohol a problem.

388
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:29,090
So they can maybe specifically cut back on those things.

389
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:33,620
We do recommend smaller, more frequent meals.

390
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:42,110
There's just less pressure being put on the stomach where the contents can reflux up into the esophagus with smaller,

391
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:52,979
more frequent meals compared to like a large meal. Sometimes we will trial food restriction to assess the effect on the lower esophageal

392
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:59,760
sphincter pressure so that lower esophageal sphincter as leg esophagus meets the stomach.

393
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:09,090
For a lot of people with gastroesophageal reflux disease, the integrity of that lower esophageal sphincter is compromised.

394
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:19,350
So it tends to be more relaxed and that when it relaxes, that allows that acid from the stomach to splash up into the esophagus.

395
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:30,180
So these foods can cause that lower esophageal sphincter to relax or can cause a decrease in that pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter.

396
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:39,600
So if we think pressure would be make it close, if it's decreasing that pressure, it would be more likely to stay open or relax a little bit.

397
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:49,710
So the foods known to relax the lower esophageal sphincter are chocolate mint and foods with a high fat content.

398
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:58,890
I would say many, many people with good, high fat fried foods, greasy foods are a problem.

399
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:03,719
They know that after they eat that like a fried meal, they're going to have really bad symptoms.

400
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:09,950
And that's just because fat takes a little bit longer to digest in the stomach and it can cause a relaxation of the lower.

401
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:18,430
So these are kind of the best known food approaches to use.

402
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:23,290
So anything missing on here or anything you're surprised not to see?

403
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:29,710
Yeah. Spicy foods.

404
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:33,310
How often do we hear that? Like, I can't have anything spicy.

405
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,600
We'll talk about that a little bit because that's often really implicated.

406
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:45,370
What else? Yeah. I was sitting on the sidelines and things like that.

407
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:52,060
Yes. So people in the city will say, well, I can't have anything spicy or acidic because of reflux.

408
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:58,000
Well, that's kind of based on anecdotal evidence of some people have specific food triggers, of course.

409
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:04,019
This acid content of hooves, there's really no evidence to support that.

410
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:09,060
That's going to increase the acid content in the stomach or increase acid production.

411
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:14,790
Some people may have more discomfort with certain foods, but this is really where the evidence is.

412
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:18,840
And there are physiological reasons why these foods impact.

413
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:24,340
Gastroesophageal reflux disease as opposed to just kind of more anecdotal.

414
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,550
Acidic or spicy.

415
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:35,659
So you can see why this information might be helpful, because people may not even realize that these are actually the most common problems.

416
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:43,070
And I would say in my experience, coffee, alcohol, high fat foods tend to be the worst culprits for most people.

417
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:49,640
And it has nothing to do with space or. Acid content.

418
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:54,610
Yeah. 630. They weren't hungry after a meal?

419
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:59,890
Yep. Yeah. Why would that be? If we look at some other lifestyle consideration.

420
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:09,350
Why would like like we talk about raising the head of the bed before sleeping.

421
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,390
Remain upright after eating. Why would that help? Yeah.

422
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:23,890
Yeah. It's just simple gravity, right? So if there's acid that is coming up from the stomach into the esophagus.

423
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:27,790
Maintaining more of an upright position can help.

424
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:33,640
At least not maybe not prevent that, but it's not going to make it worse than if you were to lie down.

425
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:38,329
They're going to be much more vulnerable to that. Okay.

426
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:49,670
So weight reduction if overweight. This is never a popular recommendation for any M.A. for nutrition students have found each year and I think you

427
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:56,420
know we're trying to move away from just weight loss for for many of the things the diseases you talk about but.

428
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:04,460
There is evidence to support the efficacy of weight loss in some patients with different diseases.

429
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:09,170
That doesn't mean that has to be something that we recommend.

430
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:13,730
But just so you know, there are there is evidence to support these recommendations.

431
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:20,660
So weight reduction program, if overweight and if that maybe would make sense for the patient.

432
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:27,250
Researchers have found that extra fat, especially around central adiposity,

433
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:35,140
surround the visceral organs around the stomach, can increase pressure on the stomach, forcing fluid up into the esophagus.

434
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:43,720
So sometimes weight reduction may be appropriate. Smoking cessation cessation, definitely.

435
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:51,100
Nicotine from tobacco does relax that lower esophageal sphincter and can make a patient much more vulnerable to reflux.

436
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:56,840
Improved clearing of materials in the esophagus. So this might be.

437
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:07,600
Working with the patient. Usually they'll do this with like occupational therapy or how to really get better clearance.

438
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:11,090
Sometimes they'll have Los Angeles to promote saliva production.

439
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:16,070
A really major side effect of a lot of medications is dry mouth,

440
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:26,480
so people don't have really good saliva production and that can provide a good clearing up in this topic of talk about after eating,

441
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:33,679
avoid eating no later than 3 hours before bedtime because they are going to lay down and it might be a lot of people get their worst

442
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:42,950
symptoms at night and then looser fit clothing can help as well because that pressure of tight clothing and on the Anthony can.

443
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:50,360
Worsen the reflux symptoms. We talked about space here or civic foods.

444
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:57,200
Really anecdotally, individuals do report their perception that certain foods like spicy,

445
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:01,760
tomato based or acidic foods aggravate symptoms associated with GERD,

446
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:09,380
even though these foods have not really been documented to have normally increased gastric acid production.

447
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:15,190
But yes, some people will have foods specific triggers and they may be spicier, acidic.

448
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,830
So that would be appropriate for them to look at those. Yeah.

449
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:25,560
I was also thinking of something else. I don't know if you mentioned, but like chewing gum once fully before swallowing would probably help.

450
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:28,639
I would assume with some of the acid it can because remember,

451
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:35,360
digestion and acid production really starts in the mouth as soon as we some some research even when

452
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:40,610
we smell food with that salivation starts and that begins that first step or break down of food.

453
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:51,350
So making sure foods are chewed properly to start the digestive process, start to break down, that would probably be important as well.

454
01:01:51,660 --> 01:02:03,100
That's good to point out. So spicy, acidic foods should be considered on an individual level of tolerance, so not like a broad recommendation.

455
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:07,300
And sometimes the patients are really surprised to hear that.

456
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:14,640
But you'll still see, like, even gastroenterologist notes, like avoid spicy food.

457
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:19,290
Okay, well, we have better evidence and more specific data here.

458
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:25,709
Okay. So are citrus foods more acidic and therefore more likely to cause heartburn?

459
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:33,090
We kind of talked about this. The concern with gastroesophageal reflux disease is the production of gastric acid,

460
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:40,290
not necessarily the damage from particular foods or the acid content from some individuals.

461
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:43,850
No intolerance to certain foods that may be citrus based.

462
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,889
So avoidance may be necessary.

463
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:54,510
But otherwise, note that the foods that have been documented to increase gastric acid release are those that are the most common.

464
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:59,940
So is the pepper, which maybe in some cases would be spicy for some.

465
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:07,690
Coffee and alcohol. Those are the things that are going to stimulate the gastric acid production.

466
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:14,600
Then we get this a lot. So what about milk or other high fat foods?

467
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:24,320
Coke. The stomach can protect it from pain. Now, in order to understand this, we kind of think about how digestion works as we just spoke about.

468
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:28,670
Gastric secretions are produced even before the food enters the stomach.

469
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:35,120
The presence of protein sometimes can stimulate gastric juices as well.

470
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:41,870
So there's really no way for like milk or dairy to coat the stomach.

471
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:48,979
It's high in fat. The stomach is more of a water soluble vitamins environment.

472
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:52,250
So this isn't really possible. It doesn't help.

473
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:55,400
But some people will come asking if they should do that.

474
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:07,980
Okay. So that's it. I you posted the handout for gastroesophageal reflux disease, so just take a look at that.

475
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:12,000
That's kind of an example of what you would focus on for talking to the patient.

476
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,830
Again. A lot of times patients will require medication management as well.

477
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:22,780
All right. So let's talk about M.A. for peptic ulcer disease.

478
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:28,120
What from the lecture, what's the main cause of peptic ulcer?

479
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:37,809
Yeah. It's kind of a worry, right? It's a bacterium in a lot of people have exposure to h.

480
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:41,770
Pylori and not everybody gets peptic ulcer disease.

481
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:51,850
That bacteria makes the lining of the stomach and the GI tract more vulnerable to damage from acid.

482
01:04:51,850 --> 01:05:01,659
And then these ulcers can develop. So a lot of times they'll they'll test the they'll do a little sample of the offer for each pylori.

483
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:06,219
If it gets to a point where they biopsy and then they'll treat with antibiotics and then

484
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:11,110
they may have some other nutritional things to consider as well while they're healing.

485
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:23,500
So some nutritional considerations for these patients. So peptic ulcer disease may result in inadequate intake resulting from changes in appetite.

486
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:32,110
Food intolerances and abdominal pain. So usually patients with peptic ulcer disease have a specific site of outcome.

487
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:42,570
So it can be really uncomfortable. And that may often lead them to try to take out certain foods to see if it's food that's bothering them.

488
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:51,550
It can really impact appetite. They can have electrolyte imbalances if they're having vomiting secondary to their ulcer.

489
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:58,239
There are all sorts are in the stomach, could be iron deficiency if they have a bleeding ulcer that leads to blood loss.

490
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,160
That would happen over time.

491
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:09,070
But that can happen if it goes undetected and untreated and then possible decreases in calcium, iron, vitamin B12 absorption.

492
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:14,110
And this can be due to long term use of medications that reduce acid production.

493
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:24,309
So if they're on a P for a long period of time, remember these minerals and vitamins to prefer acidic environment for the first step of absorption.

494
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:29,770
So over time, this could be potentially problematic for those things.

495
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:40,909
Okay. So some nutritional considerations, factors that increase acid production.

496
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:47,629
We talked about this for acid secretion, pepper, alcohol, caffeine, other factors.

497
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:54,230
Some may have rapid gastric emptying that can cause some discomfort, some diarrhea.

498
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:04,420
And it can and can worsen. The ulcers and stress as well can really impair company culture, disease and the ability to heal.

499
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:10,110
And then potentially protective factors.

500
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:18,360
These don't have a really strong evidence base but definitely some the theoretical basis that if we have good.

501
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:23,610
Intake, surprisingly, says adequate fiber intake.

502
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:29,760
These nutrients can help protect the lining of the stomach and make it less vulnerable to ulceration.

503
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:34,140
So these are more like in theory.

504
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:39,630
If these the status of these nutrients could be helpful. Not a whole lot of strong data, though.

505
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:46,760
Okay. So this is our final slide today.

506
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:56,990
Our goals for peptic ulcer disease optimize nutritional intake to correct any deficiencies and to meet their nutritional needs.

507
01:07:57,830 --> 01:08:04,490
Avoid foods that potentially increase gastric acid suppression or can damage the gastric people some more than it already is.

508
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:12,570
Talked about what those might be. Identify foods that directly irritate the gastric mucosa that are not individually tolerated.

509
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:14,790
So I would say definitely peptic ulcer disease,

510
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:22,859
more so than gastroesophageal reflux disease is very individualized in terms of what foods trigger pain symptoms.

511
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:29,550
Sometimes foods can relieve pain for patients, so this is much more patient specific.

512
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:40,079
Avoid eating at least 2 hours before bedtime and suggestions that may assist with symptom control of peptic ulcer disease include smaller,

513
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,470
more frequent meals and again eating before bedtime.

514
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,420
Those can help just with the pain management as well.

515
01:08:48,510 --> 01:08:57,149
Yeah, about bedtime one is that like when people are falling asleep and they're noticing symptoms or is it something like in the morning?

516
01:08:57,150 --> 01:09:01,050
They're still I would say both. Do you sleep?

517
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:06,209
A lot of times in my experience with patients, it's around bedtime.

518
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:12,870
When they start to lay down is where they really feel the symptoms and then they can have it in the morning as well.

519
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:17,879
But it's more like in that process of going to bed. All right.

520
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:23,190
So let's does him have questions on that? I mean, this isn't going to come up a lot in the hospital.

521
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:31,140
Maybe more outpatient like ways to manage their their gastroesophageal reflux disease or their peptic ulcer disease.

522
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:33,340
They're going to look for some guidance there.

523
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:43,739
And in my experience, a lot of patients are trying to go more toward lifestyle management of chronic disease and symptoms as opposed to medication.

524
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:47,520
And that's been different, I'd say, over the last.

525
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:55,820
Five years or so. There's a huge, huge demand to try and try things that are not medication based.

526
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:02,750
And sometimes we don't have great evidence for that. So let's just briefly look at our.

527
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:07,560
Education Guide for gastroesophageal reflux disease.

528
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:16,730
So again, these chips here, these are things not related really to necessarily just specific foods, but this can help.

529
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:23,120
You know, this is definitely within our scope to talk about these other lifestyle things that patients can do.

530
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:30,020
And then you can see here about foods recommended. A lot of this is going to be things lower, in fact.

531
01:10:31,950 --> 01:10:35,160
You know, that might be patient dependent as well.

532
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:41,010
Usually it's it's more like things that are deep fried or really greasy as opposed to what.

533
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:44,770
Full fat milk is usually not a huge problem.

534
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:55,679
So sometimes you don't take this with a grain of salt, but foods down here, these kind of touch on the things that are most known to aggravate reflux.

535
01:10:55,680 --> 01:11:02,240
And sometimes patients will be very surprised to see. And then peptic ulcer disease.

536
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:08,560
You know, here are foods that have added salt and sugar.

537
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:14,089
I think maybe they're just trying to get at more processed foods there.

538
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:21,190
That may be problematic for people, but this is just kind of like general healthy nutrition in place.

539
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:27,370
So this is definitely something where it's very patient specific and to help identify their certain triggers.

540
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:38,709
Yeah. I think there's different hypotheses.

541
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:44,950
There's probably one that stress can make your immune system a little bit suppressed,

542
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:51,220
so you might be more vulnerable to bacteria that would then would you normally be clear,

543
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:59,229
which you don't, and then your stomach lining becomes more vulnerable to that bacteria in the same

544
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:03,970
way I think stress maybe you might have to do with like the acid production as well.

545
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:08,370
The stresses is intimately linked with GERD as well.

546
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:13,650
Stress is a really difficult exposure to measure.

547
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:24,930
I think we're getting maybe a little bit better and in studies, but the actual mechanism, I think it's more so hypothesized.

548
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:30,930
But I would say that a lot of it has to do with making your body just more vulnerable to.

549
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:35,880
Infection or impact in response.

550
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:44,830
Yeah. It's it's I think it's really interesting to see how stress is tied in with a lot of these.

551
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:51,090
Okay. Any questions about today?

552
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:57,650
Okay. So I think Tuesday I'll post that.

553
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:06,560
What you need to do for Tuesday. By tomorrow. But we're going to stay in the upper GI tract and focus more on the stomach.

554
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:13,249
Yeah, I really. Yes.

555
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:21,440
I thought that, yes, I will make sure I think I changed it because I think they had at least right away, which was not my intention.

556
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:26,450
And I want to stress you guys out. Usually it's like a couple days later, but yes, I can do that.

557
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:31,120
All right, you guys have a great weekend and I'll see you on Tuesday.
