1
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,100
yesterday money this weekend. little

2
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,220
bit of next Tuesday. before certainly we'll continue. this is quick

3
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:35,640
reminder for you. so today

4
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:46,000
one two two Thursday

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:21,777
and four. please

6
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:26,837
okay so well we were talking about dermatology. and just

7
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:32,237
finished talking about this diagnostic test that patch test and then. this is an interesting

8
00:01:32,237 --> 00:01:37,277
article and I think it's useful. with respect to what you first left

9
00:01:37,277 --> 00:01:42,617
two or two o'clock conversation. you listen to he talk about

10
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:47,777
general politicians. this is a call the nation. and so this is an article sort of like that.

11
00:01:47,777 --> 00:01:53,177
Christmas article about specific because issue with respect to Worker's_Compensation.

12
00:01:53,177 --> 00:01:58,557
this is an article by dermatologist to help one

13
00:01:58,557 --> 00:02:03,697
to decide whether a particular skin condition is work related.

14
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:09,397
contact Titus. so it's an article almost thirty years ago now. several criteria.

15
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:14,837
you know he'll have his buddy call considerations. people calling criteria

16
00:02:14,837 --> 00:02:19,937
for what you would consider. in determining conversation. in this

17
00:02:19,937 --> 00:02:25,317
particular. I say let's take up positive four out_of seven in Worker's_Compensation.

18
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:30,797
it's for a position. it's in good condition. call. bye. work.

19
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:36,037
he said more likely than not because of my work and now those English words translate into fifty

20
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:41,957
one percent or greater likelihood. so that's four out_of seven in this case

21
00:02:41,957 --> 00:02:47,057
and should actually should make sense just to just

22
00:02:47,057 --> 00:02:52,177
commonsense in terms of the decision. the determination for

23
00:02:52,177 --> 00:02:57,737
you so first of all is the diagnosis. this is just a variation is the diagnosis

24
00:02:57,737 --> 00:03:02,803
consistent or established a free sample of some cover police asked

25
00:03:02,803 --> 00:03:07,843
me wanna know if they have asked about for trade show. in this case. does the rest of this

26
00:03:07,843 --> 00:03:13,323
condition looks like contactor and type in our their exposures

27
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:18,663
and the workplace that can cost something like a contactor. I just and just the distributions

28
00:03:18,663 --> 00:03:23,963
of this because back into the diagnosis is the distribution of the rash I so you a picture

29
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:29,663
ration red hand all the way up to the rest and proximal or above the rest.

30
00:03:29,663 --> 00:03:35,483
there is no redness at all. kinda looks like some long area. so that's a man atomic

31
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:40,783
distribution. that is consistent with what kind of exposure the person

32
00:03:40,783 --> 00:03:46,343
had in the temple relationship you know it's from Dawson Hills.

33
00:03:46,343 --> 00:03:51,663
just don't put the cart before the horse. still get

34
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:56,805
the exposure occurred before the rash developed if you can Determine

35
00:03:56,805 --> 00:04:02,025
thing about skin problems and they tend to develop slowly. any attempt to collect

36
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:07,345
a go away or resolve every slowly so it's not an excuse reaction

37
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:13,045
like wheezing and asthma. rolled out non- occupational

38
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:18,465
classes. just a little bit of detective work. and and also he'll talk about

39
00:04:18,465 --> 00:04:23,725
the experiment. I wish you meant. if you remove someone from exposure. just

40
00:04:23,725 --> 00:04:28,925
probably get better or the people not get the condition. so just remove them from exposure

41
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:34,325
lease with us can problem overtime and then. alright. is there a consistent diagnostic

42
00:04:34,325 --> 00:04:39,625
testing in this case. the patch testing. they had a couple of criteria. so

43
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:44,765
a_lot_of some people have some kind of skin condition already and then it gets aggravated by work

44
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:50,145
and so. so they're in need for criteria then to help determine

45
00:04:50,145 --> 00:04:55,281
that there's new areas I have a rash that we're not

46
00:04:55,281 --> 00:05:00,401
present before the exposure or pre- existing areas are now worse

47
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:06,101
and so months of this is part of what happens to the skin

48
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:11,221
but it is common for certain chemicals to use again is

49
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:16,781
a port of entry into the body and to access the system system circulation you get ill

50
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:22,201
from that. whereas the skin is just a port of entry and it doesn't actually

51
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:27,461
turn out to be involved in the answers. so here's

52
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:33,541
just a table that I don't want you to remember but just sort of like to get a sense for

53
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:38,861
chemicals can do things like Tyson nitrate nitrate

54
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:44,061
set and contaminate well water. you can call us. Matthew McGlocklin in the area

55
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:49,221
briefly. the hiring goes from one state to another thing

56
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:54,307
first affair fair fair the parents if you know your chemistry in the bottom line

57
00:05:54,307 --> 00:05:59,627
is that that hemoglobin with fire and that has changed it's taken a longer except oxygen

58
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:04,767
the same way. that used you as a little bit like carbon monoxide.

59
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:09,827
the preference for hemoglobin for covering over oxygen. so you can see

60
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:15,147
all that easy. you heard of thinking about organic solids and so forth about

61
00:06:15,147 --> 00:06:20,667
current I saw a file. I know you've heard about.

62
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:26,427
I don't him. I have not beautiful key tone there and BK

63
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:32,267
which is toxic tuners you heard about normal heck same that straight chain

64
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:37,307
six carbon hex Shane Solomon. that also is toxic tenders.

65
00:06:37,307 --> 00:06:42,557
so they can penetrate the skin hey Mindy. I'm pretty sure in the previous.

66
00:06:42,557 --> 00:06:47,657
talk to you so. this vinyl chloride my number. it is received pictures

67
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:53,077
worth a thousand words up here. this is the to the finger this is the middle finger.

68
00:06:53,077 --> 00:06:58,197
this is the knuckle right here in the left and there's some and there's three bones in each finger

69
00:06:58,197 --> 00:07:03,317
and on the phone there's just too. so this is the first bone in the finger second on the third bone with

70
00:07:03,317 --> 00:07:08,437
a finger nail is. it's been dissolved and so that was the effect of final.

71
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:13,617
alright my number. is Afro hospital voices. which simply

72
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:18,677
means after needs to ask you means going and like this means. it's

73
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:25,877
dissolved. so it's a ten dollar word for dissolving the bone. in this case.

74
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:30,977
so we'll talk about I talked about contact dermatitis. there

75
00:07:30,977 --> 00:07:36,417
were other kinds of allergic reactions involving the skin

76
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:41,516
and one that really sort of at the very latest part of the eighties and kinda blew

77
00:07:41,516 --> 00:07:47,316
up here in the nineties with latex allergy. especially health care workers were wearing these gloves

78
00:07:47,316 --> 00:07:52,376
and this is an allergic reaction and it can't be

79
00:07:52,376 --> 00:07:57,396
like we talked about last Thursday which is can

80
00:07:57,396 --> 00:08:02,496
be an allergic contact dermatitis. the chemicals used to process the clubs

81
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:08,016
for example. in this case. it can be a different kind

82
00:08:08,016 --> 00:08:13,336
of reaction in this reaction. is a different learning mechanism. they call

83
00:08:13,336 --> 00:08:18,436
it and give me a_lot to me now and headed home. all of a tight one allergy. it's

84
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:23,976
facilitator mediated. the mechanism is. you know Bobby Lynn in this case I GE.

85
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:30,076
if you get stung by a bee and you get hives all over that site. he's an immediate allergic reaction

86
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:35,932
and the most common trigger for latex allergies latex gloves

87
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:41,032
and latex gloves. I need you to harvest the sap of the rubber tree

88
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:46,092
plant. typically in like in Tanisha. and there maybe residual

89
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:51,572
proteins latex elastic latex itself. plumber arrived

90
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:56,752
and is not Taylor genic but there's residual proteins in the South and the

91
00:08:56,752 --> 00:09:01,892
visual proteins like proteins and peanuts and various things that cost

92
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:06,912
allergic reactions can cost the sensitive station. after latency period of

93
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:12,192
exposure and then similar to GE mediate at least things you can get

94
00:09:12,192 --> 00:09:17,572
five certain carrier. they can be localized can be generalized of your entire body

95
00:09:17,572 --> 00:09:22,712
you can have sometimes when hardly text calls or used up latex

96
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:27,732
proteins because essentially in here to the powder powder suspended in the air now you

97
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:33,632
have essentially suspended allergy and in the healthcare environment. so you had a

98
00:09:33,632 --> 00:09:39,396
case reports of health care workers getting asthma even from in handling

99
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:47,776
these rubber latex proteins are message in the on the powder latex gloves.

100
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:52,836
by the way. the problem is much improved. partly because in large part

101
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:58,316
because they love many factors for Health Care. applications

102
00:09:58,316 --> 00:10:03,556
are processing latex better solution less in the way

103
00:10:03,556 --> 00:10:08,556
allergy and the proteins and powder free is pretty much

104
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:13,696
the rule and so that is diminished the source of the problem

105
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:18,816
tremendously. so just just an FYI of course people who work outdoors

106
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:24,356
or more on Realty developing skin cancer. people get infections

107
00:10:24,356 --> 00:10:29,596
and talk about health care workers can get infections first

108
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:34,676
injuries. there are certain conditions of certain medications that you take. and if you're

109
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:39,936
supposed to sign. you can get a rash so if you're running in a biotic for any

110
00:10:39,936 --> 00:10:45,284
reason you have_to know whether that particular antibiotic. especially during the summer when you can be exposed

111
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:51,484
to son can call us. your photo sensitivity.

112
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:56,724
so other problems so anyway take a lace for

113
00:10:56,724 --> 00:11:02,444
the topic. just understand what characteristics are

114
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:07,544
allergic to contact you return this and you're to contact the retirees. the check at your agent

115
00:11:07,544 --> 00:11:13,284
is much more common with contact number and how is

116
00:11:13,284 --> 00:11:18,384
that allergic. there's a latency period you for the work late and see all along so it's really

117
00:11:18,384 --> 00:11:23,884
important to understand that it doesn't happen with certain conditions your two conditions.

118
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:29,824
and then latex allergy is. I can be contact

119
00:11:29,824 --> 00:11:36,404
at allergy but it's a ninety. it's not so mediated.

120
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:41,788
any questions about

121
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:46,908
so okay.

122
00:11:46,908 --> 00:11:52,568
so this is this is Jay. shifting gears.

123
00:11:52,568 --> 00:11:57,588
I have a relatively short discussion about workers compensation. it's

124
00:11:57,588 --> 00:12:02,648
not an occupational disease obviously you are Carmen Toler. patient

125
00:12:02,648 --> 00:12:07,748
injury. but the fact is in our world here. if something

126
00:12:07,748 --> 00:12:12,848
happens at work. Worker's_Comp. is involved and and so I

127
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:18,228
think it's important to have even think twenty minutes or so over an introduction

128
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:23,868
if you don't not very familiar with it. just in appreciation for what it's about a little bit about his history

129
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:28,888
and some of the short short coming. so the history is important because you

130
00:12:28,888 --> 00:12:34,228
should be a point like before that about nineteen eleven whether work any workers compensation

131
00:12:34,228 --> 00:12:39,848
laws. Andy Selman lost their hand in the press at work.

132
00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:45,090
they had to file a lawsuit against their employer I was you only

133
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:51,210
have one the only way to get in the work or have_to have what's called the person approved to establish that.

134
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:56,590
there was a work injury and they were eligible should be eligible for damages and

135
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:01,750
so that why didn't like his employers didn't like it because when they didn't get to there. in

136
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:06,790
terms terms of your exposure risk could be quite fine. and so there was

137
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:14,714
a_lot_of risk there so all parties I guess considered it as it contains

138
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:19,804
in the fact the matter is. this issue became more more important because as the in

139
00:13:19,804 --> 00:13:25,224
just a revolution progress. more more entries for the most apartment ever

140
00:13:25,224 --> 00:13:30,384
special. this is as well. but the response was to

141
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:36,744
the increasing degree of injuries and

142
00:13:36,744 --> 00:13:42,144
with the system as it was. there was a shift responsibility

143
00:13:42,144 --> 00:13:47,704
for these injuries and away from the work to the employer. and so that was pressured

144
00:13:47,704 --> 00:13:53,324
to to protect your employer and also to protect the employee. so

145
00:13:53,324 --> 00:13:58,344
what happened was what's in terms of the Grant bargain. and so the idea

146
00:13:58,344 --> 00:14:04,484
was that you provide benefits to your workers and at the same time you protect your employers.

147
00:14:04,484 --> 00:14:10,144
that's final basis for starting the start of workers compensation

148
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:15,624
months. so you could no longer do your employer.

149
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:20,857
if you got heard now. apparently you can sue your employer these days if you can show

150
00:14:20,857 --> 00:14:25,917
gross negligence. find large it's very very man and for the most part completed to

151
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:31,057
no longer assume their employer. to get compensation

152
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:36,557
and employers from into community from lawsuits. so if you had to go to the workers compensation

153
00:14:36,557 --> 00:14:42,817
system. employee didn't have_to deal with lawsuits.

154
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:48,417
I'll get answer in terms of toward a law that is. so

155
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:53,517
each state one five one. develop the workers compensation law the first was in nineteen

156
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:58,737
eleven. I can't remove the last one I think Indiana was in nineteen forty

157
00:14:58,737 --> 00:15:03,837
eight. so if he has it's own line tone statue and

158
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:09,217
he said to call message from one state to the next. it's a different law.

159
00:15:09,217 --> 00:15:14,497
maybe similarities and there are see medically similarities but in terms

160
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:20,955
of nuts and balls and important criteria.

161
00:15:20,955 --> 00:15:27,635
it's really highly variable from state to state. so

162
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:32,955
this coming term the language has been involved for. whether something is

163
00:15:32,955 --> 00:15:38,035
eligible for workers compensation. is this a condition right now and in the

164
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:43,155
course of employment. the common language so it came out_of

165
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:48,175
somebody working and due to the work that they were doing. no

166
00:15:48,175 --> 00:15:54,955
longer had to prove negligence. only password was the class and

167
00:15:54,955 --> 00:16:00,495
on this basic same like I say from state to state there's a_lot_of very ability.

168
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:05,555
so in most cases he gets hey. essentially the exclusive remedy it's a no fault

169
00:16:05,555 --> 00:16:10,695
system. and if you get hurt at work and you go to your doctor and

170
00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:15,775
the doctor knows find out that it's work related. they pretty much

171
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:20,813
say can't touch it. you have_to go through Worker's_Compensation so personal insurance typically we'll do

172
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:25,813
nine payment for conditions that are known to be

173
00:16:25,813 --> 00:16:31,013
covered. should be covered in your workers compensation. so is everybody protected.

174
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:36,273
not really small employers are not required to carry insurance.

175
00:16:36,273 --> 00:16:41,373
many small like farming entities are excluded in in

176
00:16:41,373 --> 00:16:47,473
certain states. some self employed workers are excluded

177
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:52,553
public sector workers tend to be covered through different mechanisms. there's federal

178
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:57,693
Worker's_Compensation and so forth. so what

179
00:16:57,693 --> 00:17:02,713
you get under workers compensation. if you're eligible. well first of all when you get your

180
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:08,373
medical care. paid for makes sense to run any co-pays. there are limits

181
00:17:08,373 --> 00:17:13,453
except that they denied the treatment but essentially if you need it. please

182
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:18,713
in theory. you're eligible for your medical care cost. if you can't work

183
00:17:18,713 --> 00:17:24,435
you get weight loss replacement and

184
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:30,155
if you get severely injured in a no longer able to do your normal work or occupation.

185
00:17:30,155 --> 00:17:35,415
you can get. let's call but we have a vocational rehabilitation payment

186
00:17:35,415 --> 00:17:40,795
so you can get trained to do something else perhaps the first to represent

187
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:46,295
the Medical Care class and lost wages represent the vast majority

188
00:17:46,295 --> 00:17:51,335
of the cost under Worker's_Comp.. not too often in some growth of vocational

189
00:17:51,335 --> 00:17:56,495
rehabilitation. they're also our benefits to

190
00:17:56,495 --> 00:18:01,535
the estate or the family. if you die. as a result of the work injury or if

191
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:07,055
you have a current disability. you lose your finger or something. so there are benefits specifically

192
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:12,495
related to that. so if you missed work. weight loss is replaced

193
00:18:12,495 --> 00:18:17,495
in high average from you know if you ever got the space it's about two thirds of what you used

194
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:23,499
to get and it's generally tax free so you don't make as much as you did

195
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:28,679
in Michigan. they have a formula for calculating it which I won't bore you with but every State has some

196
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:34,139
way of calculating. so one of the objectives of

197
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:39,999
the work comp loss is to control like the cost

198
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:45,019
workplace injury especially but also illness and it's employers

199
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:50,259
comp lawyers money to have people injured and sick. then

200
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:55,519
listen to and they have an incentive to keep your people healthy. your most recent in the cost

201
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:01,339
more money. so give the class return lies to business operations.

202
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:06,379
then there would be if you're not. otherwise and send device to protect your workers done. then

203
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:11,659
that would be a reason to do it that cost money to have sick people

204
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:17,099
are injured people and you know I'll mitigate the cost

205
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:22,939
to the employer if there's a catastrophic financial loss because.

206
00:19:22,939 --> 00:19:28,159
if you have help. if you don't floor you have workers compensation insurance

207
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:33,199
under written by the Insurance Company. they have risk Pool or an Insurance

208
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:38,699
pools. and taking up to work catastrophic loss.

209
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:43,699
so work in your region working on this is really different. with

210
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:48,939
respect to Worker's_Compensation. the laws were initially developed to cover people who lost

211
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:53,939
their hand in the process and those kinds of things and diseases. either

212
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:58,957
we're not recognizes much work his much any concern

213
00:19:58,957 --> 00:20:04,337
my guess is that the large part. this is work. even

214
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:09,517
recognized as an a rating from the work place. as much

215
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:14,537
of course they recognize but not as much. so I feel busy this

216
00:20:14,537 --> 00:20:19,697
is starting to be addressed. even early on. but it wasn't until even nineteen seventy

217
00:20:19,697 --> 00:20:24,717
six or all the states had some kind of language addressing all of this

218
00:20:24,717 --> 00:20:29,977
is in their loss. okay. so the reason

219
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:35,237
why these are special. this is in even on this is a dance related to these illnesses

220
00:20:35,237 --> 00:20:40,657
aren't covered or mold. so there could be multiple reasons. our classes

221
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:45,877
for particular. unless someone has asked me to read

222
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:51,057
we in Holland and they're also allergic to the night I since I need it we're

223
00:20:51,057 --> 00:20:58,284
keeping those parts is difficult. can be difficult

224
00:20:58,284 --> 00:21:03,424
lacy periods. you know lot of these. I'll talk to you last night as an example or you

225
00:21:03,424 --> 00:21:08,544
heard about the latency for asbestos and lung

226
00:21:08,544 --> 00:21:13,564
cancer. we all were talking about decades several decades

227
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:18,684
we're too late. ten a little longer than the work comp schedule limitations.

228
00:21:18,684 --> 00:21:23,964
which seems that you should have a law that says disease that call takes

229
00:21:23,964 --> 00:21:29,044
thirty years to develop. is not covered because it took too long to develop. but there are statue

230
00:21:29,044 --> 00:21:34,404
statues of limitations and the length of time also can secure

231
00:21:34,404 --> 00:21:40,844
within the exposure that it was the one that actually called you on this occurred

232
00:21:40,844 --> 00:21:46,064
and you know you go to your doctor if you're having trouble breathing and you know it doesn't say

233
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:51,524
where related to asthma. when you sign and you have_to have an index of suspicion

234
00:21:51,524 --> 00:21:58,566
and some awareness and some knowledge. in order to even make that recognition

235
00:21:58,566 --> 00:22:03,566
hey you know before it seems like forever. some people change jobs. some

236
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:09,206
people live in different states and some states have a different local

237
00:22:09,206 --> 00:22:14,266
exposure. that would qualify for a work related on this

238
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:19,266
other space and so I needed to reset

239
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:24,326
some workers and their positions. just don't even think about

240
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:29,626
or have a clue that index of suspicion you have_to know that it can't exist and

241
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:34,666
consider. you know it's possible that of twenty five percent. don't also

242
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:39,706
ask about his work related. so you need to tell you in turn the general

243
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:44,786
practitioners the family doctors and so forth. to trying to

244
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:49,926
consider that and there are efforts to do that but it's not as as

245
00:22:49,926 --> 00:22:55,146
well known and established as it should be

246
00:22:55,146 --> 00:23:00,870
and of course just because reality because specific call station can be very complicated.

247
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:06,530
we're talking about the case of the latency and the exposure and so forth.

248
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:12,790
Charlie said again that that there's there's very ability from state to state

249
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:17,790
and in to do multiple areas of these laws. so just pass out for instance if

250
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:23,870
you live in. I work in Louisiana and you have_to miss work because of an injury.

251
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:28,910
you have_to wait a week before you're even eligible. thank you. wage loss

252
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:34,370
and that for seven days. it's not gonna be ever covered unless you're off for a long enough time. in

253
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:40,230
this case for a few days. if your offer thirty days. that first week is on you.

254
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:45,310
fair or not doesn't matter. these laws are written to discourage

255
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:50,550
time off. so for for real injury and only cost a few days.

256
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:55,690
there isn't any incentive to be off work on the part the work for or not. that's just the way

257
00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:00,762
it said Mississippi seven eight it's five days and those five days can be

258
00:24:00,762 --> 00:24:05,862
covered if you do not work for fourteen days. Michigan is seven days and fourteen days. so you don't

259
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:11,422
get paid for the for seven days. but if you're up for fifteen then go back and cover for the first week.

260
00:24:11,422 --> 00:24:16,582
so again tomorrow think about why. well if it's bad. I can be offered two weeks or longer

261
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:21,602
and maybe we should pay you for your first week of April. so yeah

262
00:24:21,602 --> 00:24:27,202
if you think that's. perhaps there wanna call schedule

263
00:24:27,202 --> 00:24:33,102
loss. so that means that there's a table in the workout club that says

264
00:24:33,102 --> 00:24:38,282
you lost your finger at your index finger. because cost different

265
00:24:38,282 --> 00:24:43,342
little things and either using or use the function of the finger

266
00:24:43,342 --> 00:24:48,342
or whatever body part is on the schedule and then they say will the little

267
00:24:48,342 --> 00:24:53,722
thing is worth next week's wage loss and we'll just pay next week's for that

268
00:24:53,722 --> 00:24:59,130
lost a little finger. and so here's a little table computers

269
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:04,390
the loss of your hand in Delaware. I was in Mississippi how many weeks

270
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:09,490
of wages you'd be eligible. if you lost your aunt or

271
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:14,750
lost the use of your. so you can just go down there and see you know

272
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:19,830
in high. you know almost two years worth of wages in Mississippi

273
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:25,570
and I'll double that in Delaware. so

274
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:32,790
there you go. state by state.

275
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:38,470
so the title of this life is Worker's_Comp. lost. are they working.

276
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:43,490
you might guess. I don't know anybody who's not workers comp that they thought it was really

277
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:48,730
a great system to go through. so the fact is that there a_lot_of people who get hurt

278
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:53,970
at work and have no coverage you for this concept

279
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:59,294
of the wife urination coverage depending on same condition depending on where

280
00:25:59,294 --> 00:26:04,334
you happened to get hurt. and and if you not gonna get rich you're

281
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:09,354
not even covered your basic expenses. the way you could. if

282
00:26:09,354 --> 00:26:16,754
you were working. if you're re receiving weight loss. so

283
00:26:16,754 --> 00:26:21,854
at the time of the OSHA shaft was from located. there is this commission.

284
00:26:21,854 --> 00:26:27,534
set of the national commission state Worker's_Compensation laws and the proposal

285
00:26:27,534 --> 00:26:32,734
was that there be a federal minimum standards for work comp laws. in

286
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:37,970
the state statutes if they didn't substantially

287
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:43,150
improved because there were significant problems recognizing state workers counselors

288
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:48,430
and congress didn't support doing that so the arrival.

289
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:53,790
there are no minimum federal standards for work comp loss. so this is report

290
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:58,930
from the US Department_of_Labor from October. just a few months ago and

291
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:04,390
the title of the report is does the workers compensation system fulfill our obligations

292
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:09,630
to injured workers. so you can tell from the title of this document. the answer is probably

293
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:15,370
no so it's just a few quotes from. this is the Department_of_Labor

294
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:21,050
publication the only major component of the social safety now. with no federal oversight

295
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:26,450
or minimum national standards. working people are at greater risk of selling in poverty

296
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:31,630
as a result of workplace injuries and the failure of state Worker's_Comp. campuses systems to provide them with

297
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:36,909
adequate benefits and wait there's more. only a small portion of the overall cost

298
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:42,149
of occupational injury and illness is born by employers. cost are

299
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:48,169
instead shifted away from employers. so you lose the incentive then to

300
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:53,209
improve safety in the work place. this is a true of all obviously

301
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:58,649
but at any event the cost of shipping up to workers and families communities.

302
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:04,309
the other insurance mechanisms and so forth. other social benefits systems have expanded.

303
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:09,629
while the Worker's_Comp. sixteen that has been shrinking. high hazard employers

304
00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:14,669
have fewer incentives to eliminate workplace hazards and actually prevent injuries

305
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:20,569
from occurring. so it's all about prevention rights in injured workers or families and other

306
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:25,629
benefit programs effectively subsidize high hazard employers. so with

307
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:32,369
all the shifting. those are the how the economic forces

308
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:37,441
are affected this is a little bit of an old report

309
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:42,461
this is from Fellowship from two years ago. and the title of their report is adding

310
00:28:42,461 --> 00:28:47,601
any quality to end your evening. the cost of feeling to protect workers on the job. so this

311
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:52,641
the title of this report is in the question is the statement and it's obvious with they're staying with your

312
00:28:52,641 --> 00:28:57,981
sinks on this case as the quote is for affiliate many employers to prevent millions of her injuries

313
00:28:57,981 --> 00:29:03,641
and illnesses each year. and the filter the broken Worker's_Compensation system should say six pounds.

314
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:08,861
to ensure that workers do not hear the cost of their injuries and illnesses are truly adding any quality

315
00:29:08,861 --> 00:29:15,041
to injury. so there's a little

316
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:20,181
nugget about Worker's_Compensation. so I understand you know your medical

317
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:25,461
care cost your water loss wages are covered. okay. we

318
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:31,821
need to be in the schedule losses and death benefit. there's a significant very ability

319
00:29:31,821 --> 00:29:37,461
Worker's_Comp.. it tends to not cover not only

320
00:29:37,461 --> 00:29:51,201
injuries but especially occupational illnesses and that there's all this hot shifting.

321
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:56,281
so yes as a question about the cost shipping about sales. I go to work

322
00:29:56,281 --> 00:30:01,581
and I trip over something and I don't mind any and all like that

323
00:30:01,581 --> 00:30:06,781
wait a few days to report the injury in the places. wish to long. you not.

324
00:30:06,781 --> 00:30:12,201
we're not gonna cover you under Worker's_Comp.. you got your own doctor with the work injury.

325
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:17,341
and now you are covered. see if you have your own personal insurance. or self

326
00:30:17,341 --> 00:30:22,501
pay for under personal insurance. so the employer didn't have an incentive event to prevent your injury you tripped over something

327
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:27,761
at work. maybe there could be some corrective action. but instead of the employer

328
00:30:27,761 --> 00:30:33,001
or the employers premiums sort of insurance for Worker's_Comp..

329
00:30:33,001 --> 00:30:44,847
tending for that entry. it's now paid for by another insurance mechanism

330
00:30:44,847 --> 00:30:49,927
personal insurance would not cover. knowingly cover work injuries. because

331
00:30:49,927 --> 00:30:55,347
there's this is supper mechanism. and this is the United_States right so there are countries

332
00:30:55,347 --> 00:31:00,807
where they say don't care if you covered at work or not I don't care if your ass is really need to work or not.

333
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:05,907
you have any this or not calling or you have an injury and we're gonna cover you. but the fact

334
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:11,707
of the matter is. our system is very different Worker's_Compensation

335
00:31:11,707 --> 00:31:17,027
in this exclusive remedy for work related injuries and illnesses. so

336
00:31:17,027 --> 00:31:22,167
much of end you know message work related gets covered under other method is some's free clinics

337
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:55,925
if you don't have insurance and so forth. bye

338
00:31:55,925 --> 00:32:01,405
your

339
00:32:01,405 --> 00:32:06,525
part. you lost your finger. you have_to go to bed after work there. but certainly

340
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:11,545
for whatever reason. if you moved to a different state or something or you were afraid that it's

341
00:32:11,545 --> 00:32:16,805
unsafe to work there. you have no obligation to buy. yes your phone

342
00:32:16,805 --> 00:32:22,105
to be capable work and they offer you a job.

343
00:32:22,105 --> 00:32:27,165
you can do with limitations or not. and you say no I'm

344
00:32:27,165 --> 00:32:32,525
afraid I'm not going to then I'll just stop paying. so you won't be eligible for. for wage

345
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:37,625
loss. if you are felt to be capable of going back to work

346
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:42,697
in some capacity you're always free to quit employment

347
00:32:42,697 --> 00:32:52,457
and go work somewhere. question.

348
00:32:52,457 --> 00:32:58,997
yeah so are they required to take you back.

349
00:32:58,997 --> 00:33:04,397
yeah you're supposed to be able to come back to a job that you're capable of forming

350
00:33:04,397 --> 00:33:09,397
in there. they can't fire you because you are. you have

351
00:33:09,397 --> 00:33:14,579
some physical impairment now. that this other legal

352
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:19,599
issues but yeah here. you wouldn't be you wouldn't be terminated because you had a work

353
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:42,719
injury you would have a legal case.

354
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:47,759
well if you missed work. even if you made two million dollars a year. your

355
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:53,259
wages are weight loss is cap. they probably be covered executive

356
00:33:53,259 --> 00:33:58,319
with. you can come would probably be managed in

357
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:03,539
some different fashion. anyway. okay.

358
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:08,799
so another very different topics. so this is shift work and help

359
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:14,016
and I think it's a pretty fascinating stuff. I so

360
00:34:14,016 --> 00:34:19,236
first. what is shift work and specially in the word is. anything

361
00:34:19,236 --> 00:34:24,336
is not get up in the morning go to work and come home have dinner. so it's something

362
00:34:24,336 --> 00:34:29,356
outside of that kind of more getting up time. six seven eight and the

363
00:34:29,356 --> 00:34:34,616
morning or whatever and then working normal shift or whatever and then

364
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:39,676
coming home. but the fact is definitions very tremendously and just

365
00:34:39,676 --> 00:34:44,996
kids that's something that is very important terms of understanding the help

366
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:50,136
that the shift work and that is. there's so many variables in terms of just finding it

367
00:34:50,136 --> 00:34:55,856
in people work so many different kinds of animal or non- standard shift.

368
00:34:55,856 --> 00:35:01,236
that the LG is very challenging and very difficult. so

369
00:35:01,236 --> 00:35:06,336
some people. a_lot_of people work. just daylight hours or write some paper work afternoon shift

370
00:35:06,336 --> 00:35:11,724
and not quite as bad to go to work at two thirty and get done at ten thirty. not so bad

371
00:35:11,724 --> 00:35:17,164
one of the plants that I cover in Brownstown Township yourself the airport.

372
00:35:17,164 --> 00:35:22,164
they work for ten hour shifts a week and the second shift starts

373
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:27,444
at seven p.m. and they go to five thirty in the morning. it's kinda like a weird

374
00:35:27,444 --> 00:35:32,884
hybrid between the afternoons and midnight. the hours maintenance. starting

375
00:35:32,884 --> 00:35:37,924
early. so there's always very ability. I have friends in college who during

376
00:35:37,924 --> 00:35:43,464
the summer. we're gonna steel mill down the river and they work the swing shift three weeks

377
00:35:43,464 --> 00:35:48,504
three weeks ten days. then they rotated three weeks and afternoons. and they rotated three

378
00:35:48,504 --> 00:35:53,924
weeks on this nights. talking about turning your schedule upside down.

379
00:35:53,924 --> 00:35:59,244
but there are rotations like that. the fact of the matter is there are millions

380
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:04,264
of people who work some kind of alternate shipped. according to your labor

381
00:36:04,264 --> 00:36:10,024
statistics about fifteen million full time workers in the US maybe a little bit higher

382
00:36:10,024 --> 00:36:15,276
in your so hi and to find it is critical in terms

383
00:36:15,276 --> 00:36:20,536
of understanding the health tax which is what we're eventually gonna get to. after

384
00:36:20,536 --> 00:36:25,616
we talk about nature of shift work and the nature of the just

385
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:30,696
out on the body. so the international agency for research on cancer which

386
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:35,736
I think you heard about right tire. they said you really need to specify certain

387
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:40,756
domains with respect to during doing research. and this is Sarah

388
00:36:40,756 --> 00:36:46,616
commonsense in my mind. you need to know what the issue system is. what time do you start.

389
00:36:46,616 --> 00:36:51,976
how many hours are you working today. do you rotate like to swing shift

390
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:57,036
example or is it permanent. some people. not sure if they're

391
00:36:57,036 --> 00:37:02,136
going at ten thirty to get out at six thirty. they just nine dollars and that's the way they

392
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:07,196
like to do it and they don't change. so with the regular the regular is. if you

393
00:37:07,196 --> 00:37:12,296
do rotate what's the speed power the direction of the rotation you go to from first

394
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:17,562
to third. the second go for first or second or third there's different ways of doing

395
00:37:17,562 --> 00:37:24,282
it. some better than others and worse than others. how many years are you a particular

396
00:37:24,282 --> 00:37:29,282
non- standard schedule and then if you do let's say ER

397
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:34,382
docs work flow. some of them twenty four hour shifts and full time. I

398
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:40,082
can't remember things like twelve fourteen shifts in the month. see work a twenty four hour shift and you're off.

399
00:37:40,082 --> 00:37:45,682
so what's the intensity. if you do work these abnormal shift. then

400
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:50,982
you know for nurses a_lot_of nurses work three twelve's. that's full time anybody know about

401
00:37:50,982 --> 00:37:56,662
work three twelve. right. it's also

402
00:37:56,662 --> 00:38:02,722
a potential full time frame. you get paid full time for three twelve's and you really packing.

403
00:38:02,722 --> 00:38:07,822
so and then what about flight a chance. we're

404
00:38:07,822 --> 00:38:13,142
flying in court. you know going from California to Hawaii. five hour time difference

405
00:38:13,142 --> 00:38:18,844
for Michigan. five hour time difference flight in some point. so now you call

406
00:38:18,844 --> 00:38:26,724
now you create a different fine shift where you shipping time zones.

407
00:38:26,724 --> 00:38:31,744
in in terms of not getting in the biology. it's still light. when

408
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:36,764
we should be in the dark. this abnormal light at night daily.

409
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:42,224
it is Monday afternoons. he is very important in terms of affecting

410
00:38:42,224 --> 00:38:48,784
our strategic. so like pollution. lots of nice are no longer dark.

411
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:53,944
folks like you. sometimes stay up late reading. so the lights on and when you should

412
00:38:53,944 --> 00:38:59,044
be sleeping. when your body is reacting to

413
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:06,164
two o'clock in the morning. and it should be dark with the lights on and he's having an impact on your body.

414
00:39:06,164 --> 00:39:11,344
and then there's long work hours. where you call long you know forty hours fifty hours a week so

415
00:39:11,344 --> 00:39:16,544
in this case the definition is fifty hours and that includes lots of US

416
00:39:16,544 --> 00:39:21,838
work you're just a bar chart certain occupations

417
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,898
a law enforcement protective Services. half of them lots of

418
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:32,418
fire fire fighters police work twenty four hour shifts or twelve's.

419
00:39:32,418 --> 00:39:37,418
you need tonight's nights food crap. get up in the morning go to work in the bakery at

420
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:43,058
two a.m.. alright. transportation Health Care. personal care.

421
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:48,698
so on and so forth. you can imagine all the people that you work these hours.

422
00:39:48,698 --> 00:39:53,964
and this is a little bit of an eye chart but basically what it says is between six thirty

423
00:39:53,964 --> 00:40:00,004
in the morning and four thirty. you've got about seventy two seventy three percent

424
00:40:00,004 --> 00:40:05,884
of workers captured who start work.

425
00:40:05,884 --> 00:40:10,924
basically in the morning and come home in the afternoon. example I gave you these

426
00:40:10,924 --> 00:40:16,064
ten hour shift that started at seven p.m.. between six thirty p.m. to eight thirty only one.

427
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:21,144
one percent of the full time workers work that kind of a schedule.

428
00:40:21,144 --> 00:40:26,164
so. so you can just see and up shirt and

429
00:40:26,164 --> 00:40:31,284
this graph year how many workers are either working at night. we're very

430
00:40:31,284 --> 00:40:37,084
bullshit shifts. so little bit about the basics because

431
00:40:37,084 --> 00:40:42,724
the science of the health effects. shift work

432
00:40:42,724 --> 00:40:48,764
is not right there suggestion science but in terms of cost Sally.

433
00:40:48,764 --> 00:40:53,797
there not a_lot_of hard determination. so. so

434
00:40:53,797 --> 00:40:59,177
some of the basics. so you can understand how is it shift to work. can

435
00:40:59,177 --> 00:41:04,217
have an impact on diabetes or cancer rate or something like that.

436
00:41:04,217 --> 00:41:09,577
does that even makes sense. so to. so the basics are Katie and resumes

437
00:41:09,577 --> 00:41:15,057
and you as you can read there. it's always different systems in the body that have

438
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:20,537
processes that follow kind of a twenty four hour cycle. in the primary

439
00:41:20,537 --> 00:41:25,597
factor. that guy needs these reasons. so can you give me as as it

440
00:41:25,597 --> 00:41:31,197
is light and darkness. some other things but mostly like to

441
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:36,837
enter and if you to another Hamilton plant this evening.

442
00:41:36,837 --> 00:41:47,537
micros. bye.

443
00:41:47,537 --> 00:41:54,117
have a quick question this is full time workers I have_to go back to the source which is in the fine print on the bottom

444
00:41:54,117 --> 00:41:59,217
to see you soon. military question. the workers are

445
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:08,117
the something else. you know our student workers.

446
00:42:08,117 --> 00:42:13,177
so in terms of the basics and in skating reasons.

447
00:42:13,177 --> 00:42:18,977
these processes are cycles are actually week cycles which are probably the most prominent.

448
00:42:18,977 --> 00:42:26,117
our body temperature fluctuations blood pressure Pharmacy. so creation metabolism digestion.

449
00:42:26,117 --> 00:42:31,157
glucose control. space is self cycle regulation all of these

450
00:42:31,157 --> 00:42:36,397
things are in train to Marsha Katie and groups. so you heard about

451
00:42:36,397 --> 00:42:42,557
biological clocks. so this is interesting concept that

452
00:42:42,557 --> 00:42:48,357
that this includes groupings of interacting Malik in individual sales throughout our

453
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:53,575
county. okay. not just eight o'clock but essentially clocks that

454
00:42:53,575 --> 00:42:58,615
are functioning within sales throughout the body. there is

455
00:42:58,615 --> 00:43:03,835
a master clock. what. some of you may know where super kinda somatic nuclear super

456
00:43:03,835 --> 00:43:08,935
means about high asthma beams. where the optic nerves. Cross

457
00:43:08,935 --> 00:43:14,115
it was just an expensive work for a part of the brain about where the nearest

458
00:43:14,115 --> 00:43:19,235
cross in the high palace and control production

459
00:43:19,235 --> 00:43:24,315
melatonin and melatonin. if you've ever taken one to help

460
00:43:24,315 --> 00:43:29,555
and do sleeping is's. is that's what it's produce produce for

461
00:43:29,555 --> 00:43:35,115
and to now. we've got a link with the hyper elements and melatonin.

462
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:40,755
that can link system. so the function of the brain that screening melatonin.

463
00:43:40,755 --> 00:43:46,435
that can lead to an outage in different systems in our building kind of a

464
00:43:46,435 --> 00:43:51,575
an understanding of how this can. this issue can

465
00:43:51,575 --> 00:43:56,673
relate to the re study systems so

466
00:43:56,673 --> 00:44:01,933
part your kitty resumes are in train to the extreme government. certain repair

467
00:44:01,933 --> 00:44:06,993
signals but especially select our site. so that's the most important

468
00:44:06,993 --> 00:44:12,653
other things like when you eat tends to. also mark

469
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:18,033
our treatment in terms of our routine. course our house.

470
00:44:18,033 --> 00:44:23,153
when we eat. isn't as routine as the sun coming up and going

471
00:44:23,153 --> 00:44:28,553
down. so it's really the light dark cycle that is the most important

472
00:44:28,553 --> 00:44:33,873
and melatonin is producing and it actually with his secretions.

473
00:44:33,873 --> 00:44:39,273
transmit information throughout the body to all the molecular

474
00:44:39,273 --> 00:44:45,013
biological clocks that exist throughout the body. so

475
00:44:45,013 --> 00:44:50,513
two basic drives that are important part of the light

476
00:44:50,513 --> 00:44:55,515
cycle and that is first the wait from this drive so there is the way from

477
00:44:55,515 --> 00:45:01,415
us driving is really into this learning system. as part I can tell.

478
00:45:01,415 --> 00:45:06,995
I'm not sure even what exactly the learning system is or if it's been defined

479
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:12,815
but it allows us to be somewhat alert through sixteen hour day

480
00:45:12,815 --> 00:45:18,075
and that is what links there is synchronize or biological clock

481
00:45:18,075 --> 00:45:23,175
in so you get up in the morning and then the learning signal tends to increase during the course

482
00:45:23,175 --> 00:45:28,695
of the day. attendance just case a little gift toward

483
00:45:28,695 --> 00:45:33,895
you know in the middle of the night. when most of us are sleeping and when our bodies are

484
00:45:33,895 --> 00:45:39,515
built to be sleeping and then it starts to increase and by the way

485
00:45:39,515 --> 00:45:44,635
in about an hour or so. it takes a little bit so that little thing

486
00:45:44,635 --> 00:45:49,815
out that sometimes you get just because you're sitting and listening to my mind at home.

487
00:45:49,815 --> 00:45:55,541
but also to read something to the learning signal taking a little dip in the later afternoon

488
00:45:55,541 --> 00:46:00,661
that is by logically reason for being a little bit

489
00:46:00,661 --> 00:46:05,901
sleepy. so if else is awake from this drive. learning signal

490
00:46:05,901 --> 00:46:11,081
there is the sleep drive. there are no evidence of in the brain that controls the drive

491
00:46:11,081 --> 00:46:16,281
to sleep and you know if you wait a few hours

492
00:46:16,281 --> 00:46:21,501
and it gets late. I just become sleep here. you all know that.

493
00:46:21,501 --> 00:46:27,021
if you stay up too long. you just can't take it any more and you and you not out. so

494
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:32,697
the drive just leave obviously just space as the night goes on and

495
00:46:32,697 --> 00:46:39,597
it eventually reads Regis it's Loan Point. so it's this

496
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:45,337
alert just driving to sleep. drives that are operating separately

497
00:46:45,337 --> 00:46:50,857
in secret. that are affecting

498
00:46:50,857 --> 00:46:56,597
us in terms of archer keys and your synchronize. all this beautiful.

499
00:46:56,597 --> 00:47:01,697
we're learned during the day and we sleep well during the night and

500
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:06,837
the thing that can be the most effective in disrupting the is like tonight night.

501
00:47:06,837 --> 00:47:12,317
so my wife who is technology and in our family

502
00:47:12,317 --> 00:47:17,837
is now reading at night with red. I can't remember not having the bright light

503
00:47:17,837 --> 00:47:23,337
screen or even a reading light Jostens.

504
00:47:23,337 --> 00:47:28,438
five C Ashley Drive. it's Mark. so it makes a difference so

505
00:47:28,438 --> 00:47:33,638
here's a little chart where things are synchronized. so you start at nine

506
00:47:33,638 --> 00:47:38,658
in the morning and you go through to nine p.m. and then dark represents leave and then

507
00:47:38,658 --> 00:47:44,178
nine in the morning and you can see the sleep drive increase as the day goes

508
00:47:44,178 --> 00:47:49,178
and we get later and later in the sleep drive increases. the alerting signal when we get up

509
00:47:49,178 --> 00:47:54,178
grows during the day and peaks and then it drops off and that's when

510
00:47:54,178 --> 00:47:59,418
we sleep in our learners drops off. so that's that's how it works. when

511
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:05,119
things are how it should be. if there's an in balance

512
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:10,779
and the timing of the signals learning signal versus the

513
00:48:10,779 --> 00:48:16,099
sleeping as you have trouble sleeping and and

514
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:21,678
when you try to sleep during the day. if you work the night shift you might have trouble because

515
00:48:21,678 --> 00:48:26,898
of the mismatch between these drives and the time that you're trying to do something

516
00:48:26,898 --> 00:48:32,014
that your body isn't well suited for. some people can handle

517
00:48:32,014 --> 00:48:37,814
it well some people not. so if they don't handle it well then it can be a problem.

518
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:43,254
so the top the top. hey this is Jay worker.

519
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:48,254
and this basically represents the same kind of pattern you have_to sleep

520
00:48:48,254 --> 00:48:53,314
growing sleep drive and growing from morning two at night

521
00:48:53,314 --> 00:48:58,554
and that way for Ms. Price growing during the day and then you sleep.

522
00:48:58,554 --> 00:49:04,375
when you are alert this drive is a minimum. and

523
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:09,635
and the sleep drive has put you in a nice blissful sleep the night shift workers

524
00:49:09,635 --> 00:49:15,154
and trying to sleep between nine a.m. and three p.m.. when the alert

525
00:49:15,154 --> 00:49:20,294
signal is growing and the sleep drive is at a minimal. so if you've ever

526
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:25,574
had jet lag or you trying to sleep in your all your wide open. it's three a.m..

527
00:49:25,574 --> 00:49:32,697
that's the mismatch between you learning signal and the wait list in this week drive

528
00:49:32,697 --> 00:49:37,897
alright so little bit of understanding about that now move to the Halifax which I already said

529
00:49:37,897 --> 00:49:43,657
our summer ten was in terms of cost family but there's a_lot_of research that is at least suggestions

530
00:49:43,657 --> 00:49:49,297
if not more. so the help factor related to this

531
00:49:49,297 --> 00:49:55,297
miss match restricted sleep miss alignment is for Katie and rhythm.

532
00:49:55,297 --> 00:50:00,937
and so there are certain kinds of affects one would be sleeping. which is kind of obvious.

533
00:50:00,937 --> 00:50:05,977
and if you're sleepy. not quite as alert. not quite as focus for

534
00:50:05,977 --> 00:50:11,037
your performance can suffer your productivity at work myself or and maybe

535
00:50:11,037 --> 00:50:16,677
unsafe to do certain things. you do why Doctor doing an operation on you.

536
00:50:16,677 --> 00:50:22,837
when the physician hasn't slept in twenty hours or something. alright so.

537
00:50:22,837 --> 00:50:28,977
there's also a potential fax on chronic disease. so heart disease

538
00:50:28,977 --> 00:50:35,051
metabolic disease is Gee I guess intestinal cancers.

539
00:50:35,051 --> 00:50:40,531
there are links. and as I said there many of the

540
00:50:40,531 --> 00:50:46,010
associations that have been reported on are not fully excepted as possible.

541
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:51,210
so when you possibly because now you lost some

542
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:56,490
degree of alert and there's a challenges your memory. your performance. your efficiency

543
00:50:56,490 --> 00:51:01,851
at work and this is very interesting if you have somebody who sleepy

544
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:06,871
and has had some difficulty with this

545
00:51:06,871 --> 00:51:12,311
mismatch. how they're doing this and I'm doing okay. and you're always doing worse than they think they are.

546
00:51:12,311 --> 00:51:17,351
so you measure somebody's performance and you're always doing worse or

547
00:51:17,351 --> 00:51:23,031
also is doing worse than they think they are. they're more important. in period and they think they're.

548
00:51:23,031 --> 00:51:28,450
it's very important because you don't you know have a good sense for your own performance

549
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:34,646
and just delete yours and injuries. so this report

550
00:51:34,646 --> 00:51:39,987
compared to the relative rate injury

551
00:51:39,987 --> 00:51:45,027
on second shift or third shift compare to three shift workers and lease in

552
00:51:45,027 --> 00:51:50,567
this particular research. it shows that they're significantly increased

553
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:56,547
rates injury on the afternoon shift and even almost double that

554
00:51:56,547 --> 00:52:02,707
on the night shift. so this is highly traffic and registration.

555
00:52:02,707 --> 00:52:07,886
at estimates a hundred thousand police report crashes pre-

556
00:52:07,886 --> 00:52:13,207
year. due to driver for T tech people lot of injuries

557
00:52:13,207 --> 00:52:19,927
mobility in mortality and a_lot_of money spent on these kinds of problems.

558
00:52:19,927 --> 00:52:24,987
doctors in training working shifts over twenty four hours have increased risks or serious medical

559
00:52:24,987 --> 00:52:30,346
or getting needle sticks. nothing intention of getting into a car crash

560
00:52:30,346 --> 00:52:36,826
driving home. these things this things clearly happen

561
00:52:36,826 --> 00:52:41,846
and then there's another fax to me. if you work in your home for

562
00:52:41,846 --> 00:52:47,866
dinner or if you're work and you're working the night shift you're not there when your kids get up.

563
00:52:47,866 --> 00:52:52,886
you're not available. so there's these disruptions in what our

564
00:52:52,886 --> 00:52:58,346
normal family kinds of events that typical families.

565
00:52:58,346 --> 00:53:04,050
do you get and and also

566
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:09,180
these office can interfere with your ability to do other things outside of work.

567
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:14,220
exercise prepare food in and do and then they have a text can be confirmed

568
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:19,540
because sometimes shift workers tend to be more prone to drink alcohol

569
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:25,100
or smoke. as an example. part to the risk of medical diagnosis

570
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:30,280
call. shift work sleep disorder. so this is specific medical

571
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:35,920
diagnosis. and there are criteria that this organization International classification

572
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,640
of sleep disorders. typically sleep specialist position sourcing specialist

573
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:47,080
neurologist or pulmonary physicians. that tends to be

574
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:52,160
two groups that are sleep specialist. so anyway which shift for sleep

575
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:57,540
disorders there's a sleep disturbance because of disruption of your kitty in rhythm.

576
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:02,900
so there's insomnia difficulty sleeping. excessive daytime

577
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:07,917
sleep units are both and then you get sleep disturbance fractured sleep and

578
00:54:07,917 --> 00:54:14,977
so forth and function is now in period. so in addition to those criteria.

579
00:54:14,977 --> 00:54:20,217
the insomnia or excessive sleeping is is temporally your

580
00:54:20,217 --> 00:54:25,337
time. related to recurring work schedule. that is non-standard

581
00:54:25,337 --> 00:54:30,577
sure overlaps usual time for sleep and symptoms

582
00:54:30,577 --> 00:54:35,757
are lasting at least for a month because we all don't get enough sleep

583
00:54:35,757 --> 00:54:40,797
now and then we have some excessive daytime sleep in this and so forth all of us experienced that but it's

584
00:54:40,797 --> 00:54:46,057
Wendy Ian happens for ongoing period of time. been

585
00:54:46,057 --> 00:54:51,097
a crazy ass one criteria and fulfilling disorder. these

586
00:54:51,097 --> 00:54:57,977
services calls clinically significant distress or functional impairment. and

587
00:54:57,977 --> 00:55:03,725
in that there's a miss alignment of some Canadian reasons in

588
00:55:03,725 --> 00:55:08,825
frequently in the position. give an individual a diary to keep track

589
00:55:08,825 --> 00:55:14,185
of when you go to sleep when I get up home only sleep so forth. so the estimated

590
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:20,025
day shift work sleep disorder. it's probably only about twenty five percent of the general population

591
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:25,185
but those are non- standard shift to ten to twenty three percent. so

592
00:55:25,185 --> 00:55:30,265
very high problems and populations that are working

593
00:55:30,265 --> 00:55:36,285
on standard ships. so characteristics to sleep to ration tends to be less.

594
00:55:36,285 --> 00:55:41,325
and those are non- standard shift workers and then those same

595
00:55:41,325 --> 00:55:48,245
shift workers but who don't have shippers sleep. just worse or less hours of sleep.

596
00:55:48,245 --> 00:55:53,525
you go to sleep like this. so you lay your head down and with in

597
00:55:53,525 --> 00:55:58,585
and average two point three minutes. you're asleep. so that's all sleep late and seen the time

598
00:55:58,585 --> 00:56:03,639
from and intending to go to sleep which to choose a point which you

599
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:09,419
actually falling asleep. two. three minutes is pass logic

600
00:56:09,419 --> 00:56:14,619
six you can falsely instantly. the average slate and see if her sleep

601
00:56:14,619 --> 00:56:20,259
is three minutes and in people who are not deal with any kind of

602
00:56:20,259 --> 00:56:25,279
shippers sleep disorder test to go to sleep it takes ten to twenty

603
00:56:25,279 --> 00:56:30,279
minutes of trying to go to sleep before you actually sleep so and these people often have excessive

604
00:56:30,279 --> 00:56:35,599
sleeping. so how you measure actually penis. what is what's called a multiple sleep

605
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:40,619
latency test test that's leaking as per say but it measures some latency.

606
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:45,699
so that's a link link of time in minutes required to transition from weight from

607
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:50,739
to being asleep and obviously if it only takes two minutes. you're very

608
00:56:50,739 --> 00:56:55,859
sleepy. you must be very sleepy. to only take two minutes to fall asleep. it's not

609
00:56:55,859 --> 00:57:01,071
normal to take so please

610
00:57:01,071 --> 00:57:06,151
leave a test of five ten minutes. so if you're smart. a daytime sleep penis. that

611
00:57:06,151 --> 00:57:11,291
includes all lot of the US population. about twenty percent of the general population because most

612
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:16,551
of us don't get enough sleep less than five minutes is excessive.

613
00:57:16,551 --> 00:57:22,851
and that and actually includes a fairly significant seven point seven percent of the general population.

614
00:57:22,851 --> 00:57:27,991
okay so no let's link it to. how is it Dan. getting not getting

615
00:57:27,991 --> 00:57:33,031
enough sleep. I have a shift with sleep disorder for example. can

616
00:57:33,031 --> 00:57:38,551
call these various kinds of medical conditions. the biological possibilities

617
00:57:38,551 --> 00:57:44,631
are very talked about that's repeating resumes that Philip Tony Mister Miller calling.

618
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:49,831
this just you throughout the body that can affect five o'clock spot in the endocrine

619
00:57:49,831 --> 00:57:54,931
system and the nervous system and so we know that you disrupt your Katie

620
00:57:54,931 --> 00:58:01,129
and rhythm. and it can affect your blood pressure Lis it's like cholesterol and triglycerides.

621
00:58:01,129 --> 00:58:06,449
might increase your stress response. activating your sympathetic nervous system

622
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:12,589
disturbances of your metabolism. elevated fasting blood glucose

623
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:18,049
and as I said there are associations in their Park and founders because shippers tend to be

624
00:58:18,049 --> 00:58:23,809
more more likely to smoke. I have poor guy have higher BMI so

625
00:58:23,809 --> 00:58:28,849
there. I'm following up with respect and understanding. if it isn't

626
00:58:28,849 --> 00:58:34,729
just from the shift work sleep disorder. for example or is it related to these associated

627
00:58:34,729 --> 00:58:39,889
lifestyle behaviors. so for shift work

628
00:58:39,889 --> 00:58:45,049
sleep disorder there does not appear to be any link with all. cost more

629
00:58:45,049 --> 00:58:50,389
tally. so there's least

630
00:58:50,389 --> 00:58:55,569
evidence as far as there does not appear to be a link in there. however

631
00:58:55,569 --> 00:59:00,569
sleeps to ration. there are no repeatedly appear to be a

632
00:59:00,569 --> 00:59:06,129
link with all across mortality so you have a very short sleeved ration like glass in your vehicle.

633
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:11,509
to six hours. night. it's significantly associated with wrist.

634
00:59:11,509 --> 00:59:16,649
all of us. we're at Calvary. risk isn't that great. it's like one. one

635
00:59:16,649 --> 00:59:21,769
two. confidence interval doesn't corporate zero.

636
00:59:21,769 --> 00:59:27,209
for statistical a significant. they're beautiful. one.

637
00:59:27,209 --> 00:59:32,509
six one. one eight. compare to longer sleep here. okay.

638
00:59:32,509 --> 00:59:37,629
so but on the other hand and the other and if you sleep more than nine hours

639
00:59:37,629 --> 00:59:42,869
quote too long. that's all associate. not only with risk but a greater

640
00:59:42,869 --> 00:59:48,081
risk than sleeping. too loo in this case the relative risk is one. two two one.

641
00:59:48,081 --> 00:59:53,921
three eight. see you shake too little too much inside building lots problem.

642
00:59:53,921 --> 00:59:58,921
right in the middle of the sweet spot where the porch is just right track. bring your time and is not gonna

643
00:59:58,921 --> 01:00:04,061
be to call. so. so. so you this interesting you

644
01:00:04,061 --> 01:00:09,841
shipped those response to to loosely. I not asleep and

645
01:00:09,841 --> 01:00:15,061
too much and keep in mind that if the relative risk is fairly low like

646
01:00:15,061 --> 01:00:20,641
one. one two. that's in Chester fairly

647
01:00:20,641 --> 01:00:25,661
long increased risk right but if you applied that to a population of millions then

648
01:00:25,661 --> 01:00:30,701
we're talking a_lot_of people right so there's that concept of a population tribute of

649
01:00:30,701 --> 01:00:35,901
risk numbers of people. as opposed to five times the risk

650
01:00:35,901 --> 01:00:50,418
and much more exposure. question

651
01:00:50,418 --> 01:00:55,478
yes for questions with the because people sleep longer other conditions. that

652
01:00:55,478 --> 01:01:00,758
leaves them to have more recent Kelly. honestly I don't know the answer to the question

653
01:01:00,758 --> 01:01:06,098
will be a good one to look up Ashley for me and looking to so. good question.

654
01:01:06,098 --> 01:01:11,118
I don't know the answer. okay. any other questions.

655
01:01:11,118 --> 01:01:16,138
so apologies. there's just a balance. so

656
01:01:16,138 --> 01:01:21,818
these are just summaries from literature in terms of because reality cardiovascular

657
01:01:21,818 --> 01:01:27,278
disease or suggestions Margaret Evans. that there's a link for increased part of yesterday's ease

658
01:01:27,278 --> 01:01:32,658
in shift with you for metabolic syndrome. is anybody heard of metabolic

659
01:01:32,658 --> 01:01:40,610
syndrome. it's got more more play syndrome when you get a collection

660
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:45,810
factory condition. so and they're all risk factors for cardiovascular

661
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:52,350
is or diabetes and stroke. so the risk factors that are included.

662
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:57,470
to find my metabolic syndrome. our will be city

663
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:02,590
increased triglycerides decreased. HDL high density like

664
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:08,150
a protein that's the good cholesterol so decreased HDL. increase blood pressure and increased

665
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:14,890
fasting blood sugar. your suggestion might have written evidence that shift work. I

666
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:20,350
may be a call factor for metabolic

667
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:25,490
syndrome diabetes. this is from a recent matter

668
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:30,850
analysis that who the adjuster to ratio between

669
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:36,494
every exposure to shift working diabetes was one. oh nine

670
01:02:36,494 --> 01:02:41,554
conference your vote doesn't cross zero. so higher in men and women.

671
01:02:41,554 --> 01:02:47,194
so again some suggestions about evidence of a call. only

672
01:02:47,194 --> 01:02:53,214
have_to cultures these are some strong evidence with the risk of twice out_of date workers

673
01:02:53,214 --> 01:02:58,454
pregnancy outcome there's good evidence of an association with low birth weight.

674
01:02:58,454 --> 01:03:05,014
pre- term birth and spontaneous abortion.

675
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:10,094
and there's a question of the shift work. exams should be existing diseases

676
01:03:10,094 --> 01:03:16,294
I know when I was heard from Rachel actually trailer here at Saint Joe's Hospital.

677
01:03:16,294 --> 01:03:21,834
I have a real diabetic diabetics who are nurses with difficult to control

678
01:03:21,834 --> 01:03:26,874
diabetes with Doctor Snow this is should not work tonight shift in that

679
01:03:26,874 --> 01:03:32,654
kind of disruption. you know. I was calling in the biological clocks and this

680
01:03:32,654 --> 01:03:37,792
a logical possibility fact David is gonna be more difficult to control.

681
01:03:37,792 --> 01:03:43,632
I don't know if you started actually say it's more difficult to control box

682
01:03:43,632 --> 01:03:49,272
but clinical experience shows that that's that's the case. might also be true for

683
01:03:49,272 --> 01:03:54,452
epilepsy for treating it might be less effective in people or

684
01:03:54,452 --> 01:03:59,672
shippers and there maybe certain conditions

685
01:03:59,672 --> 01:04:04,992
that that works like sleep apnea. Russell

686
01:04:04,992 --> 01:04:11,612
flex Central. so here's a report that train crash

687
01:04:11,612 --> 01:04:17,412
in the cost of the Trinity to someone. the driver of the train has sleep apnea

688
01:04:17,412 --> 01:04:22,752
was not diagnosed. so the driver actually fell asleep because the trains

689
01:04:22,752 --> 01:04:28,232
going through a tight curve in the Bronx. people were killed sixty one

690
01:04:28,232 --> 01:04:33,632
injured and the national trap transportation safety board. Boston

691
01:04:33,632 --> 01:04:38,684
train driver shifting work schedule to this case. exams

692
01:04:38,684 --> 01:04:43,964
are beating his diagnosis of your truck to sleep yet. so first of all you got a truck

693
01:04:43,964 --> 01:04:49,044
to sleep. which means that if it's not been treated. you got problems you got

694
01:04:49,044 --> 01:04:54,164
excessive daytime sleeping and now you're putting this person on a shift work

695
01:04:54,164 --> 01:04:59,264
non- standard work and so now you're just in this case. in retrospect or

696
01:04:59,264 --> 01:05:04,344
ask asking asking for trouble. I had a Ford truck driver who thankfully

697
01:05:04,344 --> 01:05:09,684
just retired last year. he had sleep apnea. that was

698
01:05:09,684 --> 01:05:15,704
way way severe and we fall asleep on his Ford truck repeatedly

699
01:05:15,704 --> 01:05:20,804
and be probably driving in a factory with a fork truck at least several cons

700
01:05:20,804 --> 01:05:26,584
of moving equipment and driving up on two trucks

701
01:05:26,584 --> 01:05:32,544
at the truck truck and so forth so. safety issues there.

702
01:05:32,544 --> 01:05:38,230
okay so hot line at nine ten. breast cancer that was actually in. just published

703
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:44,150
a few months ago. yes. are you strongly against the increasing literature.

704
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:49,390
linking breast cancer and late at night. that has been creek that study

705
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:55,250
has been criticized. I'll just tell you what has been

706
01:05:55,250 --> 01:06:01,190
felt to be the case. with respect to light at nine ten breast cancer. so

707
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:06,470
there so since about mid nineties so for about twenty years or so.

708
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:11,810
there was this so I process is that light and I could be called at press Cancer

709
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:16,890
high reverse cancer. seen industrial voice countries in so

710
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:22,348
shift work with uses this or get further exposure to light at night and

711
01:06:22,348 --> 01:06:27,708
six out_of eight studies in this review. I from various

712
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:33,308
regions including an independent cohort study of nurses on the night shift.

713
01:06:33,308 --> 01:06:38,488
honestly increased risk of breast cancer and long term employees versus was not on

714
01:06:38,488 --> 01:06:43,708
the night shift. some of course a fighting and also showed some increased

715
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:49,648
risk and so again the biological possibility. this for Katie written description

716
01:06:49,648 --> 01:06:55,088
from sleep prevention and light at night. cost decrease melatonin.

717
01:06:55,088 --> 01:07:00,308
can have an impact on sex hormones. I noted

718
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:05,368
that ten percent of jeans or under is for Katie in regulation. all

719
01:07:05,368 --> 01:07:10,548
these clock teams can some of them contractors to Mercer pressures. they can regulate cell

720
01:07:10,548 --> 01:07:16,308
cycle. a top houses for sale. the may damage response. so

721
01:07:16,308 --> 01:07:21,339
here's the groundwork for the biological possibility that could link late at

722
01:07:21,339 --> 01:07:26,519
night staying up at night to work and something like breast cancer.

723
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:32,399
so melatonin may actually be protected against breast cancer. decreasing it by exposure to

724
01:07:32,399 --> 01:07:37,739
artificial light at night. may increase the risk therefore

725
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:43,379
I reported that an animal models. dozens of studies with various light red men's simulated

726
01:07:43,379 --> 01:07:48,559
jet lag. reduced melatonin production and was associated with

727
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:53,599
a major increase in tumor incidents and growth. so now you got animal studies

728
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:59,959
supporting. so. so A.R. I archive from two thousand seven ten years ago.

729
01:07:59,959 --> 01:08:05,339
based on limited evidence in humans for Carthage and the City of shift work that involves network

730
01:08:05,339 --> 01:08:10,719
and sufficient evidence in experimental animals. concluded

731
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:15,919
that shift work that involves Katie and the disruptions probably Carson

732
01:08:15,919 --> 01:08:21,131
Jack to shuman so

733
01:08:21,131 --> 01:08:26,811
you know that I. I'm at the International Agency precision cancer and they said just

734
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:31,911
United_States national toxicology program. also

735
01:08:31,911 --> 01:08:36,991
addresses it has a rating system for Carson regions and

736
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:42,351
NTP. he's currently studying at Health Texas or Keating disruption

737
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:47,571
related to artificial late at night shift work focusing both on cancer but also non- cancer

738
01:08:47,571 --> 01:08:53,031
health outcomes. they accepted this and as a candidate.

739
01:08:53,031 --> 01:08:58,191
topics for study. just last year. and they're in the process of

740
01:08:58,191 --> 01:09:03,191
actually reviewing this right now. so this is an article

741
01:09:03,191 --> 01:09:08,511
from March twenty sixteen. there are ways

742
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:13,651
to manage and help control the L. I do look here

743
01:09:13,651 --> 01:09:18,991
is the fax of shift work in your workers working

744
01:09:18,991 --> 01:09:24,277
with efforts to approve sleep hygiene. there

745
01:09:24,277 --> 01:09:29,337
standard recommendations for improving sleep.

746
01:09:29,337 --> 01:09:34,337
getting to bed earlier. rather than sleeping in. I don't know how

747
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:39,917
many of you experience that if you go to sleep early or to get more sleep. more hours

748
01:09:39,917 --> 01:09:45,157
during the night. you tend to be more rested than if you go to sleep later and sleep in.

749
01:09:45,157 --> 01:09:50,617
in fact if you if you look at some of those charts. if you stay up late

750
01:09:50,617 --> 01:09:55,877
Saturday night because it's the weekend and you sleeping seriously. Saturday night and Sunday

751
01:09:55,877 --> 01:10:01,217
morning. and you need to get up early Monday. you kinda reset your circuit in random.

752
01:10:01,217 --> 01:10:06,397
where you are learning the signal is not getting up and going. when you're getting up and going.

753
01:10:06,397 --> 01:10:11,597
and you can be much more tired. that's typically why people are more tired on Monday

754
01:10:11,597 --> 01:10:16,797
morning. they've kind of shifted there. sure Katie really a little bit mismatch

755
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:23,595
there. just driveway phone us driving their sleep drive so.

756
01:10:23,595 --> 01:10:28,735
so catching up. it's better to get to sleep early rather than sleeping later. dark room for August

757
01:10:28,735 --> 01:10:33,835
reasons we talked about the light at night. being a problem. limiting noise caffeine

758
01:10:33,835 --> 01:10:38,875
nicotine Mark large meals before bed time. excessive fluid and take you're not getting

759
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:43,935
up to speed all the time. alcohol is not good to help

760
01:10:43,935 --> 01:10:49,155
you sleep. I hope you get to sleep and you wake up more exercise and before sleep tends

761
01:10:49,155 --> 01:10:54,315
to get your learning drive going and answer

762
01:10:54,315 --> 01:11:00,675
the release these ways of controlling sleeping the success sleeping that's including

763
01:11:00,675 --> 01:11:05,935
strategic lead time maps even for workers comport could

764
01:11:05,935 --> 01:11:11,135
could support strategically time naps which actually may make

765
01:11:11,135 --> 01:11:16,995
night shift workers or shift workers. more productive and perhaps safer.

766
01:11:16,995 --> 01:11:22,249
so scheduling the work to sign presentation this week

767
01:11:22,249 --> 01:11:28,289
shift. you might not be the best way. we're designing

768
01:11:28,289 --> 01:11:33,409
the swing shift timing. light exposure for example if

769
01:11:33,409 --> 01:11:38,949
you're working at night shift in the hospital. timing light exposure during that time while you're there.

770
01:11:38,949 --> 01:11:43,949
may have a positive impact in keeping you over

771
01:11:43,949 --> 01:11:49,569
and decrease the melatonin production.

772
01:11:49,569 --> 01:11:55,069
and you can see that there's no tone available at the store. okay. so

773
01:11:55,069 --> 01:12:00,649
to take a ways about shift work and sleep.

774
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:05,849
but start with and that is starting this topic is very challenging. I don't do that. gimme

775
01:12:05,849 --> 01:12:11,029
a holler if you myself by controlling. that's after receiving the finding what

776
01:12:11,029 --> 01:12:16,289
your exposure is. so many variations on

777
01:12:16,289 --> 01:12:21,623
non- standard shoes. when you start and how long this is the group

778
01:12:21,623 --> 01:12:26,923
that you're starting happy. do they have uniform exposure so all these

779
01:12:26,923 --> 01:12:32,823
variables make it very difficult to reproduce ability

780
01:12:32,823 --> 01:12:38,003
in research which is why I to find these domains for

781
01:12:38,003 --> 01:12:43,183
defining the. the exposure

782
01:12:43,183 --> 01:12:48,363
to try to make the research more robust and that

783
01:12:48,363 --> 01:12:53,363
there's a very strong link between certain external queues especially light in there for the

784
01:12:53,363 --> 01:12:58,431
logical response in our tricky reasons and

785
01:12:58,431 --> 01:13:03,631
in this understanding that the our Shepherd drive to work and see if you need to wake from the striving

786
01:13:03,631 --> 01:13:08,791
to sleep drive. and so you can now understand how

787
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:14,491
it's biologic leave as possible that there could be a fax on metabolic

788
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:20,331
functions in the body hormones on cancer.

789
01:13:20,331 --> 01:13:26,091
based on light at night. that there's a really broad range of health

790
01:13:26,091 --> 01:13:31,291
shift work and a_lot_of suggestions studies fairly

791
01:13:31,291 --> 01:13:36,351
good because Alan needed terminations but a_lot_of research. so needs to be done in

792
01:13:36,351 --> 01:13:41,411
terms of salary and that there are ways in managing

793
01:13:41,411 --> 01:13:46,531
work that shift. effective shift work. I gotta say my experience even

794
01:13:46,531 --> 01:13:51,591
though the science is been out there. in terms of managing like napping even during

795
01:13:51,591 --> 01:13:56,671
your shift providing opportunities out in light during your shift and so forth in

796
01:13:56,671 --> 01:14:02,272
managing rotations and so forth I'm not aware of the employers

797
01:14:02,272 --> 01:14:07,392
rule applying these testing weeks. I think it's something that

798
01:14:07,392 --> 01:14:12,472
there's an opportunity. I actually mentioned that to the Corey

799
01:14:12,472 --> 01:14:17,512
medical director GM. GM factors work around the clock. even

800
01:14:17,512 --> 01:14:23,112
medical work around the clock. the field cars around the clock. so there's a_lot_of opportunity

801
01:14:23,112 --> 01:14:28,392
I think to manage these help. thanks. okay. so

802
01:14:28,392 --> 01:14:34,232
any questions about shift work. anybody study this or been involved in it.

803
01:14:34,232 --> 01:14:41,432
for questions

804
01:14:41,432 --> 01:14:47,472
comments questions. alright. thanks for listening.

805
01:14:47,472 --> 01:14:53,132
no_one fell asleep as I can see. I tried to see away from those jokes.

806
01:14:53,132 --> 01:14:58,596
it was pretty successful
