1
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:19,010
All right. So unfortunately, we're back up to the height of it. We had a really good meeting and I was like, um, how are you guys doing?

2
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,800
Okay. Almost gotten through the second week.

3
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,560
You look a little more tired than last week. I think I feel the same.

4
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:46,330
It's okay. Oh, no, you're fine. So we're going to keep talking about theories a little bit this week.

5
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:58,050
We've got three, three new ones. So we had readings on social stress and a static load and life course today.

6
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,890
And before I get started with the slides, I just want to hear your your thoughts on the readings.

7
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,950
If there are ones you particularly liked,

8
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:15,480
there were things that you noticed as connections with last week's readings or differences from last week's readings.

9
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,690
Did anybody have favorite. Yeah.

10
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,800
Olivia and she like really into Alice that it goes okay. That okay.

11
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:59,679
I wasn't as familiar with the social stress idea before that one felt a lot more like

12
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,950
last week's readings and just kind of talking about a lot of this inherent complexity.

13
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,060
And then also, I'm not really answering the question. I'm just saying that this is something you need to think about.

14
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:13,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a lot of connections between this, the stress process reading and what we what we read last.

15
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:28,960
It sounded like from the discussion posts, a lot of people really liked the life force theory reading or that one kind of resonated with people.

16
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,520
It is hot. And I thought it was.

17
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,760
Oh. All right. Well, let's start by talking about the social stress theory.

18
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:51,610
And this is my attempt to depict the ideas from this reading and sort of a graphical form.

19
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:59,500
But this always helps me to kind of draw out what the relationships are, especially when there's a whole lot of words.

20
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:08,590
And so thinking about how would I take like, what are the proposed relationships in this model?

21
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:16,450
And if I were going to test it, let's say I wanted to apply this, I wanted to use some data and I wanted to run some models,

22
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,469
like generate some hypotheses, do some analysis, how would I do it?

23
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:28,750
And so sometimes drawing it out like this can be really helpful for thinking about what the modeling strategy would be.

24
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,470
So the social stress theory, like Olivia said,

25
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:42,310
kind of starts with what we were talking about last week that were described as sort of fundamental clauses in that framework.

26
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,670
Carolyn talked about in a social structural position.

27
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:54,580
And so he talks about how our social structural position is determined by things like our social and economic class,

28
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,559
us by race and ethnicity, by gender, by age.

29
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:06,550
And of course, there's other social status that you could put in there to basically anything on which society is stratified.

30
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:17,990
And then the social stress theory is really trying to understand how your position and the social structure influences health outcomes.

31
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,920
And like some of the other readings that we talked about last time.

32
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:33,590
It's not about a specific health outcome. The idea is that these social structural variables influence many different kinds of health outcomes.

33
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:42,140
And so a lot of social stress theory or work that's in this kind of in this tradition focuses on mental health outcomes.

34
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:51,620
But there is work in this on physical health. And so you can see that like there's sort of there's a direct connection,

35
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,000
but this one represents between social structural position and health outcomes.

36
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,310
And then there's indirect relationships through exposure to stressors.

37
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,950
And so those stressors are defined in different ways, right?

38
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,190
So there's life events, chronic stressors.

39
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,190
And then later in his model, he adds daily hassles.

40
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,920
So what's an example of like a life event, a stressful life event?

41
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,930
Yeah. Death of a loved one.

42
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,010
Sure. Yeah. Come on. Divorce. Divorce?

43
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,860
Sure. Yeah. Losing a job. Yeah.

44
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,420
Current events. Car accident. Yeah.

45
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,440
Okay. Moving to a different geographic location. Yeah.

46
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,380
Yeah, I've heard about is natural disasters.

47
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:53,310
Yeah, absolutely. Some of you wrote in your comments.

48
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,839
Starting grad school. Yeah, that is true.

49
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,910
That is true. And then sometimes these life events become chronic stressors, right?

50
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,680
So life event is sort of a discrete thing that's stressful.

51
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,380
And then a chronic stress. There is something that's ongoing. So what might be an example of a chronic stressor?

52
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,280
Yeah. Yeah.

53
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:31,739
If you're having marital conflicts. Okay.

54
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:38,190
A chronic illness could be an ongoing stressor, either a chronic illness that you have or that a loved one has.

55
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:43,560
Yeah, Patricia, I was just. Our time difference between chronic stress.

56
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,610
He gave an extremely kind of. For environmental.

57
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,140
Yeah. I don't know that you need to differentiate between that too much.

58
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:02,270
It may be more about the degree of it.

59
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:08,930
Um, or it could, you know, we'll talk in a minute about perceptions of these things,

60
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,280
too, and how that plays into the effects that they have on our whole.

61
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,920
Somebody mentioned losing a job. What might be a chronic stressor that would follow losing a job?

62
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,050
Yeah, sure. Or or Ali whatever.

63
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,779
Financial. Yeah.

64
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:37,250
So you might have financial strain or you might have difficulty paying your bills that arises from losing a job and that becomes a chronic strain.

65
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,670
And what might be an example of, like, a daily hassle. Yeah.

66
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,250
Jack traffic. Yeah. Ah, but.

67
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,940
Happy to wait. Wow. Yeah.

68
00:07:52,550 --> 00:08:00,340
We should never be scheduled, in my opinion, but I'm not in charge of anything else.

69
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:12,970
Yeah. I guess they're maybe more subtle. Yeah.

70
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:22,870
Yeah, absolutely. So there's all these different types of stressors.

71
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,790
Right. And you can imagine that these might have different effects on health.

72
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,650
Right. Whether something is a life event, whether it's a chronic stressor, whether it's a daily hassle.

73
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:43,330
But they're all different types of stressors. And according to Perlin, they're all socially patterned.

74
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,810
So they're not they're not random. And I think that's the really important part of this article.

75
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:57,010
So sometimes when we think about stress, when you hear people talk about stress, they'll say, everybody has stress.

76
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,420
Right. Have you heard this? Yeah. And so, yeah, that's true.

77
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:08,890
We do all have stress, but we don't all have the same amount of stress or the same amount of resources that help us cope with stress.

78
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:16,870
So that's the other part of this model is thinking about stress buffers, Perlin calls the stress mediators.

79
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,590
But we'll we'll talk next week about the difference between mediators and moderators or effect modifiers.

80
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,810
He uses the term mediator, but it's really not what we think of as a mediator in epidemiology.

81
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:40,540
He's really thinking about this as an effect modifier. So these stress buffers are things that modify the effect of exposure to stressors on health

82
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:47,410
outcomes so they can either make the effect greater or lessen the impact of the stressor.

83
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:57,280
Does that make sense? So like what would you expect if somebody experiences the death of a loved one and they have

84
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:03,050
really high levels of social support versus someone who has really low levels of social support?

85
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,370
How would you expect that to have different effects on their health outcomes?

86
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,230
They both lost a loved one, but they have different levels of social support with that matter.

87
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,590
Caitlin. I see you nodding your head. Why do you think it would matter?

88
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:30,710
Um, I think just because, like, going through a thing like that, like having that social square, it would lessen the impact of that whole program.

89
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:37,140
Yeah. And like, how how do you think it would do it? Or like, or which health outcomes might it impact?

90
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,030
Right. Because it might not impact them all the same way. I think especially like mental health.

91
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,750
Yeah. Just because like having supports for not helping that situation.

92
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:55,280
Yeah. A lot of people have to. I think if you have a death in the family, sometimes things people do is brings them to the home.

93
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:01,249
Sure. And it could change the nutrition that you get if you do the work tivity like there's a lot of things that

94
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,360
could happen physically after that as well that a strong social support system could help you navigate.

95
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,340
Yeah, that's that's absolutely true.

96
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:14,030
So there could be emotional social support that helps protect like your mental health and there could be instrumental support,

97
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,280
like someone bringing food or taking you to doctors appointments or things that can help.

98
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:24,970
And how long did you want to say something? Um, I just think about acceptance.

99
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:38,179
Yeah. Yeah, there's a book from, um. It's like how long she went through after her husband.

100
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:46,970
Something bad. And because she was the CEO of Facebook and then all the kind of support I have,

101
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:53,180
uh, her friend is a professor in psychology and counseling and social work.

102
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,130
Help her through the process of grief and loss.

103
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,260
Help her children. Sheryl Sandberg.

104
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:15,330
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So like someone who was able to draw on a lot of personal resources to deal with the unexpected loss of a spouse.

105
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:23,430
Yeah. So part of what Perlin argues is that not only is stress exposure socially patterned,

106
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:33,270
where people who have lower social balance are exposed to more stressors, but access to stress buffers is also socially patterned.

107
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,740
So having lower social status also influences your access to these stress buffers.

108
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,790
The ones where he talks about her coping, social support, self esteem and mastery.

109
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,000
There's plenty of other things that you could put in here.

110
00:12:52,820 --> 00:13:01,760
And so this is sort of the way he talks about this is that there's differential vulnerability to stress.

111
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:21,250
So there's. There's a couple of basic premises to the social studies theory.

112
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:26,709
There's three kind of basic ones, and so we've already talked about them a little bit, but I just want to state them more explicitly.

113
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,070
So the first one is the differential exposure hypothesis.

114
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,370
And that's just the idea that members of socially disadvantaged groups are exposed to more stress.

115
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,530
So that's what you're seeing. That's what is.

116
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:49,660
So stress or exposure to stressors is sort of a mediator of the relationship between social status and health outcomes.

117
00:13:50,290 --> 00:14:01,529
It's on the causal pathway. And then the second idea is that access to these social and personal resources,

118
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:08,460
like self esteem and social support, can reduce the damage caused by exposure to stressors.

119
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,140
And then third is the differential vulnerability hypothesis,

120
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:25,790
and that's the idea that people in socially disadvantaged groups are less likely to have access to these resources,

121
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,230
which leaves them more vulnerable to stressors when they encounter them.

122
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:46,079
And so you could imagine that there could also be relationships.

123
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,409
And I think this is what you see in the paper that you read for today.

124
00:14:49,410 --> 00:15:00,299
This paper, they're examining a direct relationship between some of the things that are in the stress buffer category and top outcomes right there.

125
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:09,750
Not conceptualizing the stress buffers as something that modify the impact of exposure to stress or modify the impact of social structural position.

126
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:15,150
They're interested in how social support and social strain directly impacts health outcomes.

127
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,950
So you could also have a version of this model that draws an arrow here.

128
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:32,550
So do you see how this could lead to like I mean, how many hypotheses could you propose and test from just this model with an infinite number?

129
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:41,829
Right. So I think it's a really nice model and I think it helps kind of illustrate these ideas,

130
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:46,270
which we'll talk about more next week when we talk about methods that are so important

131
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:51,160
in social epidemiology about differential exposure and differential vulnerability.

132
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:57,910
These ideas come up over and over, and they also come up in the life course theory, which we'll talk about more later.

133
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:14,670
Any questions about about that model? So now let's kind of get into some more of the details.

134
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,070
So that's at a very high level. So what makes a stress or stressful?

135
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:34,470
Yeah. Patricia. Christine, try again. Okay, so there's an element of perception in there.

136
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,600
Right. Do you does it feel stressful to you? Whatever is happening?

137
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:43,989
Right. Yes. And you? Okay.

138
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:48,850
So some of whether something is stressful or not depends on whether you're able to cope with it.

139
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,710
And. The question very well.

140
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,120
First of all, what is it like to drop up your daily life?

141
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:02,770
Yeah. Yeah. So something that disrupts your life?

142
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,060
Yeah. I mean, I think that's really fundamental. Yeah. Something I was thinking.

143
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,770
Biology was really stressful.

144
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,280
I like the hormones stress response.

145
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:21,510
And yes, I think that's something that's so interesting about thinking about the study of stress and stressors,

146
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:30,060
is that I can read a lot of how this research is done is with checklists of life events or chronic strains.

147
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,020
Sometimes those questions ask Peter will ask people, how stressful do you find this?

148
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:44,880
But I think your point is a really important one, that sometimes we may not actively perceive something as stressful,

149
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,140
but our bodies can be experiencing a stress response to something.

150
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:57,509
Right. And so that's one of the things that makes the study of stress so challenging, is that it's really,

151
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:07,470
really hard to measure exposure to stressors because most of the time we just have to ask people and rely on their answers.

152
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,219
And there's just a lot of squishiness in that measurement.

153
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:19,430
And so one of the things that social epidemiologist in particular did within the last ten years or so is

154
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:26,160
try to move toward measuring biomarkers of stress rather than self-reports of stressful experiences.

155
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:33,749
And so there were a lot of studies that came out looking particularly at cortisol and trying

156
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:41,250
to sort of understand that that had its own great challenges if anyone ever studied cortisol.

157
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:48,329
Yeah. Are you want to tell us about very tricky because there's a natural daily rhythm to be very specific about when you

158
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:54,719
measure it at different time that you're measuring it in response to a stress or just a daily pattern or a single drive,

159
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,640
it is a different thing. Yeah. And you can measure it in different right way.

160
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:07,620
You can measure it and you're in right? You can measured and here and fingernails and saliva if you've had experience with that.

161
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:13,010
Yeah. With. Yes. Research studies.

162
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,219
Yeah. Yeah, it has a diurnal curve of cortisol.

163
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:26,200
And so the time of day that you measure, it matters.

164
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,860
And then it's like it also depends on what time you wake up in the day.

165
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:39,490
Right. You so you're like your own thinking. If you're trying to do a standardized protocol in a large study, it's extremely difficult.

166
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:45,130
One study that I was involved in, the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis, um,

167
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:54,040
they used these little devices on the collection tube that captured the time of day that

168
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,930
it was collected instead of relying on people's self-report of when they collected it.

169
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:06,910
But it was really expensive. Um, and then this data, it's just really tricky to, to analyze because you can have,

170
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:16,660
you can look at the area under the curve as your outcome and you can look at different parts of the slope of the curve.

171
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:24,250
There's all kinds of ways to do it. Um, I don't think we have any readings that in this class that, that do this.

172
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,989
But there's also the like experimental techniques that you can use to look at people's stress

173
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:34,960
reactivity so you can bring them into the lab and expose them to a stressful situation.

174
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,860
Has anybody ever had experience with the trigger? Yeah, but you should.

175
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,510
You want to explain it? Yeah.

176
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:54,910
So, I mean, it was like for the first time when you the a speech to you and our job is like to stand there and you just like watch them.

177
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:02,230
I couldn't help or do anything. It doesn't matter what they say, but still like that, the stress is like being.

178
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:18,850
Did you do the math portion too? Or else I have to count backwards from so many factors by 17.

179
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:24,440
And if you myself go back to this. But I don't think I can even do it one time.

180
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:34,040
Yeah. So this is like this, this experimental protocol that everybody does because it works so perfectly.

181
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,610
It, like, always elicits a stress reaction from anybody.

182
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:45,110
Because we find public speaking and performing math tasks in front of other people is just really incredibly stressful.

183
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:52,670
And I think the other part that's so mean about it is that the researchers are just that they are completely stone faced,

184
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,200
like they can't give you any positive or negative reinforcement.

185
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:07,700
So you're just like, what have you got anyway? So that but it's a great way to sort of look at how people's bodies react to a stressful situation.

186
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:13,280
And so, you know, how what happens to you immediately,

187
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:21,540
what happens to you like after that study is super interesting and relates to our set of course we'll talk about that a little bit.

188
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:35,880
So you. So. So how should we measure exposure or just trousers based on everything we just said about self-reports, about measuring these biomarkers?

189
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,540
If you wanted to study stress, how would you do it? How would you measure it?

190
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,540
Olivia.

191
00:22:51,970 --> 00:23:00,280
Ideally, I would love the mixed methods approach of a really in-depth qualitative piece, but also having all of these biological biomarkers as well.

192
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,010
And what would you do in the qualitative piece?

193
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,189
I think I would want to know to find what they perceived as a stressful event so within their own history,

194
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,729
but then talk about how that made them feel day to day. What did they feel like?

195
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,760
Do they feel like they could relate like psychosomatic feelings to that?

196
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:20,440
That would be really nice. But also hear about how that impacted other quality of life.

197
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,320
But in terms of your like quantitative models, you focus on the biomarkers.

198
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,909
I like biomarkers so much, but I know that the qualitative piece is so important.

199
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:35,440
So I'm not well versed in how to interpret those, but I think it's important.

200
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,670
I just don't know how to do it. Yeah, I think it's a challenge. Absolutely.

201
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,780
Yeah. Think I think to some extent it would depend on what exactly you're studying.

202
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,139
So like with exposure to stress in particular,

203
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:57,590
you're interested in whether you want to use like more intense methods or more qualitative, quantitative and use like biometric methods.

204
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:02,239
So I'm kind of dependent. Yeah.

205
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:09,889
And you know, you'd also have to think about are you trying to understand overall exposure to stress

206
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:16,400
or are you interested in understanding something like the effect of losing a spouse?

207
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,579
Right. Like that's a it's a very different kind of research question,

208
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:27,080
whether you're interested in a specific stressor or whether you're interested in a more global concept of stress exposure.

209
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:31,999
I think in the sociological literature, which is where this is based,

210
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,329
there's much more interest and understanding overall exposure to stress and

211
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:43,580
thinking about specific stressors in the context of that overall stress exposure,

212
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:53,690
which is part of why I think there was a tendency to use these lifespan inventories and things like that to try to total up overall amount of stress.

213
00:24:54,890 --> 00:25:02,719
But of course, we. People have to come up with that list of stressors and then they have to rank

214
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,220
them because they actually said which one was more and they assign point values.

215
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,830
Um, so how would you assign point values to losing a spouse?

216
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:17,700
Versus going to jail versus losing a job.

217
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,770
Right. It's incredibly difficult.

218
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:28,740
And it could be that sometimes something that someone might perceive as a stressor for another person could relieve stress.

219
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:35,310
You know, like if you think about if you had a really toxic job and you lose that job,

220
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,390
there could be health benefits from that, apart from the loss of the financial stuff.

221
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:45,390
Or if you were in a really bad relationship and you get divorced, that could potentially be promoted.

222
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,500
So stresses like on super complicated areas and stuff.

223
00:25:51,850 --> 00:26:00,880
So another idea that comes up in the Perlin article that I think is really interesting is whether low social status itself is a stressor.

224
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:14,130
That's sort of the idea. And the theory is that like, let's say you have low socioeconomic status,

225
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:19,650
that is going to increase your risk of exposure to a variety of other stressors.

226
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:25,860
But could having low socioeconomic status on its own also be a stressor?

227
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:38,160
Sure. Yeah. So if you perceive that you're lower in the social brain back then, like that can be a stressor.

228
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,900
But yeah, I think it could also be that stress in itself.

229
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,980
Perhaps if you're in a situation.

230
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:02,980
That is in mostly support. So that would not make it.

231
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,159
Yeah. Or did that or not. It could be a stressor. But do you have access to these drugs?

232
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:17,120
But heard that it's not something that's negative. And so the outcome is that, you know, a decrease of.

233
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:28,940
I think similarly to like your most social status translates to safety risks in physical safety or psychological safety.

234
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,750
Like if you look like if you're.

235
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,350
In a really big area like that. But obviously you have.

236
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:47,260
Absolutely. Yeah. And it could be that you don't even you're not even necessarily conscious about that, but it could still have an impact.

237
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:53,780
But but like Sasha, when you were talking about that earlier, I was thinking about this, this kind of idea here,

238
00:27:53,780 --> 00:28:02,839
that, um, that you may not you may have few material resources and you may not perceive that as stressful,

239
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:13,100
but it could have impacts through like nutritional stressors or environmental stressors that could still have an impact on, like, your physiology.

240
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:28,700
So that a question about this theory is where is the physiological stress response?

241
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:35,990
Is it represented in this theory? Right?

242
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:41,630
Yes. In your brain. Did Perlin talk about it in your brain?

243
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:55,480
No, no, no. This article doesn't really get into how do the stressors impact your biology to ultimately impact health, whether that's mental health.

244
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:01,890
So that's kind of missing from this theory, right? That's right.

245
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:05,720
So I found this to be great. Yeah.

246
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,720
But at the same time. So. Yeah.

247
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:15,380
So confused in terms of how would you use this tool? Like to actually do a study?

248
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:24,110
Yeah. And sometimes that's how these kind of theoretical papers are, even the static load paper,

249
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,380
it still doesn't exactly tell you what you would do in a study.

250
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:36,890
Now, those seem on paper, takes that idea of Alice out of load and tries to operationalize,

251
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,300
trying to figure out how am I actually going to measure this, quantify it and put it in a study?

252
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:48,290
So I think it's helpful to see these different levels from the most abstract down to the most concrete,

253
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,670
because that's what, as epidemiologists, we're being asked to do.

254
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:04,920
So then another question from this and column. Maybe this paper didn't answer this question for you,

255
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:14,760
but what outcomes should we measure if we're if we're approaching a research question from this social stress theory or social stress perspective,

256
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:23,020
what outcomes makes sense to look at? In relation to exposure and vulnerability to stress.

257
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:44,730
Yeah, I would. Also thinking about how exposure to stress leads to sort of more stressors over time.

258
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,780
Yeah, if you could do that, you could do like a one with a life force kind of framework for that.

259
00:30:49,820 --> 00:31:02,750
Absolutely. Yes. There. Yeah.

260
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:09,390
So maybe like thinking about mental health kinds of outcomes related to substance use, suicide,

261
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:15,430
that sort of thing, having like kind of a direct connection with stress and stress exposure.

262
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:20,980
Yeah. Based on what they said then what about do it for you.

263
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:33,200
Yeah. So cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes, there's, there's a lot of work that links stress and stress reactivity to those types of outcomes.

264
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,160
So those are kind of common things that people will look at in relation to stress.

265
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:46,940
I mean, I think depending on your model too, like would it make sense if I had a cross-sectional dataset?

266
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:57,080
Would it make sense for me to look at, um, death of a loved one and atherosclerosis?

267
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:05,410
Olivier said, No way. There's no way that death of a loved one would immediately cause you to do that.

268
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:13,710
Yeah. So you have to think about how long would it take from exposure to the stressor to the outcome that you're studying.

269
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,930
So you have to understand something about the disease process.

270
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,920
So substance use might make a lot more sense in that case, right?

271
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:29,080
Or symptoms of depression or something that like that can kind of be an immediate result of an exposure and exposure to a stressor.

272
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:34,570
So I think that's really important when you read these kinds of papers to think about that piece to.

273
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,040
Okay. All right. Oh, yeah.

274
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:52,090
Yeah. Yeah, right.

275
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:59,480
I don't. I don't really. Even though they have no.

276
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:16,589
I know, I. So usually what people do when they're trying to understand chronic strains,

277
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:29,400
like I'm thinking about cardiovascular cohort studies that have done that is oftentimes there's like a set of four questions that ask things like,

278
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:40,110
um, over the past three months or over the past six months or one year or something like that, have you experienced any of the following?

279
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:47,010
And then it will be things like financial difficulties, ongoing problems in relationships,

280
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:51,090
ongoing problems with your own health or the health of a loved one.

281
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,790
Um, and then, so then they'll ask you like, how do you experience that?

282
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:04,470
And then sometimes there'll be a follow up question that says How stressful, how stressful is the situation to you?

283
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:12,630
And that's usually how it so it's not like in these survey studies, we don't ask people to say,

284
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:21,870
what are all the stressors that you're experiencing and what the investigators identify some that they think are either common

285
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:29,610
stressors that people might experience or that are particularly relevant for some health outcome or something like that.

286
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:36,600
But rarely in an epidemiologic study do you get a really comprehensive assessment of stress exposure.

287
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:46,290
Um, because you can imagine how long it would take and a survey to ask people about dozens and dozens of stressors.

288
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:49,680
There's just not room or time in surveys to do that.

289
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:58,620
Um, so that's kind of the typical way, and I hope psychologists will do studies that have much more extensive measures.

290
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:03,450
There's a really interesting, um, tool that was developed called The Strain,

291
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:11,040
and I'm trying to remember what it stands for and what if it's a stressful life experience inventory and it sort of,

292
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,000
it walks people through stressors starting like in early life.

293
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:20,790
And so it'll have things that are like similar that you've seen eases measures.

294
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:27,329
Um, that's another kind of way that people sometimes measure stressors and epidemiologic studies,

295
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:33,090
but it walks people through like kind of the life course and measuring different stressors.

296
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:38,940
It's a little bit more comprehensive, but it takes a long time to do, one time to administer.

297
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:56,360
All right. So our static load theory really appealed to me when I was a student in sociology and I was studying,

298
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:06,590
I was using kind of ideas from the stress process model or social stress theory, and I kept thinking, where is the like biology at work?

299
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:10,220
Best It's just missing from the sociological theories.

300
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:14,870
And so I started to learn about Allison and flow theory and I was like,

301
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:21,049
This is so cool because this is sort of what was missing from the other, the other theories that I've been using.

302
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:27,740
And so it really is trying to understand what's happening in the body when we're exposed to stress or stressors.

303
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:34,460
And so it's trying to answer the question, how do stressful experiences lead to disease?

304
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:43,030
And so there's these two ideas and the theory, there's this idea of Alice thesis and then the idea of Alice static food.

305
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:53,580
And outer space isn't just the process of adaptation to environmental demands.

306
00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:00,480
So Anna just kind of reminds me of when you were defining stressor.

307
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,260
It's like something that disrupts what you were already doing.

308
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:12,329
It's like something that comes in and poses a challenge to you, whether that's psychological or physiologic.

309
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:24,280
Right. And so this is just the process that your body goes through to adapt to demands, and that can be all different kinds of demands.

310
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:32,930
So your body actually goes through this really complicated series of events when you stand up from a seated position.

311
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,430
Right. Which we don't we don't think about it at all. But our body has to adjust to that.

312
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:41,629
That's a stressor for your body. We're waking up in the morning.

313
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:45,980
I think we probably know that was stressful or more stressful for some of us than others.

314
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,810
But we have to adapt to things like standing up.

315
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:55,520
We also have to adapt to things like losing a loved one, which is a very different kind of stressor.

316
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:03,170
Right. And so this process of our spaces involves all kinds of bodily systems.

317
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:10,790
So it includes the cardiovascular system, the metabolic machinery, the immune system, the central nervous system.

318
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:23,230
So what happens when to your body, when you encounter a situation that you perceive as stressful?

319
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:32,430
And you said that. You said a car accident. What would happen to your body, do you think, if you were in a car accident?

320
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:40,710
I mean, assuming you didn't really get hurt, assuming you just bumped into the car in front of you, how might you feel?

321
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:50,940
Does he want to die? Yeah. Anybody else in a stressful.

322
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,210
So you have an exam, a really difficult exam coming up?

323
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,730
Yeah, not. Yeah.

324
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:04,889
Your heart rate might go way up, and you're. Yeah.

325
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:08,950
You get your muscles might get really tired. That's.

326
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,840
So can you say it again? It's a headache.

327
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:24,379
Yeah. So it could be in the way in the immediate aftermath of the stress.

328
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:32,960
Or it could be once you kind of come down, sometimes just a little bit, you might experience a headache or some other kind of uncomfortable feeling.

329
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:36,800
Yeah. So this is just our bodies fight or flight response.

330
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:41,360
And I can't remember who said it in the comments, but somebody said,

331
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:50,450
we have one stress response in our body and it doesn't matter what kind of stressor it is.

332
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,499
And that's kind of true.

333
00:39:51,500 --> 00:40:02,690
Our body reacts to having an exam the same way it reacts to being in a car accident or something or losing a job or being chased by something, right?

334
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,340
Or somebody like our body just goes through this kind of reaction to stress.

335
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:13,100
So when we experience the fight or flight response, adrenaline and cortisol are released.

336
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,930
Our heart rate goes. Our digestion slows down.

337
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,059
Blood flow gets shunted to the major muscle groups.

338
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:32,640
Right, so that maybe y you feel dizzy. So the blood is going to your legs so you can run away and you get this burst of energy and strength.

339
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,290
I've even noticed sometimes, like, if I almost hit somebody in front of me, like,

340
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:46,050
I had to brake really hard, like, you can breathe really well right after that.

341
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:53,850
I don't know. Maybe it's because I have allergies and stuff, but like your sinuses just open up if you have that kind of reaction.

342
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:58,089
So it's it's fascinating what it does to your body. Okay, so that's great.

343
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:03,430
But we have that. It's really it's important for us to be able to adapt to these demands.

344
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:12,370
But there's a price to that adaptation, which is what the concept of our static load is about.

345
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:25,809
So our static load is about the wear and tear that we experience on the body and the brain when we have

346
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:33,340
chronic overactivity or inactivity of these physiological systems that are involved in our stress response.

347
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:56,010
So the idea is that our stress response is adaptive in the short run, but it can become problematic if it's repeatedly activated.

348
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:04,799
And so we can end up in this situation where those stress response systems stay on high alert

349
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:12,570
when they shouldn't be anymore or when they don't rise to the challenge when they're needed.

350
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:22,740
And so McEwan talks about three types of static load.

351
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:34,580
Oh, before we do that, sorry, I wanted to bring up Cynthia's comment.

352
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:42,590
So, Cynthia, you had a comment in the discussion board about how this sort of reminded you of Arlene Geronimo's work on weathering.

353
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:45,730
Do you want to say more about that? So.

354
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:57,020
Oh, no, you're high. It's just hard to hear up here. Um, I'm interested in the and stuff.

355
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,800
The experience. Stress caused by the.

356
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:22,430
Such that it goes against traditional. But for black women because.

357
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,580
Through their entire body. You don't believe that?

358
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:41,010
15 to 17 inches. Which was controversial.

359
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:45,130
Yeah. Yeah.

360
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:51,350
But in all honesty. Yeah.

361
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:59,780
Yeah, absolutely. So inherent in this idea of the weathering hypothesis is that groups that are experiencing

362
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:06,770
discrimination or other chronic stressors experience faster physiological aging.

363
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:14,750
So chronologically, like if you're the same chronological age, there's differences in biological age because of this stuff with those groups.

364
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,769
And that's very similar to what the theory of L seven load of being.

365
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:23,240
It's just putting a little bit more biology, right?

366
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:31,710
Okay. So then the three types. So the first type one is frequent stress.

367
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:37,920
And so this is just based on the frequency and intensity of what he calls hits.

368
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:50,730
And so, again, this gets back to this idea we were talking about in the beginning of the class.

369
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:54,780
Everybody experiences stress. We all experience stress every day.

370
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:02,320
But there are differences across groups and across individuals in terms of the frequency

371
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:07,030
of those stressful experiences and the intensity of those stressful experiences.

372
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:20,840
And that has impacts on how. So then type one, a static load and then lead to either type two or type three static load.

373
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:26,090
And type two is where you have a field shutdown of the stress response.

374
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:34,670
So this is where like your levels or does the hall and stuff stay really elevated throughout the day higher than they should?

375
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:40,280
And so your body is being exposed to a lot of this more of this hormone that is healthy.

376
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:51,190
Right. And so this can look like you can have elevated blood pressure and elevated glucocorticoids,

377
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,180
and this can accelerate things like obesity and type two diabetes.

378
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,690
And then on the other hand, you can have type three hour static flow, which is where you have inadequate stress response.

379
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:16,840
And so what can happen here is autoimmunity and inflammation when the HPR access isn't working as much as it should.

380
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:27,550
And so you can see those in those like in those trier social stress experiments.

381
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:37,960
Part of what you're doing is you're trying to see are there people who their stress response goes up like you would expect,

382
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:43,600
but then doesn't come down compared to other people's who's come through that come back down?

383
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:51,070
Or are there people who in this stressful experience, like, they just don't mount a stress response in the same way?

384
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:03,319
So one of the things that I think is super interesting is this idea that, like, you can have type one,

385
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:09,470
but this can be something that happens over the life course as a process that you can sort of have type one,

386
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:20,930
but then leads to type two that then ultimately leads to type three so that you could over time have these repeated his lead to two failed shut down,

387
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:26,060
but then ultimately inadequate response once you kind of burn out stress response system.

388
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:32,300
Um, but we don't have a lot of longitudinal studies that that look at that.

389
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:35,280
Okay.

390
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:48,180
So table one in that paper just talks about the types of things that can go wrong when various systems, bodily systems are over or under activated.

391
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:56,160
And so like in the cardiovascular system, when you have chronic activity of the stress response,

392
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:01,979
you can have hypertension which can increase the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction.

393
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:08,640
But like we were talking about before, this would be a process that happens sort of gradually over time.

394
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:16,440
You don't experience a sudden stressor and then, you know, develop cardiovascular disease.

395
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:27,940
It takes a while. In terms of the metabolic system, chronic activity can lead to obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis.

396
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,999
And then for the immune system, this is where the type three hour static blood comes in,

397
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:43,290
where there's where there's inactivity of the stress response systems can result in inflammation and autoimmune disorders.

398
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:52,010
And then within the brain, in the central nervous system, you can have neuronal atrophy, death of nerve cell cells.

399
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:59,670
So there's all kinds of different effects that our static world can have across bodily systems.

400
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:07,530
So it makes a lot of sense in the like the theory of fundamental causes or social stress theory.

401
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,560
But they're not just about one type of health outcome, right?

402
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,640
They're about all different kinds of health outcomes.

403
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:22,080
And this explains why. Because stress, social stress is operating on all of the systems of the body.

404
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,790
All right. So let's talk about life course theory a little bit.

405
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:38,510
Before I put up a definition,

406
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:47,840
if you had to sort of summarize life course theory and how it's different or the same as the other theories that we we've already read,

407
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:59,570
like how would you characterize it? What does it add?

408
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:06,770
Yeah. COHEN Yeah.

409
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:13,130
TIME Right. The other theory is don't necessarily explicitly address time.

410
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:26,340
Anything else that might. Yeah.

411
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:34,020
Yeah. So it's not just trying with in a person's life worse but time across generations

412
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:38,820
which is an idea that we don't really get from any of these other theories.

413
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:47,620
And that's we'll talk about this in a minute when we talk about the methods. But it's like you hear that and you say, of course.

414
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:55,060
Right. Like, of course, you know, you can have, you know, transmitted intergenerationally.

415
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:59,050
But how do we study that?

416
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:02,700
Right. It's it's tricky.

417
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:10,290
So these ideas, from my first theory, are very tricky to implement with the methods and the techniques that we currently have.

418
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:20,250
But yeah, so life course theory. It's all about studying the long term effects.

419
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:31,200
Of physical and social exposures that we have throughout our life.

420
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:37,800
So from gestation to childhood to adolescence, young adulthood and later life.

421
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:46,560
So how do all of these experiences and exposures that we've had across our life course impact our health risk?

422
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:07,900
And then beyond just thinking about all of those exposures and how they ultimately impact our health,

423
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:15,100
it's also trying to understand the pathways through which those exposures impact our health.

424
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:20,770
So what are the the biological pathways? The behavioral pathways?

425
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:30,020
The psychosocial pathways? Within our own lives and then also across generations.

426
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:38,020
So it might be the biggest theory of all, even though it's the shortest paper.

427
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,489
So I think in general and you can tell me if you agree with us or not,

428
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:08,050
but I think a lot of times students and an epidemiologists find this theory really intuitively appealing.

429
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:16,480
Um. It just makes a lot of sense to many of us when we think about how.

430
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:27,820
And yet you don't see a lot of studies that really implement life course theory sort of like this method.

431
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:33,700
So, so I'll just stop there and tell me what like, do you like my theory?

432
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,190
Are you tired of theories that you're ready for some data?

433
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:51,120
Sarah I thought that sounds like my first theory. I don't know if I can dove into specifics, but you.

434
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:57,390
Yeah, to tell me why. Think about. You know, I know you're. You're not writing your dissertation yet, but you're probably thinking about it, right?

435
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:02,970
Like, is life was something that you would want to incorporate explicitly or implicitly.

436
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:08,890
A big question, especially if you have, like, chronic diseases.

437
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:13,390
Yeah. Yeah. I was like, we don't have time for this.

438
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:16,970
I'm always thinking like, I want.

439
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:26,430
With intergenerational. That will result in left and right levels of the.

440
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:31,120
Even for living in Texas. I like.

441
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,760
Wolf, back to the bigger picture, which I really like. Yeah.

442
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:42,560
And I feel like. Ice cream is great for our customers, especially for.

443
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:58,889
Hopefully. Yeah. He has a great point about how infectious diseases and that and all of these papers are really kind of focused on chronic disease.

444
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:04,710
But it doesn't mean that some of these things, the same things wouldn't apply to infectious disease.

445
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,990
You might just have to kind of think through the specifics of how that would work.

446
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:16,139
I was going to say something about so, you know, even like in the theory of outside alert,

447
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:19,770
it's talking about how it impacts your system and immune function.

448
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:23,310
So you can always kind of tired into that.

449
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:28,170
I mean, of course, you know, more detail on that, right?

450
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:32,430
Yeah. Yeah. Like I think would be really interesting to do that. And I think you could get colon.

451
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:38,650
Yeah, I just. I like it. It's a good approach to the social.

452
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:47,390
Because they all. Yes.

453
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:58,850
And that's. But all in all, I still get really confused.

454
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:02,650
But it's not really practical. I would say yes.

455
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:07,120
Yeah. So. So it's like. It makes a lot of sense.

456
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:15,549
Right. But it's hard to think about in a practical way, how would I apply this given epidemiologic data?

457
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:22,150
And I do think that's the challenge there. I did want to mention also somebody asked a question about it.

458
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:31,300
I mean, it's been USERRA and the discussion word about whether there's work related to like social stress theory on infectious disease outcomes.

459
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:35,560
And I think that there's some really interesting work by Sheldon Cohen,

460
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:40,780
who's done he's a health psychologist who's done these kind of experimental studies.

461
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:47,380
Um, and one I'm thinking about in particular where he looks at whether participants in a study,

462
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:51,430
if their parents owned their own home when they were kids or not,

463
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:55,450
or whether they were renters as a marker of early life, socioeconomic status,

464
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:01,479
and then they put rhinovirus in their nose and wait to see who develops cold.

465
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:06,920
I know it's so gross, right? I don't know who volunteers for these studies, but people do.

466
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:13,749
And so then he is shown that people whose families owned their own homes when they were kids are

467
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:20,680
less likely to get a cold after being exposed than people whose parents did own their own homes.

468
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:27,940
And so showing these like lasting impacts on the immune system of things like early life, socioeconomic conditions.

469
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:37,210
So definitely there is, there is work looking at, um, that, that we see similar to infectious disease things.

470
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:49,040
Okay. So there's a couple of concepts from my first theory that I wanted to just pull out.

471
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:57,800
There's a lot of concept concepts in that article, but some that I think are particularly useful for epidemiologists to think about.

472
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:02,900
And the first one is this idea of accumulation of risk.

473
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:19,969
And so not thinking about some kind of exposure in isolation from other exposures that came before,

474
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:26,540
but thinking about it in the context of an accumulation over time of risk factors.

475
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:34,950
And so just this idea that these exposures gradually accumulate over time to effect health.

476
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:48,090
And so they talk about this idea of risk clustering, which should probably remind you of the health lifestyle theory a little bit.

477
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:57,990
Remember how we covered and talked about how health behaviors cluster and this is where this is thinking about how stressors can cluster.

478
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:11,150
And that those clusters of stressful things can be related to a person's position in the social hierarchy.

479
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,750
So not not randomly distributed clusters of stressors.

480
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:18,530
So if you think about think about some stressors that go together.

481
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:30,680
Can you think of an example of a cluster of stressors that might be determined by something like low socioeconomic status, for example?

482
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:40,120
Yeah. I got one. I think the master. Uh huh.

483
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:44,310
Absolutely. How? How does that?

484
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:50,050
Yeah. Yeah. Like how? Social.

485
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:56,040
The. Do your homework, Spencer.

486
00:59:56,190 --> 01:00:01,530
Yeah. Exposure. Is brochure because of your social system.

487
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:06,250
That was social software and all.

488
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:14,130
Or worse. Yeah. Increasing their risk for health outcomes.

489
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:18,000
So like in that that box, that was about stressors.

490
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:26,910
So the chronic and the chronic strains and the life events, what are some examples of those that might be socially patterned?

491
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:45,270
Yes, there is a. And then.

492
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:53,550
They went shopping for food and so they're going through your nutritional.

493
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:07,110
Yeah. So that so low socio economic status could shape the, you know,

494
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:14,109
part of that is the type of occupation that you have, um, which could come along with certain types of stressors.

495
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:18,640
So for example, if you're doing work that's dangerous or something like that,

496
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:22,450
it also is then going to be related to the amount of income that you have.

497
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:30,760
So you could have financial strain or, like you said, an inability to purchase healthy foods or something like that.

498
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:36,550
You could also live in a neighborhood that has fewer resources.

499
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:40,810
So there's like ways in which these things can kind of cluster together.

500
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,680
That's right. So did you want to say something? That same thing.

501
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:52,870
Okay. Yeah. So that's the idea of risk clustering and then chains of risk is kind of a related idea.

502
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:59,590
And that can be and I think some of you mentioned this before, like one bad exposure can lead to another.

503
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:07,690
So you experience one stressful life event or something and then it leads to another or to a chronic strains that we talked about,

504
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:16,780
that example of you lose your job and then maybe you can't pay your bills and then you get evicted from your apartment.

505
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:22,060
And so it's like this sort of chain of things that happens that are different stressors.

506
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:30,080
So then another idea that comes up in life force theory that I think is really

507
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:34,940
important for epidemiologists providing critical versus sensitive periods.

508
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:44,170
And it's easy to get these two things mixed up. And sometimes people use these interchangeably.

509
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:49,210
But how does a critical period differ from a sensitive period?

510
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,700
If anybody knows this literature well.

511
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:06,930
Nobody wants to be brave and say, Yeah, the pyramids are meant to be more irreversible of the damage that occurs.

512
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:12,960
Yeah, backwards. A sensitive period of you're particularly susceptible, but there might be a way that you could reverse the damage.

513
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:22,979
Yeah, exactly. So a critical period is the limited time window in which an exposure can have adverse or protective effects on subsequent outcomes.

514
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:27,060
There's no effect outside of that window. It probably isn't reversible.

515
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:33,180
There are some things like this, especially in like early, you know, development, right?

516
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:44,430
Like that's where this is kind of a big thing. So I think an example and tell me if I'm wrong is like folic acid early in pregnancy.

517
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:51,510
Yeah. Think about the spinal cord. Yeah. Things like organ function and limbs, like things that are not going to change once they're.

518
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:57,420
Yeah. And so most of the time as social epidemiologist, we aren't studying critical care even.

519
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:01,290
We're more focused on sensitive periods.

520
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:10,560
And so that's like a time window in which an exposure can have a stronger effect on development and disease risk than it would in another period.

521
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:15,120
So what might be an example of a sensitive period in the life course?

522
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:20,010
Yeah. Okay. Pregnancy.

523
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:31,580
I got thinking. Yeah.

524
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:37,670
So. So like when my experience being divorce, like,

525
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:44,540
is there a period in the life course we're experiencing divorce might have a more significant impact on your health than another period.

526
01:04:47,320 --> 01:05:02,530
Do you think that there would be? I spoke.

527
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:12,620
Yeah. And it took me that year to do anything to that.

528
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,180
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

529
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:25,829
So, like, let's say you experience the worst when you have like two young children versus you have grown children or something like that.

530
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:31,280
Like you could be a different, a lot more stressful in one period versus another.

531
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:37,110
Or, you know, if you think about a couple who gets divorced in their seven years,

532
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:44,040
that could be particularly problematic for their health because they're losing their most important

533
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:49,049
source of social support at a time when it's difficult to form new relationships or something like that.

534
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:53,940
So that's an example of how something can be like a sensitive period.

535
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:59,970
And so the effect of getting divorced would depend on the stage of life course or something like that.

536
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:06,600
Um, I think we've also seen from COVID, right, like we all went through COVID,

537
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:15,160
but were there some groups who were more sensitive to particular outcomes as a result of COVID, right?

538
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:20,069
Like we've seen that for, um, and I don't necessarily mean for health outcomes,

539
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:25,559
but like especially for learning for kids, we're seeing that there's differences.

540
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:32,160
There were apparently some sensitive periods for moving to remote school and one of them seems to be the middle school

541
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:39,930
years that that group of kids has had the worst outcomes in terms of how much learning loss they've experienced.

542
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:45,960
And they're not making it up as quickly as kids who were kind of at different developmental stages.

543
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:53,399
Um, so that's another example of how something that can happen to everybody across the world can have

544
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,300
a different impact depending on the stage of development that you were at when it occurred.

545
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:11,430
Another idea that comes up in here that's also in social stress theory is this idea of vulnerability and resilience.

546
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:20,230
So vulnerability being negative adaptation in the face of adversity.

547
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:26,640
And resilience, being positive adaptation in the face of adversity.

548
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:31,530
And they're both just examples of modifying factors.

549
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:39,270
So there's things that can like amplify risk or mitigate against it.

550
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:48,700
Which adds another layer of complexity to this type of work.

551
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:53,960
Right, because the same exposure won't always produce the same outcome.

552
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,840
So another idea and my first theory that I think is really interesting for

553
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:10,140
epidemiologists to consider is this idea of plasticity and the potential for change.

554
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:23,740
And unless we're taking a life course approach to studying health, we can't always incorporate that idea.

555
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:39,770
So we've talked about this a little bit already, but implementing life force theory and the challenges with that.

556
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:50,120
So it's kind of it's paradoxical in a way, because it's intuitively obvious all of the kind of tenets of life force theory.

557
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:58,310
I mean, I don't think anybody disagrees with any of them, but empirically, incredibly complex.

558
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:07,550
So like, of course, we know that risks accumulate. Just anybody who's had lived experience can see that risks accumulate over time.

559
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,050
But do we have evidence to show it? Like,

560
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:20,720
do we have studies that have quantified cumulative exposure to risk and then looked at the impact that that has on some particular health outcome?

561
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:24,800
Not really, because it's so hard to view.

562
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:37,720
There's limitations of data. If we wanted to do that kind of study, could we do it?

563
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:50,110
Or are there data sets that have intergenerational exposures from gestation through death?

564
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:57,620
There's probably a few in Europe. You don't really have those here.

565
01:09:57,650 --> 01:10:04,220
There was an attempt to start a national children's study about 15 years ago, something like that.

566
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:08,000
It got funded and then they pulled the funding for it.

567
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:16,309
And the idea was that they were going to like follow pregnant people from pregnancy and then follow the kids after they were born for many,

568
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:18,920
many years. And unfortunately, it didn't happen.

569
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:29,120
But this is it's really challenging because we don't oftentimes have a lot of data that would allow us to look at life course kinds of questions.

570
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:39,520
And even if we had the data, we don't necessarily have the methods that would allow us to do this.

571
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:47,290
Do you think that logistic regression models would really allow you to capture light?

572
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:50,390
Of course. Right. Colin was laughing. No.

573
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:59,780
And why not? Why are those types of traditional models really not quite enough to get the job done?

574
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:18,720
Yeah, Ali. Yeah, I think you would have to be able to account for time and various things, plus time, varying things.

575
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:24,300
You might have feedback loops in here.

576
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:32,280
I think somebody was mentioning earlier, like if the outcome of the stress process is that you develop chronic disease,

577
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:36,509
chronic disease can then become its own stressor and feedback into it.

578
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:40,880
And how would you how would you analyze that over time?

579
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:46,079
All the interactions that we've talked about happening here,

580
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:55,650
how would you model all of these interactions between exposures and the other factors associated with resilience or vulnerability?

581
01:11:57,270 --> 01:12:00,350
Your model would just be incredibly, incredibly complicated.

582
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:12,030
Yeah. And I wrote down here. I brought this up, Sarah.

583
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:19,440
I have a lot of a lot of people brought up this idea that I do want to say anything about your comment about the complexity of this.

584
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,820
Not only did they say, yeah.

585
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:40,460
Europe is also. Why?

586
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:50,420
Like. So I think the timeline.

587
01:12:52,870 --> 01:13:00,959
Yeah, absolutely. Like we're already talking about things that are incredibly complex and we haven't even gotten into this idea

588
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:07,300
of the intersectionality between the multiple social statuses and how we would analytically account for that.

589
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:15,850
And then we're going to add time on top of it. And it just it becomes like infinitely more complex the more of these things that we put in there.

590
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:23,020
So so does that mean our research studies are dumb and we shouldn't do them?

591
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:30,790
Okay. So. So how do we reconcile these two things?

592
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:37,170
We think the world works this way. That's what the theory that's what the theory is about.

593
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:43,900
We think this is how it works. Research accumulated across the life course bears.

594
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:51,660
These risks are socially patterned. There's these factors that modify the effect of the risk.

595
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:55,540
There's all of these different kinds of health outcomes that could that could be affected.

596
01:13:55,990 --> 01:14:05,379
So how do we reconcile that model of the way the world works with our analysis that probably has a single exposure,

597
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:09,340
a single outcome, one effect modifier and three confounders.

598
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:22,339
How do we do that? You have to go through.

599
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:28,730
You give them a good answer. But I know it's like a thing right now.

600
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:35,770
We never thought about it before, but now we have it so we can have a little bit.

601
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:44,879
Like me. Uh huh. So I got a little more useful.

602
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:52,680
And maybe in the future. This learning is going to help us.

603
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:57,000
Do. Yeah, I think that's true.

604
01:14:57,010 --> 01:15:03,579
I do think we kind of you don't have to answer everything in one study rate

605
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:08,770
like each of our studies is a small piece of trying to understand something.

606
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:16,060
And so you can have, especially if you're doing it, this is your career and you're doing research as part of your career.

607
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:21,010
You're going to you're going to work on these research questions for 30 or 40 years.

608
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:24,940
So you don't have to answer at all in your dissertation, right?

609
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:30,370
Or your project or whatever. Like you get time to explore these things more.

610
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:37,960
And yes, over time, methods start to develop that are better aligned with theories.

611
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:45,969
But yeah, it's, it's a little bit of a gradual process. And I think it's also important to remember that like no start,

612
01:15:45,970 --> 01:15:51,710
like we would never take just the results of one study and say this is what's true, right?

613
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:56,620
We're looking at different types of studies across time and across different

614
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:02,170
disciplines and with different methods to try to understand how health works.

615
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:06,420
Yeah. So we just do the best we can. That's the answer.

616
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:11,350
You know, we do these we do these little studies and we acknowledge that they're kind of small,

617
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:17,110
but that they're contributing to this overall body of literature that's trying to understand it.

618
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:20,230
Remember last week we talked about what's the purpose of theories?

619
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:30,520
And theories do give us that framework to understand what in isolation, um, borderline meaningless is, right?

620
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:35,229
Um, you know, I hate to say that, but I've published lots of things and I'm like,

621
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:38,770
that's not that important, you know, on its own, it's not that important.

622
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:43,330
But if you combine it with these other things, then it starts to tell the story about something.

623
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:47,650
And so, yeah, that's, that's kind of how we do it and we just keep trying to do it better.

624
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:54,850
All right. Let's take a break. See what time it is?

625
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:59,200
1050. Let's come back at 11 and get into the groups.

626
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:02,859
And I tried to spread them out a little better this week and make sure you check your tent,

627
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:07,060
because I had I had to change the groups a little because we had new people coming into class.

628
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:11,710
I think I did. Group one here. Group two there.

629
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:16,780
Three, four. I don't know where five is.

630
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:20,500
Do you guys have five back there? Do you see it on your table?

631
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:24,640
Five. There were there were six and six.

632
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,670
Is there why did I put on. I don't know if you need to move around.

633
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:33,040
I tried to spread them out, but for some reason, I can't make equally spaced groups in this classroom.

634
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:49,460
All right. So let's take a break. Yes.

635
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:24,450
Any further than that.

636
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:39,900
Yeah, right. Yeah.

637
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:47,950
Okay. If you can find it. The first.

638
01:18:56,650 --> 01:19:04,930
Yeah. No. Do.

639
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:22,480
Oh. And during that time, it's just not right.

640
01:20:50,780 --> 01:21:00,880
Yeah. I do.

641
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:04,970
Oh, I do not like.

642
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:16,420
Yeah. Yeah.

643
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:29,670
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

644
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:44,020
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

645
01:21:44,500 --> 01:22:33,430
Yeah. You never know.

646
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:46,200
Throwing for zero rewards available.

647
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:53,680
But you have a. Yo, yo, yo.

648
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:12,870
Yeah, I'm. No, no, I'm sorry.

649
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:42,920
Maybe they an email. Yeah.

650
01:23:54,200 --> 01:24:02,500
Oh, yeah.

651
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:09,620
I haven't got that right.

652
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:15,530
I wonder. I.

653
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:46,870
Strategic dialog. Doesn't know what you're going through.

654
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:59,430
So I can understand your.

655
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:21,010
I think. One.

656
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:40,219
Yeah. It's a big story there. Yeah, yeah.

657
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:43,940
I think somebody should go back there. There's space back there.

658
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:49,130
It's been around. So back where, you know, you get the.

659
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:55,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

660
01:25:55,510 --> 01:26:00,530
I guess. I don't know why.

661
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:09,660
Oh, I'd love to hear a little bit more.

662
01:26:18,010 --> 01:26:21,800
Yeah, it's the groups are really out of balance.

663
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:24,860
They can also try to lay it out.

664
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:31,270
There's always like, yeah, yeah. And what a lot of people are saying doesn't.

665
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:39,290
Yes. Over this weekend. Well, will it ever stop?

666
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:48,350
I think it's going to be the answer. Yeah, I think they are.

667
01:26:48,730 --> 01:26:58,850
Okay. What are we going to do? Oh, my gosh.

668
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:03,740
Will we ever. You know, like our bodies were like that?

669
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:14,240
I've spoken to this person.

670
01:27:15,670 --> 01:27:20,060
Just let me write a number on it. They lost some of their numbers, though.

671
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:29,450
Oh, I think I read your file. Oh, there's no.

672
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:36,590
I grew five as anybody else in group five.

673
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:43,490
Yeah. You know, I swear, they were supposed to be equally sized.

674
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:50,330
I don't know that. No one in that room.

675
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:54,590
Okay, so there's one, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four.

676
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:58,360
One, two, three. Are you guys one there?

677
01:27:58,430 --> 01:28:08,690
That's all three. Oh, I.

678
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:26,180
So for this, for the small group discussion where I recommend is having somebody in your group start a Google doc and

679
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:31,190
share it with everybody else in your group so that you can all kind of type in it or have access to it.

680
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:41,150
You don't have to share with me unless you want to. And then for each week try to kind of pick some agree on somebody who is going to

681
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:45,299
be the spokesperson for your group once we get to the large group discussion.

682
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:49,910
And then I'll just make it easier so that you're not all looking at each other saying, who's going to?

683
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:53,780
I was going to say answered those be my recommendations.

684
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:58,849
I will walk around. If you have questions, I'm happy to help answer them.

685
01:28:58,850 --> 01:29:03,680
So this is the questions that are up here are for the comment paper.

686
01:29:09,170 --> 01:29:13,490
And hopefully their self-explanatory. But if you have questions about it, just raise your hand.

687
01:29:14,210 --> 01:29:30,190
Colin What you're very concerned about, this group said that the over 06000 yeah.

688
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:33,310
I think it's the ring.

689
01:29:36,230 --> 01:29:42,830
What do you think? And I can see that.

690
01:29:48,830 --> 01:29:59,420
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

691
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:09,670
They've been there. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

692
01:30:13,470 --> 01:30:20,690
Like. And hopefully I.

693
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:32,130
Unless you work for the French right now, you're.

694
01:30:37,530 --> 01:30:43,460
Remember, we are the friends.

695
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:58,990
I'm not here for. Get them down.

696
01:31:05,790 --> 01:31:14,450
You know you have to. Yeah.

697
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:28,500
Oh, yeah. Just. What?

698
01:32:05,180 --> 01:32:09,090
I mean. Like my friends.

699
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:20,990
More. I don't think anyone called.

700
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:31,870
It. I'm sorry.

701
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:43,770
I just want to make sure we have. I.

702
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:21,190
There was so.

703
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:11,820
I think that's what. Right.

704
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:39,030
The system. That's right.

705
01:34:39,100 --> 01:35:00,980
That's. Sorry to say.

706
01:35:14,260 --> 01:36:10,480
If I can. So you have.

707
01:36:14,010 --> 01:36:18,390
Okay. And this.

708
01:36:27,190 --> 01:36:31,700
I want. Yeah.

709
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:40,300
Yeah. Okay. So.

710
01:36:40,410 --> 01:36:44,910
No know and many of.

711
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:55,660
Yeah. Oh, yeah. When you get better.

712
01:36:56,620 --> 01:36:59,650
When you're with them. Oh.

713
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:07,870
Oh, I know. All.

714
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:24,420
How are you doing? Okay.

715
01:37:24,570 --> 01:37:28,510
Any questions about anything? Okay.

716
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:39,740
We're. This.

717
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:48,680
You know. Hmm.

718
01:37:51,850 --> 01:38:11,760
I just put my printed. Oh.

719
01:39:56,770 --> 01:41:13,200
I really. I don't know.

720
01:46:25,950 --> 01:47:41,550
Yes. I think it's time now for California.

721
01:47:54,200 --> 01:48:12,470
I'm nearing the end of. Okay?

722
01:48:14,510 --> 01:48:21,450
Yeah. Yes, it is for me.

723
01:48:34,930 --> 01:49:01,560
I'm sorry that. Some of them were very brave.

724
01:49:04,010 --> 01:49:08,940
I guess I glad I've done it. Yeah. A little bit later on.

725
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:16,290
And of the more and I used.

726
01:49:22,930 --> 01:49:35,980
The other side is a match in terms of the way that I think I have my own personal and yeah it's more about.

727
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:47,340
I have to do that. Oh, yeah.

728
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:57,050
Okay. Okay. Well, I think.

729
01:49:57,180 --> 01:50:04,270
I think you're right.

730
01:50:06,260 --> 01:50:14,120
And I really I personally don't think it's important that there's a.

731
01:50:19,310 --> 01:50:25,330
But that's. Yeah.

732
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:31,240
Oh, yeah. I live in the auditorium.

733
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:36,350
I already had.

734
01:50:39,730 --> 01:50:44,690
15 years was a real accident.

735
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:51,020
I don't know. I can't tell you that I wasn't there.

736
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:58,460
Okay, great. But I knew a lot of stuff.

737
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:11,720
So I'll do it. Okay. I don't know.

738
01:51:12,270 --> 01:51:15,419
You know the other one? You.

739
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:31,840
We're going to do it. This one right across the street.

740
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:40,450
And I can show you like I can point to the building, but basically they have their year ban on the website.

741
01:51:41,410 --> 01:51:45,400
If you just look up oh, sure, Jordan and I can send you an e-mail this to you.

742
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:54,760
But you can look and see like what they have and if it sounds good and maybe that would help out with it.

743
01:51:56,230 --> 01:52:01,330
Let me ask you this one, because it sounds like you have to keep trying to click on the.

744
01:52:25,720 --> 01:53:02,490
Here is. As they.

745
01:53:14,090 --> 01:53:18,050
This is. Oh, yeah.

746
01:53:18,230 --> 01:53:31,750
Just. I think everything. But again, there.

747
01:53:34,320 --> 01:55:04,770
And just. I don't know.

748
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:16,320
So this is the. Does that bother you?

749
01:55:16,980 --> 01:55:21,370
Yeah. Because we're literally right there.

750
01:55:22,570 --> 01:55:28,860
So yeah, so it's very and then the door and that goes in steps and if you go in that door right there with you.

751
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:36,260
Right there. I wouldn't have believed.

752
01:55:37,310 --> 01:55:53,330
I knew. You know.

753
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:28,470
Yeah. That's pretty. Yeah.

754
01:56:29,230 --> 01:56:33,680
Okay. Go for it. Okay, let's go ahead and get started.

755
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:45,470
Um, a couple of things. One, I should tell you that this is just the discussion questions that we'll do in the second half of most of our class.

756
01:56:45,770 --> 01:56:52,400
Some weeks will be a little different, but most of the time we'll have one reading that's assigned as a discussion paper.

757
01:56:52,790 --> 01:56:58,370
And so if you're looking at the syllabus, not on the modules per se,

758
01:56:58,490 --> 01:57:02,150
but if you work on the syllabus, it will tell you which paper is the discussion paper.

759
01:57:02,930 --> 01:57:05,120
And so then just I should have mentioned that last week.

760
01:57:05,390 --> 01:57:13,040
So then just pay extra close attention to that one because you'll have questions kind of similar to business each week.

761
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:22,280
And so the idea is just to sort of learn how to go through the paper and pick out the pieces that are that are really important.

762
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,730
And what you'll notice, the more you do this,

763
01:57:26,150 --> 01:57:35,209
you'll see that like sometimes authors aren't very good at telling you the information that you really need to know.

764
01:57:35,210 --> 01:57:39,530
And so I think this is also helpful for you as you begin to write papers.

765
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:47,510
So think about what is it that my reader needs to know about what I do so that they understand my study.

766
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:53,210
So hopefully going through these papers will help you kind of get better at that piece too.

767
01:57:55,010 --> 01:57:58,600
Okay, so let's go ahead and get started.

768
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:03,650
I always like to start with what were the research questions and the hypotheses?

769
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:07,850
They're not always there, but let's see if they work for this paper.

770
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:13,120
Group one Did you find any research questions? Yeah, we said.

771
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:24,730
What aspects? Yeah.

772
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:40,969
Yeah, absolutely. So they're trying to understand what are the biological pathways that are linking social

773
01:58:40,970 --> 01:58:46,129
relationships to how one of the other things they kind of mentioned in the beginning,

774
01:58:46,130 --> 01:58:48,950
they don't say explicitly this is a research question,

775
01:58:48,950 --> 01:58:57,740
but like are the effects of social relationships underestimated when we look at individual biological processes rather than multiple systems?

776
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:07,340
And then kind of really vary. There is a question about whether women are more physiologically reactive to relationships than men,

777
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:10,700
although that's not like a primary question, but kind of in there.

778
01:59:11,570 --> 01:59:19,729
And then they're hypothesis is that aspects of social relationships, which we will talk more about how they operationalized in a minute,

779
01:59:19,730 --> 01:59:24,290
are associated with differences in levels of biological risk across multiple major

780
01:59:24,290 --> 01:59:30,280
physiological regulatory systems and then consequently the overall multi-system stress,

781
01:59:30,290 --> 01:59:34,060
which is the idea of our study. Okay.

782
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:38,949
Sometimes authors, I always try to do this.

783
01:59:38,950 --> 01:59:46,720
Sometimes I think I forget to do it. I try to do at the very end of the introduction, a section that's like research, questions and hypotheses,

784
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:53,920
just to feel like it helps with your own clarity about what you're doing, as well as helping the reader kind of understand it.

785
01:59:54,910 --> 01:59:59,050
All right. Question two. How about group six?

786
02:00:00,060 --> 02:00:05,500
This is an easy one. What theoretical framework was used? I hope we have it right.

787
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:11,229
There you go. Does that include framework?

788
02:00:11,230 --> 02:00:17,080
And then also, it's not really like necessarily the name of a theory, but social relationships and health.

789
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:22,120
I mean, there's of course, there's big literature out there on social relationships and hope.

790
02:00:22,420 --> 02:00:32,650
And actually one of the most important early studies that was done on social relationships in health, the paper was from authors at Michigan.

791
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:36,580
So Jim House, who retired several years ago,

792
02:00:36,580 --> 02:00:43,270
was in the sociology department and the epidemiology department here did this study that was published in Science,

793
02:00:43,270 --> 02:00:47,410
which was a huge deal to have a paper in science on social relationships and health.

794
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:57,459
And they found that social isolation was as strong a risk factor for mortality as cigaret smoking.

795
02:00:57,460 --> 02:01:02,020
And so this was like a huge finding that, you know,

796
02:01:02,020 --> 02:01:05,660
your social relationships are just as important for your health as these other like

797
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:09,370
health behaviors that we know to be strongly associated with health outcomes.

798
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:18,700
I think the pandemic has helped us realize how important social relationships are for both our mental health, health and our physical health.

799
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:23,020
But a lot of that early work was done here. So that's really interesting.

800
02:01:25,450 --> 02:01:30,490
All right. Group three, describe the data that was used.

801
02:01:36,810 --> 02:01:48,900
Uh huh. Yeah.

802
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:59,120
So they're using some of the data from the Katia study, the coronary artery risk and development and what I've already said from the study.

803
02:02:00,110 --> 02:02:04,360
So they're using data from the year 15 SUBSTUDY.

804
02:02:04,820 --> 02:02:11,850
It's not a full cardiac sample. By this time, they're 32 to 49 years old.

805
02:02:11,870 --> 02:02:15,230
And when they started the study, they were 18 to something.

806
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:21,649
And they've been followed up over time. And then there are did you say there's four study sites?

807
02:02:21,650 --> 02:02:29,780
I think in the large study, but for this study, it was only the Oakland and Chicago field sites that they used.

808
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:39,530
So even though the sample for the whole study is fairly large, by the time they got down to this particular subsample a little bit, only 782 people.

809
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:44,940
So they had to. Make it small. All right.

810
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:50,200
Um, how are the the exposures and outcomes operationalized?

811
02:02:50,230 --> 02:02:55,290
What's the how about what are you going to do all right here, too?

812
02:02:56,790 --> 02:02:59,880
So the exposures were all those different social relationships.

813
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:07,229
I took slight issue with escalating because I was confused. And maybe that's just because it's not it's not my area.

814
02:03:07,230 --> 02:03:15,510
So it looks to me like the they looked at like the number that you considered in your your social relationship and they had those categorized there.

815
02:03:15,510 --> 02:03:22,649
So and people could choose from those categories. Yeah. And then they also had the coverage and the relationship quality.

816
02:03:22,650 --> 02:03:26,220
So those that either measured social support or also social strain,

817
02:03:26,310 --> 02:03:30,960
the other than you got to do that kind of on a scale type thing of the not at all a little bit a lot.

818
02:03:31,350 --> 02:03:34,979
I would have liked to know more about the questions in what was used,

819
02:03:34,980 --> 02:03:39,840
but I think that's that's what it was trying to get at the outcome for allosteric load.

820
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:45,180
So they had 17 biomarkers that were from a couple of subcategories.

821
02:03:45,180 --> 02:03:48,390
So they had blood pressure information, heart rate variability.

822
02:03:49,410 --> 02:03:54,750
The sympathetic nervous system is notable events, but a couple of different biomarkers and all of those.

823
02:03:55,350 --> 02:04:00,989
And then to create that index, all of those biomarkers were put into quartiles, I'm assuming,

824
02:04:00,990 --> 02:04:04,350
based on the sample distribution and those that are in the highest quartile would

825
02:04:04,350 --> 02:04:07,500
be coded as high risk and the other ones were low risk and to be some together.

826
02:04:08,220 --> 02:04:12,540
But I also know a little bit about that. I don't think they explained it well. Okay.

827
02:04:12,870 --> 02:04:18,060
Yeah. So that is all right. I'll say it again because I know that was sort of a whole lot.

828
02:04:18,450 --> 02:04:24,390
So in terms of measuring the exposure, the exposure is social relationships, right.

829
02:04:24,780 --> 02:04:27,839
But how do you quantify social relationships?

830
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:33,240
So you have to get that a little more specific in terms of an operational definition of social relationships.

831
02:04:34,050 --> 02:04:38,370
So they're defining this as number of relationships.

832
02:04:38,820 --> 02:04:43,830
So that's like the number of reported close friends and relatives.

833
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:50,100
And there's these weird, funky categories where one of them is 2.5.

834
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:54,509
It's, you know, don't try to understand it.

835
02:04:54,510 --> 02:05:00,510
I think it's just roll with it. Um, and then also, so in addition to number of relationships, social support,

836
02:05:00,510 --> 02:05:06,719
so they ask a series of questions or things like how much do your family and friends care about you?

837
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:10,650
That kind of stuff. Or Non a little bit, a lot, whatever.

838
02:05:11,340 --> 02:05:15,240
Um, and then social strain.

839
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:18,480
So this is the sum of responses to four different questions,

840
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:24,450
including how often did your family and friends get on your nerves, which makes you laugh.

841
02:05:24,450 --> 02:05:33,720
But, um, so then have, has those same kind of categories then also the globe like Olivia, that is 17 different biomarkers.

842
02:05:34,110 --> 02:05:37,889
They're taking the distribution on each one, creating quartiles.

843
02:05:37,890 --> 02:05:47,130
And if you're in the highest risk quartile, you get assigned a score of one, otherwise you get a zero and then you sum across all of those 17.

844
02:05:47,580 --> 02:05:55,469
And then there's some kind of complicated stuff around how many of those can you be missing in order to have a score and that kind of thing.

845
02:05:55,470 --> 02:06:01,860
And yes, Olivia is a great point. The risk quartiles are not based on clinical cut points.

846
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:04,590
They're based on the distribution in the sample.

847
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:15,120
So if you if you compare our static adequate in this sample to a sample maybe of older adults who's in the highest risk quartile,

848
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:20,700
it would be different. Those different. Okay.

849
02:06:22,810 --> 02:06:28,090
What color variants were included and why 3 to 4.

850
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:32,380
Um, so I think they were kind of grouped into two.

851
02:06:33,220 --> 02:06:43,140
Uh huh. And so there is something. Smoking and physical activity were treated as companions or later.

852
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:50,100
Uh huh. Do you like that hugging? Yeah. Yeah. Could be confounders could be needed.

853
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:54,600
Mm hmm. Um, and then they also included Sociodemographic.

854
02:06:56,110 --> 02:07:02,670
In. Educational attainment, um, which I think is just treated as culture.

855
02:07:05,300 --> 02:07:11,840
Interact. Yeah. So they also look at some of that is is a fact modifier in their analysis.

856
02:07:12,010 --> 02:07:20,240
Yeah. So in terms of way over areas, they have age, race, ethnicity, educational attainment in their results section,

857
02:07:20,250 --> 02:07:26,370
they mentioned having control for income, but they don't mention having control for income in their methods section.

858
02:07:26,910 --> 02:07:34,830
Any idea why that might be the be. Does anyone go through the peer review process yet?

859
02:07:35,940 --> 02:07:40,979
If you read the paper, you submit your paper and then reviewers give you feedback.

860
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:46,800
And I guarantee you one reviewer said you need to control for income in addition to education.

861
02:07:47,130 --> 02:07:51,870
And they probably were like, fine. And they added it in the model, and then they forgot to update the method.

862
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:59,850
So you'll see this in every paper. And the more you go through them, the better you'll be going, Oh, that was a review, working on that.

863
02:08:00,660 --> 02:08:06,990
And sometimes the authors have an attitude about it and you can kind of tell, but that that would be my guess there.

864
02:08:07,260 --> 02:08:12,209
It's about what happens. So yeah, so they've got age, race, ethnicity, educational attainment,

865
02:08:12,210 --> 02:08:18,150
and then they have this kind of second model where they adjust for physical activity and smoking status.

866
02:08:18,570 --> 02:08:23,129
And they say that these are potential confounders or mediators.

867
02:08:23,130 --> 02:08:31,390
Why do you think they said that? I mean, I drew it out.

868
02:08:31,850 --> 02:08:37,979
Uh huh. I don't know what. Yeah, exactly.

869
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:46,500
So, like, I mean, just try it just for fun. This marker where you go, okay, let's say you've got social support.

870
02:08:53,930 --> 02:09:04,750
Oh, static load. And then you've got let's just use age as an example and let's use physical activity.

871
02:09:06,070 --> 02:09:06,550
Okay.

872
02:09:07,270 --> 02:09:14,560
So what do you think the if we were drawing the nature of the relationship between age and social support, what kind of arrow might I have there?

873
02:09:18,290 --> 02:09:23,690
Is age associated with social support. Do you think? Could be.

874
02:09:23,870 --> 02:09:27,610
Probably is. In what way? Yeah, Ali.

875
02:09:30,680 --> 02:09:43,520
Okay. So it could be like that? Yeah. So it could be that, like, as we age, we accumulate social relationships and therefore have more.

876
02:09:43,940 --> 02:09:48,110
Or you could argue as we age, depending on the stage of the life course,

877
02:09:48,110 --> 02:09:54,230
we lose social contacts because of things like having children or the death of social.

878
02:09:54,540 --> 02:10:00,110
Right. Like you could imagine some life course argument where this relationship might be different.

879
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:05,780
At a minimum, I think we can say they're probably correlated in some way.

880
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:09,820
Right. And then how do we think age is related to our static load?

881
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:28,720
What do you think they're. So I'm just thinking about chronological age here.

882
02:10:28,790 --> 02:10:33,170
Yeah. Don't think about biological things. You're getting to be chronological.

883
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:40,030
Do you think older people or younger people on average have higher blood pressure and worse cholesterol and.

884
02:10:40,610 --> 02:10:44,599
Yeah, right. So like older people would tend to have now of course,

885
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:53,509
in the fall you've got a limited age range and you've got allies that explode determined within your sample.

886
02:10:53,510 --> 02:10:58,730
So there really might not be much of a correlation between age and our static load in this particular sample.

887
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:07,640
But if you're thinking in general, yeah, you've got this. So if you have this kind of relationship here, what how would you classify age?

888
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:16,610
Confounder. Right? This is a confounder. Okay. Now we've got physical activity.

889
02:11:17,390 --> 02:11:23,750
Let's start with the easy one. How is physical activity related to our static load event?

890
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:36,380
Yeah. If you if you exercise, if you have higher physical activity, you probably have lower alt static load rate because what is the nature of that?

891
02:11:37,010 --> 02:11:40,700
So how might social support be related to physical activity?

892
02:11:45,350 --> 02:11:48,980
Yeah, I think so. Because, I mean.

893
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:59,710
People do carve out time. It's got to be you know, you're doing it in a group.

894
02:12:02,490 --> 02:12:10,000
Yes, I started a group exercising and then I made friends with the people who were in my group so that it goes that way.

895
02:12:11,020 --> 02:12:18,250
But maybe I have more friends and so I'm more inclined to go engage in activities with them.

896
02:12:18,280 --> 02:12:27,700
Yeah. So this is why they're kind of hedging a little bit because they're like, you know, if it goes this way, it's a mediator.

897
02:12:28,660 --> 02:12:35,350
Right. And if it goes this way, it's a confounder and we have cross-sectional data.

898
02:12:35,350 --> 02:12:40,450
So all we know is this. All we know is that there's some association with it.

899
02:12:40,450 --> 02:12:43,570
We don't know that, like the causal nature of that relationship.

900
02:12:43,990 --> 02:12:50,560
And so if it's a confounder, do we need to adjust for it?

901
02:12:51,700 --> 02:12:56,290
Yes. If it's a mediator, do we need to adjust for it?

902
02:12:57,260 --> 02:13:00,880
No. And should we adjust for it if it's a mediator?

903
02:13:01,480 --> 02:13:11,620
No. Right. So, um, if this is difficult, this is really tricky and well, you'll find it in every single paper that like,

904
02:13:12,010 --> 02:13:15,819
it's not always clear what you should and shouldn't adjust for.

905
02:13:15,820 --> 02:13:20,440
And so this is part of the reason why they do it in two steps.

906
02:13:21,730 --> 02:13:26,440
And you hope that the results are too different, but sometimes they are right.

907
02:13:27,250 --> 02:13:31,329
Okay. Um, I wanted to say one other thing about that.

908
02:13:31,330 --> 02:13:39,969
So Al, you raised a question actually in the discussion about this, like why is race a Kobe area in here like that?

909
02:13:39,970 --> 02:13:44,930
They didn't explain why they included these things as covariance.

910
02:13:44,930 --> 02:13:50,350
Did you want to say anything about that? Um, well, I also have Patricia.

911
02:13:50,590 --> 02:13:52,720
Yeah, Patricia and Cynthia also like.

912
02:13:54,010 --> 02:14:04,200
Yeah, I mean, I just think they, you know, they didn't really use some of the structural theories and just kind of parameter covariance and.

913
02:14:05,670 --> 02:14:11,800
Some of the patients. Yeah.

914
02:14:12,370 --> 02:14:16,900
Let's just say that you want to say anything else about that. Okay.

915
02:14:16,980 --> 02:14:20,110
Yeah. And, Cynthia, did you want to add anything? Okay.

916
02:14:20,350 --> 02:14:25,990
Yeah. So this is this was the kind of Perlman has this point in his paper, in the social stress paper,

917
02:14:26,350 --> 02:14:30,790
about how a lot of times when we just start focusing like further down in the model,

918
02:14:31,120 --> 02:14:39,310
we lose sight of what's actually shaping the thing that is our exposure and how social status is related to social support.

919
02:14:39,340 --> 02:14:43,629
Right. So, you know, Caroline would be all interested in not just this piece,

920
02:14:43,630 --> 02:14:50,490
but like how does how does age and gender and race and socioeconomic status pattern,

921
02:14:50,530 --> 02:14:57,310
the types of social relationships that people have about the amount of strain, the amount of support, all that kind of stuff.

922
02:15:00,170 --> 02:15:04,070
All right. What did the authors find?

923
02:15:04,130 --> 02:15:11,330
Have I done all the groups? Or did I skip a group? How about group two?

924
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:14,839
Can you tell us what the authors found? Yeah.

925
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:20,959
So they found that the social strains were most family and positive, not related to overall wealth.

926
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:23,510
So the social strain went up. So did the static load.

927
02:15:24,260 --> 02:15:30,520
But also the social ties and emotional more support were negatively related to of both good and bad.

928
02:15:30,710 --> 02:15:35,540
Yeah. Which was, I thought kind of a fun finding and that they focused on both the negative and the positive.

929
02:15:35,870 --> 02:15:43,489
Yeah. That like certain social relationships themselves can be related to our static load in different ways,

930
02:15:43,490 --> 02:15:48,080
depending on whether it's the positive aspects of social relationships or the negative aspects

931
02:15:48,080 --> 02:15:53,000
of social relationships of which anyone who has social relationships knows that there's both.

932
02:15:53,570 --> 02:16:02,719
There's the good and the bad kind of aspects of that. So yeah, so they found, you know, they, they looked at sex and race as a fact modifiers.

933
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:06,140
They found that there was no difference in terms of the association.

934
02:16:06,350 --> 02:16:16,280
So then they just presented models for the whole sample. There were kind of larger of sizes for the full scale than for the subscales.

935
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:20,210
If you notice that like for the full scale, the results are stronger.

936
02:16:20,720 --> 02:16:26,330
And then there was a strong and highly significant gradient for each social relationship measure for the full scale.

937
02:16:26,330 --> 02:16:31,969
In the bivariate analysis, these results remain significant after adjusting for covariates.

938
02:16:31,970 --> 02:16:35,180
And the biggest effect, like you said, Olivia, was for social strains.

939
02:16:35,660 --> 02:16:43,430
And then in one model they combined all three of the different social relationship variables in there to see which are still significant,

940
02:16:44,300 --> 02:16:51,020
and only the social strains remained significant. So then for support and the number of contacts were no longer significant.

941
02:16:52,610 --> 02:16:59,240
This was a super, super interesting finding and most previous research has just focused on this positive aspects of social relationships.

942
02:17:00,370 --> 02:17:06,200
All right. What were the strengths and limitations of the study?

943
02:17:06,250 --> 02:17:11,000
How about five? One of the strange.

944
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:25,700
The they of professional also. Yeah.

945
02:17:36,050 --> 02:17:39,320
Exactly. So, you know, some of those things, like we said,

946
02:17:39,340 --> 02:17:46,400
looking at the negative aspects of relationships in addition to the positive ones, what's kind of a good thing in the study?

947
02:17:47,030 --> 02:17:52,800
Um, the multi systems approach, some people would say that the disadvantages, some people would say is that,

948
02:17:52,970 --> 02:17:59,120
you know, I think our site included a little bit controversial, like whether people think it's useful or not.

949
02:17:59,120 --> 02:18:05,530
I mean, I think one of the things that's challenging about it is that there's no direct like clinical kind of

950
02:18:05,540 --> 02:18:11,270
relevance or application of this type of measure because you're kind of smushing everything together.

951
02:18:11,780 --> 02:18:22,400
So some people don't like this. So it kind of depends on your your perspective and whether you're interested in it from kind of the social

952
02:18:22,580 --> 02:18:28,850
point of view or whether you're interested in it for more of like a biomedical or clinical kind of perspective.

953
02:18:28,850 --> 02:18:31,580
So you might analyze it differently depending on those things.

954
02:18:32,300 --> 02:18:42,379
Um, you know, one thing that's nice about using a young sample, so this is before people have serious disease and so it can help you understand,

955
02:18:42,380 --> 02:18:47,480
like prior to the onset of disease, is there evidence of relationships with this?

956
02:18:47,480 --> 02:18:52,640
And so that's kind of a nice thing about using these biomarkers and using a going sample.

957
02:18:53,150 --> 02:18:59,059
Um, weaknesses, anesthetic load, there's kind of arbitrary cut offs, right?

958
02:18:59,060 --> 02:19:02,810
Like using the highest risk quartile is somewhat arbitrary.

959
02:19:02,810 --> 02:19:07,700
It's not a clinically meaningful cut point. And you can't like we said,

960
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:17,870
you can't compare across studies because the static load score is done within the Singapore and then like you guys

961
02:19:18,350 --> 02:19:25,489
put your shirt cross sectional so it could be that sick people are less able to maintain social relationships.

962
02:19:25,490 --> 02:19:32,840
So this premise that we have here might be wrong and it might be going that way and then we're totally wrong.

963
02:19:33,410 --> 02:19:36,500
Um, and then also the limited h range.

964
02:19:38,390 --> 02:19:41,690
Okay. Let's see. Group three.

965
02:19:41,780 --> 02:19:49,060
Do you want to tell us the conclusion? Okay.

966
02:19:50,010 --> 02:20:31,710
Um, just wanted to. Yeah.

967
02:20:31,730 --> 02:20:35,530
So they, they really, they found support for that hypothesis.

968
02:20:35,530 --> 02:20:42,700
Right. So like social relationships do seem to be related to multiple aspects of biological regulation,

969
02:20:43,180 --> 02:20:49,360
but really only when they're looking at the full alphabetical scale, which I think is an important point.

970
02:20:49,540 --> 02:20:59,559
That was part of why they were arguing that it is important to look at all of those together rather than to just focus on individual ones.

971
02:20:59,560 --> 02:21:03,129
And part of that could be, you know, it's it's not a huge sample size.

972
02:21:03,130 --> 02:21:06,940
They may have been underpowered for some of this stuff too.

973

977
02:21:37,910 --> 02:21:44,000
