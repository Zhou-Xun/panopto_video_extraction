1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,520
Here we go. Okay, everything. Everything's going on here for everybody.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,080
Really? Cruising along the semester.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:18,570
And as I said, the next few weeks in this class are kind of the most rigorous slash technical with regards to the content,

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,770
I'm telling you, and the problem sets, etc.

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,640
But again, if you ever have concerns, let me know. Um.

6
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,090
Problems will be at least a chance to take a look at the first.

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,450
Several problems are again engaging with reference materials and things like that.

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,620
And then the next few lectures, there's a problem or two that aligns kind of with what we cover in class on the problem.

9
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:49,150
So I'll try to point that out right there. Um, so here we are today.

10
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,580
Fundamentals of gases and vapors. All right.

11
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,950
And then at the end of today, I'll talk a little bit about the the next assignment.

12
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,430
Again, this is one that you have quite a while. I just wanted to get out there to use it and manage your time accordingly.

13
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,880
All right. So gases and vapors.

14
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,590
So we're going way back or this is, you know, high school, college chemistry.

15
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:24,720
So this is one of several lectures where I haven't had the courage or time to really reinvent,

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,800
really re-imagine the material, how to best convey the material.

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:37,740
So I do this mostly. The previous course slides for this from Professor Sellers, who taught this cluster for many, many years.

18
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,780
And there's not a ton of slides in this lecture, but it can be a bit dense.

19
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,960
So if you want me to stop and explain something, I will definitely try my best to do so.

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,370
So a little bit about what we're going to be talking about today. So we're going to give some definitions upfront.

21
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:00,150
Again, this is all kind of basic stuff, but once you start combining everything together, you get a little confusing.

22
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,799
And then we're going to revisit the universal gas law,

23
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,230
which I'm guessing most of you have or all of you have seen at some point in your chemistry training.

24
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:19,919
Then we'll talk about a few various law, other laws. This one's called social pressures, and we're going to be using that.

25
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,390
How does this result in being able to use it to our advantage?

26
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,240
And as well, we'll show some of these examples. A lot of this is related to estimating exposure.

27
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:37,890
So while we might not be talking about actually taking measurements right now, some of these can be used for modeling and screening.

28
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,430
So it's sort of a quick, quick method to to decide what what should be done next.

29
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:51,030
But again, may not be the most quantitative way to do it compared to actually taking measurements.

30
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,900
We'll talk about different concentrations and converting back and forth.

31
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,239
We'll cover this law,

32
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:11,500
which is relevant to another way to screen for potential exposures and relevant to one of the problems on the problems as is favorite hazard ratio.

33
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:22,650
So this is just an outline of what is to be covered. And, you know, again, this is a lot of stuff, at least for me.

34
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,880
This was one of the reason, one of the things that drew me toward environmental health,

35
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,700
industrial health was, you know, I sat through so many years of various chemistry classes.

36
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,460
Not really. It wasn't really connecting with me. But this is a way to kind of you're able to apply it to something useful.

37
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,900
So that's that's one reason I was drawn to this was profession.

38
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:53,640
So some working definitions of gas, again, as we've talked about, is a substance that is in the form of the gas, normal and normal temperatures.

39
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:03,030
So for normal temperatures, we're going to say 25 centigrade, which is and normal pressure is one atmosphere.

40
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:12,240
We're 760 millimeters of mercury. Vapor, then is a substance that's a liquid at room temperature.

41
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:21,960
But given the right amount of heat, it will evaporate and it could exist as a as a gas.

42
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,990
So what? How do we differentiate what's what's what?

43
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:35,330
One way is with the vapor pressure. So this is the the phone is the pressure exerted by a substance at equilibrium with its condensed phase?

44
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,850
Another way to think of it is the maximum amount of vapor that would be present relative to.

45
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:49,530
The atmosphere here. And this does change with what the temperature surrounding the liquid.

46
00:04:50,460 --> 00:05:01,980
Again, this is kind of intuitive. You see a puddle of water is much more likely to evaporate in a 100 degree day than 40 degree day.

47
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:11,480
But that also relates to humidity as well. So again, it's a measure of volatility which is useful for our purposes.

48
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:18,110
So when we encounter a substance or a chemical in a process, we can think about how likely is that to exist as liquid?

49
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,470
How likely is it to be as it as a gas or vapor?

50
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,610
And what conditions would make it phase in and out between those two?

51
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,820
Another concept is boiling point temperature.

52
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:35,060
So this is defined as the temperature required to raise the vapor pressure of a substance to atmospheric pressure.

53
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:42,500
So a related concept and it's inversely related to your your vapor pressure.

54
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:50,180
It's a boiling point. Temperature is used for other things as well, but it is direct and will continue to meet the pressure.

55
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:07,020
Another definition that's important throughout today is more so back to Avogadro's number 6.0 to 3 times 10 to 23 molecules per mole,

56
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,060
and each more has a mass equal to the molecular weight of those of a substance.

57
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:20,790
So, you know, you add up the atoms in your molecular formula that gives you the molecular weight for that compound,

58
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,950
and that's defined as how much that many number of molecules weighs.

59
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:35,280
So one more time with 92 grams per day and that's you can take the formula.

60
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,570
Look at the periodic table. Count those up. And that gives you your.

61
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,640
What's the word, everybody with me so far?

62
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,850
Basic chemistry. Okay. Density and specific gravity.

63
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:56,250
So this is mass per unit volume simply expressed as Graham per cent meter squared or any sort of units.

64
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,740
So water has been seen about one gram, four centimeter cubed at normal temperature pressure.

65
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,900
Air density is about 10012 natural temperature pressure.

66
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:18,920
So. This is relevant because you'll see some some scenarios while you're given a volume or you're given a mass,

67
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,030
and sometimes you need to transfer between the two.

68
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,320
And that's where obviously. Density comes in.

69
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:34,820
So specific gravity that is basically just the relative density compared to a reference substance,

70
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:40,170
substance liquids that's usually water and for a gas or vapor that's there.

71
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:47,840
So that's defined as your specific gravity. Okay.

72
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,080
So if you make me. This was burned into your brain at some point.

73
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,160
You chemistry. PB equals and our t that's our universal gas line.

74
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:08,270
So we have our pressure and the units can get confusing for some of these because there's a lot of different fields use different things as.

75
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,940
You know, it's convention for this particular one.

76
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:20,710
We're using the atmospheres for pressure, volume and leaders and as our number of moles are, is a constant.

77
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:25,049
So we want so much time on that because that doesn't factor into a lot of the types

78
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,250
of problems and equations we're going to apply these to our for our purposes.

79
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,670
And then t is temperature. And again, that's that's a kelvin.

80
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,230
So if we can remember how Kelvin relates to some degree Celsius,

81
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:46,410
that's 73 to 73 is that magic number you add to your degrees C and now give me Kelvin.

82
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:54,160
So this describes the behavior of guests and vapors near ideal conditions.

83
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,230
So we're assuming making some assumptions that things are going to behave as if they're ideal.

84
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,750
And that's true of gases,

85
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:08,200
but also true of chemicals that are in the labor force that really helps us to do a lot of things we're going to show you today.

86
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,970
And there's some some nuances to this, depending on the specifics.

87
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,830
But for our purposes, I think we can assume your ideal conditions.

88
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:29,990
For all its properties. So a little bit more on illustrating how we can apply this.

89
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:38,330
So if you just simply rearrange that ideal gas line, it can tell us what that relationship is between pressure,

90
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,830
temperature and volume, if any of those change in your conditions.

91
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:53,450
So if you want to know what? So if you change a pressure temperature or both, that's going to impact your volume.

92
00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:01,700
And here's how you do it. So just to illustrate a bit, you can have a balloon which has a flexible barrier, right?

93
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,690
Another way to think of this is with a piston that has solid walls and floor and a ceiling that can move up and down.

94
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,780
So what happens if we increase the pressure of a balloon?

95
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:28,910
The volume or if he stretched out the balloon, what happens to the pressure inside?

96
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,970
I guess I should have started that way. This is where I get all mixed up.

97
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,940
Okay. All right. So we have this volume as volume.

98
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,240
Let's say we're able to stretch the balloon. It's a sealed balloon.

99
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,800
You stretch it. What happens to the pressure inside that would go up against the increase?

100
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:52,340
It decreases because you have the same amount of air in that space and it's not as pressurized.

101
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,720
On the flip side, what if we we have a set volume and we push this plunger down on the common piston?

102
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:05,450
What happens to the pressure in that space for decreasing the volume, increasing the pressure?

103
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,890
That's right. And that sort of plays out in this equation.

104
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:16,850
So the bottom line here is that volume is inversely related to pressure.

105
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:27,380
So Boyle's law tells us that a lot of laws could be thrown around with people's names on dates way, way back to early, early times.

106
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:35,030
Okay. So that's one important concept of this of this slide that I wanted to get across is volume inversely related to pressure?

107
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:43,370
And then volume is directly, positively proportional to temperature.

108
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:49,760
So you increase the temperature of this balloon.

109
00:11:49,760 --> 00:12:00,400
What's going to happen? If you increase the temperature to expand increases, yeah, it's going to increase that volume.

110
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,950
So that's based on something called Charles Charles's law.

111
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:14,790
So. To put this into practice, say we want to know what's the impact of volume.

112
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:24,300
If we have a big change in temperature, you can use this equation for that second volume equal to your original volume times.

113
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,880
Pressure condition one over two, temperature condition two over one.

114
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:37,550
So again, this relates to the inverse relationship with pressure and positive relationship with temperature,

115
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:43,070
and that can be used again to find that second volume.

116
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:52,040
And, you know, if you need to rearrange to solve for something else and for this, we're assuming,

117
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:58,400
again, that our number of ball stays constant and that far from ideal gas law is also a constant.

118
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,180
Okay. So you're wondering, what does this have to do with anything?

119
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,720
First, we have to talk about reference conditions.

120
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:15,960
So if you recall in your chemistry training, you probably also used what's called standard temperature pressure STP for a lot of these calculations.

121
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:26,040
So that's despite a zero centigrade to 73 Kelvin, as was pointed out earlier, and one atmosphere which is equal to 70, 60 millimeters of mercury.

122
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:34,380
So a standard temperature pressure, one more of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.

123
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,700
So that's a point. So again, we talked about what a mole is.

124
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:48,720
And based on the ideal gas law and the known properties, that standard temperature pressure that takes up 22.4 liters.

125
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,970
However, because that's a colder temperature than we usually encounter in our fieldwork.

126
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,950
It's not used much in industrial hygiene and occupational health calculations.

127
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:07,350
Where we use instead is called normal temperature, pressure and tpe, which is the same pressure,

128
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:13,770
but we have a higher temperature, so it's 25 C, it's just very commonly used.

129
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,340
And we add that to 73, that's to 98. Kelvin.

130
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:30,480
And if we punch these differences, this difference in temperature into this previous equation, what you'd get for your he too is that 24.45.

131
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,610
So this is our mold more volume of an ideal case at that normal temperature

132
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:40,620
pressure and this is the number you'll see a lot and calculations that will show.

133
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:51,120
Okay. So on our poems that I wrote. Do it that much, but will it safely and cheaply or as TV?

134
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,300
If it's important, it will. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it will.

135
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,740
And if not, let me know. Okay. Okay.

136
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,960
So I example here we have one more guess.

137
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:13,530
Like we said, I proposed 24.45 liters. And that normal temperature and pressure, what would that same gas volume be at 35 degrees Celsius.

138
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,860
So again, we go to 35 plus to 73, get three or eight, and then we punch that in our equation.

139
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:27,360
Again, if you're doing this off the top of your head, it can get confusing as well as far as p1p to t to t one.

140
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:34,260
But again, just try to remember that that relationship as volume increases, temperature,

141
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,759
temperature and volume or possibly associated rose pressures, inversely associated, right?

142
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:47,260
So you just punch that and you have your T to over two one and because it's an increase in temperature,

143
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,880
you should be expecting that volume to increase rate because that's what we've already talked about.

144
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,309
So that equation gives you 25.2.

145
00:15:53,310 --> 00:16:00,629
So if you get an answer for an increased temperature that's below that 24.45, then you've probably flipped it in the equation.

146
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:08,100
Right? So that's that's an example of how this plays out for a temperature difference of ten Celsius.

147
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:17,730
One, if we have a pressure change, what's an example of when might we have a different pressure when we're doing environmental occupational?

148
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,860
Take stuff. Colorado?

149
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,930
Yes. The elevation is a big one for sure. I'm sure there's probably some specialized.

150
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,340
Places that people were in their pressurized or not pressurized.

151
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:38,870
But yeah, what I was thinking of this is altitude for sure. So an example here, what if we have a lower pressure?

152
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,490
So just intuitively, we think about how the plane going to change with a lower pressure.

153
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:52,740
If you think about the inverse of that, for example, you increase the volume, the pressure dropped.

154
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:58,800
So here we're dropping the pressure. It's going to increase, which can be associated with an increase in volume.

155
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:05,640
So here we have our P to the denominator that calculates out to 25.

156
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,230
Everyone with me so far. All right. This isn't even the confusing part.

157
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,800
Coming up. All right. Don't. Partial pressures again.

158
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:28,709
A lot of names have you memorize these, but they can be useful to kind of know for reference for certain things to work.

159
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:35,670
Gas pressure, a piece of tea in a system is the sum of all partial pressures of the gases or vapors in the system.

160
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:44,070
So it's just simply the partial pressure is added up is equal to your total pressure, which is typically our atmospheric pressure.

161
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:51,900
And for these types of equations, instead of seeing one ECM usually see 760.

162
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,840
You know, engineering, they might be using tilt pascals.

163
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,100
You just never know. But there's always conversion chance for those types of things.

164
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:14,250
But always you got to always pay attention to the. So anyway, this can be used to look at relative air concentrations.

165
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:24,800
For example, in a mixture, things like that. Things if you want to prioritize what to approach first in your risk management.

166
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,970
This can be used as well. Okay.

167
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:40,670
Unit units of concentration. So parts per million is a very commonly used term, but we consider that to be a relative term of concentration.

168
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:47,720
We can also express for gases and vapors. You can also express those in absolute terms, which is a mass over volume.

169
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,840
And because we're talking about gases and vapors, every single one can be expressed in one or the other.

170
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:01,490
And a lot of times a very common thing we have to do is just kind of calculate back and forth between the two for various various purposes.

171
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,360
So, you know, ideally everyone would express things in absolute terms.

172
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:15,580
But like I said, even to these people sometimes are parts per million and.

173
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,610
So that's that's just something to be aware of.

174
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,200
And also an example of a little bit here of of why it might might make a difference.

175
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:29,840
So parts per million, obviously, is just volume per volume.

176
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:35,780
And then you multiply that volume per volume times 10.6 or a million to get that passed.

177
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:41,570
So an example here is one part familiar ammonia refers to if you had one microgram.

178
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,460
Per liter of ammonia, per liter of air.

179
00:19:50,780 --> 00:20:02,020
So, I mean, you can it's just one microliter per liter of air would be one PPD people and we'll do more examples.

180
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,000
So to be a little bit more detailed here.

181
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,530
So that's I'm considering it for all you bases but.

182
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,020
It can also be done on a smaller basis for pressure basis.

183
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:25,460
So 1 p.m. volume two volume is equivalent to one people in pressure to pressure.

184
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:31,130
And also, if you want to more, buy more as well.

185
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:36,170
Again, this will come into play with some of these examples we show.

186
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,040
Questions, I. Probably some concerns.

187
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:53,799
Okay. These next two slides are a little busy, basically just showing you the the math behind why that is,

188
00:20:53,800 --> 00:21:03,610
why the partial pressure, the PMI by volume is equivalent to keeping by pressure, which is equal to PMI molar ratio.

189
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,440
So that's just relating it back to the ideal gas line.

190
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:14,920
So for pure liquid or solid, you can.

191
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,850
Equate that partial pressure. Into vapor pressure which then can give you an estimated.

192
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,340
Your concentration. I don't do an example of that. So where do you get vapor pressures?

193
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,900
We'll talk about that as well. There's something called the Antoine equation that you can calculate.

194
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:45,510
It's also available in certain reference books. Wikipedia sometimes has it on the figure a Google a chemical.

195
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,250
I usually try to just verify that with the second source.

196
00:21:50,520 --> 00:22:00,230
But there's there's sources for that. So when we get our p r ratio by volume, by pressure, by more, we can express it as we talked about.

197
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:08,129
You could also express it as a percent, which is equal to parts per hundred or so in occupational settings.

198
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,670
Parts per million is extremely common. Let's get into environmental settings.

199
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:15,420
We talk maybe a lot more about parts per billion, parts per trillion.

200
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,890
But same concept. You're just adding more serious.

201
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:31,320
When we're talking about using partial pressures as vapor pressures to estimate air concentrations, we have to assume a closed system and saturation.

202
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:36,510
So that would come into play later when we decide what method to use for a scenario calculation.

203
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:45,900
Just remember those assumptions. This is similar to just talking about per volume.

204
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:58,740
And another sort of caveat, we're assuming that the cut of the amount was that it was not a hiccup, though, as it stands right now.

205
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,590
So.

206
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:12,650
What I was going to say, you know, the amount the toxic substance is usually considered to be low enough relative to the amount of air that we don't,

207
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:17,630
you know, add to that so that it doesn't add to the volume or account.

208
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,730
And then you still have the same denominator.

209
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:25,650
I mean, that's that's just another sort of caveat that we don't really typically worry about earthquakes.

210
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:31,070
So just friggin forget about that, but know it as much. Okay.

211
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:39,350
So this is just, again, bringing back the idea of gas law and to equating pressure ratio, volume ratio or water issue.

212
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:45,290
So let's get to the get to it here. So here's just a basic example.

213
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:54,720
So a person is working in a histology clinic prep room and inadvertently knocks over a bottle of cyclohexane without noticing.

214
00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:00,800
She continues to work because the odor threshold of cyclohexane is so high it provides the word property.

215
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:05,469
So I briefly mentioned. Water thresholds.

216
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:09,299
Last time, I kind of maybe I dismissed it a little too much.

217
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,530
You could in situations like this, you could see how it might be helpful.

218
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:18,880
Right? So I have posted a table of over thresholds under the resources page on canvas in case you are interested.

219
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,500
I can't remember if I, I don't think I use it in chrome, so it's going to be all.

220
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:31,470
But anyway, that's there. So anyway, hours later she goes home, has dinner, but then she notices she has a split.

221
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,630
So she goes back to the prep room and sees that the bottle,

222
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:46,330
sees the bottle of cyclohexane was knocked over and that there is still some liquid left in there recalling her industrial hygiene chemistry class,

223
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:55,210
as we all do. She uses Dalton's law of partial pressures, and the university estimates the magnitude of her exposure and roughly estimate the hazard.

224
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:59,410
So what we can use here is what we've been talking about.

225
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:04,120
Of course, we have some assumptions, right? We're assuming saturation.

226
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:09,339
So this is a huge part of this problem. And this is relevant to problem solving.

227
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:17,290
So problem sets, quizzes, C-H exams in the future for some of you that not all the solvent have evaporated.

228
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:22,000
So that's a huge clue in how to solve this problem compared to other approaches.

229
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,830
And again, we're assuming a small room. We're assuming there's no ventilation.

230
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:31,930
We're just trying to get a quick and rough estimate of what could the exposure possible,

231
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:36,250
what's the kind of maximum level that could be in the air to decide what to do next?

232
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:42,250
So using Dalton's law of partial pressures,

233
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:50,220
we can look at partial pressure of this chemical entrance to our total pressure and then multiply it by 100 million.

234
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:55,780
So our maximum concentration is simply, again, because of these things,

235
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:00,970
we can equate that partial pressure with pressure, with vapor pressure right in the system.

236
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:13,300
So we look up the vapor pressure of cyclohexane and we find it is again, this can be found in textbooks that calculated 100 millimeters of mercury.

237
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:18,790
The CRC handbook is available. It's a super old text.

238
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,080
If you go to the UVM library and sign in,

239
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:27,040
you can have free access to it and you go to don't go to the book one because that's like a super old textbook.

240
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:32,740
You have to find off the shelf, go to one top database and then you can search for stuff and it has all the tables there for you.

241
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,700
So our partial pressure equal to our vapor pressure we've hooked up is 100.

242
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,299
We divide that by our atmospheric pressure. That normal temperature pressure is 760.

243
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:55,840
Mm. The mercury and we multiply that by a million and we get 113,000 parts per million, which is a lot.

244
00:26:56,290 --> 00:27:02,500
That's, I mean that's more than you typically would want to see because then you're talking about actual parts per 100.

245
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:17,860
So, you know, obviously a handy thing to just always remember is if you go from parts per million to percent, you just divide by 10,000 or vice versa.

246
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:24,730
But the ideal concentration for this particular chemical is 10,000 people.

247
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,710
You may remember the ideal age means just for breathing.

248
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:36,430
I briefly, just so briefly mentioned a few centuries ago, but yeah, it's got immediately dangerous to life and health.

249
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:40,580
It's kind of like that concentration. You don't want to even know about encounter.

250
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:52,690
So obviously this is a problem. She needs to contact health, probably go to the hospital and immediately seek medical attention because again,

251
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,120
this is a maximum we don't know what it was when she was in there,

252
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:01,180
but the potential is there that she needs to take action and report report the action and get to the medical care.

253
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:07,630
So that's just one basic illustration of how you might use some of these.

254
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:15,180
Practice questions are. Again, the clue here is underlined.

255
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:27,650
I mentioned the CRC handbook has listing. The other thing to think about, remember, with the peer pressure it is temperature dependent.

256
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,810
So even if you see it listed on Wikipedia or in a textbook, it's going to be at a certain temperature.

257
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,320
Hopefully it's 25 C, it could be 20 C.

258
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:41,570
If you want a specific temperature, you can then use this Antoine's equation.

259
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,920
There's several versions, but this is the one most people use these days.

260
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:59,810
So for a given temperature, you can use your temperature and Kelvin and then add in these A, B and C constants, which is specific to a chemical.

261
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:05,840
And then I'll give you it'll give you the natural log of the vapor pressure.

262
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,700
So again, if if you can find the vapor pressure, but it's not the right temperature that you want.

263
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,860
You can find these for a lot of chemicals, these A.B.C. constants.

264
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:29,690
Some of some of them are in the Appendix B, which I also posted on the resources on canvas for a lot of chemicals or in other other types of tests.

265
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:39,850
There you go. I think there is a question about the pressure on the problems.

266
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,769
I don't know if you'll have to go to this level of detail, but it's there, sir,

267
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:52,180
if you determine it is for chemicals where they can't find those constants anymore,

268
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,410
which if we recall, there's tens of thousands of chemicals out there.

269
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:01,080
Right. So that might not have constants for everything if you can find that boiling point.

270
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:06,710
Remember, we talked about the boiling point was inversely related to the vapor pressure.

271
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,360
There's this simple equation. You tell me, I see an equation like this.

272
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:17,229
I kind of chuckle because it's either empirically derived or a lot of unit changes or something.

273
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:22,030
I don't know. But you probably never use this.

274
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:29,300
But just if there is a chemical that you can't find a vapor pressure or use concerns for, but you can find a boiling point.

275
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:37,120
You can use this just for your back pocket, for rainy day fever if you ever need it.

276
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,219
But we're not going to talk about that one any more. Okay.

277
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:52,900
Here's another example. A bottle of toluene c7h8 is broken in a confined space, and this time all the solvent evaporates.

278
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:59,900
What is the maximum concentration? So let's talk through this one.

279
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,930
So this one's different, right? We're not going to be able to use the partial pressures because everything's evaporated.

280
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:09,800
We don't it's not saturated, obviously, because there's no liquid left.

281
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,200
So we're going to have to take a different approach here.

282
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:21,230
But because we have an estimate of how much liquid there was to begin with, we can equate that to a mass instead of a liquid mass.

283
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:26,600
It's now a vapor mass and use the volume of the room to calculate a concentration.

284
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:36,800
So at this one, because we would need to get a mass, what we want to do is, is realize the density which is given here, that's grams per milliliter.

285
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,030
And so we multiply our volume of the the liquid in question by the.

286
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:51,650
Density and they'll give us how much grams how many grams we have in the room.

287
00:31:54,410 --> 00:32:03,500
And then we also have to take into consideration the the molar volume of both the vapor and the molecular weight.

288
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:12,990
And by doing that, we get 115 meters and we know the volume of the rooms, we take that 100.

289
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,750
We're doing it on a volume basis instead of a patient pressure basis in the last.

290
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,590
Example, 115 divided by 10,000 meters.

291
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:33,480
But we had to change meters, two liters, there's a thousand liters and a cubic meter and we get 11.5% million.

292
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,950
So that makes sense. And there's different ways you can do this.

293
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,390
You can do, you know, some of the conversions you can do later or earlier.

294
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:53,600
It's just a different order. So which variables were we given that we can use virtual temperature?

295
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,340
Anything else? Russian pressure.

296
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:10,560
That's true. Although we're assuming in tpy because if it told us we were at at some weird temperature or pressure,

297
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,730
we would have needed those variables to come up with a different molar volume. Right.

298
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,879
Perfect. All right.

299
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:27,860
So this is just a text version. Again, for your reference, if you find a similar problem and you want to.

300
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:39,750
Think back to it. But again, you could have done everything on a volume basis and then convert that people to.

301
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:46,270
Micrograms per cubic meter. And I can read this to you, this history reference.

302
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:53,070
If you need to come back to it. So I mentioned you could do it one way and then convert at the end.

303
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:57,420
There's a very direct way to do this that we use all the time.

304
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,950
And the main part here is these two boxes here.

305
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,470
So to go from PM two milligrams per cubic meter,

306
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:16,410
you take your parts per million and you multiply it by your molecular weight in grams from all divided by your molar volume and.

307
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:24,360
TP it's 24.45 with to 24.5, and that'll give you the concentration in milligrams per cubic meter.

308
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,960
If you have milligrams per cubic meter, you want to do two parts per million, you just inverse convert that equation.

309
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:39,330
You take times the molar volume divided by the molecular weight multiplied by your concentration and then I'll give you your PPA.

310
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:48,000
The derogations up here, because if you look at the units here, they seem weird, like they want to cancel out the way they cancel this.

311
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,809
It's given up here if you're so inclined to look at that.

312
00:34:51,810 --> 00:35:01,140
But what you need to know is down here, so what tends to be numerically higher the mgs for a given chemical,

313
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,770
it's concentration in milligrams per cubic meter or parts per million.

314
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:26,060
So, you know, we're telling you in on the last question, we gave it in parts per million.

315
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:34,780
If we were to convert that to a milligram per cubic meter with that numerical value, you think be greater than 11.5 or less than five.

316
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,540
Never mind. I'm just trying to remember myself.

317
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:52,200
So the way we do that is because the molecular weight here is on the numerator and.

318
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:59,380
24 is on the bottom. Anything with a molecular weight of more than 24.4 or five.

319
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,140
You're going to have a higher.

320
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:10,740
Numerical value in milligrams per cubic meter the most is a super small molecule, and that's just kind of a good thing to remember if you.

321
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:18,570
It's a good way to find mistakes. If you do, the conversion in your prime is a higher number than your milligrams per cubic meter.

322
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:24,540
And if it's not a super tiny molecule, you'll think maybe I'll interpret that that equation.

323
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,510
So I have to do a lot of this on the program. So it's pretty straightforward, but a good thing to kind of get used to doing.

324
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:46,440
Okay. Here's the example of why we call one relative concentration and one absolute concentration.

325
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:51,240
So this is going back to that original balloon or piston example.

326
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:57,690
So say we have two different conditions and we have a chamber here.

327
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:07,560
And the first condition, it's ten cubic meters of air and we're adding carbon disulfide, which has molecular weight of 76.1 to this bubble.

328
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:18,059
So we inject that carbon disulfide 310 milligrams of it, which easily calculate our absolute concentration.

329
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:22,890
310 divided by ten meters is 31 milligrams per cubic meter.

330
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:30,930
If we want to get that in parts per million, we just take that 31 milligrams per cubic meter that we just calculated in our

331
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,860
absolute terms and punch it into the equation we just showed on the last slide.

332
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:42,540
So going from milligrams per cubic meter to parts per million, we have the molar volume on the numerator.

333
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,810
So we have between 4.4 or five over 76.1, our molecular weight and we get ten parts per million.

334
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,440
So again, this is a fairly small molecule.

335
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,880
See us to 76.1. But since it's.

336
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:03,059
The numerical value is about one third milligram per cubic meter, but it's smaller.

337
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,060
So I think we got our numerator and denominator output.

338
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:12,510
So what if that chamber was expanded to 12 cubic meters there?

339
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:21,319
We still only have 310 milligrams of the carbon disulfide, so that changes our absolute concentration to three.

340
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:26,570
Ten over 12 is equal to 26 milligrams per cubic meter.

341
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:32,780
So our absolute concentration has gone down because we've expanded the amount of air in the chamber.

342
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:41,090
However, we then calculate our people, we have our concentration and they'll get to meter 26.

343
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:49,970
We adjust that more volume because of the change in temperature and pressure using the ideal gas laws that we showed before.

344
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,820
So we get 29.35 over a molecular weight and we get ten.

345
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:04,250
So we have the same concentration in parts per million, but a different concentration here.

346
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,670
So why doesn't the parts per million change?

347
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:28,620
So the ratio remains the same, right.

348
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:38,170
Because the. Recognize disulfide is an area that is experiencing the same thing as the current events.

349
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:43,850
Yeah. So because we're talking about vapor and we talked about they're following the ideal gas loss,

350
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:49,449
it's following the same ideal gas laws that air is surrounding it. So those are both expanding.

351
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:53,290
So our relative concentration stays the same, but the mass hasn't changed.

352
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:59,800
So our absolute concentration. Did you get on that?

353
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:07,780
Good. Great. All right. All right.

354
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:18,940
So here is the next couple of slides. I'm not going to try to belabor too much, but some, if you can imagine, we're talking about altitude,

355
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:26,200
other conditions where, you know, it might make sense to do some of these conversions when you're going out and sampling.

356
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:33,160
So the conversion of absolute will to concentration of drugs.

357
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:39,080
Most common application is when we take a sample and we compare it to a two year old,

358
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:47,840
and the other one would be when you're collecting air samples, there's a certain volume of air we're pulling in.

359
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,930
Does that volume of air, how does that change?

360
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:55,700
If you're changing from a normal temperature and pressure to something else, how do you have to account for that?

361
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:03,410
So we'll cover that just briefly here. So this is.

362
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,890
And two words slide from Professor Sellers.

363
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,440
But if you just take your time and read through it, it's okay.

364
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:17,320
So assume you have used the sampling pump with the charcoal tube.

365
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:21,620
We'll talk about what these are when we get to the sampling lectures where you're

366
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:25,579
using that to collect an eight hour sample that we noted contains a chemical

367
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:31,580
called ISO amyl acetate and then or something like 88.1 pain stripping operation

368
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:38,360
conducted outdoors in July when the outdoor temperature was 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

369
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,900
Again, sneaky can always pay attention to units.

370
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:46,100
We calibrated the pump before and after sampling in your air conditioned lab,

371
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:53,300
which was at our normal temperature and pressure, and the flow rate was 0.25 liters per minute.

372
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:58,760
So we'll talk about this in future register. So we're calibrating the pump.

373
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,490
You do this before and after you samples.

374
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:08,299
You know exactly how much air is flowing through it, which gives you the most accurate denominator when you calculate your air concentration.

375
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:15,740
Understandable. But if you're doing that at a different temperature than you're actually collecting the sample, is that a problem?

376
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:25,370
We'll find out here. So the lab you sent sample to be measured, the mass of it, and it was 24 milligrams.

377
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:34,250
So with that 24 milligrams, the mass they measured, we can use that with the flow rate of the pump to calculate what the concentration is.

378
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:44,890
So the flow rate was. .25 is 8 hours to 8 hours is 480 minutes.

379
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:51,009
Sarah Okay. Because our unit's on our floor.

380
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:57,190
It was liters per minute. So we take point two, two, five times 480 and we get 120 liters.

381
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:11,650
So there you can divide by a thousand cubic meters and that would give us our concentration of 24 milligrams per .12 cubic meters.

382
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:16,030
You can multiply that out and you get 200 milligrams per cubic meter.

383
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:30,000
So with that, we can we can calculate what that is in parts per million because in this example the TLB is given in parts per million by age.

384
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:39,780
So we want to be able to compare directly. So we use that equation we talked about we have far more volume with an error divided by their wait times.

385
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:53,430
The 200 equals 55.5. So we conclude that 55 is less than 100 and we're okay if we're using that as a black and white, yes or no?

386
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:58,200
Are we good to go? How did you arrive at 200 again?

387
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:02,460
Oh, sorry. Yeah, there's a lot going on here.

388
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:07,110
This is one of the slides I really need to re-imagine. Okay. So we had our point.

389
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:11,970
25 liters per minute. 8 hours is 480 minutes.

390
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:18,150
So we multiply .25 by 480 to get 120 liters.

391
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:25,620
So we have 24 milligrams per 120 liters, which means that two cubic meter.

392
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:40,470
There's 1000 liters in a cubic meter. So that gives us 24 milligrams per .12 cubic meter divide or multiply to get that the zero here at one.

393
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,550
And that should give you 200 people have a calculator and you could.

394
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:53,140
Yeah. Okay. Everyone got that already?

395
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:58,649
So are we going to go in there?

396
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:02,520
Our temperature is different between the field in the lab.

397
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:14,180
Yeah, you're right. So this is just to give you a sense of what we're talking about, because we haven't covered this yet.

398
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:22,580
This is a pump personally or sampling pump where it pulls the air through this tube past a sampling apparatus.

399
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:26,810
And this is where you measure the mass of the the chemical of interest.

400
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:32,600
And we know that volume of air that is passed through with it as our denominator.

401
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,879
So you guys are right. But to play this out.

402
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,570
So we'll see. For instance, they concluded that they're below the tub,

403
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:49,320
but they they then kind of had a realization that they did not account for that temperature difference.

404
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:58,800
And they were like, oh, no. What do I do now? But the bottom line is, it didn't matter because the volume of air hasn't changed.

405
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:07,640
That difference in pressure and temperature hasn't changed that the actual volume that's being sampled, it's impacting the density.

406
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:11,310
Be there. So anyway, so as a long winded example to say,

407
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:19,380
while we're talking about the effect of temperature and pressure on air volume when it comes to the sample volume being collected,

408
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:33,740
it's not not an issue in that regard. Now let's consider from comparing measurements collected at nine A.P conditions to the tilt or p.

409
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:42,770
So again, this is sort of taking it further where, you know, if anybody is interested in this,

410
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:47,059
if you get a job in Denver or something and you want to know more about this,

411
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:52,820
or you're doing a project at high altitude or really high temperature, you know, there's there is science behind this.

412
00:46:52,820 --> 00:47:00,559
But I don't think we need to go into much more detail right now of this, because the bottom line is,

413
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:07,760
when they set these poles or trees, it's based on a assumed amount of air and the volume of air inhaled.

414
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:11,510
And again, that's not going to change based on based on those differences.

415
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:15,530
So it is comparing like things.

416
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:28,190
Okay. So I just want to make that clear. So bottom line is you don't have to change or adjust for that calibration when comparing

417
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:35,070
with the 12 year poll because they account for volume inhaled in the same place.

418
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:40,580
Okay. Here's another example. Let's use the same chemical.

419
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:52,580
I assume we've collected air readings on a sample in Salt Lake City, Utah, with ambient temperature of 33 pressure 6070 tau.

420
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:57,680
So our flow rate is 0.02 liters per minute.

421
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:05,070
We get a lab result of 3.5 milligrams. I'll give you guys a few minutes to break this up.

422
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:11,630
You can work alone or with people next to you to see if you can come up with some estimates on this without looking head in the notes.

423
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:20,030
All right. You're free to work together if you'd like, and then multiply.

424
00:48:23,100 --> 00:49:27,940
Some 9.6. Really want to.

425
00:49:34,160 --> 00:50:18,430
So I did. Important because are so glad.

426
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:41,100
Late afternoon slot. So you.

427
00:50:53,640 --> 00:51:00,290
This is a $70. So we had a.

428
00:51:18,430 --> 00:52:12,650
Let's go. One more. I have.

429
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:43,100
All right. I don't know where you guys are. You just want more time, or you're ready to regroup.

430
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,840
I would need more tired. Yeah.

431
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:54,650
More time. Yeah. I'll give you another. Another minute.

432
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:12,910
And we're using this. An immigration.

433
00:53:50,330 --> 00:54:15,780
It's a one. All right, regroup, just in case we you're going down the wrong path so we don't run out of time today, if that's okay with you guys.

434
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,890
You guys are okay with that. When people get their total sample volume.

435
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:24,190
9.6 liters. 9.6 liters.

436
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:34,220
Great. Okay. This one is.

437
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:39,530
So don't forget if we want a denominator in cubic meters, this is rounded off.

438
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:45,880
So .096. Cold snap, for example.

439
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:53,810
So yeah, that sounds right. But remember, if you need to get two cubic meters, it's divided by a thousand.

440
00:54:54,680 --> 00:55:04,190
So what you get for an air concentration one. Yet point 96 cubic meters.

441
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:12,950
Pope Francis. 4.5 kilograms. Yeah.

442
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:18,890
Yeah. Again, this one's rounded, so. Yeah.

443
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:22,460
Better to be more exact, this example or lazy.

444
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:24,490
Okay.

445
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:35,140
So then of course, like we've done in the previous unit, if we wanted to get a total inhaled dose, if we assuming 100% absorption, what would we need?

446
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:44,670
And we're going to assume because the paper we're going is going to assume 100, even though that might not be correct in this particular.

447
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:50,450
But what else what else do we need? Yeah.

448
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:55,120
Inflation rate. So this is a little different than an environmental setting, again,

449
00:55:55,180 --> 00:56:00,579
because we're at 8 hours and we're usually working with an adult, an adult population.

450
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:03,710
So that might play into what your assumptions are for that.

451
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:12,940
So in this case, we're assuming that ten cubic meters were enabled in an eight hour period and it gets rounded off.

452
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:16,950
So a lot of rounding going on in my example.

453
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:20,520
So 3500 milligrams approximately.

454
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:26,799
But anyway, that's not pertinent to what we're doing because our air concentration standards or guidelines in this case,

455
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,160
the topic that we're interested in is 100 ppm.

456
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:37,870
So we need to convert what we got here, 300 and whatever it was, milligrams per cubic meter to PPA.

457
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:46,500
So what are we going to do? We take our milligrams per cubic meter times.

458
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:56,100
What? The ratio of pressures, the ratio of your molecular weight over your molar volume of air.

459
00:56:56,110 --> 00:57:05,320
Right. So. Because we're at a different temperature and pressure.

460
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:18,490
We have to use that earlier equation that we showed. We have p one over two times t two over t one and we get 28.40 liters.

461
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:30,570
So he's up here and it's 350 times 28 over here equals 132 people.

462
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:39,290
So are we. How are we in relation to our TLB? You're home.

463
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:43,000
We're over. Oh, that's a problem.

464
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:48,880
However, so we did this correctly.

465
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:55,300
Our conversion is correct, but we didn't handle that difference in temperature and pressure correctly because of some of the stuff we talked about.

466
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:59,110
For your volume of air inhaled, it actually isn't changing.

467
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:08,050
So even though the extra effort was appreciated, we actually didn't have to account for that when comparing to the tube.

468
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,260
So to do that instead,

469
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:20,860
we would do this equation where we use normal temperature pressure that we have our 24.4 or five or 24.5 in the numerator instead,

470
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:25,360
and we come up with 97. And how is that compared to our.

471
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:28,059
So it's below.

472
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:37,540
So this is kind of a nuanced example that was designed particularly to have one scenario where you're above the target one below just to show that,

473
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:47,050
you know, could be an important thing, even though the overall error, the net error in that difference is only 14%.

474
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:51,040
But again, it's best to get it right to avoid these types of errors.

475
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:59,590
So, again, kind of a trick question, but the change in temperature and pressure when compared to the top of your peel, you don't have to account for.

476
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:07,080
But that is a question that does come up. All right.

477
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:12,470
Let's change gears here for a couple more examples. The next concept is, well, what's LA?

478
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:19,709
So this is saying that the partial pressure of the eighth component piece of IE of liquid mixture is

479
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:25,620
equal to his favorite pressure piece of B multiplied by the mole fraction in the liquid x supply.

480
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:35,010
So x y is that molar make up of chemical high of interest in that mixture?

481
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:43,080
You multiply that by the vapor pressure of that particular chemical to make sure that gives you the.

482
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:50,380
Partial pressure. And then once you have that partial pressure, you go back to that previous example of things that we talked about.

483
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:56,910
So again, exabytes, we could more fraction piece of the pie.

484
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:06,010
It's been pressure of chemical at a given temperature. We can use this ideal gas law to estimate maximum air concentration of a liquid mixture.

485
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:11,950
So in the previous example with cyclohexane, it was a single chemical in a closed room.

486
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:18,580
Here we're talking about a mixture. And again, we need to assume equilibrium.

487
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:22,550
That is the. Conditions.

488
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:29,490
All right. So we have a number of malls and total malls and.

489
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:35,230
So this is best done with a.

490
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:42,270
Example. All right, so consider a dip tank used to clean metal parts.

491
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:47,280
The tank contains 200 gallons of a solvent, having 1% by weight benzene.

492
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:56,730
And the other 90%. 99% is with what would be the highest concentration of benzene near the surface of the tank at normal temperature and pressure.

493
01:00:57,810 --> 01:01:05,430
We know that the vapor pressure at 25 C for benzene is 76 millimeters of mercury.

494
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,430
We first must determine our mole fraction.

495
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:17,460
Then we go back and apply Rawls Law, then apply Dalton's law to determine the mass concentration in parts per billion above the tank.

496
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:22,070
So this one, I think, tracks fairly well with one of the problems in the problem set.

497
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:27,870
So give things, something's not clear what stop and make sure we got it.

498
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:35,250
So the notation here so benzene is this over our total moles.

499
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:39,060
So again, we need to do moles, the mole fraction.

500
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:43,680
So the moles of benzene divided by the moles of benzene plus the moles of tall.

501
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:47,040
You need to do that.

502
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:58,619
We have percent mass of benzene over its molecular weight divide by 2% mass again for benzene and then plus the percent mass of Tali.

503
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:05,399
We divide by its molecular weight and that is 1% times 78 over 1%.

504
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,310
Divide by 70 plus 99 over 92.1.

505
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:18,140
And again, you know, this has to be masked because I think in the prompter it's given us a volume to potentially convert that.

506
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:28,399
So when you calculate this, you get the sales are 2.012 times our vapor pressure.

507
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,969
There are 76 equals 0.8.

508
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:36,740
Nine millimeters of mercury is it's partial pressure in that mixture.

509
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:47,060
And then we go back to Dalton's law. We have the partial pressure point eight, nine over seven, 60 times a million gives us 1200 p.

510
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:53,900
Of benzene is the highest possible concentration of benzene right above the tank.

511
01:02:54,470 --> 01:03:02,900
Based on the assumptions of saturation and using this idea of these gas loss, that makes sense.

512
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:09,400
Questions. Concerns. Okay.

513
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:14,500
And then because benzene is going to evaporate more rapidly than the time when,

514
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:20,380
you know, we don't get into this, but over time, that would go down eventually.

515
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:25,990
But again, this can be used as a screening technique or ideal age for benzene is, what, 2000?

516
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:31,980
So I think we're below that. But, you know, you still might still seems like a very high concentration of benzene that might be useful to then,

517
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:35,710
you know, determine how you want to sample or what you want to do next.

518
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:42,370
Okay. So that one tracks with one of the good examples in the.

519
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:50,890
Problems. If you have questions, just let me know later and you can work together on the problem.

520
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:54,640
So I said at this point. Okay, a couple more concepts here.

521
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:58,360
One is the beeper hazard ratio and the beeper hazard index.

522
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:02,470
This is kind of another technique we can use for prioritizing hazards.

523
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:08,290
So it combines measures of toxicity and volatility, right, index of the hazard.

524
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:14,800
So basically what it is is calculating your maximum concentration like we've been doing,

525
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:23,080
but then taking it in the context of what that is compared with TLB and then comparing it with other things, either in a mixture or in a workplace.

526
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:33,280
And then because this hazard ratio can span several orders of magnitude, another concept you could do is just take the log of that.

527
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:39,460
Kind of like we do a decibels of noise to come back to that scale.

528
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:49,000
And then, you know, after that log, if if everything's below zero, then, you know that nine those tallies are exceeded.

529
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:50,620
So here's an example.

530
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:59,980
And there's a actually the chapter that was one of the chapters that was assigned last class period at the end of that chapter is an example of this.

531
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:06,640
So this is not a mixture. These are three separate chemicals that we're concerned about in the workplace.

532
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:12,490
We have chemicals avient. See, here's their vapor pressures at normal temperature.

533
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:20,080
Using that, we calculate their C max like we did before based on those paper pressures.

534
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:24,280
And then we're comparing that to their hypothetical tabs for this example.

535
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:26,950
See how they're quite variable.

536
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:39,580
Another thing we could do is take into account the number of workers exposed and how often or how frequent they're exposed to to help also prioritize.

537
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:47,829
So taking this ratio and then the log of it should give you this vapor hazard index like we talked about.

538
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:53,850
So this one's. But we're also multiplying.

539
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:57,570
Sorry, the hazard index.

540
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,350
Yeah it's the the of 480,000 hopefully that has a certain text.

541
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:15,630
This one would be the bog of one 49,000 over five and then this one would be the log of 6.6.

542
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:20,760
No. 666.66.

543
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:30,330
6600 over 100. Take the log that would give you your VHI for compound C and then for a priority score.

544
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:35,850
What we do is we multiply that vhi times are the number of fraction of workers

545
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:39,060
exposed in fraction of the day exposed to come up with a priority score.

546
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:45,120
So with that we calculate a VHI a 4.2.

547
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:52,080
So, you know, if you just take the maximum potential concentration over the top, the compound is the most of concern.

548
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:59,490
But because hardly anybody is exposed very often when you put it into a priority score, it actually goes down to the lowest period.

549
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:08,640
Obviously, it's still something you really want to pay attention to, but if you're talking about it in terms of the full workforce,

550
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:14,610
you may want to actually go with C first because most people are going to be impacted.

551
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:22,870
So that's just another way to combine things in a way to to prioritize everyone fall in line.

552
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,130
It's good. All right. All right.

553
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:31,570
The next example is expanding this a bit to a mixture.

554
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:41,110
So kind of like that benzene. And tell you an example, this is an example where we have even more chemicals in a given mixture.

555
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:49,780
So we have tolerance. Eileen, ethyl acetate benzene seems to go to an CCL for carbon tetrachloride.

556
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:54,159
So there's a lot here,

557
01:07:54,160 --> 01:08:01,560
but it makes sense once you kind of piece apart and there is a question like this on a very similar question on the problem set.

558
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:05,830
So we'll talk through this rapidly, which will hopefully give you what you need to do.

559
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:14,560
Typically, though, a lot of same chemicals. So the first column, A, we have MSDS, remember what that means.

560
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:20,749
I mentioned it last time. Materials and. Material safety down these days.

561
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:24,650
They dropped a material off those I don't know why. So they're just called safety data sheets.

562
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:33,350
And remember that. So if this is, you know, a compound you've ordered from the company and it's a mixture of all these things,

563
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:36,890
it has to tell you on that safety data sheet what content is of each.

564
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:41,870
So that's where that comes from. Then we have our who will be the PDL or the TLT.

565
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:46,700
And this is an old example. So these might be out today. Don't pay attention too much to the accuracy of these numbers.

566
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,090
Just that that's part of what we're going to be looking at.

567
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,060
Column C is the molecular weight of each one of those.

568
01:08:53,870 --> 01:09:05,070
And then D is the vapor pressure again based on a certain temperature from maybe the CRC handbook for other things.

569
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:12,740
This was made before Wikipedia existed, so I'm guessing they didn't use that column even as our moles.

570
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:17,510
So that's the number of moles based on molecular weight over that.

571
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:27,790
Is there and the combining that the more fraction is the number of moles over the total

572
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:35,080
number of balls to your .434 over 1.02 in this case would give you that whole fraction.

573
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:39,250
And then column G is partial pressure.

574
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:48,520
So taking that more fraction times your vapor pressure, like we showed a couple of slides ago, will give you that partial pressure.

575
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:54,760
And that's where you can calculate your theoretical max concentration in parts per million.

576
01:09:56,050 --> 01:10:02,920
Divide it by your top E from column B, and that's your vapor hazard ratio.

577
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:10,479
And you can also calculate that as a percentage. So in the way we describe this one,

578
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:18,460
in the way it's presented in the problem set is you can use this again to to determine relative hazard between these.

579
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:22,420
So you have this mixture of a bunch of different solvents, of different concentrations.

580
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:26,230
This is making sense of which ones you think are most of concern.

581
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:34,150
So let's say we have this. We built out this table. We take one measurement and say benzene is the easiest one to measure.

582
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:39,010
We have a method ready to go. We go out and measure benzene a two times.

583
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:42,970
It's a real we measured benzene at 2 p.m.

584
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:49,840
What does that tell us about the other agents in that picture?

585
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:58,000
Which other ones do you worry about? If we measure. Benzene at two parts per million or twice its topping.

586
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:07,830
We want to look at. Bigger hazard ratio.

587
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:13,800
So we know that benzene has the capacity to be quite, quite high.

588
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:19,860
It's not in this case, but it's it's in a relative vapor hazard ratio of 44.

589
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:29,460
The only one that's near it. So anything above 22 we'd be concerned about, you know, would be.

590
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:39,680
Potentially got it. So yeah, but nothing's really even approaching 22 except for carbon tetrachloride.

591
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:46,190
So the answer to this question would be CCL four is the other one you want to be concerned with.

592
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:57,920
If benzene came back at you know, 20 times its p Tony tell me then it would trigger some of these other ones in that mixture.

593
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:00,709
So it's kind of confusing to think about in your head,

594
01:12:00,710 --> 01:12:09,950
but it's just a relative way to potentially take one bit of information and extrapolate to other things.

595
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:15,590
Is that? Is that registering?

596
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:21,560
Yeah. So just taken like the second highest relative each other.

597
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:29,960
Yeah. You're kind of looking at how if you had the sample in the cycle that we were able to measure, benzene came back twice at so wheel.

598
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:34,970
So it wasn't near the the maximum which could have been 2500,

599
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:42,859
but because it was over its LDL, um, anything that's above it is also going to be above it.

600
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:47,239
So you need to do it because it's only twice as much.

601
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:48,730
That's where you look at.

602
01:12:48,810 --> 01:13:00,530
It's anything on this percentage, you know, in relative terms that race to that level and they're all pretty low compared to other.

603
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:08,520
You know, other questions on that one. And you'll walk through it on the on the prompter.

604
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:12,210
Just let me know if there are questions that arise.

605
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:17,879
All right. So that's the summary. I won't read this off.

606
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:21,000
So we've reviewed the ideal gas laws.

607
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,530
I apologize. I stumbled through it. That's why I'm not a chemistry teacher.

608
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:33,450
But hopefully I got I was able to convey in some Matt Miller how it's useful to helping us estimate

609
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:40,260
maximum concentrations in some other types of scenarios that might utilize those to our advantage,

610
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:50,190
that conversion of parts per million two milligrams per cubic meter, again, very useful, very common thing that we do on a day to day basis.

611
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:56,280
And then some examples of the hazard ratio and things like that.

612
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:05,310
As some study questions, it gets more fun on your own. Yeah, we just have a couple of minutes to talk about the next assignment.

613
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:10,230
You have plenty of time to think about this. I just wanted to get it mentioned to you.

614
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:11,310
So it's on your radar.

615
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:22,160
So health hazard evaluations is something that Nash as we talked about, Nash was part of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.

616
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:31,830
It's more of the research arm. They go out and they do workplace assessments based on requests they get either from workers,

617
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:38,520
unions or employers that can trigger them to go out in the field and assess exposures of concern.

618
01:14:39,330 --> 01:14:45,120
So they've done thousands of these and they're all on the website.

619
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,030
All the final reports they have available.

620
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:59,129
So typically these are very well done because they have now staff are very well trained in exposure assessment and other other related fields.

621
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:01,500
So they usually have really good state of the art at the time.

622
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:06,090
Some of these are pretty old, which is fine if you choose that for years from your topic.

623
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:11,069
They go back to the 1970s, but at the time they're done.

624
01:15:11,070 --> 01:15:15,630
They're usually pretty much state of the art for methods and how things are done.

625
01:15:16,410 --> 01:15:22,770
So I'm going to have you do is pick one and kind of read it and critique it.

626
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:26,590
What did you think? What did they do? What were the concerns? Why were they concerned?

627
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:30,120
What did they measure? How did they measure it? How they look at the data.

628
01:15:30,210 --> 01:15:34,710
And this kind of tracks with some of the other stuff we'll cover in this unit in the next few weeks.

629
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:42,120
So the first step is just having you guys pick which report you want to critique so you can search by.

630
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:44,010
And it has to involve chemical agents.

631
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:56,130
Some of them are really physical agents who are very biological agents, but you can search by agent, industry, location, anything like that.

632
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:03,450
Just try to pick something of interest that's sort of robust enough to give you and what you need to answer.

633
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:08,220
It's a list of 20 questions. The first few are very simple, and they get a little bit more detailed as we go.

634
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:15,450
And you'll be you can read through these basically for some of these, I just want an expanded answer.

635
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:20,170
The length can vary and. It's.

636
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:27,390
So what I'm asking you to do is have some have responses to these to bring back

637
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:32,790
to class on November 10th and on that date will break up into smaller groups and

638
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:35,790
spend more time with you guys talking to each other about reporting out what you

639
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:41,070
chose and why and how that assessment went that will report out to the group.

640
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:49,050
And then I'll give you another week after that in case you got some good ideas from your peers to turn up just the final version of that critique.

641
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:56,910
Okay. So. Anybody have a favorite chemical and throughout their.

642
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:07,170
All this silica. Why not? So there were 281 of these that include silicone in some form or fashion.

643
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:14,450
We have a dental clinic, dental drilling pages, fire, debris cleanup.

644
01:17:14,470 --> 01:17:22,130
So, you know any of these? One of my favorites is a pesticide called chlorpyrifos.

645
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:29,390
I always say use this as an example when I'm searching for they got seven that might include that pesticide.

646
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:35,820
One of agricultural stuff. I'm originally from Iowa.

647
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,500
Do they have any from there? Yeah. Sara Lee Foods and Storm Lake.

648
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:44,930
Maybe I'm interested in that. You know, so that gives you I'm giving you a lot of freedom to kind of pick something,

649
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:49,220
but you want to make sure it's got a fairly robust, at least for one chemical hazard.

650
01:17:49,230 --> 01:17:52,490
Something might have multiple chemical answers to be measured. All right.

651
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:54,890
Any questions on that for now?

652
01:17:56,330 --> 01:18:05,180
Again, we have quite a bit of time or we can revisit this before it's let's do do we need to survey all of the reports that pop up?

653
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:08,899
No, you just you just picking one. You know, you're picking one report.

654
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:13,340
I'm just telling you how you go about selecting one, you know, based on your interests.

655
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:19,850
I mean, you can narrow down. But yeah, if you just randomly pick one and you think, Oh, that sounds good, that's fine.

656
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:23,659
But it's interesting to know why people select certain things like maybe it's

657
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:27,620
a chemical you've worked with before or an industry you're interested in.

658
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:33,620
But yeah, you don't have to spend as much or as little time looking for one as you want.

659
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:37,990
It's just. Let me go to the other questions.

660
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:44,020
All right. Thanks. That was. That's always the toughest.
