1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,110
So it's like you can see like there's a third person.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:17,840
There's actually been as you know, there was one child.

3
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:28,590
All right. That's a good time to read every member of the Bible.

4
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:39,240
So we're were able to keep looking at the importance of thank you for solving.

5
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:57,650
I might be I just want you just say like I love you so much.

6
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:08,610
So why instructions related to something like a medical student?

7
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:34,680
Let me tell you something else. I think that's why I think that, you know, I mean, I think I did really well.

8
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:58,780
I never thought, oh, my goodness.

9
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:09,630
Yes, I know it is.

10
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:49,860
So I'm not sure exactly. Exactly like what's really going on right now.

11
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:59,100
Okay. Let's go ahead and get surprise expressions.

12
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:13,440
But I know you have a title and it's great to see you worked there.

13
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:23,690
And I know you're in the weeds of your own role model and your project will be exciting to see what I others came up with looking at different topics.

14
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:32,240
So I decided you two will do about five presentations for each of these.

15
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,730
So details you have about 10 to 15 minutes per group.

16
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,900
Everyone should say something.

17
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:54,150
Yeah, I think it can be hard to talk in front of this volume of people and I totally understand that I'm a bit of an introvert,

18
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:01,920
so it's taken many years for me to convince them I'm comfortable in front of 60 plus people.

19
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,530
Even if you just said I have a sentence. Yep.

20
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,640
That's sort of that feeling for you being in front of a lot of people.

21
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:19,290
That's okay. I tried just trying to say something so everyone in the group participates and decide that among your peers you

22
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:27,120
can use PowerPoint or Prezzi and you're required to show up for all of the presentations as part of your grades.

23
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,890
That's, you know, for me, that's very much out of courtesy and professionalism.

24
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:43,469
Like everyone every group is going to present. And so you want to make sure that we're giving people spending time listening to you.

25
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:49,230
You do this thing. So we like everyone who you show up and we'll make this a little fun.

26
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,019
So we'll have you like rate each group and we can make it into a competition.

27
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,319
So Dominique and I come up with something for you to do.

28
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:09,850
So you're doing something very. We're going to win the presentations and you're making some sort of friendly judgments on the quality of the cable.

29
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:17,660
So we'll we'll put our heads together around that and come up with something to keep it interesting.

30
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,220
You don't have to do so in terms of why you should discuss these.

31
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,949
So these are the different elements I'd like for you to touch on in your presentation.

32
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:33,919
And there are all the different components that you've been turning in, or we'll be turning in throughout the semester.

33
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,459
So your background in target population, what are your outcomes?

34
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:43,700
Why did you choose them? Show us your conceptual model and then walk us through your intervention.

35
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,760
And we'd also love for you to touch on your experience.

36
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:55,790
I mean, that's pretty open in terms of what you choose to emphasize.

37
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,610
Play tough. Was it hard? Was the easy? Were certain parts easier or harder than others?

38
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:10,700
Did you have an epiphany like halfway through, just telling us about your experience and your.

39
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:22,709
So in terms of some advice, focus on the highlights and try to draw a logical thread thread.

40
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:31,500
So like giving you the components to highlight, try to, you know, make sure your presentation isn't just choppy.

41
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,000
Like, here's my background and then here's my target population and my outcomes.

42
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,579
But when you're actually presented, it feels disjointed.

43
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:47,310
So, you know, it's not necessarily in this order, cover all this and find a story to tell some sort of logical thread to it.

44
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,819
And obviously, this is a theory class.

45
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,690
I want to hear about theory. Everyone wants to hear about that.

46
00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:01,470
So be sure to highlight and emphasize how you use that to inform your conceptual model and especially your intervention.

47
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:08,549
There's no need to include a slide of your references. That's just it's not necessary.

48
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:16,270
When you do a presentation, you can leave your references for the write up to be determined to dominate an audience.

49
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:31,580
So I'm going to get into now some pet peeve of mine how not to design your slides so I can't see this tiny.

50
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,840
I mean, it's right in front of me and I can barely see it. I don't I don't like this.

51
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,140
I don't like, like, gray font right in front of me.

52
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:49,820
You can barely see it, so make sure your slides are visible to everyone.

53
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:54,260
So here's an example. This is like very bold and in your face.

54
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:07,370
So keep that in mind. When you design, drivers want to be able to see it, not leave any questions.

55
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,520
Okay. So I'll tell you where I posted this.

56
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:23,870
So under assignments, I know the class presentation instructions are here.

57
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:32,720
They're link there. And then I've also put in here at the bottom with all of your projects.

58
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,640
So if you need to reference that and remind yourself what do your group is presenting?

59
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:49,600
Find it in two places. Any questions, comments, concerns, suggestions?

60
00:08:52,820 --> 00:09:06,490
Yes. Our actual final project, though, is due on the 12th of December, right through to the final day.

61
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:18,070
Yes. And so would we be expected to like change what our final looks like based off of like feedback we go through in the presentation?

62
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,920
Or is it okay if they're actually expected to say.

63
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:29,920
It could be the same. And if you're like, I just want to be done with this by the time the presentation comes, that's okay.

64
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,670
And just turn it all in and we'll get it graded and submitted.

65
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:39,100
So that's that's totally fine. So you're not expected to necessarily change anything?

66
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:46,540
The presentation is really for all of us to just learn about what everyone did this semester and hopefully

67
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:53,200
learn something new because you guys focused on a lot of different topics and populations and issues.

68
00:09:53,710 --> 00:10:03,850
So yeah, these are these are deadlines there because at some point we do have to get grades and they require us to do so.

69
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:09,940
But if you want to be ahead of the game and stretch out your winter break, I totally encourage that.

70
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:18,610
And that's totally fine. And. Any other pet peeves you guys have with signs that you want to remind your peers?

71
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,250
Yeah. Don't put a ton of words on it. Okay, that's a great one.

72
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,059
Yeah. So use visuals.

73
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,060
Not. Not to be super wordy on your slides.

74
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,650
Don't be afraid to use visuals like pictures and stuff, because, I mean,

75
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:48,560
I know it's good to just like when you have somebody, like, give a perspective of what it is.

76
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,750
Yeah. So don't be afraid to use pictures. You can do a lot better.

77
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,060
Don't just read what's on the slide like we all can read.

78
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,290
You should actually have more content to say than what's just up there.

79
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:09,980
And that also involves practicing ahead of time. It's like very noticeable when people haven't done so.

80
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:16,700
So just things to think about. And when your font is like, gray, you really can't read it.

81
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:23,390
So keep that in mind. Or a light yellow or any kind of stone.

82
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:30,169
I would say don't use colors that people who are colorblind might struggle with.

83
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:34,400
A lot of people don't mean to do it, but they'll use colors that are actually look similar.

84
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:43,910
That's a good point. Yeah. Yeah. So you look into what may not be accessible to those who may be colorblind.

85
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:56,650
To use everybody's strengths and weaknesses and don't just define what their strength is when it comes to designing and lighting without hesitation.

86
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:02,989
No doubt. Somebody if they can. I love that you brought that up.

87
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:11,070
So, you know, my strong suggestion to you was to make sure everyone participates in your group.

88
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:19,069
And that can be done in a variety of ways. So really talk to your group members about capitalizing on your strengths that could come out

89
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:24,290
in so many different ways that how do you structure your presentation and use your time?

90
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,680
Okay. Good.

91
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:42,510
So if any questions come up as you're preparing, we're happy to assist and we're really pleased with how your projects are coming along here.

92
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:48,300
You're like almost over halfway there, which is really exciting.

93
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:53,729
So that's really wonderful to see.

94
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,060
We're excited to see your intervention feedback on that.

95
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:04,890
So again and iterate, we're here to support you and your feedback and looking forward to everything coming together.

96
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:11,160
So today we're going to do an activity around social marketing.

97
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:17,850
So I really want us to get very familiar with the four P's that we talked about on Monday,

98
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:28,890
and we're going to look at some actual source from marketing campaigns, some really notable ones, ones that are have been widely disseminated.

99
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:35,490
So I want you to get into groups of more than five people around you already,

100
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:40,049
if you want to if you're like over here and you want to go over here, that's always encouraged.

101
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,440
So groups of no more than five people.

102
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,390
I give you a website out here. Yes.

103
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,450
I mean, you guys are going to get and I also posted this,

104
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:58,020
if you just want to click on whatever group you're assigned to on the one that's posted, that's easier to go there.

105
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,759
So go to that website.

106
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:08,250
That's where the social marketing campaign is, and we'll give you a description of what it is and post a series of questions to you.

107
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,709
So around these campaigns, I'd love to do a little bit of education to the class,

108
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:19,590
so I'm going to have your groups put together like 3 to 4 slides based on the questions

109
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:24,749
and the worksheets and would love for groups to volunteer just to do a very,

110
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,190
very brief presentation. This is what this campaign was.

111
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:34,709
These were the four P's we identified you. So we're going to do that.

112
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:40,410
They're interesting campaigns, so go ahead and get into groups of no more than five people.

113
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:45,300
And then once you have five people, raise your hand and Dominique will hand out your campaign.

114
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:55,800
Me feel like kids interact with you guys.

115
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:02,220
How do you other that is going to come out?

116
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:12,250
This term really looking back a bit to wonder about this.

117
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:27,130
I know this is going to be very good before it looks like that's great.

118
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:36,909
That's why I wish I could do it right.

119
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,480
And you need a reminder that we're going to have a bizarre, I think,

120
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:52,540
definition where you really have to work with a roller coaster ride or other social change.

121
00:15:52,600 --> 00:16:08,140
If you don't look so hard on me and find happiness, just like the Lisbon Community Day, I was wrong.

122
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,340
I want to see zero. I don't know. I just.

123
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:26,740
Oh, oh, oh. I did a best of their making during a hat trick by today.

124
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,020
Right now we just have to see my hero.

125
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:42,160
He's been carrying on almost like was like.

126
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:51,430
Oh, I would, like, know.

127
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:58,000
I just. Yeah, I got engaged.

128
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:07,780
Like, you know, like I say, I've seen one blinded the other one.

129
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:15,280
They'll think just thinking, hey, man, you. How did it look like?

130
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,400
It's very smart. It's better than having to go out.

131
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:30,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

132
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:40,930
Are they hiding? Yeah. So it's like when we first came to the Jets hiding in the bathroom.

133
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:46,660
Oh, yeah.

134
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:54,880
I have breast cancer. I mean, why not some of my relatives?

135
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:01,930
You're too young. You went to the doctor and you think he's going to be done with this?

136
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,870
Oh, my God. Yeah.

137
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:18,230
Yeah, that's terrifying. It's not working. Oh, just know it's about time.

138
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:23,889
You're right on that. Are you guys from about three years?

139
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:28,810
Yeah, that's fine. That's about right. Yeah, there's also, like, 30.

140
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:38,890
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

141
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:55,910
That's that's why I'm on that. My parents you're talking about my boys and my parents are like family and I never heard.

142
00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:01,480
Oh, man. I think I just try to figure out what they what they're like.

143
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:09,640
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

144
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:15,850
Because, like, you feel like you're really feminine.

145
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,570
Like my parents, like, like it's your choice.

146
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:29,050
But being around this is a great, great insight into how much I love it.

147
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:45,430
Like, I was like I was like, I can see how serious I was like, you know, and I, quite frankly, I was like, oh, my, oh, my.

148
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,580
Like, Somebody's got to go home care.

149
00:19:49,180 --> 00:20:03,550
Oh, I'm sorry to hear the story. Like, so excited to see it posted in a stronger position.

150
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,360
So it so worried about that. I know.

151
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:20,290
I was like, I'm telling you, this is important because it might seem very telling, actually.

152
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:56,550
But no, this is just what talk about like so that it makes sense for the purpose of the episode analysis on plane.

153
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:14,299
It's all on the ratings consumer product just the cap just I think it only gets my dad is

154
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:27,610
like I don't like the shot it's a great idea that's like my grandfather out the idea of oh,

155
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:33,820
my grandfather's business. No, it's going to basically the product like what they're trying to sell is actually.

156
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:43,850
Yeah and like I don't like to go do I think my mother won't kill you anymore.

157
00:21:43,850 --> 00:22:04,339
She would kill you. You know, you're going to be one product is like trying to pay the price, but you could also donate I think infectious diseases.

158
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:11,149
I think they already have rhobh could be any of the ads.

159
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:23,690
And so there's an actual that's like, yeah, that's one of the things they haven't done a really bad job.

160
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:39,420
It's just crazy. And this could be a comedy show was like, What does it actually mean when you get a lot of stuff that has a medical care?

161
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:45,020
Like, I disagree that it was my dad's things.

162
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:49,680
Along with that question, I say, I don't care what people think.

163
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:57,680
It's like, no, I do want to be like so always like in a charity.

164
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:05,780
I think so this is that talks about like, you know, because Patty is like your right because you guys are young.

165
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:09,290
It's not it's not even like you don't see on it. Exactly.

166
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:17,329
Like I like to see my friends.

167
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:23,899
You need to know everything about it.

168
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,250
It's just I can't see that because, like, I like, like the place,

169
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:45,210
I guess online I'm about how to use because I mean my husband Simon is next to just like promotion for comments

170
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:58,210
about me were giving out my class and never really writers and they also have a patient with your body.

171
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:10,040
Okay so getting it to the limit we said I was trying to make lemonade separate materials for so yeah that's the big

172
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:28,650
issues there video but yeah all that stuff is like all the stuff at the bottom of the the videos or brochure videos.

173
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,490
Donations is like a choice but we do it is the first.

174
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:44,270
The brochure is just for patient checklists like sales, posters, facilities.

175
00:24:45,350 --> 00:25:02,500
I have some I think that's good because I mean, yeah, this is more championship going to get a lot of things.

176
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:16,250
I use on the side of the house.

177
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:21,500
Oh, yeah.

178
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:35,190
Which is on the website at least. Something like that.

179
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:44,010
Which might be. You know what I'm saying?

180
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,630
Yeah. I'm not kidding. Yeah.

181
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:57,820
So let me ask you to call them out on this one.

182
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:07,250
Opportunities of using your research evidence for checklists.

183
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,610
Check this out. Like one of the single most effective ways to get people.

184
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,330
I see that. And also this check legislation. Or maybe they can do it before.

185
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:31,380
But you what are they really going to read all you go pre-surgery sources if they split up so that the social media I was but I think a

186
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:50,370
lot of people might not have seen thing when you came up with this campaign experience and school like I mean the sport is not exciting.

187
00:26:51,840 --> 00:27:06,470
I wrote you know I was like, you know, I'm just, you know, narrow your life.

188
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:14,250
Number three, you were about how he likes reservations and missing the whole everything.

189
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,780
That is, for instance, I was like that or rightly so.

190
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:30,960
Right. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. I don't know how you can regularly see a doctor.

191
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,230
Oh, that's true.

192
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,860
I mean, yeah, yeah.

193
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:54,450
There's also the economic cost now is what is treatment.

194
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:09,760
To actually be thinking about too much is that they are going to have a hard to go.

195
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:24,600
First person is not a barrier. Opportunities like, oh, that's a shame to work together.

196
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:35,300
I think that's part of the reason.

197
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:43,710
I mean, I think if we can just like whoever, you know,

198
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:54,690
we talk about like especially how it's said that the reason I was kind of like a very clinical the key is that like.

199
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:02,550
Yeah, it's like white and blue is kind of the colors of the position of changing the place.

200
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:13,500
I don't know. I think it makes sense for the audience, but there is still like I feel like it's the same degree, doesn't have to be one where it is.

201
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:26,040
So we could, you know, it was just like every year.

202
00:29:30,840 --> 00:30:00,300
So it sounds like they've been able to put up a lot of other things, like wearing a shirt because you don't really want to do that.

203
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:05,230
I don't like that. Right.

204
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:16,650
Yeah. Well, so what does this mean? They're not as good as boxers?

205
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:41,040
Pretty much, I guess. I mean, honestly, I realized that at the beginning of, you know, I just, you know, these they were just.

206
00:30:49,940 --> 00:31:16,660
So I'll start responsibility right now because I don't know if you guys are present, if there's anything here.

207
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:43,310
It's just like everything you think you can do that you can get a scholarship to study international law.

208
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:55,220
So nice. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

209
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:20,890
I think. I think that's what I just like to say that like I was somewhat physically and mentally,

210
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:27,740
this is not the consumer trade that we have to facilitate demand,

211
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:53,820
changing norms, positive behavior driven, attractive all that that is or is driven by Saudi Arabia.

212
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:03,280
So, you know, that is, you know, once they tell you, I don't know why, but I have to be.

213
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,430
But I guess if you're targeting social norms.

214
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:25,340
Okay so I think that costs and out what's your you mentioned that every 24 hours creating something and we

215
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:35,590
talked about glass you know like you know we might be able to combine just like those like pictures and titles.

216
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:40,550
So I was just throwing them at their now and then.

217
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:55,399
Yeah, I just got rid of two bathrooms and I was like, they know like this awareness maybe is only about like three,

218
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:14,780
like four pictures and there wasn't any time for them to actually take them in their options like some of these and then to do things like that,

219
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:34,970
you know, that might sound like is that like they're placing their responsibility for like frustrating things that are very different.

220
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,620
What are you supposed to look at?

221
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:50,380
Risk. She was like, oh, I it was like still pretty complicated like that.

222
00:34:50,420 --> 00:35:01,310
And I think it's like you don't really. Right. Yeah. I was like, something's wrong with me, right?

223
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:10,080
Yeah. Look like they have a safe place, but I don't know.

224
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:22,170
Yeah, that's what I actually like, because it's costing you more.

225
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:32,600
So, you know, if she was really. Where are they finding those measures?

226
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:41,300
Exactly. So you can only get so many, but.

227
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:57,930
That's right. So I don't want to hear anything similar to how I do it all.

228
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:11,820
I don't want to challenge. I got sidetracked by some activity to play relationships and financial life experiences

229
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:21,060
that I like that are better side of McDonald's because most people don't get much.

230
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:28,830
And instead of having. I was going to say yes, absolutely.

231
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,690
Oh, come on, please.

232
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:44,100
Can you help me with psychological industries trying to get companies that it's all about

233
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:52,860
education and not about like actually things are easy to improve like those things,

234
00:36:53,060 --> 00:37:01,000
but that is likely to cost you a social media campus.

235
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:05,820
And I think it's a massive security clearance. I think it's more than that.

236
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,910
I'm starting to feel like I you out.

237
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:20,120
Excuse me, but I also thought I was lucky.

238
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:26,870
You were like that. Leave of absence and simultaneously.

239
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:50,940
I think it's because I think I will not support just changing the reading of what you have to be able to section.

240
00:37:52,320 --> 00:38:03,990
I did like so much be aware of your doctor buyer beware profiteering,

241
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:13,390
sexual behavior change or have like your doctor having the behavioral change

242
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:18,950
you to keep writing information because it's cool to see an opportunity like,

243
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,860
oh, that is so it's like, okay,

244
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:40,200
I have I have on something like some and so to like you're wearing red but are you are you surprised at how to be a part of it?

245
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,040
I'm serious. I missed some options all day.

246
00:38:48,420 --> 00:39:01,210
That's right. I was I was like, yeah, I think it's extremely successful.

247
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:10,440
Like, I don't think I get that. No, no, no, no, no.

248
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:19,650
I'm so sorry. Japan has a few specific around the south was not.

249
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,410
I don't know that I completely agree with her.

250
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:32,420
Yeah. Oh I'll go with you.

251
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:47,639
It's pretty, it's actually I mean, I mean, if I could just be like we wanted to just be, like, embraced.

252
00:39:47,640 --> 00:40:13,469
Why? I think I'm trying side for once like number one place and and I think we should talk about so we're doing is there are things that I think we

253
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:38,010
talk about it like everything I mean I think question one their gowns exude as long as they're closing the first and only going to title it was.

254
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:44,780
Yeah I think it's like. You have sexual abuse.

255
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:51,550
And I really appreciate all that.

256
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,790
Like, this does not matter.

257
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:02,110
I think that he needs to change.

258
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:12,800
Like I was about. I don't think she's trying to.

259
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,470
Excuse me. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

260
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,700
Yeah. You know, I can work for you. Okay.

261
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:35,919
Maybe that's exactly why so many other people see shapes opposed to opportunities duty to expand.

262
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:55,300
His staff have been watching that show very closely with the money going back to anything because you still think to yourself,

263
00:41:55,350 --> 00:42:02,820
I guess I know what I want to go there.

264
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:11,260
I think it's just such a great thing.

265
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:17,620
You just do it. Not everybody hates me tonight.

266
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:28,110
I'm making it better.

267
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:43,840
Yeah, I guess that's the first line is, you know, we're just here for the business of supporting that.

268
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:52,870
That's true. They're talking honestly.

269
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,899
They'll talk through the stress.

270
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:01,570
They're like, now the world has.

271
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:10,420
I mean, because I entire lives downtown Manhattan and down there at 15 years going out to eat,

272
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:29,410
honestly, I say I'm so hungry and I don't know what can I say?

273
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,330
He would appreciate that.

274
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:48,280
Yeah, he did. I was like, I just love that this man right here, I was always, you know, everybody thinks it's not it's it's better than okay.

275
00:43:48,790 --> 00:44:07,150
What about. Yeah, I just want him to that he has so much more political power.

276
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:13,540
Oh, God. Where. Yeah, because I had the job was to get jobs.

277
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:22,540
Right now it's it's short, but it's like it's important.

278
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:36,250
I think people don't talk about like it's like the people that are online.

279
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:51,580
So now in western Pennsylvania, they don't really have a team here that it's like, Oh, what's the look on your face?

280
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:59,170
Like, there's like a something, there's another one and it's got a [INAUDIBLE].

281
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,540
I never get a bucket of guys under the table.

282
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,740
Nothing is happening right now.

283
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:21,310
I have no plans to change because, you know, like your reasoning and wondering if there's a great.

284
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:27,280
Right. Yeah, it was like, oh yeah, she had a vision, but now I can't make it.

285
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:41,350
Yeah, but I mean, you're so busy, and I know this.

286
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:47,350
Take her the. I said, it's pretty.

287
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:50,660
I was like, Yeah, I know.

288
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:57,370
We can see. Three times.

289
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:16,390
It's really weird. It's like mid-Atlantic. And then they were like, Because it's such a California, where are you going to concentrate the class?

290
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:23,500
I was on Zoom, wanting to cry a little more.

291
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:46,450
Stick about five more minutes. Yeah, I just want to write it off at home or anything.

292
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:55,870
But it was really interesting to see how fast we put it on there.

293
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:07,590
I didn't know. I was like, Oh, yeah.

294
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:20,529
Oh, yeah. Oh, excuse me.

295
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:27,459
I'm just thinking caps.

296
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:34,390
Every morning I was like, This looks fun.

297
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:54,159
We feel like we have segments. So, I mean, if you mean like, so we can and it's like having like literally I don't have selected.

298
00:47:54,160 --> 00:48:05,100
Yeah. If I don't feel like they are like register like something like right now.

299
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:24,550
Happen I we have also seen a number which is on every single show considering all this stuff.

300
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:44,020
Yeah. Yeah. It's because like I like privacy and I was like, oh well that's not really clear.

301
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:53,890
Yeah, yeah. I put it where you are on here because I like answer.

302
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:58,200
I think I yeah, kind of.

303
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:05,649
I was just like all these I feel like.

304
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:19,420
But she's not trying to say that and apprehends like two females friends say, okay, I'm sorry, I don't want to,

305
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:29,980
you know, it's funny, but it sounds like she's not going to win a prize in the middle of my absence.

306
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:41,500
Like, I mean, I was like, not really near everywhere, that kind of, but I mean,

307
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:53,830
he's like, all these things that I wanna see at a bar to just, like, hanging out, like.

308
00:49:54,970 --> 00:50:03,730
Like, at least to meet somebody. So he's got a room and it's like, Oh, you're right, you're right, you're right.

309
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:09,790
I had no idea. Like, did they do you at reputation?

310
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:15,700
What am I doing for you? Do I have I take.

311
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:29,740
Yeah, I think I know it's not good for her, but I was like, I don't want to sort of see I feel like she saw.

312
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:39,189
So just like, well, that's that's the thing.

313
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:48,519
You should give me this and she must be part of it. And I was like, I'd love to for us to just get some highlights.

314
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:52,930
So we present just different like 2 to 3.

315
00:50:54,180 --> 00:51:00,780
Am of the different campaigns and some of the groups, but we are two groups of the same one.

316
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:09,940
So, you know, not every group needs to come. I would love to see a volunteer group to give us a little insight into the different

317
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:17,440
campaigns where you talked about and what you came up with so that troops can be seen.

318
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:28,510
And so we do it for volunteering at a goodwill.

319
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:36,550
For goodwill just to get it off the air.

320
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:45,700
If we go to each one to do one, this shows what it's like.

321
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:51,170
There needs to be a little social time.

322
00:51:51,950 --> 00:52:17,180
So I like to point out a marketer doesn't work because they don't have a choice to say yes our country is not willing to do.

323
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:34,200
This used to be a bit older than Sri Lanka, which is almost out of the ice this time.

324
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,190
I can do this.

325
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:52,140
Yeah. So I think the use of these are these images that we looked at was the Heart Truth campaign centered around.

326
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:57,330
Women's awareness for the risk of heart disease.

327
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,610
So our product is in terms of this marketing initiative,

328
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:11,510
was to increase awareness of women's risk for heart disease as well as ways that they can reduce their risk,

329
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:18,170
such as just general healthy lifestyle factors like smoking, reducing their stress slightly better, eating better.

330
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:25,640
We do believe that this initiative of product and consumer based products, because of the red dress logo that you just saw,

331
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,969
it's a very specific branding that they have there,

332
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:35,990
as well as consumer driven because they are trying to increase awareness and buy in to healthier behaviors.

333
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,959
And then the perceived costs and barriers is reforming the behavior.

334
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,950
Having behavior is accessibility and affordability of healthy foods.

335
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:51,750
Employment barriers like shift times. I'm not getting enough sleep, extra stress levels.

336
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:54,510
There's also environmental barriers to physical activity,

337
00:53:54,510 --> 00:54:00,600
like having a safe place to actually exercise and the overall motivation to indulge in healthier behaviors.

338
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:06,990
And where do these behaviors will take place is more centered around like it can be implemented in any aspect of your life and at home,

339
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:15,090
school, work, etc. And they also have community based, community based heart health education initiatives.

340
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:23,300
And then for promotion for the Red Shirt campaign is like the red dress campaign.

341
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:28,350
If you ever watch like America like Project Runway,

342
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:32,610
they had they actually have like a promotional event where the designers designed dresses

343
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:37,920
for the red dress campaign and it just continued on since like fairly like since like 2002.

344
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:42,269
That's one of their big promotional events now. So like Wear Red Day to bring awareness.

345
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:47,190
But people might not recognize that you're wearing red to bring awareness that you should be.

346
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:54,590
There are concerns for a woman. And then as for expansion opportunities,

347
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:58,729
we talked a little bit about how this campaign is really focused on education and

348
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:04,459
how education is limited in its ability to actually lead to behavioral change.

349
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:13,400
And so how they can try to, you know, make their marketing something that incorporates some of the behaviors that they're trying to encourage.

350
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:20,440
So something like instead of just having a Red Heart gala, having like a heart health walk, for example,

351
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:24,319
something that's kind of being able to encourage people in those healthy behaviors

352
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,680
while still leading to those promotional activities that they are hoping for.

353
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:31,250
And then we also talked a little bit about how they didn't say that they wanted

354
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:36,860
this to be really focused on for communities of color and women of color,

355
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,819
but they didn't have a lot of focus or place really centering that.

356
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:44,510
And so that's another area of opportunity for them to really make sure that they're

357
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:49,280
partnering with those local communities and women of color to reach those goals as well.

358
00:55:50,720 --> 00:56:00,500
That was it. Thank you. So how about the one and only campaign?

359
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:12,200
Yeah, I think you know how they should be connected to show it is like a USP.

360
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:19,240
I don't see how we're going to have the least tech savvy person.

361
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:25,000
Two groups go at it. I mean, do you guys want a tag team?

362
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:28,070
Do they also have. It's like, come on.

363
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:38,230
I don't know. This is after we can add on if you feel like your slides aren't serving you to talk about it too much.

364
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,260
Yeah. No, we're not going to talk about it.

365
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:49,760
So they are they want to make this show.

366
00:56:54,710 --> 00:57:01,000
My point is, I don't. Because I don't want to.

367
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:08,030
Yeah, because I want to know what this is.

368
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:16,680
What do you want me to go through here?

369
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:20,690
It's like it's just a time when you feel like they start serving.

370
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:27,290
You can just talk. Okay. We're going to start by asking what is actually going on there?

371
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:33,210
Sure. So we had the one and only campaign, so we can't get our slides up here.

372
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:41,030
They're beautiful, though. It talks about safe injection practices really specifically targeted at health care facilities.

373
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:50,570
All right. So this was a consumer driven campaign type because it was the main purpose was to inform audiences of a positive behavior change.

374
00:57:50,990 --> 00:58:00,080
In this instance, it's using new sterile needles for each injection and about how safe injection practices are good for both patients

375
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:07,850
and clinicians because there was two different audiences and also this was primarily in a health care setting.

376
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:12,500
So and many injections are occurring within health care facilities.

377
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:20,380
So that was why they were trying to apply to clinicians and providers. So for our product, we figured it was safe injection practices.

378
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:24,490
So that would be, like you said, new, like making sure you're using new and sterile needles.

379
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,040
And for the price, we figure it would be the needles themselves,

380
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:33,519
that people would be being frightened as well as the health outcomes of practicing safe injection.

381
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,030
So this could be I'm avoiding like infectious diseases, HIV.

382
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:46,180
C And then for place we figured it would be health care facility as well like providers offices in order to get the safe injection practice.

383
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:55,240
And then for promotion it had some promotion for providers and clinicians themselves as well as individually for the patients.

384
00:58:55,630 --> 00:59:02,230
So for providers we thought it was the checklist provided like checklists that of providers can have within their clinics.

385
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:11,019
And they also had pocket cards for the providers as well as of promotional videos and posters that providers can put up in their offices.

386
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:19,690
And then for patients, they provided pamphlets. Lastly, just some opportunities for expansion, improving the campaign.

387
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:24,900
We found it pretty boring. They used a lot of blue and white decision colors.

388
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:29,440
So we understand for the audience that they were targeting that it made sense.

389
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:34,150
However, some of the materials were pretty wordy and we just felt like they could be more concise,

390
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:40,300
maybe use more images, make things a little more exciting. Also, to expand to a larger audience,

391
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:47,470
this really was targeted mostly towards clinicians and injections happening within a health care setting where

392
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:52,780
there's definitely opportunity to expand this campaign to people who like perform injections on themselves,

393
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:58,210
like if they're injecting insulin or if they're like recreational injection drug users.

394
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:05,049
And then lastly, we thought there was opportunity to discuss the hidden costs of not using clean needles.

395
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:13,780
So essentially, like quantifying what the cost of medical care and treatment for infectious diseases like Hep C versus HIV would be,

396
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:17,140
and kind of using that to promote this healthy behavior.

397
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:23,860
Thank you. Does that group have anything to add? You also had.

398
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:37,350
I'm thinking, Mr. Glover. How about Leon's therapy? Thank you.

399
01:00:39,960 --> 01:01:08,370
Well, I hope you guys let us know. Well, I just got to get you back so you don't go back to his death with the opportunity to continue my actions.

400
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:16,470
And I was angry because I was wondering what was working.

401
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:20,969
Just getting it all.

402
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:25,510
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. So this is man therapy.

403
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:34,980
It is a website that is a resource for men's mental health needs driven initiative.

404
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:40,379
Because you heard of the consumer up of middle aged,

405
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:47,550
working age white man at the center of it and trying to build a demand for their product as opposed

406
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:51,930
to promoting the product and targeting social norms specifically around mental health stigma.

407
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:58,169
It's there's not really they're not really selling anything.

408
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:05,819
So it's mostly like a resource hub and consolidated resources. So a lot of the links, they're kind of like written in like funny or eye catching ways.

409
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:12,960
But most of the links like how to like NIH resources or nominee resources or like general national suicide hotline,

410
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:23,010
and they also compile sort of resources that connect to state specific resources and give some technical advice for mental health.

411
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:29,160
So because it's a web based online resource, it's free to browse.

412
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:33,059
And like to mention, there are lots of things on the website that are free,

413
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:38,280
like advice on how to journal their videos about deep breathing exercises and stuff like that.

414
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:46,409
And the point of it is to reduce the cost that comes along with expensive therapy.

415
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:57,059
If you take too long to put off taking care of your mental health and the emotional and social kinds of costs that come with that and the place,

416
01:02:57,060 --> 01:03:02,010
it's virtual, it's online. So there are helplines and online support systems.

417
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:07,770
It's based in Colorado and it has connections with multiple different agencies in the Colorado area.

418
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:12,600
And in terms of promotion, it's an app and an online site.

419
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:19,110
And we saw a lot of pictures of billboards or public marketing strategies such as this one right there.

420
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:24,240
And it really encourages men to reach out and connect with each other.

421
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:33,899
And as Julia mentioned, it really targets a specific audience of middle class white men, and it uses a lot of humor and catch phrases.

422
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,729
But we were just curious like this,

423
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:43,530
the light heartedness of this kind of program take away from the gravity of the issue that a lot of men are suffering from a higher rate of suicide.

424
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:48,260
And then lastly, some opportunities to expand.

425
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:50,759
So it is, like we mentioned, a very niche audience.

426
01:03:50,760 --> 01:04:02,340
So looking at other men who could be using this resource, expanding the cultural references, and then making it available to those without web access.

427
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:16,020
This. How about the Truth campaign?

428
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:33,800
On the other, the you know, there's also the word triple threat and you have to do that.

429
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:41,690
Mean I think you can actually mark the truth.

430
01:04:43,610 --> 01:05:07,290
What is the truth? I see that there is a difference.

431
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:11,690
I think if you do it directly, it is a different beast.

432
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:17,990
You know, it's a different fight, but it's not right.

433
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:21,350
You know, I just want you to watch an apple.

434
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,720
Apple wants, you know, only Apple products.

435
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:36,110
So we had the truth campaign, which was we said it was both consumer driven and market driven because it considers the behavior of consumers.

436
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:39,780
So that's people who are smoking and vaping and that sort of stuff.

437
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:48,380
And as well as a competitive economic environment. So essentially, this campaign is campaign.

438
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:56,450
The main goal is to partake in smoking cessation and prevention, as well as the use of nicotine and opioids.

439
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:05,869
The prices that they highlighted were like dependance like you probably see in their commercials,

440
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:12,470
but they talk about like mostly for teens, like how we should act on smoking.

441
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:17,810
They also talk about, like, health issues, diseases associated with smoking.

442
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:23,270
Like spending money on cigarets and food.

443
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:32,930
And they also talk about how the tobacco industry is kind of a villain because it disproportionately gets to people of color.

444
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:38,120
So it's causing inequities, you know?

445
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:52,199
Okay. Sorry. And then for the place, I've just targeted basically the adolescent in the United States specifically and their production methods,

446
01:06:52,200 --> 01:07:02,100
primarily with using social media and TV advertisements as well as a community engagement with the youth within and within communities.

447
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:09,150
Yeah, we saw some truth trucks which were like basically trucks advertising their program and then they

448
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:17,430
also had a presence at like youth populated events such as like sporting events and concerts,

449
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:26,580
stuff like that. So we focus the opportunities for growth and change in the place category.

450
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:34,800
We said that it could be expanded to a wider range of people depending on the age.

451
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:42,600
It's definitely youth focused and you can tell from their commercials and stuff, but we know that is a problem just for you.

452
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:52,080
So we could expand in that area and then to other countries and different cultures globally would be another way to expand.

453
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:03,840
Thank you. How about your lemons?

454
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:26,910
I really like that. And, you know, I like to see I like to say because well, look, I like it, but that's not a safe sport.

455
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:36,930
Oh, so it was like rugby, like, oh, it's a sport. Violence, like I used to have the games for the boyfriend's brother.

456
01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:43,470
Does it I suppose you could use. I like using the chance to play something.

457
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:53,090
You never know where it's going to take any opportunity to talk about it.

458
01:08:53,090 --> 01:09:04,290
And all I did, I ignored it. It's not acceptable, you know.

459
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:14,250
I do it like, you know, you go.

460
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:18,780
You should go to the seminar. Yeah, I was writing.

461
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:28,260
I saw a presentation was on you. And then the first question was, what is the drive?

462
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:37,950
So it was a consumer product marketplace. He said, I was computer consumer driven, so it was both consumer and market driven.

463
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:43,859
So the reason it's consumer driven we're part of this consumer driven is because the organization

464
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:48,480
behind the product is prioritizing the health needs of the consumer that it's trying to engage.

465
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:58,409
And it's doing it by trying to promote some type of health education that is going to help people detect breast cancer early on.

466
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:01,950
So it can reduce the prevalence of breast cancer, both men and women,

467
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:09,660
so it doesn't get to the later stages and also helping encourage people to go get screening and stuff like that so that it can get reduced.

468
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:16,500
They've been on the front page of the app and shows like Speed Limits and they show like Discharge and show

469
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:23,580
that to indication of like the various things to look out for that women might not know is a is a problem.

470
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:27,940
It's also market driven because they're trying to increase consumer education of

471
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:31,830
the consumer's knowledge about what to look for when it comes to breast cancer,

472
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:37,290
of breast cancer and what to look for and stuff like that.

473
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:41,439
But they also do that by selling like different like miscellaneous objects.

474
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:48,720
So like mugs and mugs are T-shirts, like clothing items, pins, breast cancer pins.

475
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:54,360
But the proceeds that come from people buying it goes to donations regarding breast cancer.

476
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:58,470
So it's like they still get that market like torrential with them there while

477
01:10:58,470 --> 01:11:04,200
also making the proceeds go to something that they're trying to educate more.

478
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:09,930
And then our four piece was product,

479
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:19,630
so it was the app posters and then the awareness package that they posted on said that they want people to like the buy the items,

480
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:27,900
the price, the app is free. But then again, obviously this is a website where they can buy different merchandise.

481
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:33,810
It ranges from $12 to $400. They can buy the bundles and like just individual items.

482
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:38,010
And the place is online only on the website and the promotion.

483
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:46,740
LEMON Facebook. So as it was showing that took that page I was talking about the beginning of let's Switzerland for for breast cancer.

484
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:53,179
So for operative opportunities for improvement, we said they could expand their target audience,

485
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:58,910
so they only focused on using an app which is online and not everyone has access to the Internet, so they're missing a lot of people.

486
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:05,690
So we asked for other suggestions on where they could reach out to fliers, those papers.

487
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:17,840
That's a good question. So it's price. We often refer to prices like like what is the cost of either taking the desired action or not taking it?

488
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:27,590
So when you think about that in the context of this issue, what do you think they were highlighting in terms of that for the price of the item?

489
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:35,390
So the price of not engaging in a particular behavior they they are trying to promote.

490
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:40,729
So I they're on the website. There's also a quiz like a breast cancer prevention quiz on there.

491
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:45,830
And then one of the questions was like, if you are like if you identify,

492
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:50,630
like go to the doctor and you have stage one breast cancer, what's the average or what's the chances of survival?

493
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:57,020
And it gives you like four options. And I honestly didn't know what it was and I think it was like 90%.

494
01:12:57,410 --> 01:13:04,310
So that kind of like helps you weigh the cost of like getting screened or like doing self screens as opposed to not doing it.

495
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,020
Because the question after is like,

496
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:14,030
what are the chances of survival if you're diagnosed with stage four or a later stage and that chance is like greatly decreased.

497
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:20,840
So that kind of helps way. Okay. So they're really trying to price maybe chances of survival, but.

498
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:24,170
Yeah, okay. Because if you wait longer. Okay. Yeah.

499
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:34,750
That's it. That's it. Okay.

500
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:38,950
Just two more bumpers.

501
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:54,860
No, no. You just from me.

502
01:13:57,340 --> 01:14:00,490
It's just, like, serendipitous timing. This can't be right.

503
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:07,300
What did it look like?

504
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:34,750
Wasn't. Yeah.

505
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:46,210
We had the Movember campaign, as was just discussed, the product specifically, and this was all about men's health improvement.

506
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:51,610
They focused on mental health and suicide prevention than testicular and prostate cancer.

507
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:56,350
And they specifically were talking about how you could make this improvement happen.

508
01:14:57,490 --> 01:15:02,740
They were asking for monetary assistance that would be funding.

509
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:13,480
Campaigns related to the campaign itself was not directly about how you can do it, but how you can work yourself through their actions.

510
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:21,270
The price of this campaign is increased. The awareness of men's wellness.

511
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:30,780
There's a lot of stigma around mental illness. And so by promoting mental health awareness and cancer, you can decrease all of that.

512
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:36,720
It's easy to make donations because it's online, easy to get involved and have your own events and fundraisers,

513
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:48,440
and you just bring them up for awareness as well. So the phrase everywhere is mustache as appropriate as a picture of my dad.

514
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:55,940
There's online donations, fundraising events, work place.

515
01:15:56,090 --> 01:16:04,310
And then there's a move for a Movember marathon. So six miles for 660 men who pass away every hour due to suicide.

516
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:15,100
So how do you promote it is mostly like word of mouth, I guess when you're growing out your mustache,

517
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:19,120
some people are apparently going to be asking you about it.

518
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:24,550
And then you kind of say, well, actually, you can like sponsor my mustache on this little app and donate.

519
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:31,390
So that's I think they didn't say a whole lot like on the website,

520
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:35,590
you're already on the website, they're early signs or they're promoting it in different places.

521
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:41,739
But they also have the marathon I just talked about and then they have a motorcycle ride

522
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:52,240
every year is centered around this campaign and then four ways they could improve it.

523
01:16:52,240 --> 01:17:00,639
The four PS I think we saw the product wasn't super clear because they focus on, you know, men's health and also prostate cancer.

524
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:04,120
And so we're like like where is the money going?

525
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:10,930
And I guess it it funds different initiatives and interventions, but they're all kind of like random.

526
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:15,400
So they don't really own their own initiatives, kind of like the breast cancer.

527
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:25,149
You know, organization. That's good. And then it's promoted mostly as just men.

528
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:36,100
So like, can we include like people who loves this men, women, trans men and women of different races and different ethnicities?

529
01:17:36,910 --> 01:17:42,250
And I mean, most of the time you'll see like it's a lot of white men on the website, I think.

530
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:49,689
And then it lacks mainstream media promotion, we think. So I think most people who heard of this have heard of it through word of mouth.

531
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:58,840
So I have never seen like a flier or anything on social media about Movember, so it could promote it.

532
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:06,639
One of the other things, we spent maybe half of that time trying to figure out what their goal is,

533
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,720
because you're talking about growing a mustache or like during a marathon, they're like, What is?

534
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:17,180
Organizations want something better, they get attached to whatever they want.

535
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,459
We pretty much couldn't figure out on the website.

536
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:29,060
It seems like you have to download their work to figure out if that was the product really, really was not clear.

537
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:36,650
The tie between mustaches and like, men's wellness just wasn't super intuitive to us.

538
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:46,380
I don't think so. Thank you. Sarah Parsons.

539
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:49,880
So do very quickly. 2 minutes.

540
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:57,910
Want to do tips for smokers for good?

541
01:19:00,990 --> 01:19:04,170
So we have my day off because of ADHD.

542
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:09,350
Definitely use that opportunity to engage with the conference.

543
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:14,060
Otherwise, we'll see what can.

544
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:29,320
I guess it's just, you know, how do you stay?

545
01:19:41,890 --> 01:20:37,600
I'd like to ask you to like you know, it's not that I don't want to see the National Guard whether I tell myself that, because I got to go.

546
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:49,770
Do you still talk to them?

547
01:20:51,610 --> 01:21:14,390
I never said I was like, oh, I was going to play once again.

548
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:18,430
This is different for you.

549
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:30,340
You know what else to do that?

550
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:37,850
I think that's very impressive.

551
01:21:37,870 --> 01:22:02,340
I want to know as I know how that works.

552
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:27,580
All right. Every time I look for the next day, you know, it's funny to me that I'm like,

553
01:22:30,690 --> 01:22:45,700
I'm glad you made me part of the job, so I can't let you go with that part.

554
01:22:46,090 --> 01:22:52,120
Oh, you said I was thinking about the person.

555
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:58,910
Are you going to stay for, like, the more I guess it's easier now because they said there.

556
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:10,760
I mean, I sometimes when I was a little bit higher, would they turn you into.

557
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:15,760
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm bored today.

558
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:26,400
I'm the my mind taking psychedelics. I don't even know if I have time to like this, so.

559
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:31,870
Yeah, but the climate here.

560
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:36,040
Oh, right, yeah. Right, right. So, you know, over that one time.

561
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:43,750
Oh, oh I'm asking how I feel. I would be there to greet them when I get in here.

562
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:49,830
That's it. If you do work, is it about.

563
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:57,130
All right. What's going on? What am I getting myself into?

564
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:04,360
What makes you think she has been?

565
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:13,690
Otherwise I would finish these two years and at some point come back for years.

566
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:19,180
At some point. Well, I don't work for a while now.

567
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:24,490
Well, if I do that now. You.

568
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:32,600
That was over six years. I don't know what's gonna happen now.

569
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:45,200
So you don't have to get up. I guess what I'm trying to say is I felt like.

570
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:56,750
I mean, after doing. His classmates.
