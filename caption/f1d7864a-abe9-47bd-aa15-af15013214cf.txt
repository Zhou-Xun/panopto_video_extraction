1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:11,070
My estimates in my case would.

2
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,280
When my kids were young last time I was in here.

3
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:42,330
The primary. Welcome to discussion number two about screening.

4
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:51,040
We're going to go over some of the questions that were on my first point survey

5
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:57,150
to kind of prepare you for the learning and cleared up a few things from you

6
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:04,059
that I know a lot of people have asked about the determining between positive

7
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,100
or negative and negative predictive value and specificity and sensitivity.

8
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,030
Here is your gold standard. Continue reading the standards.

9
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:26,770
Can see disease or no disease in the UK and the EU and the UK to the left of the UK.

10
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:34,700
By to your table would be your screening test, be positive or negative and compare that with the gold standard.

11
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,100
And you can see in quite a few has the true positives.

12
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:50,310
These people are positive on both the gold standard actually have the disease and they screen positive for having the disease.

13
00:01:51,950 --> 00:02:00,620
All of this is R and B, and they truly do not have the disease based on the gold standard.

14
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:13,840
But the screening tests said they were positive. For the people who truly have a disease by the gold standard and screening negative,

15
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:25,350
those are in box and there are false negatives because the screening tests are negative, but they really do have to be in the Indian box.

16
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:31,360
Then you've got the true negatives who truly do not have the disease based on the gold standard,

17
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,010
and the screening test correctly identified that they were negative.

18
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:46,080
For sensitivity. That is the ability of a test to correctly identify those who have the losing.

19
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:52,840
When you have those fortunate and truly busy person, you aren't as busy.

20
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,930
Another way to think about a good way to know what you're doing is to look at the

21
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:04,660
denominator for each calculation you do and look at which boxes you're using.

22
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:15,330
For sensitivity. You're taking the total alien vaccine, which is the gold standard of disease to people.

23
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:22,290
And you're seeing what proportion of those were identified correctly as true positive.

24
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:33,200
We take your true positives and take it on the divided by the total of 80 plus C, which would be true positives plus false negatives.

25
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:42,570
Those people all really do have the disease. What you're seeing, what proportion of those has been positive on your screen test?

26
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,440
For specificity. It is very similar. Except it is for the known disease of.

27
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:58,090
The ability of a test to correctly identify. Those who do not have the disease.

28
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:05,560
Another way of saying it, the proportion of truly not diseased persons identified as not disease.

29
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,390
As you can see in your table, the denominator of being positive.

30
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:18,980
All positive and true negatives. These are all of the people that do not have the disease by the gold standard.

31
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:29,660
And you're dividing the true negatives by that, to take the proportion when you're seeing how many or what proportion.

32
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:41,960
Your screen test has identified as negative out of the total people who do not have disease or positive or negative and negative predictive value.

33
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:49,350
Or positive predictive. As the test is positive, the probability is that the patient has the disease.

34
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,360
If the negative, the probability is that the patient does not have the disease.

35
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:02,090
Here. You can see that it is different in the denominator from sensitivity and specificity.

36
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:09,680
Your denominator is the total of the screens for positive or negative.

37
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,060
So for positive projected predictive value.

38
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:21,870
You have a denominator of true positives and boxes and false positives in box B.

39
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:30,800
You divide the true positives by the total who screened positive and you have the probability.

40
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:38,840
A proportion. Untrue positives out of all of those that tested positive on the screening.

41
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:47,720
Not of those who truly had the disease. This is divided by the total positive screenings.

42
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,050
For negative predictive value. It is the same deal with true negatives.

43
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:00,110
You take the screen negative people C plus D.

44
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,160
And you divide the true negatives box the.

45
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:12,410
So you see the proportion of true negatives out of all of those who tested negative on the screening.

46
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:22,270
Another way of saying this, in summary, is sensitivity is of all those words in the boxes,

47
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:32,250
a plus seems according to the gold standard if the proportion who are truly positive and were identified as positive by the screening test.

48
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:43,750
I was a. Specificity will show you of those who are disease free, according to the gold standard boxes being closed.

49
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:52,770
The specificity will be the proportion who are truly negative and identified as negative by the screening test.

50
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,740
The. Or positive predictive value.

51
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,490
Again, of those who tested positive according to the screening test,

52
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:10,920
adding boxes and possibly as your denominator, the proportion who were truly positive.

53
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:19,380
In my take. Well, the negative predictive value of those who tested negative according to the screening test.

54
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,140
As seen in boxes seem to be added together.

55
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:31,890
Your denominator is the proportion of those who are truly negative and the new.

56
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:40,340
Tomorrow we will go to the point three review, which is very much based on Cuban tables like we.

57
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:50,040
You can see four questions, 135 investigators wanting to evaluate the use of the surgery,

58
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:56,130
especially influenza like symptoms, as an effective screening tool for detecting influenza.

59
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:06,960
In January 2017, the researchers tested the use of the symptom survey among 500 students living in the University of Michigan residents.

60
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:14,100
Survey findings were compared with gold standard influenza determination by PCR.

61
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:22,770
So your PCR test will show your gold standard disease or not in the survey is your screening.

62
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:33,580
For this one. We have 390 students who reported no influenza symptoms on the survey.

63
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,110
So they screen negative and they tested negative.

64
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,550
So those are your true negatives. Which would be in box.

65
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:54,710
For question two, 93% of students with PCR identified influenza.

66
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:00,770
So these are your disease people by the gold standard.

67
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:10,870
Reported, including the symptoms on the survey. Remember how you calculate your denominator or sensitivity.

68
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:22,880
You've got your true positives and negatives as your denominator, and then you divide your positives by that.

69
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:30,170
And B, how you arrive at sensitivities. You have to look for what you're actually calculating.

70
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:38,860
You don't understand it through the words or you can understand it through using through lightning cable to kind of see what is going on.

71
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:54,860
Of the 397 students that reported no influenza symptoms on the survey in 1998, percent of them did not have PCR defined as one that.

72
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,990
This will be negative for the environment, for you guys being here.

73
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:13,150
20 students reported influenza symptoms. The survey, but did not have PCR defined influenza.

74
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,460
They screened positive for her true negative.

75
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:30,900
So is a false positive on the screen. Of the 500 students in the study, 18% had PCR defined influenza.

76
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:37,290
And this would be your prevalence. This is just how many in the population have this disease at this time.

77
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:54,560
Question six and seven allergic to the chemical company in which workers are exposed to a dangerous chemical.

78
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:00,200
Long term exposure among workers to this chemical can lead to vascular problems.

79
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:08,960
Alert exports to monitor levels of exposure to this chemical among its workers and reassign them to different jobs if levels are too high.

80
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:18,920
Until now, the only way to monitor the chemical is drawing blood samples and costly procedure and one which workers did not like to undergo monthly.

81
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,350
The company has just come out with a kit to measure breakdown.

82
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:30,860
Products of the toxin and immigrant being miscast would be less costly and more acceptable to the workers.

83
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,420
Alert X wants to evaluate the screening properties of the new urine test.

84
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:41,870
So the urine test will be your screening and the blood test would be your gold standard.

85
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:49,370
As stated under the assumption another 500 people insured total population.

86
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:57,860
True. True disease is defined by the blood test and positive screening and urine values above are constantly.

87
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,870
And for this, you can see the total U.S. volume is 100.

88
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:26,760
So if you. Those are true. If you are not 401 level of the toxin binder and you can read 93 and 350,

89
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,360
you have low levels of toxins out of your blood, which is your number of treatment.

90
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:45,040
You calculate sensitivity in your formula once you've got everything in the proper two by two format.

91
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,560
You can add a policy as your denominator and then divide by that.

92
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,920
You get your proportion and convert that to a percent and that is 50%.

93
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:05,510
The specificity is calculated in a very similar way, which is an interesting denominator.

94
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,110
And the numerator is. So you have 87.5.

95
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:21,920
Four Question Age. No word to mind your table. Environment concerns and public health practices.

96
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:30,140
Developing a highly sensitive screening test that comes at the expense of specificity for a given population will result in the following.

97
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:43,120
You will increase the number of false positives and increase the number of true positives to increase sensitivity and generally remove from expensive.

98
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:53,150
Being tested as reliable will also necessarily be precise.

99
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,000
You can be very rich. For those who missed retirement, a small area.

100
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,850
Any serious disease can be treated if it is comfortably.

101
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:21,620
It is important to have a test with high sensitivity. This is true because you don't want to have people.

102
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:28,380
We were falsely testing negative. Over.

103
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,270
Now under week four, you should find your engaged learning assignment through.

104
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:45,700
I'll give you about 30 minutes or so to work on this assignment and work in groups or individually,

105
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:55,110
and we will discuss it before the end of the period. We're going to enjoy your assignment.

106
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:19,661
Let's go through the exercises in your own words.

107
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:32,281
Already, $30,000 is confirming the validity of rural hygiene screenings included in the turnover or an irregular or irregular toothbrushing.

108
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:41,040
Your regular and irregular toothbrushing was used as the screening tool for the absence or presence of

109
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:48,091
double part regular toothbrushing defined as twice per day or more regular less than 2 hours per day.

110
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:52,711
The gold standard was presence or absence of dental plan.

111
00:15:53,731 --> 00:16:02,131
And the lightning cable was a little less than obvious where you should pull your numbers from.

112
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:07,011
I think for the first 14,

113
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:15,961
given that the screening questionnaire about the frequency of direct response would be used a positive screening for the presence of.

114
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:48,521
Never mind that I do not. Most of you probably saw your true value table in a way with your regular toothbrushing to identify your disease.

115
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:57,051
You and your friends, of course. Irregular, irregular brushing.

116
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:11,451
Players look something like this. For your first number pulled from the table, you can see.

117
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:17,531
Then there was the presence of gunmen by the 415 people.

118
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:24,311
So there will be a row on the west side of the disease here,

119
00:17:25,031 --> 00:17:32,351
which is defined as the presence of plaques rather than like the gold standard or your

120
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:39,431
next set of numbers has really gone in any order as long as you fold up the people.

121
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:53,281
You have your results. The total for the irregular brushing category was 247 people in your regular review and you reported by the screening.

122
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:58,021
You have 875 of those.

123
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:05,101
You have 292 that say that they were adhering to regular brushing.

124
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:17,721
And that has been all. You have 123 of those or your regular brochures, and I don't.

125
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:25,421
Which you can see is a much larger number on 247 1992, result of a five.

126
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:32,041
To get. The other two boxes.

127
00:18:33,621 --> 00:18:37,971
We would just subtract the total war from what you can see from the table.

128
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:42,591
So you take 123 from 247.

129
00:18:43,461 --> 00:18:50,271
You get those who were irregular Russians and also had an initial time, which was 144.

130
00:18:52,321 --> 00:19:03,741
For the regular Russians who had no dental implant 875 and subtract those who did on dental order and you will get 583.

131
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:15,601
I give you a total for that column of 77 and a total and altogether over 1122 people.

132
00:19:18,581 --> 00:19:27,160
If the prevalence of dental plaque doubled in the population with sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value.

133
00:19:27,161 --> 00:19:32,231
For the screening question, we expected to increase, decrease or stay the same.

134
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:37,331
And why would you think that? For sensitivity.

135
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:47,501
This is an inherent characteristic of the test. So even if your prevalence doubled, the test is still the same test.

136
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,131
So it's going to give the same type of result.

137
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:57,851
Specificity is also characteristic of the test and does not change.

138
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:06,621
But for the positive predictive value, you're identifying the true positives out of those.

139
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:12,521
So I would have predicted value will increase as the prevalence goes up.

140
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:21,511
And now you can see here that box, a little increase.

141
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:35,411
And he reportedly predicted. If the screening questionnaire were revised to define regular toothbrushing and brushing once a day per month.

142
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:41,801
What would be the impact on sensitivity? What will be the impact on the specificity?

143
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:54,101
And why do you think? The definition changed more people would be counted as being a regular brochure that people who.

144
00:20:56,101 --> 00:21:00,161
Cities all across the EU will be contributing.

145
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:24,071
She's going to learn. The sensitivity of the test will decrease because there are individuals with 500

146
00:21:24,081 --> 00:21:30,471
positive who were previously defined as having irregular burn through screening.

147
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:36,981
Those are all classified as having regular brushing. We find that screening negative.

148
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:41,581
This reduces the number of true positives. And this is a very.

149
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:49,451
In contrast, your specificity will increase with children without plaque.

150
00:21:49,811 --> 00:22:02,841
Those who are truly negative, who previously reported irregular brushing and screen positive previously are now defined as regular broken injury,

151
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:09,641
negative growth, increasing the number of true negatives, and then increasing the specificity.

152
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:17,991
So you will. It's increasing the number.

153
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:24,901
You're not going to increase specificity and reducing the number of true positives and the simple.

154
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:40,721
You lose the erosion when you do this, but you go back inside.

155
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:53,511
This one or number six? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

156
00:23:01,851 --> 00:23:05,091
Can you go over five again, please? Yeah.

157
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:19,811
Or just like. I need an actual presentation here.

158
00:23:21,061 --> 00:23:25,711
But what are the strengths and weaknesses of the screening tool for use in this population?

159
00:23:29,311 --> 00:23:32,461
The questions that are administered to the mothers include.

160
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:38,501
This is simple and inexpensive and it will be feasible in population.

161
00:23:39,611 --> 00:23:48,221
So if you proposed some sort of screening that they can perform in, it's just not going to work out.

162
00:23:49,271 --> 00:23:52,361
We want people to be able to perform the screening test.

163
00:23:53,921 --> 00:24:00,880
This also addresses an important public health problem of fairly high prevalence and has serious

164
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:10,951
consequences for the development of subsidies and pension subsidies or other complications.

165
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:22,741
If this is self-reported, it's got very poor, relatively low sensitivity and positive predictive.

166
00:24:54,361 --> 00:25:07,851
These are not in this presentation and deliver number three on the human security calculations, 123 to 413.

167
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:12,311
The sensitivity will be 29.6 persons.

168
00:25:15,211 --> 00:25:20,491
Specificity. 583 divided by 707.

169
00:25:21,751 --> 00:25:25,291
What we're going 2.5%, 130.

170
00:25:28,211 --> 00:25:42,370
We're number four. What's going to be one of the things when we interpret the sensitivity is that among the 415

171
00:25:42,371 --> 00:25:49,781
Brazillian children of this cohort study with plaques identified by the clinical exam in 2009.

172
00:25:51,731 --> 00:25:59,221
29.6% would be incorrectly identified as having dental implants by report of irregular rate.

173
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:11,070
Movie screening identifies who is correct will be 49.6% of the time for specificity.

174
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:19,921
Among the 707 Brazilian children of the cohort study were not plaques identified by the clinical examiners in volume mine.

175
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:25,921
83.5% will be incorrectly identified as having no flags.

176
00:26:26,741 --> 00:26:29,921
Part of the screening test. A report of regular Russian.

177
00:26:34,891 --> 00:26:46,141
Number four. Of the 247 Brazilian children in the cohort study with maternal reports of irregular brushing in 2009,

178
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:59,401
49.8% actually had the dental plaque on the clinical exam using the screening test as a predictor of what fruit?

179
00:27:01,581 --> 00:27:07,761
In other words, those with the regular brushing had a 49.8% chance of having dental practice.

180
00:27:09,721 --> 00:27:16,921
Or negative predictive value. That comes out to the 583 out of 875.

181
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:20,131
So that's 66.6%.

182
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:31,690
And of the 875 Brazilian children in the cohort study, the trial reports are regular toothbrushing and to remind you, these are all important.

183
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:36,751
You wonder who, what, when and why in your statements.

184
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:44,201
What you interpret something. 6.6% did not have them to apply on the platform.

185
00:27:45,611 --> 00:27:53,051
In other words, those with regular brushing and a 66.6% chance of not having dental.

186
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:20,140
For concern. If the screening questionnaire were revised to define regular toothbrushing as brushing once per day or more.

187
00:28:20,141 --> 00:28:23,981
What would be the environmental sensitivity and specificity of the water?

188
00:28:27,761 --> 00:28:37,801
Will people would be counted as a regular writer. And the sensitivity of that has to be increased because they're reducing the time.

189
00:28:37,811 --> 00:28:42,751
They're not classified as having regular volume reduces the number of true problems.

190
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:47,971
This is the theory, and this is one we didn't just go after.

191
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:51,751
It is worth noting that this is the reported.

192
00:28:53,211 --> 00:29:04,221
In contrast, the specificity will increase with children without the previously reported irregular amount defined as regular versions,

193
00:29:05,071 --> 00:29:10,111
thus increasing the number of true negatives and increasing specificity.

194
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:19,411
With church negatives go up, you increase the specificity to the positives go down, you decrease sensitivity.

195
00:29:24,631 --> 00:29:31,771
If everyone got through you know a few years of it your assignment.

196
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:40,080
Email them to you again are no canvas should be working this time and will not take you off work.

197
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:50,821
This is the same situation as before. Everything should be organized.
