1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,990
Right. All right. Well, with that, I would like to welcome Dr. Goodrich.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,030
Thank you so much for joining us. Oh. Oh, okay.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,810
Well, thanks for having me. It's nice to meet new students, usually up on the sixth floor with students.

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,850
And so I like to get down here and see what's going on and in your department as well.

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,250
So thanks to Dr. Haynes for having me.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,520
So this is I mean, you probably know what this is because you have to do an introductory class in this for most of your degrees.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,920
But tell me from your age, you know. So what we do is we try to find hazardous environmental factors.

8
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:47,070
In my case, usually chemicals or elemental exposures that can impact health so that we can prevent them or in some cases,

9
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,500
you know, reverse the toxic effects from them.

10
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:57,480
But our ultimate goal, of course, is prevention and just prevention of, you know, these hazardous factors that people do not need to be exposed to.

11
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,640
And what do I mean by environmental factors? And I'm usually in the space of chemical exposures, but there's also biological toxins.

12
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:13,620
There are psychosocial stressors can fall into this realm. Things in diet, you know, parts of diet can be good or bad, the built environment and more.

13
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:22,790
And of course, we're interested in seeing relevant to this class how, you know, you're learning a lot about obviously injury in this class.

14
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,520
So, you know,

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,710
we can think of these toxic exposures as causing injury to know more of the biological or cellular level in people and leading to disease.

16
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:42,540
And what's important to think about when we study and make prevention policies for these hazardous substances is that not everybody has the same risk.

17
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:48,360
So, of course, you know, I could be exposed to the same level of lead as a small child.

18
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,400
And maybe it's not toxic to me or very toxic, but it would be much more toxic to them.

19
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:00,840
So things like age and, you know, a developmental stage can make you much more susceptible to these exposures.

20
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,720
There are certain exposures that are more harmful for, you know, people who are elderly, people who are pregnant.

21
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:15,000
There can be difference in susceptibility sometimes by sex and also by interactions with just other stressors and exposures that you have.

22
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:22,650
You know, if some people are already exposed to a lot of toxic things, then adding something like lead on top of that can make it even worse.

23
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:33,989
And one of our our prime tenants of toxicology is came from many, many centuries ago where this this guy, Paracelsus, said the dose makes the poison.

24
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:43,319
And that's that's still true. But what we find for many, many substances that we study is that, you know, oftentimes regulations make a cut point.

25
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,190
Okay, below this level is is okay above this level is bad.

26
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:54,270
But for a lot of things including like lead that we'll talk about today there's even subtle toxic effects at very, very low levels.

27
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:01,650
So even though reducing exposure more and more and more is always helpful, you know, we need to be mindful that for some things,

28
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:10,889
you know, getting getting down to zero would actually be be what we need as far as it goes with exposure sources.

29
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,040
And exposure levels are really important to think about.

30
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,140
And people can be susceptible not only because of their biology, their age and things like that,

31
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:28,290
but also just because of they're more susceptible to have a higher level of exposure instead of just, you know, biological differences.

32
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,209
So I think last week you had a talk from Male Friends blog about occupation.

33
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,000
So there's certain, although he was maybe talking about actual injuries,

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,510
but there are certain occupational groups that have much higher levels of exposure to toxic things all the time.

35
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:50,490
They're in, you know, in populations that have, you know, different kind of gender roles traditionally.

36
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,530
Sometimes like maybe women or men are exposed to certain things more than others based on what they do like with the family in the household,

37
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:06,780
again, things like age, children use different things, play with different things, come in contact with different things than adults do.

38
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,570
And, you know, in different regions of the world and even within the US, there are,

39
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:17,820
you know, differences in levels of pollution and contaminants that are all, all around us.

40
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,080
And of course, that brings us to environmental injustice and environmental racism,

41
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,420
where the places where the most toxic burden of chemicals, you know,

42
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:35,160
toxic waste pollution and things like that are often among populations that are historically marginalized and,

43
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,210
you know, underrepresented in among policymakers and stuff like that.

44
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,630
So our outline for today,

45
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:51,329
I'm going to focus mostly on early life susceptibility to environmental exposures with lead as the big example and four lead.

46
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:59,790
We'll talk about where it comes from in the past and where it still comes from now that people are getting exposed to why and how it's toxic or just.

47
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:06,990
I'll just get a little bit into that. Then I'll give some examples of environmental injustice that I'll have to do with lead,

48
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,660
and then talk a little bit about some intervention prevention efforts that can be done to reverse,

49
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,280
you know, some of the bad things that are happening with lead around the US or the world.

50
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:25,140
So this brings me to the DOE head paradigm, which stands for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease.

51
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:32,250
So this is something that's been around for, you know, some decades, but it was originally mostly focused on nutrition.

52
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,250
And now we use it to look at the impact of of other more broad environmental factors, too.

53
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,989
And basically, the theory, which is essentially been proven by now,

54
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:50,430
is that environmental factors or exposures during pregnancy, sometimes during very early postnatal life,

55
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,740
can alter your development in such a way that it impacts not only young kids,

56
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,450
but actually they're at risk for disease later in life, you know, decades and decades later.

57
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:08,429
And this is a really simple schematic, but some of the earliest evidence for this show, it was all about nutrition.

58
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:14,280
And it showed that if pregnant people were very malnourished,

59
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,129
then the the offspring of the babies that were born kind of developed this thrifty phenotype.

60
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,150
Their metabolism was different. Other things about their biology was different.

61
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:31,260
And so they were very small at birth, in infancy. So in some ways, they're kind of ready for a world with lower resources.

62
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,570
But then if those babies instead had had, you know, had enough nutrition,

63
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:42,059
had enough resources growing up, then they had this rapid catch up growth in childhood.

64
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:50,700
And ultimately as adults, you know, we're more likely to have heart attacks, other cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity and more.

65
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:56,690
And there's a lot of cool research that's went into showing biologically how this happened.

66
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:03,990
Part of it is epigenetic programing, which I study. But there's other things too that essentially, you know, programing these kids to have a,

67
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,550
you know, low metabolism and this biology that was ready for a low resource environment.

68
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,370
But when it wasn't, was it matched with what they actually grew up with?

69
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,040
And they had more of these, you know, these risks for these other diseases later on.

70
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,739
So that's this was the the prime example.

71
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:26,760
I only bring this up here because this is how we kind of discovered this theory in what's going on with developmental origins of disease.

72
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:34,290
But in my world, I apply it usually to look at, you know, how do toxic chemicals fit into play?

73
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:39,689
And there's so many toxic chemicals and exposures and they all they all do different things.

74
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:47,280
But if you put it broadly, you can think about having an exposure to toxicant during pregnancy or early infancy.

75
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,500
It changes something in your cellular phenotype, your metabolism, your epigenetics.

76
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:59,550
Then you might see some differences in infancy, which are usually some kind of developmental delay or maybe altered growth pattern.

77
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:10,290
And then that tracks with, you know, differences in childhood in the same outcome and then sometimes the risk for disease later in life.

78
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:16,469
And so some prenatal exposures have been associated with, you know, cancer risk way later in life,

79
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:21,540
some of them with, you know, cardiovascular diseases and things like that and also neurological disorders.

80
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,740
So basically, we see this across the spectrum with many different things.

81
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:34,290
And when we think about those biological mechanisms, this I'm actually realize I'm not going to talk that much about epigenetics today,

82
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:38,909
but you're going to ask questions if you're familiar, because I know people think that's really cool.

83
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:42,090
And I, I do a lot of work with this in most of my studies.

84
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:50,159
It's a, a regulatory mechanism. It's not your genetics, but it's what regulates if your genes are turned on and off, but it's actually quite stable.

85
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,500
So it's really vulnerable to environmental insult early in life.

86
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:02,639
This pattern when, you know, a person is very, very small, even before birth will be established,

87
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,350
that can kind of get passed on to all of your tissues and stay with you as you grow.

88
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:13,829
And so any exposures that modify this early in life can affect how your genes are expressed and regulated and,

89
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,580
you know, essentially how how your physiology is later in life.

90
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,319
So that's one big mechanism we look at of how this long term development program happens.

91
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,299
But there's there's other biological changes that occur, too, having to do with early in life,

92
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,780
you know, just how your organs are forming, including your brain and things like that.

93
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:37,170
And if that's disrupted, then that's going to track with, you know, how that organ functions potentially for the rest of your life, too.

94
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:46,470
So I just kind of filled in the boxes here with the topic for today, so you can see how it all fits in to this paradigm.

95
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:53,160
So, you know, when we're talking about lean, we can think about lead exposure is an early development,

96
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,580
lead to a lot of differences and in how your brain is developing, which I'll get into in a little.

97
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,850
And also in the world that I work in changes in the epigenome.

98
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:12,040
This tracks to delays in infant development, especially measures that you can make in infants about their neurological function.

99
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:21,480
And then it tracks to, you know, decreased IQ in children and other measures of children's, you know, behavioral and cognitive functions.

100
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:30,610
And also it can track to what happens in adults. So, you know, there's some evidence that early life led exposure is linked to even Alzheimer's,

101
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:36,680
which is now way at the end of life, but also, of course, things like if, you know,

102
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,379
it leads to decreased IQ or increased ADHD and things like that,

103
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:47,380
you can you can think about how that would affect, you know, basically the whole livelihood and adulthood.

104
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,860
You know, that doesn't really necessarily go away.

105
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:56,410
So that leads to sometimes less job opportunities, less economic opportunities and other other hardships.

106
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,950
So I just want to mention a couple of other big neurotoxic hands there.

107
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,799
So many chemicals out there. But, you know, some of them were exposed to more often than others, some of them we know more about than others.

108
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,690
And these are as a 12.

109
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:21,490
So these are you can think of some of the big 12 that we have good evidence that their exposures early in life affect neurodevelopment and then,

110
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:29,139
you know, that can lead to other effects later. And so, you know, things like a couple of them are other metals, arsenic, lead,

111
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:34,810
mercury and manganese, which, you know, some other sources of exposure are very industrial.

112
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,839
For the most part, they're industrial. Some of the sources of exposure, actually,

113
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,450
natural arsenic can be naturally occurring in many parts of the world and gets into drinking water that way.

114
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,510
Fluoride like always fluoride on there.

115
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:52,210
You know, I think a fluoride, of course, is, is something that benefits public health and dental health especially.

116
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,900
But this is more on the side of you. You can have too much.

117
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:03,010
So I think there's been studies of I've worked with some people in Mexico where instead of fluorinated the water,

118
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,030
they fluorinated salt, much like we put iodine and salt in the US.

119
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:13,330
And that seems to give people a, a higher exposure than, than what we give in water.

120
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,089
And so it does benefit dental health and things like that.

121
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:23,889
But if people consume a lot of this fluorinated salt, it can lead to actually some toxicity to his way.

122
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:30,430
When my when my dentist is always telling me to have my two year old brush his teeth, fluoride toothpaste, I'm like, no, not yet.

123
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,060
Still as well is it. I don't want him having a yeah.

124
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:37,720
So how much is too much? Yeah, that's a good question.

125
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:48,879
I would say for people in the US who are just drinking the standard water that's fluorinated that that seems to be fine I think.

126
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,660
And even just using toothpaste, you don't usually swallow it. So that's unless you're a little kid.

127
00:12:52,930 --> 00:13:00,190
So that's also fine, I think. I can't give you the exact little offhand, but I would say where it's been a problem is where are these?

128
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,099
Where there are these additional sources like fluoride and salt,

129
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:11,320
or there's actually some countries where there's naturally fluoride in the water table and there's a lot more fluoride in the drinking water.

130
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,309
So, you know, maybe I can send you something on that after class.

131
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:22,330
But I would say what we what we generally have in the US right now is, okay, this is more of a problem in other countries right now.

132
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,460
But good question. And also, any kid who will swallow their toothpaste.

133
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,660
I think should not use for a toothpaste because it's a much higher concentration, too.

134
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,540
But and then some of these things are pesticides.

135
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:45,500
And these this one name, PBDEs, those are flame retardants that at one point in time, everyone's like, oh, my gosh, we need to prevent forest.

136
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:53,350
And that forest fires house fires. And so there was this law was that went into place that required these chemicals

137
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,770
to be put in couches and even children's pajamas and everything you can think of.

138
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,490
And they're actually toxic to neurodevelopment.

139
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:08,349
That kind of how you get exposed to them as they can leach out, you know, basically as your furniture, whatever it is, breaks down over time.

140
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,540
They kind of end up in the dust in your house.

141
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,760
And so it's not really a big deal for adults, but kids will touch that and, you know, eat it essentially.

142
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,830
So these are you know, these things are all things that are being regulated.

143
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,540
But at the same time,

144
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:30,090
their sources of these exposures are still out there and often they're disproportionately impacting certain populations over others.

145
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,760
So this is, you know, big things we need to think about when we're worried about,

146
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:39,340
you know, toxic injury and protecting developing children, especially in this case.

147
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:51,780
So this is a bit of a busy slide. But what this shows, I think it's from that same paper are different risks from a set of exposure.

148
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,409
Some are the last page, some are different.

149
00:14:53,410 --> 00:15:03,460
Ones that are found in different products and medications that have been linked to black is autism, red is schizophrenia, blue is ADHD.

150
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,939
And what this shows here at the bottom is actually a timeline of development.

151
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,650
So this is conception, this is birth, and then this is the first three years of life.

152
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,970
And through different research, we found, for instance, that the time, the exact timing of exposure can matter too.

153
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:26,469
So let's see one that's very specific. So for thalidomide, which used to be prescribed actually.

154
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:33,220
Oh, yeah, go ahead. Yeah, I wanted to ask about that because to my understanding, that's not it hasn't been on the market for years now.

155
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,540
Yeah. So I think it's here's just kind of a good example of how, how this works.

156
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:43,350
But yes, one of my, it used to be prescribed to a lot of people, including pregnant people, but it's, you know, banned in the US.

157
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,690
There's still a few countries where people use it.

158
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:55,940
So but here, you know, we don't really have it anymore. But it was one particular example where if it was given at the very, very beginning, you know,

159
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:03,100
very close to conception and early, you know, growth information that's been linked to autism.

160
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,500
But some of these other drugs and down here, environmental chemicals, you know,

161
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,860
there's evidence that exposure during any point in pregnancy and sometimes

162
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:18,129
tracking into childhood can be linked to some of these neurological disorders.

163
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:27,970
So in the case of lead, which is our topic for today, you know, basically during any point of early development has been linked to ADHD.

164
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:35,620
LED exposure during early pregnancy is linked to schizophrenia and then late pregnancy, it's linked to autism.

165
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:41,200
So this might have to do with how how different parts of the brain are forming and when

166
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,610
that it can lead to some of these or at least contribute to some of these diseases.

167
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,650
And if this is known, you know, for sure. But there's a strong evidence for this.

168
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,550
So let's talk a little bit more about one thing I'm sure you've heard about it,

169
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:03,130
but the main place where it comes from typically is old paint and old pipes.

170
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,560
And even though we've known that is toxic for a long time, and I'll show you how exposure has decreased in the general population over time.

171
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,130
There's still lead poisoning all around the world, even today.

172
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,680
And it's toxic to many things, not just the neuro system.

173
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:27,830
So that's what we'll mostly focus on today. And during some of these, interestingly, it can stay in your body for a long time in bone.

174
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:35,200
So it kind of looks like calcium to your body and it can replace calcium or calcium would normally go.

175
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:39,460
So if you are exposed to lead but you don't have enough calcium at the same time,

176
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,780
it can get into your bone and stay there for a really long time and it can be

177
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:49,780
released back into your bloodstream during periods when bone is kind of reserved.

178
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:57,190
So during pregnancy, lactation and also aging, when osteoporosis happens, your blood can kind of get back out to your other organs.

179
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:07,810
And this shows what our main sources of blood were in history, especially in the US, where this is really applicable to many parts of the world.

180
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,240
So let's see, that starts in 1910 and you know what came around.

181
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,340
They decided that to paint and thought that was really great, then realized that was really bad.

182
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,239
So, you know, around the 1950s there was a lot of you couldn't have an impact anymore.

183
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,540
So the usage of lead that's in tons, that's what's on the Y axis there, you know, went down from that.

184
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:34,720
But you know, a couple decades before that, they said, hey, we can add it to gasoline as an anti knock agent.

185
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,730
And I still don't even really know what that means to this day, even though I study led.

186
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,560
But it was supposed to help with something that gasoline did,

187
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:49,450
and that became really popular until the 1970s when they said, okay, this is really toxic, we need to get it out of gas.

188
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:54,520
Then you can see the major uses in the US going down after that.

189
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,219
And these are just some, you know,

190
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:04,380
some major rules that came into place for those of you that like policy that were time points in history when big changes happened,

191
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:11,319
especially in the U.S. of 72, we said you can't have it in gas anymore and made a phase out period.

192
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:18,219
So within I guess, you know, within a couple of years, most of the gasoline had to be phased out.

193
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:23,230
And by 95, there was no a lot of gasoline for cars in the US.

194
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,309
There's still a lot of gasoline for certain types of airplanes actually.

195
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,820
But you know, most people don't really get exposed to that.

196
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:37,510
It's still not great. But in 1992, you know, there was a worldwide effort to call for a phase out of this in 1998,

197
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,230
where I have done a lot of research in Mexico, there is a phase out.

198
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,830
So they still had higher exposures for a while after the U.S. did.

199
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:49,870
And then as of I tried to look as of now because about ten years ago,

200
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:55,380
there are still six countries in the whole world that use leaded gasoline, you know, kind of whenever they wanted.

201
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,680
But now it is believed that all of them have, face it out.

202
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,999
For some of those countries, it's places like North Korea. We don't know what's going on there.

203
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,260
But but supposedly everyone has face outlet of gasoline now.

204
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:18,760
And and so this is very much a public success. This is let's see, I think the the black line or blood lead levels in people,

205
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,790
the red line is use of lead and gasoline over a period of time in the U.S. And you can see, you know, as soon as that went down.

206
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:29,500
So a lot of people are embracing this. But it did, you know, the reason why they.

207
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:40,490
To spread. Yes, it was being used as an anti knock agent and that has something to do it.

208
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:46,969
It doesn't really improve combustion because I think at one point in time they thought it was more of

209
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:54,650
an efficient one led was was in there but um but I honestly have to look up what that really means.

210
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,989
So I was like, is it anti knock agents? Never really read about exactly what that means.

211
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,260
But I do know that it wasn't when they had to make the switch to unleaded gasoline.

212
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,829
It wasn't like, Oh, now our gas is much less efficient and you need more to go the same amount of miles and stuff.

213
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,460
Like it wasn't, it didn't improve anything like that efficiency,

214
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:19,370
but it had some other desirable property that wasn't definitely was not worth it in the end.

215
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:29,280
And this is another slide because, you know, I'm going to talk about some some disasters, of course, that are still ongoing, which are really sad.

216
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:34,620
So sometimes as public health professionals, we like to think about, well, when did public health work out?

217
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:42,120
And so, you know, LED there's still some ongoing issues with with lead, especially in they're all environmental justice issues.

218
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:48,629
But let is also a good example and on a broad scale of how some environmental health

219
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:55,830
policies can actually really work so or at least can lead to many improvements.

220
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:01,559
So these lines here, let's see. So they both kind of show the same thing.

221
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,549
It's basically percent of people above a hazardous level of blood.

222
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:13,830
And then just the average level of blood lead and people interact with over time with different laws that came into place,

223
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,940
you know, banning lead paint, led gasoline, led in plumbing and things like that.

224
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:25,349
And you can see as all these laws came into place, you know, blood lead in, the broad population went down and down and down.

225
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:30,450
So you can see, you know, nearly 100% of our population used to have, you know,

226
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,720
very toxic levels of blood in their blood, you know, just a few decades ago, just about 50 years ago.

227
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:41,490
So this is a huge improvement. Now in the US, you know, most people don't.

228
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:50,250
But what we're concerned about now is, you know, this this small group of people who still do have exposure and, you know, eliminating that.

229
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:56,010
So we've done the job finally as public health people of bringing down the major sources.

230
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:00,510
But now we have to protect the people, you know, in pockets that still still have this exposure.

231
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:00,990
Yeah.

232
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:10,320
They're also concerned about like aging the aging population, like you said, when osteoporosis happens and life is like coming out again or it now.

233
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,159
Yeah. Yeah. So that gets you next. So yeah, that still is a concern for sure.

234
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,049
I think we have been able to, you know,

235
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:25,950
this link between lead and Alzheimer's and stuff like that certainly is because, you know, it's this group of people,

236
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:32,370
you know, these people are now older and they all had this led exposure when they were younger, you know, young adults, children and things like that.

237
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,559
And so we do think there's a link there.

238
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:42,090
And, you know, there's a possibility that now this group of people become old, they won't have, you know, as as high burden of those diseases.

239
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,649
But and it still is a problem.

240
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:50,549
Yeah, there's a study there's a big study called the Normative Aging Study that's looked at bone lead and in adults and seeing,

241
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,620
you know, they still have this kind of burden there.

242
00:23:52,620 --> 00:24:01,770
And some ways you can protect against that a little bit by supplementing people with calcium and doing other things to prevent osteoporosis.

243
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:07,980
The other definitely is blood release in a lot of especially and probably even more like a couple of decades ago.

244
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,370
Now that we're getting further away from this this bomb, you know, there won't be as much of a concern soon.

245
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:24,410
But yes. Yeah, I wanted to ask because of love of the timeline and the history of wars that were involved.

246
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:35,550
And I'm wondering about like the different biological agents that have been used because like my dad was and was exposed like sarin gas.

247
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:40,260
Oh, yes. And like not every it's not like none of the weapons had to have on them.

248
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,580
It's you can't say that definitively. And he's aware of that.

249
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,480
Because because of that. So I'm wondering why has that been looked at?

250
00:24:51,410 --> 00:25:00,650
Because there were quite a few wardens were found being used to conquer or at least exposure to time.

251
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:07,690
Yeah. Yeah, that's a great question. And even even during this time, they would have had, you know, kind of general exposure,

252
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:13,040
even just from gas and and the Syrian war with the weapons of the chemicals of warfare as well.

253
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:18,379
I honestly can't say I've seen research looking at the interaction between those two,

254
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,790
but I can see why, especially since, yeah, they both affect neurological health,

255
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:29,570
how there could be some synergy there and it could make and it would probably even be hard to tease apart, you know, the impact of the two.

256
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,520
So would be like yeah. Or it could be confounding or yeah, it could just be.

257
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:41,570
I could see like an interaction or additive effect of the two, but you wouldn't be able to tell how much of it was from one or the other.

258
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:48,500
But yeah, that's that's a really good point. And there's sure there's a lot of other, you know, big toxic exposures people had,

259
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:54,409
especially before this 1970 was kind of on the big environmental laws came into play in the US for many things,

260
00:25:54,410 --> 00:26:00,680
for water and air and all kinds of stuff. And like you said, there's quite a few wars in the decades preceding that too, so.

261
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:11,870
Great question. So now I know this isn't a toxicology class.

262
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:17,269
So I just add a little bit here. I'll give you a little bit of what we know about the toxicity of lead.

263
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:26,059
And then I want to talk about a few a few key places where there's still some exposure today and then what we can do about it and we can just discuss.

264
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:30,080
But you might have you know, I know last week you can talk about occupational health.

265
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,020
So there is actually the founder of occupational toxicology was U of M grad,

266
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:43,760
but Alice Hamilton pictured here and she looked at led in several different industries,

267
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:51,650
you know, that that used it and found, you know, so these workers were really highly exposed even more than when led was in gasoline in the air.

268
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,759
And they had these, you know, really kind of big impacts.

269
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:05,839
They could have convulsions, certain kinds of paralysis, something they called painter's colic, which was kind of just in pain all the time.

270
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,450
And then so those were acute. If you had a a ton of exposure, you know, kind of right after, you might have these effects.

271
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,930
But then long term for maybe chronically working with that every day,

272
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:20,240
some people had high blood pressure and anemia, abdominal pain and other effects.

273
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,920
There are a lot of reproductive health effects, too, for especially women who worked with Lynn.

274
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,979
And then we know now, since the topic is more focus on kids today,

275
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:37,700
but we know in adults chronic lower exposure like some people might still see in the world today in adults is

276
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:42,320
can be associated with cardiovascular and blood pressure effects you know possibly things like Alzheimer's.

277
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,560
But for children we know a lot about what happens to children.

278
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:51,440
And this is a nice graph that, you know, it's kind of depicting roughly at certain levels of exposure.

279
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,069
We typically measure this in blood to see what's in people, you know,

280
00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:00,500
the certain level exposure that can even lead to death and, you know, really bad brain damage.

281
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:07,820
But then at lower levels that, you know, some kids might still experience today, there's things like anemia,

282
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,690
disruptions of weight and metabolism impairments and how your nerves conduct themselves,

283
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:22,430
you know, messes with vitamin D and calcium homeostasis, which can affect other things, is you need those nutrients, obviously.

284
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,229
And then this for a while,

285
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:32,180
this level of ten micrograms per deciliter in blood is what for a while we considered okay above ten is bad, below ten is okay.

286
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:39,050
But even at that level in you see, you know, decreases in IQ, you know,

287
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,220
when you look at a population scale, you can't really determine this in an individual person.

288
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,180
But when you look at a bunch of people together using epidemiological methods,

289
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:53,870
you see a link between decreased IQ, you know, impaired hearing, decreased growth, things like that.

290
00:28:55,010 --> 00:29:04,160
And now we've even seen some of these effects in kids who have a level less than five, which is the new level of concern the US kind of uses to,

291
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:10,160
you know, they say, okay, if you have a level higher than five, if they see a kid with that level, they try to do some kind of intervention.

292
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:16,010
So even at this level, which you know, is getting closer and closer to zero, you still see some some problems.

293
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:24,200
So that's why when we really want to get rid of it as much as we can, because there's no known safe limit,

294
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,340
you know, limit that we can kind of just deal with and be okay biologically.

295
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:32,719
So how, you know, how does it happen? How does it get into the body?

296
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,770
If we focus on prenatal exposure, lead can very easily cross the placenta.

297
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:44,390
So that's not a barrier can chrysalis and to get into the baby once there can also cross the blood brain barrier of, you know,

298
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:50,689
the child so it can get into the brain maternal sources of exposure, you know,

299
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:55,370
how does the left get there in the first place can be anything maybe she's been currently exposed to.

300
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,800
But also, if you know, her bones are breaking down a bit, I mean, historically that stored in there.

301
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:07,879
And then, you know, some of the work we've done the Mexico City when we were studying pregnant women,

302
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:14,780
when lead had recently been phased out of gasoline and we actually did a clinical trial looking at giving people,

303
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:19,489
you know, calcium supplementation and different levels of it to see if that would prevent, you know,

304
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:24,139
how much lead leached out of the bone in those women while they were pregnant and got into their kid.

305
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:28,040
And and it did so, you know, if the moms had enough calcium, you know,

306
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,359
their bones were didn't really break down very much during pregnancy and they didn't release,

307
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,990
you know, this extra source of blood to themselves and the child.

308
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,719
And so what happens biologically, not only can it cross into the brain in the child,

309
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,910
but it can actually disrupt the formation of the blood brain barrier, which you need that for a lot of things.

310
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:54,950
It's very important for that to form during development, and it limits the ability to protect against toxic effects, too.

311
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,579
So developing children, especially before birth,

312
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:05,900
don't really have a lot of the these enzymes in these things that our body uses to get rid of toxic substances to protect ourselves.

313
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:13,770
And then, of course, it goes in. And through various mechanisms, disrupts how the brain is forming the connections it's making,

314
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:18,120
which are very important for, you know, everything going forward.

315
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,680
And as far as early childhood, so that's gestation and registration is such a bad period for lead.

316
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,530
But early childhood is a bad time for blood, too,

317
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:33,780
because it can still either easily cross the blood brain barrier in kids and kids actually absorb a lot more.

318
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,259
So there's been, you know, studies, you know, kind of look just in their GI system,

319
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:43,920
if an adult ingests lead or a kid and just let the kids absorb a lot more of it, the adults will pass some of it out.

320
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,730
Yes. Does it also pass through breastfeeding?

321
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,200
It does, yeah. It's not like not a really high concentration, but it can.

322
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,980
Yes. Because I know it really is. They just like.

323
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:05,339
Yeah, so there are some other historical chemicals like PCBs that are very lipophilic and there's a lot of fat in breast milk.

324
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:11,940
So sometimes there's a really high dose of those for lead. It's just, you know, it's it's fairly diluted, but some of it does cross you.

325
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,610
And then kids actually, you know, eat and drink more per body weight than adults.

326
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:23,560
So if someone has contaminated water with lead, then kids, you know,

327
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:28,190
are actually kind of drinking more proportionately than adults are and getting more

328
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,910
of that and and then also observing it more because of the way their ecosystem works.

329
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:38,479
And then on top of that, they have additional sources that most of us, all of us in this room don't really have to worry about.

330
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:45,230
So they, you know, kind of accidentally and ingest a lot of dust and dirt and things like that because of

331
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,460
Holly's eyes touching things and putting them in their mouths and these pictures here.

332
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:56,839
So when we worked in Mexico, we had a major source of exposure was, you know, that if it only recently come out of gas,

333
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:03,139
but also they there's these traditional ceramics used there that are really beautiful and

334
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:08,450
passed on her family to family her down in the family but they're using this led glazed paint

335
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:13,729
so some of our our partners there are in it does legion of the food if you put food in the

336
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:18,410
dish then led from the paint comes out and when people eat the lid you know accidentally.

337
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:24,620
So there's been a big push to try to get rid of or reduce the use of these or replace

338
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,250
it with different kinds of paint in Mexico by some public health practitioners there.

339
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,310
Yes. Are you aware of the vintage fireworks issue here, too, with that?

340
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:44,420
Oh, yes. Yeah. That's like another thing here that is, um, do you know if it's like myth or fact?

341
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:50,870
I think it's. I've like three pieces of it just by race. Yeah.

342
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:54,859
I mean, I think it it probably just really depends actually.

343
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,670
Like when and where, what it's made, you know what you probably wouldn't really know,

344
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:03,559
but things that can help if you I guess if you ever have any kind of dish that you don't know if it something

345
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:10,940
hazardous and I mean usually things will leach out more with with like hot food or acidic food too,

346
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:19,430
like tomato soup, you know. So, you know, maybe if you're careful how you use it, that could help to improve the glazes cracking or something.

347
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:23,060
Yeah. If it's clearly, you know, like starting to chip away and stuff like that.

348
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,410
Yeah. But maybe even just put some fruit salad in there and.

349
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:40,810
Okay, keep it cold. And then her children, we saw some of the same biological problems that can disrupt the maintenance of their own,

350
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,170
the blood brain barrier, and disrupts neurodevelopment.

351
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:49,600
That is still happening in actually, you know, the brain continues to develop and make connections all through about age 25.

352
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:54,560
So, you know, this is a period when any toxic thing that can get into your brain can can disrupt that.

353
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:58,380
But in children, you know, it's still just happening on a really, really rapid scale.

354
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,209
So a little bit more about toxicology.

355
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:09,480
I won't explain all of these, but just in case any of you like this sort of thing, you know, at the biological level,

356
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:14,940
you know, what are some the actual, you know, cellular molecular mechanisms that are happening or hormonal?

357
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:23,490
So we actually know this just some there's a lot of different ways that let acts, you know, some toxic things we know cause, you know, their injuries.

358
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:32,430
So you will in a very specific way, you know, maybe they disrupt one certain hormone or, you know, one certain pathway target, one particular organ.

359
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,500
But for lead and for some of these actually a lot of the other metals that are out there,

360
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:46,169
they actually just really disrupt a lot of things and create a lot of havoc. So that can disrupt, you know, similar thyroid hormone, that pathway,

361
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:52,649
which regulates a lot of things that you need if through epigenetic alteration and a few other mechanisms, it affects gene expression.

362
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:58,590
So that can just affect a lot of things. And your genes control everything in the brain.

363
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:05,850
It can affect how your myelin is forming, which is important for your nerves to conduct correctly and your dendritic branching patterns.

364
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,770
So that's how they make connections with each other.

365
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:15,329
And those things are, you know, we know that those patterns are often, you know, people with ADHD and autism and things like that.

366
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,120
So it's important to set up those patterns correctly.

367
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:24,540
And then it could just it can affect your neurons, but also these oligodendrocytes, which are, you know,

368
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:30,509
in some ways that help ourselves to your neurons and that it can also just disrupt the actual signaling between neurons.

369
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:34,770
So, you know, anything neurological, it's it's basically impacting.

370
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:38,490
So it's no surprise it's associated with all these been neural effects.

371
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:46,830
So what do we do about it in the public health? Now, we've established, you know, we've gotten rid of some major sources of exposure.

372
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,370
We know it's really toxic. So why are we still talking about it today?

373
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:56,820
Because it's another one of those complicated environmental and justice problems that we still have.

374
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,249
So even though we've we've changed over time, the thresholds of toxicity, you know,

375
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:08,670
governing bodies like the CDC have said, okay, this is toxic, this is toxic, make sure all children are below this level.

376
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:12,750
And that level has gone down a couple of times to try to protect people more and more.

377
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,200
But we find, you know, of course, there's still some children, you know,

378
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,410
in pockets throughout the US that have sources of exposure that are still dangerous.

379
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:26,550
And where is it mostly coming from? You know, some is from soil.

380
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,340
So why is soil contaminated?

381
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:35,340
That's from, you know, soil can be contaminated from when we had in guests 50 years ago and it got deposited there and it doesn't really go there.

382
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:39,510
So it's still there in places that haven't had a lot of soil turnover.

383
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,969
It's can also get there places near, you know, industrial sites and older industrial sites,

384
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:56,190
especially sometimes when so soil, you know, it's still a contribution for quite a few kids to have poisoning lemon water,

385
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:04,079
which is probably the one the kind of problem you've heard about the most in these last five years and then let in dust and lead from renovation,

386
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,280
I would say go together because that's from more of the old paint source.

387
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:13,920
So if you live in a house, you know, built after 1960, then it shouldn't have lead paint.

388
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,100
But if it was built before and if the paint is starting to chip away, then that kind of gets into them.

389
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:23,010
To us in your house and children often get exposed to that.

390
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:28,770
I don't really have to talk too much about Flint, but as far as the water side of things, you know,

391
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:35,849
the Flint water crisis really brought this issue to the forefront as well as something similar happened in Washington,

392
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:40,830
DC about 15, ten years before the Flint water crisis.

393
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:50,309
And this really just showed, you know, how vulnerable certain populations are to, you know, something that they have no control over whatsoever.

394
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,240
So, of course, you know,

395
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:58,170
if you want to know a lot about the crisis document and he just wrote a really great book describing like all about it and all the complexities of it.

396
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,280
The she, you know, used some data of lead levels and kids in her clinic in Flint before and after

397
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,569
they made this water switch and how they they handled their water system,

398
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:15,060
which was really only essentially to save money without thinking about I mean,

399
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:20,280
didn't do it so that people would be exposed to lead but just didn't think about the implications that it was

400
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:26,580
going to corrode pipes and be acidic and release all this old historic flood from pipes and to their population.

401
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:33,030
And, you know, Dr. Hanna-Attisha really had to push to get people to believe this, but obviously.

402
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:39,750
As well as people in the community. We're trying to push for it for a while before, you know, even she began working with them.

403
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:47,520
And, you know, eventually, you know, what we found out is that even within Flint, you know, there are certain neighborhoods that had, you know,

404
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,079
higher proportions of these old pipes and stuff like that that ended up with more in their

405
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:57,600
water in those neighborhoods for ones that were already just more disadvantaged economically,

406
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,170
had higher proportions of minority populations and things like that.

407
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:10,260
And so what this whole process, you know, brought on a lot of questions for public health practice that we still need to think about today,

408
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:14,160
especially when we're thinking about toxic injury prevention.

409
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,390
You know, for lead, what truly is an acceptable blood led level.

410
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:27,379
You know, there is kind of these debates. About like oh the Wadlow levels weren't actually that high in the kids she measured and stuff even

411
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:32,420
though there's clearly an increase so there is debates about you know what what should we accept.

412
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:39,020
You know and I think closer and closer to zero, obviously, is what we really need to accept and not make these arbitrary limits.

413
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,930
Um, what kind of harm will be caused in children and adults that were exposed for, you know,

414
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:50,920
a year or two years, three years during that time and what, you know, how long will it last?

415
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:58,130
Is it reversible or irreversible? You know, the beginning of the talk, they talked about this developmental paradigm and how,

416
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:04,280
you know, it's it can obviously seem very hopeless, you know, like, oh, you're suppose in utero.

417
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,940
So, you know, you're just born during the flint the Flint water crisis, you're exposed in utero.

418
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,529
Does that mean, you know, you have no chance for the rest of your life?

419
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:18,739
And that's, you know, as you know, toxicologists and public health people, we we want to protect people, too.

420
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:25,040
You know, we think that there's ways to promote health, even though in people that have already sustained, you know,

421
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:32,329
maybe a toxic injury, there are, you know, certain things that can improve neurological health and neurological development.

422
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:37,250
And there's a lot of, you know, pediatricians and other groups working on that in Flint now,

423
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,750
you know, saying, okay, if you've already been exposed, what do you do?

424
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:44,180
So there is like early intervention, educational programs and things like that that are shown to,

425
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:49,969
you know, in some ways have a more positive impact on neural development than lead has a negative impact.

426
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:55,490
So you can use things like that to outweigh some of these effects now that the damage has been done.

427
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:02,629
And then, you know, we still don't know in some cases, are some kids more susceptible than others?

428
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,959
You know, some people are like, oh, you know, my kid has a dynamic.

429
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,620
It is autism.

430
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:14,540
Now, is it because they're exposed to lead in water and, you know, their next door neighbor doesn't have autism, was exposed to the same things.

431
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:22,669
So those are some of the questions we don't necessarily understand, like why it impacts certain people more than than others.

432
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:28,310
But, you know, our goal as public health people is to protect, you know, the most vulnerable.

433
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:34,430
So make it safe for all, you know, for maybe that person who would develop much more harm than others.

434
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:43,340
And then, you know, now there's some big questions on more of the, you know, government economical side, too, about, okay, what should be done.

435
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:51,290
So there's a lot of cities, most cities really that have these leaded pipes and these infrastructures with led in them.

436
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:57,440
So now cities are trying to decide, but they spend millions and billions of dollars to just go ahead and replace all their pipes.

437
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:04,070
Now, can you just be more careful with your water system so that things don't end up leaching, you know, what do you do?

438
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:10,880
And these are big questions. Obviously, public health people want to push for, okay, total remediation,

439
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:16,580
get rid of like places that have a bunch of leaded soil and clean that up, get rid of,

440
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:21,889
you know, houses that have leaded paint, you know, find ways to mitigate that and put on,

441
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:26,000
you know, fresh concept, non leather paint and also replace all these pipes.

442
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,329
But in reality, it costs billions of dollars.

443
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:32,570
And so who's going to do that and are we going to do that as a society?

444
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:40,460
Are some of the big questions still ongoing now? And then I'll just.

445
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:47,240
I'll just close with a couple more examples.

446
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,710
And this is so this is more of an epidemiological kind of thing.

447
00:43:52,130 --> 00:44:01,620
This is a graph. We'll explain this. So this is showing, you know, on on a population scale how even if we keep bringing down our level.

448
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:06,230
Like what's safe and what's not. You know, these are estimates of.

449
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:11,480
So this is our current record. So what we say, if you're below five micrograms per deciliter, you're okay.

450
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:16,399
And even in this range, this is well, this was five years ago.

451
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,620
So at this time, this was the number of kids in the U.S. that still had levels above that.

452
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:26,990
And based on estimates from, you know, big effort studies, it shows, you know,

453
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:33,860
so there's half a million kids that would have on average a six point IQ loss from having this LED exposure.

454
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:40,610
But then if you go down further, closer to zero, there's still these what we believe these smaller effects in IQ.

455
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:46,700
So there's more kids in that range. So that means it's kind of like a more total IQ loss, if you will.

456
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:52,700
So these are things that we need to think about with led to, you know,

457
00:44:52,790 --> 00:45:00,140
we know we need to clean up the really high doses in some of these places like Flint that had a huge burden of lead all at once.

458
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:05,330
But what about on this population scale? There there's still more subtle sources of exposure.

459
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:09,620
You know, where where do we where do we stop? In what level do you is?

460
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:15,890
Because in theory, there's there's, you know, effects across millions of people, even at some of these lower levels.

461
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,650
And this is just an example.

462
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:28,170
You know, people talk a lot about Flint, but actually there's levels of lead that are in some ways much higher in some other cities in Michigan.

463
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,680
I'm using Michigan as an example. But, you know, you can say this for anywhere in the US.

464
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:37,620
So these these red spots are spots where more than 10% of children have higher than that.

465
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:42,260
You know, that level five we're looking for. So like this area here is Jackson.

466
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:49,140
You can see in in certain parts of Detroit, there's a lot of kids in that range in Grand Rapids.

467
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:56,340
And I think this is Kalamazoo. You know, there's a couple of cities throughout the U.S. or throughout Michigan that have higher levels of lead.

468
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:03,299
And these cities are also places where we have high proportions of minority populations,

469
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:08,220
as well as, you know, low income, not great educational systems and things like that.

470
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:16,560
So there's really, you know, this is just a burden on top of a burden for many populations and something in these regions and something that,

471
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:23,190
you know, we really need to work on because it's a major environmental justice issue and this is one example.

472
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:28,620
And so this is zooming in on Detroit, which is in this box.

473
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:36,120
And here the the orange or the orange areas are boxes where there's more people with elevated blood lead levels.

474
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:40,020
And these dots are all historic sites.

475
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:48,600
So in Detroit, you know, they don't have or they didn't at least some of these things keep changing, but they didn't have one contaminated water.

476
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:54,899
But a lot of the housing in some of these these neighborhoods especially, is old and falling apart.

477
00:46:54,900 --> 00:47:01,559
And so people are getting exposed from paint, but also from soil where it and it came from these, you know,

478
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:07,350
these old industrial sites nearby that historically emitted lead and other things that got into the surrounding region.

479
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:15,660
And then this is something some of our colleagues here, including Alison Miller, I think is in your department.

480
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:18,660
Some of you might know her worked on a couple of years ago.

481
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:25,590
We had some partners, we had some community partners in Kent County in Grand Rapids that were worried about lead.

482
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,489
And, you know, they said, you know, we think our levels are going up.

483
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:38,370
We been screening kids blues, Grand Rapids in the city, and then Gray is the rest of their county and all the other suburbs.

484
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:44,580
Like in Grand Rapids, we've been having all these kids with elevated level of levels and it's actually just started to go up.

485
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:52,799
And so why, you know, why is it going up? So, you know, Allison and her colleagues worked with them to figure out what are these sources were.

486
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:59,370
And they didn't have a standing water source, but they did have there was a big change, housing works there.

487
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,850
So Grand Rapids was becoming gentrified.

488
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:12,060
And, you know, some of the the lower income population was getting squeezed out of, you know, some of the better housing and some of this,

489
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:19,920
if I can say it made crappier housing that had a lot of this pain and, you know, all that pain and was kind of falling apart.

490
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:27,330
And so and when that happened, you started seeing more low income kids having increased levels of lead.

491
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:34,110
And this is just another graphic kind of showing that these are basically all the kids that were tested in the county.

492
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:40,530
So in the suburbs, you know, about the same rate of kids were tested from the suburbs and the city.

493
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:49,170
But then in the suburbs, you know, a small proportion of them had this potentially high level and a very large proportion of them had it in the city.

494
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,860
And when they dug into this further, you know, they saw it was in three very specific,

495
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,300
even just neighborhoods or zip codes within the city that had more of this.

496
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:07,020
And it was those places that were, you know, higher poverty, worse housing,

497
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:12,390
and also a higher proportion of black children who had much higher levels at that time.

498
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:16,620
And at that time, you know, even though the Flint water crisis and everything was going on,

499
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:20,579
this zip code was actually that the one with the most lead poisoned children in Michigan.

500
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,250
So sometimes, you know, we see certain things in the news,

501
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:28,500
but sometimes there's actually other crises going on that you don't realize that are possibly even worse.

502
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:34,410
And this was more of a once again, a paint thing, and then we'll go into this one too much.

503
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:41,910
But there is a city pretty close to Lake Michigan is kind of, you know, a nice area, but called Benton Harbor that,

504
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:46,920
you know, recently had this I just took this from Instagram, from the National Resources Defense Council.

505
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,930
So, you know, there's a city in Michigan that has lead levels 60 times above the federal limit.

506
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:56,610
But it's not Flint, because you're always hearing about Flint all the time. And in this case, it was Benton Harbor.

507
00:49:56,610 --> 00:50:01,770
And they bring them up as an example, because the government did pretty something pretty extreme with Benton Harbor.

508
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:09,690
So they're like Flint. There's their problem was actually contaminated water, too, but their water was even more contaminated.

509
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:15,540
And the government swooped in because they're like, Oh, we really messed up the Flint crisis.

510
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:20,680
So we. You better do something good this time. Politically, that's probably why the government swooped in.

511
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:26,229
But whatever the reason, you know, that this government intervention came in, they said, okay,

512
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:33,940
we have a goal of in the next one and a half years replacing all of your leaded service lines to prevent this water problem for the city.

513
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,370
So this is, you know, a city of 10,000 people and this cost $45 million.

514
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:42,820
And it's really a lot of major construction, too.

515
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:51,009
So you can see that we might have to think of some more creative solutions going forward to to work on this,

516
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:59,350
because this is not something that every city or government is going to be able to do, especially when you think about bigger cities.

517
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:06,220
So this is kind of an example of how you can't have a government intervention to fix some of this problem.

518
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:11,560
But, you know, can we really do this across the whole the whole country?

519
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:15,160
Are there, you know, more economical ways to figure out this problem?

520
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:21,760
Since I was all really depressing, I want to just remind us again of where we once were.

521
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:28,600
So at one point in time, everybody was very highly exposed to lead, and now most people are not.

522
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:32,620
But we are still very much focused in our, you know,

523
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:38,240
small public health field of protecting those those people that are and figuring out what what can we do?

524
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:45,970
What are some ways we can get rid of these export sources of exposure, you know, possibly without replacing every pipe in the whole country?

525
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:53,770
And what are some things we can just do to promote health to and prevent toxic injury, reverse the effects of toxic injury,

526
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:59,140
which are some of the things we do on the more, you know, biological labs side of things.

527
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:08,110
And just a few quick interventions of other interventions that are maybe more accessible to a broader number of communities.

528
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:16,150
You know, of course, you can clean up all the pipes and you can replace all of your paint and do things like that, which are huge interventions.

529
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:22,840
And there are some governments and nonprofits that do provide resources to,

530
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:27,100
you know, kind of replace paint and clean up contaminated soil and stuff like that.

531
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:32,110
But some things that can also be done where there's water contamination, you know,

532
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:37,060
these the right type of water filter, it actually does get rid of all the lead.

533
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:44,080
So providing that free to everyone you can who has a contaminated water sources is a very effective intervention.

534
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,650
But you have to keep up with it. You need to help people replace them.

535
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:50,620
I think like every six months you kind of have to change them out and things like that.

536
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:59,649
Um, there's also ways if you've already been exposed, there are, you know, various interventions like to improve,

537
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:04,000
especially, you know, educational interventions to improve development for children.

538
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:11,200
And there's actually dietary interventions. I do have a slide on that that can protect against led to.

539
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:15,430
So we've talked a lot about how it interacts with calcium.

540
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:24,430
You know, if you eat a diet rich in calcium, vitamin C and iron, that can actually reduce the amount of blood you absorb into your body,

541
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:28,390
the amount that gets into your bones and kind of fight off some of its toxic effects.

542
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:34,300
So this is you know, there have been some kind of sometimes you can, you know,

543
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:39,549
lead protective diets that have been, you know, in the interim given to people,

544
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:46,030
recommended to people who've already been exposed and things like the the Environmental Protection Agency,

545
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:50,469
you know, even has a little book out on the gives, like recipes of foods that are high.

546
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:55,060
And all of these things that could try to protect children or adults have been exposed.

547
00:53:55,990 --> 00:54:04,390
So in summary, when you think about injury, don't forget about environmental chemicals that cause invisible,

548
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:07,360
subtle injuries that are harming public health.

549
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:17,260
And there are things that we can also very much prevent with the right policies and in management programs for toxic chemicals, especially lead.

550
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:19,000
But for many others, you know,

551
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:25,720
there's a very disproportionate burden of who is exposed and who is not and who will experience toxicity to and who won't.

552
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:31,660
So this is something that, you know, the public health field really needs to keep on top of.

553
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:39,640
And prevention is key. We want to continue to create and modify policies to protect everyone that we can.

554
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:44,709
But there are some possible interventions where people have already been exposed so that they're not,

555
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:49,820
you know, doomed to poor health the rest of their lives necessarily.

556
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:54,780
There are things we can do to help people, and I think that's all I have.

557
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:09,840
Yes. What name are you familiar with? The process to remove any paint left from houses?

558
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,940
Yeah, so I think so.

559
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:24,030
You know, there's two different things that are done. You know, sometimes in the maybe like the more accessible way is actually just like repainting.

560
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:31,589
So if you do a couple of layers of regular paint over, then it shouldn't chip, you know, that would take a long time.

561
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:33,840
That chip off solution really get to the old leaded stuff.

562
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:41,610
But there are some some bigger interventions, you know, where it's more like scraping off a lot of the old paint and then repainting.

563
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:45,630
But I'd say so that that is sometimes done, you know, sometimes.

564
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:56,669
And then, you know, even, you know, there's actually some of the people in my department have work done like LED problems during demolition too,

565
00:55:56,670 --> 00:56:02,340
because of course then you have to really protect workers then but are working on it because they can be everyone are doing that.

566
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:09,149
If people are doing the scraping and the cleaning up and the vacuuming up, all the other leaded kind of chip paint that's already all over the place,

567
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:18,480
they definitely if you you get like a government sponsored remediation program, then they bring in a professional who's wearing like full PPE,

568
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:22,590
you know, so they're not and you've got to be out of the house while they're doing that and everything,

569
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:28,170
because otherwise you'll be exposed to a whole bunch just while they're, you know, cleaning up the old paint, if that makes sense.

570
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:33,660
Because I was thinking about like the initiative they did in Detroit to tear down abandoned homes.

571
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,950
Yeah, they're just thinking about, like, the process to that, how they did that.

572
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:47,680
Like a lot of the workers are protected and they use water to I guess, keep the dust down but I'm wondering how long it'll linger the.

573
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:53,040
Yeah and actually and I wish next year before I come to this class I'll read more about that.

574
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:57,540
But I know one of our, a couple of our professors in my department and we're working on that too.

575
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:04,290
The impacts of the demolition and measuring. I don't think they've actually been doing LED, but they've been measuring other kinds of contaminants.

576
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:11,309
But yeah, so the, the water will keep it from the dust from, you know, like spreading like many houses away and blowing to a bunch of people.

577
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:17,459
But, you know, the workers definitely should be protected working on those demolitions because there's a lot of things flying around,

578
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:24,810
including land that they can be breathing in. And then it could whatever came out of the house could just be settling in the soil around that house.

579
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:31,589
So I'm not sure I'd have to read it. I'm not sure if there's a plan to, you know, like remediate the soil, too,

580
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:35,640
because that can be done before they build that to a new house or something.

581
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:41,970
But I know even for for people that are using old properties in Detroit to make urban farms,

582
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:47,610
you this this is just in they're doing together working on this but there is, you know,

583
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:50,999
a lot of land where they knock down houses or it's just empty for other reasons.

584
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,629
And Detroit is being used for like farms and parks and stuff like that.

585
00:57:54,630 --> 00:58:00,300
So there's also been concern, okay, what, you know, is that safe for children to be on?

586
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:11,730
Is it safe for people to eat those plants? So at least for the farms that are, I guess, established, they there's kind of regulations on them that,

587
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:14,550
you know, there's actually a remediation process you can do,

588
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:21,960
like growing sunflowers and a couple other plants that tend to suck up a lot of the toxic stuff before you plant things that you're going to eat.

589
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:27,840
So there is but you know, but some farms are just kind of working under the radar, so they might not necessarily be doing that.

590
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,930
But yeah, so it is it is an issue to think about.

591
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:36,240
Soil remediation is is possible. But, you know, it's not always done in all these locations.

592
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:51,430
Yes. There are detection processes for. Yeah, that is a good question.

593
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:57,829
It's it's very easy to get a blood test, but that's just kind of what you've been exposed to recently.

594
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:02,560
Or if I guess if your phone has been breaking down recently, you'd see it in your blood led to.

595
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:12,080
But you there is actually a method to measure lead in bone it's but it's usually only used for research usually can't access it in a clinic.

596
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:17,990
So because we've used it for our research, it's it's essentially an X-ray based technology.

597
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,850
But yeah, I don't I don't think there's any clinics that offer that though.

598
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:29,269
So I think the best someone could probably do is maybe measure their blood when, you know,

599
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:36,290
maybe like beginning a pregnancy and then maybe a few months in when in case you're having any bone breakdown to see if it's gone up.

600
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:43,670
But also just, you know, just going ahead and having good calcium supplementation right from the beginning will help because,

601
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:52,580
you know, for pregnant women, bones shouldn't really break down too much, but it does if you need more calcium for the process.

602
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:56,030
So if you have enough calcium, you can prevent most of that breakdown.

603
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:05,610
Yeah. Um, is there any class about you're not going to learn more about.

604
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:11,480
Oh, goodness. Well, which part of this one do you like?

605
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:21,170
Neuro background. Okay. And then, like, I think it's I know it's for all of this is not public, this progress being made.

606
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:25,670
So that's like the bright side, but it's really interesting to see how everything is together.

607
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:34,070
Okay. Um, yeah. So, like, epigenetics is definitely interesting, but I'm also like, what other things are being used?

608
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:38,390
Oh, yeah. What other things are currently like? We're constantly around and we don't know.

609
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:42,980
Like, I'm from the grid. I'm from the zip code.

610
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,880
That's okay. We were never told. I we were never made aware.

611
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:51,050
I'm like, how does this how do people find this out?

612
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:57,860
And people are not informed. Oh, by the way, like I said in Grand Rapids, I don't know if they've ever made a statement.

613
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:05,210
Yeah, that that is a good point. So, you know, I'll answer that first and then your class or comment on that.

614
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:15,560
That's a good point with some of these the the water disasters like Benton Harbor and even another city, Highland Park in Flint, there's, you know,

615
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:19,580
basically the pattern has been kind of like try to cover it up,

616
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:23,149
try to pretend it's not happening if people are pushing for it, realizing something's wrong.

617
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:28,550
And then when the government finally admits to it, then everybody knows like, oh, it's in the water, suffering in the water.

618
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:34,830
But yeah, you're right. With these these paint based or soil based, you know, contaminations there.

619
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,080
Yeah, there there isn't usually a government intervention like that.

620
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:46,760
And I know I know the the people working on the project were working with a community health organization that,

621
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:51,260
you know, brought this issue to the university and was like, hey, this is an issue to help us with this.

622
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:56,870
But and I'm sure that that group tries to reach as many people as they can, but they're not the government.

623
01:01:56,870 --> 01:02:01,130
They can't put out a public service announcement. So, yeah, that's a really good point.

624
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:06,110
I'm going to write that down thinking about how to how to get the message out better for things like this.

625
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:12,379
Because I know like this this group tried to spread the message like hand out fliers about this kind of stuff going on.

626
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:15,560
But yeah, it's not. How many people do they reach? Obviously not everybody.

627
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:26,680
Yeah. Um, the other classes, you know, I mean, you can kind of scroll through any of the classes offered by IHS, but I think what would it be?

628
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:31,250
I think like 601 there's one on. It's like our big, like, toxicology class.

629
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:40,010
So if you really like that, it will give more examples of different, different types of substances,

630
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:43,579
like where they're coming from and how they're impacting like different organs of the body and stuff.

631
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:50,840
So you might be interested in that, but I think there's also one called environmental exposures and disease, which could be a little more,

632
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,729
more broad and also go through a lot of different examples of things,

633
01:02:55,730 --> 01:03:00,049
but not just focus on like the picky, like biological processes that are happening.

634
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:06,050
So it depends on how detailed you want to get. Yes.

635
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:15,880
Do you all work and play sports? Thinking of, like, impaired students, the lack of resources for their kids from cause of exposures.

636
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:20,910
But they just. I guess for that support standpoint.

637
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:28,320
I just think that awareness, I think, yeah, I know that that that is a great point because you know,

638
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:35,250
schools a lot of times are under, you know, like, okay, now, now we have these kids that are already, you know, have problems.

639
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:38,370
So we just need to give them these services and try to help them and stuff.

640
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:45,989
But it would be much better to prevent or to spread a message of prevention to prevent some of these if some of these effects are from toxic exposure.

641
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:49,950
So I think, um, I haven't, but definitely some of my colleagues have.

642
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:58,229
You know, a lot of times when we work with community partners, you know, we want to actually your department,

643
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:05,910
if you're on HIV Achi is much better at doing that, you know, taking what we learn and translating it to to communities and people that need it.

644
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:13,410
But, you know, a lot of times we work with more like computer community, environmental or public health agencies that are working on a certain issue.

645
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:17,790
And then there may be trying to change policy or get access to resources or something like that.

646
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:24,780
But I know some of my colleagues have worked with schools before on like air pollution related things.

647
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:30,180
There's some schools, you know, in Detroit, Dearborn that are right next to emitters and worked there,

648
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:33,900
but that was more to try to get them cleaner air.

649
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:42,299
But yeah, I've done, you know, some of us I've I've done like LED presentations like Ann Arbor Public Schools before.

650
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:46,200
Like this is actually something where if you prevent this exposure, this will help.

651
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:50,759
But I think that's something we could do a better job of spreading that message to schools.

652
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,879
And because that's a place where you can you can actually access a lot of families.

653
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,750
You know, I've spoken at more like city council kind of meetings before,

654
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:01,260
and you just get certain people that come with those, you know, it's not everybody.

655
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:06,479
But if you go to, yeah, maybe like a, like a parent teacher meeting or something,

656
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:14,340
you can really spread the message to a lot of people that need it for the, the team that made the the Kent County.

657
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:19,830
Oh, actually they did something with with families. So the people that worked in Kent County,

658
01:05:19,830 --> 01:05:26,520
they actually made an app that it's kind of like this little thing that families can go through it talking

659
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:33,030
about how you might of kind of figuring out if maybe you've been exposed to what and then what you can do.

660
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:37,859
Some like the protective diet, some educational resources you can use and stuff like that.

661
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:45,350
And it's supposed to be like a simulate, like one on one, like talking to somebody about the issue instead of it being more widely distributed.

662
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:49,139
All but I haven't checked in lately to see how many people actually got it out too.

663
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:52,770
But that's, you know, it's a good reminder of that sort of thing.

664
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:58,940
It's really important to. Yes.

665
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:02,890
Is that or are you aware of the other policies about disclosures?

666
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:06,770
Like I was in a different class they were talking about for one or two amplifiers.

667
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:13,299
I did write a course about learning or my own experience of renting.

668
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:19,090
Like Colorado doesn't have a disclosure about love, but here I'm like a [INAUDIBLE].

669
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:22,740
And I'm like, Why is that even here compared to my Colorado leave?

670
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:28,570
So I'm like interested. Like, is there any policy regarding disclosure?

671
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:40,209
Yeah. So that is a good reminder that the, you know, the patent law must be state specific because.

672
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:47,200
Yeah, I know I've actually I've always lived in Michigan, so I know we've had that law that was built in Michigan has been around for a while.

673
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:52,330
And I think the I think it might it's definitely all rental properties.

674
01:06:53,440 --> 01:07:00,700
I'm trying to think it's in you buy properties too. I think it's any kind of property you have to disclose if you know that it has lead paint.

675
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:09,940
Yeah. And then, but you know, of course sometimes you can say you don't know, but I guess as they say you don't know, then maybe you can look into it.

676
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:15,429
But they haven't they didn't have in Colorado then it might very well be a state a state specific mandate.

677
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:19,690
There is there's a federal it's actually fairly new.

678
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:26,530
There's something called the lending capital rule that is more focused on types that would, you know, eventually impact water.

679
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:34,240
But it pipes that I believe is a federal regulation and it was updated recently, too.

680
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:43,480
So basically it makes cities essentially alert everybody if there's like a certain amount of blood in the water or copper.

681
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:49,570
And it has to do with what you do with making information accessible about like where the pipes are and stuff.

682
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:53,470
So that's a federal one. Yeah. The housing one is state specific.

683
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:59,230
That's very interesting. That's something that should be changed to be the same across all states.

684
01:08:03,290 --> 01:08:06,320
And actually, when the when the Latin copper rule recently changed,

685
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:12,680
they they lowered I think they they increased the amount of testing cities were required to do.

686
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:18,350
Of their own water. And then they lowered the amount the level of land water that you had to report.

687
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:23,989
So actually right when the law changed, all these cities got this notification like you have elevated lead.

688
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:27,880
And it was just a few years ago it was ran after Flint. So they're like, What do you do?

689
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:32,930
But they did. But it was probably the same level they had before that.

690
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:39,709
But that kind of lowered the standard to make it safer. So suddenly, like all these cities got this alert at once, you know,

691
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:47,390
and that's when some cities started taking action and in trying to to work on that.

692
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:50,930
But for for most of them, their level is like kind of borderline.

693
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:55,010
But then at that around that time, some places like Benton Harbor are like, well,

694
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:59,500
we actually have a huge flood level that we actually have to clean up immediately because it's really dangerous.

695
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:10,870
But. Yes.

696
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:17,499
We love students from HP, HP, and so please come take our classes, work together with us.

697
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:22,180
We need to translate, you know, what we find into, you know, real ways.

698
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:29,140
I mean, people need to hear these messages and I guess we need an HP, too, because, I mean, it's in policy to be changed as well.

699
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:39,080
Well, thank you. One more time. All right.

700
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:44,000
Folks who only reconvene in one direction is probably just 10 minutes.

701
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:53,540
Just not intended to do this.

702
01:09:53,810 --> 01:10:00,930
Oh, my God. Yeah.

703
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:05,040
Shoot tournaments. Great. No.

704
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:08,150
Know for your project? Yeah.

705
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:16,670
Yeah, somebody might ask. So we are just starting to get our interviews with the same person.

706
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:28,390
We can ask if there's anything that really has an and even if it's just an idea that might be boring to get through.

707
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:33,950
Or one question about the I don't know if there are any.

708
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:43,640
I really do. Yeah, for sure. So when you say these days of work.

709
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:47,610
I know, I know.

710
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:53,209
Okay. No, we are going to start trying to at least bring folks back quarterly at the very least,

711
01:10:53,210 --> 01:11:00,420
just to get everybody back on the same page with you, because we were just trying to get measures at the start of interviews.

712
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:06,590
So we really it's just been the last eight weeks before we almost have like all our sites like that.

713
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:14,840
It's been kind of peaceful. But now you have in this 2 hours it just how many visitors and we're hoping for more

714
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:21,249
than 200 is what we're actually missing that are we're not quite at that 50 or so.

715
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:26,240
A lot of the sites that we recruit is a big turn out to be like creative placemaking or Stormont or concerts,

716
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:32,480
and at least for the ones that we think we can also access and try to understand about community engagement.

717
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:46,420
So, but so I know there's estimates that there are so many things there, but there's this great well in the arena area.

718
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:51,020
Yeah. So the people are doing that.

719
01:11:51,500 --> 01:12:00,440
And what do you. Well, one of the great works of art with a couple of Detroit teachers sitting there, they're out there.

720
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:13,820
And we're also doing relationship building and other things so that we can reach out to finish the things that I remember a lot about any of you.

721
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:18,650
Is that like near the school?

722
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:25,600
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

723
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:29,930
So, listen, conferences or I guess, or.

724
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:35,300
Yeah. Yeah. That's some attention, which is good.

725
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:39,830
I think it needed to have been a long time.

726
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:42,460
These kind of didn't get any real research attention.

727
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:53,930
But now, before we started recording, it was an issue too, because obviously, you know, some of it is my parents and my dad.

728
01:12:56,420 --> 01:13:14,790
I mean, even if it was in some of the urban areas, roll the student appliances on, I don't know that I started it as well so that you can make little.

729
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:24,000
I didn't really think about this. Right, right, right.

730
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:31,610
So we're down on your outside of our house. Is it is it do good do good tires?

731
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:34,650
And do I like the name? I looked it.

732
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:39,170
I realized that. Yeah. Well, the other part we lost.

733
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:48,240
Okay. Oh, we also have a grocery.

734
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:58,760
Yeah. So we're like, okay, isn't that how you figure that we have, like.

735
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:05,160
Yeah. So since there's this not that there was no.

736
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:15,300
And that's why I do research. So I decided.

737
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:35,770
But it's over. I don't really tone it down a little bit and future trends in a different direction, which is the younger management.

738
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:45,180
Yeah. So I think I think those are gone.

739
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:50,700
So that's a very clearly had an excuse for that.

740
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:58,160
But as I said, I've done a great job working with them, but I never get a chance to see and hear the differences.

741
01:14:58,170 --> 01:14:59,730
Like most of our students are doing,

742
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:08,879
the early life exposure stuff one person can't really say Is that like smoke inhalation or just through their interaction with their job,

743
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:15,330
they're also coming into college. That's yeah, it's it's it's all of the above there.

744
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:19,290
It's just the whole time we actually worked out this summer.

745
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:24,390
But yeah, I think, you know, they made a statement that fire breathing.

746
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:36,570
I thought you did that for certain people, but as long as you can continue to grow, lots of friends.

747
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:44,160
But I don't think that's my process because I definitely want to go.

748
01:15:44,580 --> 01:16:08,610
There's also something there that is so hard to withdraw all your life in there, and so I don't think we'll do that.

749
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:18,750
We must be doing this for ten years worth of elements, probably like better gear and then also rail and firefighters.

750
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:23,850
That's going to be a big deal because they you know,

751
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:40,770
they don't know where I am working on something like this because even things are kind of like Fort Myers and stuff.

752
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:49,479
So they're just like, you know, for them. So they're not really you're right on the pages just like, you know, nothing wrong with that.

753
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:55,709
So, like, you know, I just want to hear about your example.

754
01:16:55,710 --> 01:17:00,780
You've been on like I think they're going crazy.

755
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:15,239
You can do a cool thing for us to handle that same that's cool stuff.

756
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:21,450
You know, as I thought on your point, if I was going to say yes,

757
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:24,870
I'm definitely I I'm sure they probably have a place that they need to the

758
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:37,130
person that was on holiday in Pennsylvania for a little while and everything.

759
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:46,889
And so I have to imagine here that the stats project is here.

760
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:54,360
So there's just so yeah, this is, this is the second time in this process in 2019 cause I can say,

761
01:17:54,450 --> 01:18:01,700
yeah, I have, I was teaching programs, lawyers and I knew what people like in this space.

762
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:10,290
So I don't know if every year, I mean, it's kind of crazy, but I'm like, but not every year.

763
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:14,670
And that every time I get done that, I'm telling the truth.

764
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:18,839
Yeah. Yeah. That's an interesting.

765
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:25,020
I mean, I think most people do the same thing.

766
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:30,450
No, no, no, that's right. It's definitely work and one that's really hard.

767
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:30,990
Yeah.

768
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:44,400
I think the government is going to say we're going to have to we have a couple of the articles that the FIA f where I went in and did a little bit of

769
01:18:45,090 --> 01:19:04,320
interviews I think all the time as a manager like they actually tell you we're having compared to other web authors but kind of different conclusions.

770
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:11,879
Oh, yes, this one. I hate this. Okay. This is a guy that tries to say it's not really bad, right?

771
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,880
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

772
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:18,960
Oh, yeah. That's interesting. And this is a game here, I think.

773
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:22,250
I think so. I know you're hearing it.

774
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:29,580
Any return, especially in the medical exam room.

775
01:19:30,690 --> 01:19:36,150
So but I mean, I understand what you said. I think that's. Okay, so you're just going to discuss this?

776
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:39,930
Yeah. Well, so the idea that night is you have kind of two different conclusions from this,

777
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:45,450
from different data around the same event right now is that it's kind of a compare and contrast.

778
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:51,720
Okay. So you just you like much about the whole class?

779
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:59,010
Well, you know, I usually kind of think so when you think about an explanation.

780
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:04,970
Well, like, you know.

781
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:09,540
Yeah, so oftentimes we'll debrief or. Yeah, but I think that's what this is going to be discussed.

782
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:16,530
Yeah. I'm not sure I would say that this is an interesting discussion on this.

783
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:25,320
Yeah, this I actually realized I had a slide in this about this in my presentation last time because I thought it's too confusing,

784
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:29,760
but he's like, I'm getting a different idea. Yeah, I'm glad you're talking about it already.

785
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:38,720
Have a nice day instead of 15 minutes.

786
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:44,970
And you know what? Most of you know it is like, break it up.

787
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:52,709
That's there and it is nice. I think I get to do something other than actually a little bit steamed.

788
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:54,570
You talk like the first day.

789
01:20:55,140 --> 01:21:02,640
And so when I feel certainly one of the more comfortable like the first hour which we currently practice is often Dana just got

790
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:11,130
broad strokes like this is low level of whatever suicide or mental health or substance use or violence or something like that.

791
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:20,530
I go back to the expert, comes in and tells us something like the last minute, okay, cool discussion.

792
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:27,690
Very interesting because I mean, I made a question and I didn't have time.

793
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:38,790
So, you know, this you said is one of those in hindsight is when you say what is right time because you know, there's a difference.

794
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:43,470
My sister in there that came and seems a lot of appropriate view.

795
01:21:44,010 --> 01:21:53,430
Right. You're right. You know, I think the source also, it would just be a bit also I would say like right now, I think you're right.

796
01:21:54,330 --> 01:22:04,010
I think you're starting to really see I mean, in the areas where it's mostly like that, of course, it's iterator stuff.

797
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:12,150
Exactly. So I was like, Oh, well, one for the assignment though.

798
01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:22,460
There have been a lot of repetition on those sources so that in the US we've actually done mercury testing on this one.

799
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:32,660
This is when I was there, I did this all weekend because, you know, I notice that they're supposed to say readily, okay,

800
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:42,700
I'll get so it's they're not really right now, so it's not regulated and just making sure that there's some recording.

801
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:50,040
So let me know if there if there are different. But you know what that will say, especially for Africa though they are.

802
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:54,260
I maybe I just opened up here and I'm like I don't know what they give.

803
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:59,180
You have a super okay, these fish are okay.

804
01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:02,490
Try to avoid these fish because some of them have much higher.

805
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:10,940
But my fish is best, right? 64% for me because of my money.

806
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:16,370
Personal preference affects more kids.

807
01:23:17,150 --> 01:23:23,510
All right, folks, that yes, beneficial nature and that kind of thing.

808
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:36,360
Just the topics. Thank you. I know we have about 5 minutes or so left in class yet to assign readings for today.

809
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:40,430
I'm not going to ask how many people did the reading for their initial articles and reasons why.

810
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:44,690
I want to talk about these two articles is they're both published articles.

811
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:50,810
They are both from the University of Michigan go live. But they come to a very different conclusion.

812
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:58,820
And Dr. Goodrich is kind enough to hang around and have a discussion with us to get us to, quote unquote, I hate this article.

813
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:09,079
We might figure out what I want folks to take to about 10 minutes here, try to review this, these two articles and a battery.

814
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:13,280
And that's okay. If you read the abstracts, I think you're going to kind of get a gist.

815
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:17,840
Different methodologies, different populations, maybe different conclusions.

816
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:24,500
Now I just need a little bit of compare Nicorette. So if you've had a chance to look through them, maybe find something new.

817
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:29,780
But I've spent about 10 minutes in small groups or so, just refreshing.

818
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:34,940
And if it's easier we going to talk about this is different as a whole.

819
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:40,530
So some of your folks are 10 minutes and then maybe we can turn to a neighbor for a couple.

820
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:53,890
Outcomes is a sample. Yeah, sure.

821
01:24:56,200 --> 01:25:13,630
I hate it. Right.

822
01:26:41,510 --> 01:27:10,560
That was. Okay.

823
01:27:13,760 --> 01:30:26,650
No. But.

824
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:40,390
Scan for about two more minutes. I turn to a neighbor.

825
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:31,000
Right. Find a friend a very worst.

826
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:38,409
Maybe do a little jigsaw thing. If somebody read the one our the Gomez article and the other the guard article or whatever, you start away.

827
01:33:38,410 --> 01:33:43,600
But I think my big question here is if you were just one of those two articles,

828
01:33:44,230 --> 01:33:50,890
is it possible that you would think differently about the Flint water crisis and how much it's affecting people?

829
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:56,590
That's really surprising to me. Talk, discuss and we'll come back as a group.

830
01:33:56,980 --> 01:34:00,460
That's the bottom line. I'm sorry.

831
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:10,510
You know, I think you're right.

832
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:33,410
I mean, I think one of the stars is very helpful.

833
01:34:33,430 --> 01:35:03,940
N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A.

834
01:35:06,810 --> 01:35:12,950
But then, you know, it's just like there's just knives and.

835
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:16,970
I think they have done that because they did it, you know.

836
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:35,630
Yeah. What do you think? One minute you go out to the field destroying everything and ecological treasure or not.

837
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:41,160
I, like a lot of people, say they feel that way.

838
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:50,300
It's not as if you're trying something that isn't it?

839
01:35:50,570 --> 01:36:07,280
Yeah, that's what I was saying.

840
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:33,830
But he has a little bit of a voice there because there are a lot of things that, you know,

841
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:46,780
there are you can get as many times as I want us to just play the lottery about six months ago now.

842
01:36:47,630 --> 01:37:11,300
Right. You know, it's not like we're they go through the same thing every four years.

843
01:37:14,270 --> 01:37:19,290
So he's like the master of the relationship, you know?

844
01:37:19,290 --> 01:37:27,640
And so I think that he has been and this is what stands out.

845
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:32,990
They said, well. I don't know that that.

846
01:37:35,230 --> 01:38:09,800
I one. I was I was interviewing Sebastian because I wasn't going to hear about that on or about maybe it was always on here.

847
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:22,640
I think was not that many people really maybe.

848
01:38:25,370 --> 01:38:34,040
I don't know. I don't understand why people are not.

849
01:38:36,770 --> 01:38:42,850
Three incidents have occurred in recent years.

850
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:47,070
I know that I did not. I know. I know.

851
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:57,340
But I didn't know what was going on.

852
01:39:00,210 --> 01:39:22,650
When you feel like you're trying to go, you remember you said that, you know,

853
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:37,480
because people have been saying that it's just that, you know, this isn't exactly what happened.

854
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:48,750
It happened earlier. You were just on the field on Friday or anything.

855
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:53,210
All right, folks, I really hate to break up discussions and it sounds like there's plenty to say about it,

856
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:56,760
but we only have a few minutes left and we do have an expert here.

857
01:39:57,810 --> 01:40:02,310
What were you talking about? What did you notice? Yeah.

858
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:05,820
The convenient sample taken learn and. Okay.

859
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:10,290
Tell me a little bit more. Just. It's problematic. It's not a representative.

860
01:40:10,530 --> 01:40:16,330
It's not representative of the actual population. From that just good drawing from early here,

861
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:20,819
we were talking a little bit about whether you're actually drawing from just Flint or if that's because really is the only

862
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:27,060
kind of from a level one trauma center in that area you're going to be pulling from outside of potentially Flint as well.

863
01:40:27,810 --> 01:40:34,350
But why is that can be a sample problem from a drug related study.

864
01:40:35,970 --> 01:40:43,440
From another study, I've always said why? What's the concern about just giving a sample just in general is that it's not

865
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:48,980
representative of the population where they're trying to generalize it to go.

866
01:40:49,230 --> 01:40:50,130
Got it. Okay.

867
01:40:50,670 --> 01:41:00,030
Well, just to add to that, we also said that because they were reporting negative coping as using substances, but they were already in the study.

868
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:03,840
Right. For substances, substance use. Okay.

869
01:41:03,870 --> 01:41:09,990
So are we really attributing that to kind of a the effect of the water the water crisis?

870
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:17,910
What else are you talking about? I have a yeah, we we're we learned about the fun fruity.

871
01:41:18,450 --> 01:41:20,519
I'm sorry. The adjustment. Yeah.

872
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:30,209
What is a modify the adjustment because they specify their statistical analysis and then filters papers that they did a modified one.

873
01:41:30,210 --> 01:41:34,620
Not just an adjustment but a modified.

874
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:43,020
Oh, what does that mean? So my my guess is a straight bonferroni adjustment for like and a post is just taking your

875
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:46,950
p value of like 0.05 and dividing it by the number of tests that you're going to run.

876
01:41:47,130 --> 01:41:51,990
Yeah. A modified one is probably making a small correction either for the number of tests.

877
01:41:52,260 --> 01:42:00,540
So sometimes what you can do is kind of it's more of a a sequential adjustment that as you you have the what would it be?

878
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:05,759
So you would take the number of tests and divide point five by the number of tests that becomes your highest threshold.

879
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:12,750
Then you do a slight a make it a slightly less conservative test for the next adjustment and then so on and so forth.

880
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:18,420
So basically the first one might be a P-value of 0.001.

881
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:24,810
That's the kind of threshold you have to pass. But the second one might be 0.00 to 5 and then .005.

882
01:42:24,990 --> 01:42:29,550
So it gets a little bit easier to pass it. So that's the modification rather than just the rote.

883
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:33,980
It's everything divided by the number of tests. You, right? Okay. Thank you for explaining.

884
01:42:35,130 --> 01:42:38,430
If that was explaining to me, that's essentially what you're doing.

885
01:42:38,430 --> 01:42:41,850
It's a little it's a slightly less conservative test than the most conservative.

886
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:46,500
But it's funny you say it's slightly less conservative because they argue it's a more it's a conservative.

887
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:55,410
Well, and though I question with the introduction is like child behavior and then love exposure.

888
01:42:55,770 --> 01:43:02,999
It sounds strange to me that you started out with like aggressive behavior in children and, you know, kids being kids.

889
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,420
And then you end off the paper with what? Public health efforts have been enough.

890
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:11,370
And it's not actually an emergency. That's a really interesting conclusion.

891
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:14,970
Based on where you started, you never, ever thought of what you began.

892
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:21,080
It's a big conclusion. Yeah. Um, yeah, there's a lot wrong with this.

893
01:43:23,050 --> 01:43:26,430
First of all, like, what? What are the motivations? Why? That was the month.

894
01:43:26,850 --> 01:43:38,050
What to do, you know. Yeah, that's why I don't like I mean, I want women know the level, but it came out at a very specific time and it's, you know,

895
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:45,270
my doctor in Flint treating these people, you know, and the only thing that they're measuring is blood, blood levels.

896
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:48,630
They didn't measure symptoms reported or anything else.

897
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:57,600
And I think that was on purpose because, you know, it's going to confound a lot of their outcomes in the outcome of their study.

898
01:43:58,530 --> 01:44:01,610
There's a lot of common. Are people also being on Medicaid insurance?

899
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:04,970
I'm wondering if this doctor doesn't accept Medicaid insurance.

900
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:11,600
I'm like, I'm just questioning the ethics of this because there's a big conflict among demographics.

901
01:44:11,690 --> 01:44:18,980
You know, we looked at this. He doesn't have a biography on his page, so just give cards.

902
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:22,820
Oh, yeah. I was thinking, I don't I don't know this person, even though he's a U of M.

903
01:44:23,630 --> 01:44:30,650
And I remember when this came out, I was like, What do you mean, person writing something against the land prices?

904
01:44:31,070 --> 01:44:43,270
And I was very mad. But I can I think the only way I can think about it positively is if if they want to maybe make the community worry less,

905
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:44,959
that could be the only positive thing.

906
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:51,190
I think I could see motivation like saying like, look, there's actually other cities in Michigan that have more blood.

907
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:55,180
We're not worried about that. You're making them panic in Flint. That's really bad for them.

908
01:44:55,370 --> 01:44:59,880
You know, they'll probably be okay. So that could be a positive thing.

909
01:44:59,950 --> 01:45:06,630
But yeah, otherwise, I don't know. They're just like, Hey, let's also write an article about Led in Flint, you know, and you get a good one.

910
01:45:06,650 --> 01:45:13,370
I'm not sure. Yeah, I've always wondered about the motivation to write this, but.

911
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:19,440
Yeah, but also I was talking to Justin, you know, and like obviously about a Hanna-Attisha from the book where well,

912
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:24,050
she did her paper and her her comparison is more drastic, the difference in blood.

913
01:45:24,290 --> 01:45:29,239
But she's also kind of left across like certain parts of Flint like that, too.

914
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:31,790
So this just lumps everybody together really good.

915
01:45:31,790 --> 01:45:37,460
And there are certain kids in certain parts of Flint that still have like much higher exposures that you don't see here.

916
01:45:37,910 --> 01:45:44,840
But the way this analysis was done kind of is typical in witness to the the the critique.

917
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:49,579
There are two of them that I heard. It's going to be difficult to critique someone's motivations for approaching the study.

918
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:53,059
But when you do talk about some of the weaknesses in the design, like the control variables,

919
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:59,420
like the glossing over of what could be moderating factors, that is something that we can, I think, as science bring to the table.

920
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:06,140
For those of you who feel that the the critiquing the motivations is an adequate one or an important one,

921
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:11,299
I think positional restatements in our work can be very important. This is why I'm doing and conducting this research.

922
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:18,470
This is how I am approaching this question. This is these are the ways that I've run, analyzes or considered other analysis.

923
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:23,120
These are all things that are not standard practice in our field quite yet, but you are starting to see a little bit more of it.

924
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:24,799
So that would also potentially address that.

925
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:34,550
But I think as we start to find ways to support our own views, our own arguments, sticking a little bit to that science can be our best weapon,

926
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:40,610
particularly viewed through some of these thornier issues that could have underlying motivations or spaces where

927
01:46:40,610 --> 01:46:45,049
it's not so easy to tell what these data are really showing or why people are presenting it in such a way.

928
01:46:45,050 --> 01:46:49,370
We can speculate, we can try to reach out, but we might never know why this article was written.

929
01:46:49,370 --> 01:46:54,710
Was it prefer professional gain? Was it to make things less scary for those folks that were experiencing this?

930
01:46:54,980 --> 01:47:01,550
That's a difficult question to answer. We have a couple of any other comments in a couple of minutes here.

931
01:47:06,490 --> 01:47:10,380
Did you not want them? No, I didn't get it.

932
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:17,950
You love me as late as, like 60 seconds, 80 or something?

933
01:47:17,950 --> 01:47:21,249
I think they're still here at the university. What did you say? Same.

934
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:25,120
Same. You. There's. They're both from emergency medicine. These teams ready teams?

935
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:31,180
Oh, yeah, that's very interesting. Isn't that very interesting? Like you can tell them it's a tight knit.

936
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:39,700
It's probably a very tight knit department and there's probably a lot of different opinions about what happens in their patient population.

937
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:48,139
Yeah. Well, I mean, and it would be fun to kind of just in Taylor's article, it is this argument a little bit more.

938
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:53,060
But I mean, I see there's two very different approaches, different sort of measures that they're using.

939
01:47:53,240 --> 01:48:00,650
I mean, I could see it being easy to default to, oh, look at this one that has the bio physiological measures versus this is,

940
01:48:00,890 --> 01:48:05,420
you know, quality data collection or survey data collection. Where's the sample that's represented?

941
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:13,880
All of these could inform how we are, you know, promoting one voice versus another, using it to justify the kinds of interventions that we might do.

942
01:48:14,030 --> 01:48:20,990
Is this where we need to be dedicating resources to for litigation, or are there other spaces where perhaps it's more important?

943
01:48:21,230 --> 01:48:26,360
Is any lead exposure bad? So maybe if the gains not quite as much as are quite that bad.

944
01:48:26,570 --> 01:48:33,290
Are we still unhappy with the fact that there were increases in what period when we start to look at again some of the interactions with race,

945
01:48:33,830 --> 01:48:39,920
socioeconomic status, etc., are we still does that gloss over some things that we would miss if we did a population level survey?

946
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:46,570
You know, all little, little things that, you know, with a little more attention that we can start to pull out and make our case for.

947
01:48:46,850 --> 01:48:53,900
So you can use things like this as you develop your intervention. What does the existing science say about how people have approached these questions

948
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:58,580
and is it okay to have different approaches lead to different conclusions? Where do we go forward from there?

949
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:03,440
You know, what's the next study from this? Two different approaches, sort of different conclusions.

950
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:10,370
What would you do? Well, we had something that there was breadth of that.

951
01:49:12,410 --> 01:49:15,530
But where would you go? You know, that's what's kind of fun about this one.

952
01:49:15,930 --> 01:49:19,219
You know, I don't want to shortchange wonder too much.

953
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:22,700
Thank you all. Thank you. One more time to Dr. doing research. Do you want us to.

954
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:32,420
Everybody has a wonderful weekend. We will see you next Thursday where we will be talking about all radio falls.

955
01:49:32,470 --> 01:49:37,330
All right. We've all heard all this now.

956
01:49:38,450 --> 01:49:42,060
Just we're working and we're kind of all over the place.
