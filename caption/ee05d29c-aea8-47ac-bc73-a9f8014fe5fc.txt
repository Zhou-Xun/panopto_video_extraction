00:00:05,704 --> 00:00:08,070
Hi, good to see you again.

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,604
In this final segment of the module,

3
00:00:10,604 --> 00:00:16,730
let's discuss competency-based
human resources management.

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,760
I'm sure by far you had come to understand
that human resources management

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,910
plays a critical role in aligning
organizational values and

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,000
goal on the one hand, and
employee development on the other hand.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,625
Because without such an alignment,

8
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:41,385
organizations would forever be stuck
in a mire of mediocre performance.

9
00:00:41,385 --> 00:00:46,829
Competency based human resources
management has gained traction as more and

10
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,933
more organizations realize
the strategic importance and

11
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:54,270
function of human resources.

12
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,420
Many organization have now tried to
articulate the organizational goals and

13
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,410
values in terms of competencies.

14
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:08,210
So that their goals and values can be
embodied in human resource practices.

15
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,990
And also, their goals and

16
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:18,210
values can be understood by employees and
teams working within the organization.

17
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,741
They also use competency in
the recruitment, training,

18
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:27,641
appraisal, compensation, and
other personnel processes so

19
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:32,541
that they can align employee
performance with the performance

20
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:38,660
of organizations in light
of their goals and values.

21
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,482
So what is competency-based
human resources?

22
00:01:43,482 --> 00:01:47,514
Basically, it is to use
the notion of competency and

23
00:01:47,514 --> 00:01:52,555
the result of competency analysis
in recruitment, selection,

24
00:01:52,555 --> 00:01:57,321
employee development, reward,
and other major activities

25
00:01:57,321 --> 00:02:03,380
that we discussed in the previous
segment of this module.

26
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:09,070
Clear definition and understanding of the
notion of competency is very important.

27
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:14,440
in this sense, competency is
an underlying attribute of a person

28
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,520
that results in effective or
superior performance.

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,830
Competencies can also be
defined as skills and behaviors

30
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:31,590
that organizations expect their
employees to practice in their work.

31
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,047
In other words, the word
competency is focused on desirable

32
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:44,218
social behavior as well as the underlying
knowledge, skills, and attitude.

33
00:02:44,218 --> 00:02:48,604
It is generally believed
that adequate competency, or

34
00:02:48,604 --> 00:02:53,459
competencies, is a predictor for
individual performance,

35
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:59,372
as well as the performance
of organizations.

36
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:04,249
An example that is closely relevant
to you is the core courses

37
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:09,610
that all of you are required to take,
including this one.

38
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,176
All of the courses are designed
based on this competency concept.

39
00:03:14,176 --> 00:03:21,100
Competency can be organized
roughly into three buckets.

40
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,530
The first one is called
technical competencies,

41
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,170
which are what people have to know and
be able to do in terms of knowledge and

42
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:35,040
skills in order to carry
out the job effectively.

43
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,440
Technical competency could be generic,
meaning they are required for

44
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,870
set of similar jobs, positions, or roles.

45
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,460
For example, you as public health
professionals are expected

46
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:55,440
to know the history, structure, and
functions of the public health system.

47
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,480
You also need to have basic
knowledge of bio-statistics,

48
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,970
epidemiology, behavioral sciences,
and environmental hygiene.

49
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:11,392
Technical competency can also be specific
to a particular job or position.

50
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:17,340
If you're hired into a health
informatics position,

51
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:23,420
you will need programming skills and
be able to work with health data systems,

52
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:29,490
which are not competencies required for
other jobs and positions.

53
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,060
The second bucket of competency
is behavioral competencies.

54
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,300
They are behavioral expectations.

55
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,850
In other words, the types of behaviors
required to produce desirable results.

56
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:49,876
Examples can include teamwork,
communication, interpersonal skills,

57
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:55,280
leadership, decision making,
and problem solving.

58
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,910
They are sometimes called soft skills.

59
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,480
This competency are important for
employees at all levels.

60
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,828
Not just limited to the top or
middle levels.

61
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:14,650
One can argue that this competency
apply not just to career but

62
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,470
also to personal life as well.

63
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,618
They are the traits that everyone
of us need in order to be

64
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:26,760
successful in work as well as in life.

65
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,250
Last and definitely not the least,

66
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:35,080
emotional intelligence have
become a important competency.

67
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,527
Emotional intelligence means
the ability to identify,

68
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:43,602
assess, and
control the emotions of not just ours,

69
00:05:43,602 --> 00:05:49,960
but also the emotions of others,
and even groups.

70
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,533
It is important to emphasize that,
similar to technical and

71
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:57,675
behavioral competencies,
emotional intelligence can be learned.

72
00:05:57,675 --> 00:06:02,500
It's not something that you're born into.

73
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:10,690
It is believed that emotional
competency includes four abilities.

74
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,530
The first one is self-awareness,

75
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:20,190
meaning the ability to read our own
emotions and recognize their impact.

76
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:26,549
Second, self-management, meaning
the ability to control all emotions and

77
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:30,508
impulses and
be able to adapt to circumstances.

78
00:06:30,508 --> 00:06:36,516
Assert social awareness,
meaning the ability to sense,

79
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:41,910
understand, and react to others' emotions.

80
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:47,278
And finally, relational management,
meaning the ability to inspire,

81
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:53,160
influence, develop others,
and manage conflicts.

82
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,655
Now, if you pay attention to
the definition of emotional intelligence,

83
00:06:57,655 --> 00:07:04,180
you may feel daunted that this
is such a tall order to achieve.

84
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:11,036
But the good news is that emotional
intelligence can be practiced and learned.

85
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:14,710
The most important thing
is self-awareness.

86
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:20,090
If we have self-awareness, that is
a solid foundation for us to build on and

87
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:26,530
to develop other essential
skills as defined by scholars.

88
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:32,390
Unfortunately, most human resources
management models are focused on logic and

89
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,870
rationality.

90
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:39,010
But the truth is,
emotions permeate all aspects

91
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:45,540
of organizations because
organizations consists of people.

92
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:50,790
And because people, we,
are emotional animals.

93
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:55,810
So increasingly,
organizations are recognizing that

94
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,990
emotions are an integral part of work.

95
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,730
They drive performance.

96
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,043
They shape decision making and behavior.

97
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:07,472
And they affect creativity, leadership,

98
00:08:07,472 --> 00:08:12,910
teamwork, and
our ability to negotiate many conflicts.

99
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:17,330
Which is the topic the we'll
discuss in the next module.
