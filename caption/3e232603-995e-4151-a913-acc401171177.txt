00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hi. In this video,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,000
we will continue to work on the example that we had introduced to you in last class of the student entity and the advisory entity and creating

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
a one to many relationship between them and add a couple of other features to that which is going to be useful to you in the class tomorrow,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
which is Thursday, 4th of February 2021.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
OK. So what did we do? We created two entities, advisor entity.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is the design view. And we created a student entity.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is the features that we added, right?

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So we had a bunch of the attributes of the field, names of the entity and the data type itself, the constraints that we imposed upon them.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And we created a relationship between these two entities.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And this denotes, as we know, the one to many relationship or one adviser can have multiple students.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But one students can have just one adviser. And we enforce that.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
via the concept of referential integrity, which was one of the two rules we spoke about.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The first rule was entity integrity, which essentially means that all parts of a primary key have to be unique and cannot be null.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So as to ensure every instance from the entity can be uniquely identified.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And the other was referential integrity, which essentially means that all foreign keys.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They can be either null.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
As long as they are not part of a primary key of that table or they have to match the primary key of the table to which it's related.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So the student advisor id the field here.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So that was the foreign key of the student entity.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It could either be kept null or it had to be something from this existing list of adviser I.D. from the adviser entity slash table.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So we did that. And we also created two forms, which were essentially user interfaces to create new student instances, the new advisor instances.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And so we just walk through one more example. If I create, let's say, Juan Miguel.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And these instances have to be tonight. And all of them are sort of, you know, compulsory or required.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So I had to enter a specific advisor idea, right.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I could not enter sex because sex was not there in the adviser table, thereby showing you the concept of referential integrity.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So it had to be one of the existing entries. Right. Now, what's the problem with that?

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And that's the first objective of this video. The thing is that how many of us know what Arabize of ideas are when we create a news, an entry?

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We would I don't know when the load them by the last name or by their full name.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oftentimes, they're going to come in a dropdown table or dropdown list and we will select from that.

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So we will implement that concept here just to make this presentation or does database of an intuitive Dawe creation we can assume.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So the question is, how do we do that? So let's close this phone and move to the student design table design view of the entity.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And now we see that the student advisor is the data type is a number.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So I will use the feature of the lookup resort, which essentially, as the name suggests,

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
looks up from the existing list of options that you have from the advisor table

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and narrows the search only to those options or list when each of those options.

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So when I go to narrow lookup reserved, I see that I cannot change that the table, the field size, because this part of an existing relationship.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So that implies I close this table and I've got to delete that relationship. Yes, I go to did I use tools?

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I go to relationships. And I select this relationship here and I delete it.

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes, because I'll recreate that to ensure I can make it more intuitive.

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So once I deleted the relationship, I save it.

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I go with this. I go back to my student. Design view, and here I select the day that I as look up reser.

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So I want to look up. I want to look up here to get the values from another table, a query.

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So we go next. And the table that you want to look up, the values form is the advisor table next.

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And now, assuming we won the last name to be the dropdown list of advisers that you want to select from.

45
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Right. So let's select last name. In this selected field and we.

46
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah. So these are options that we have the three advisory last names that we had in our list and we finished this and we save it.

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What you will see is, however, here you still see the unit.

48
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I was. No. Because it's being saved still as the idea of the advisor, not the name of the adviser, but to the viewer or viewer.

49
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
When you create the new entry, you will see it as the last name.

50
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So is our job done now? We still have to create the relationship, remember, because the relationship is what we had deleted.

51
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Now we see that there is a relationship between the advisor and the student.

52
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It, however, is not the one to many relationship. It's just one relationship.

53
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So those sort of distinction is that there is still not the concept of referential integrity enforced here.

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And we spoke about what referential land and integrity are.

55
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So we check this box. OK.

56
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And now we should be done, hopefully. So let's close this.

57
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And now let's move on to creating. I think our student form is going to be the same to inform that was there before.

58
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So we have to recreate this student, inform someone to delete the student from here.

59
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes. And I'm going to create a new student form to sort of incorporate the genius that we have made of the design of the entity.

60
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And I will be using the student and go push all these guys here next and finish.

61
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Now let's create a new entry. So now.

62
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We see this entry. So our awesome weepie and we enter.

63
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So now you see that we have a list of the last names of the specific advisors is just you don't have to fill this one.

64
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's not a compulsory field.

65
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So that ensures the first half of the differential that it will satisfy could be now or it has to be any one of these folks.

66
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So Denise Anthony is the option that we have and we save it because it.

67
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Well, let's take a look at what is there in the student table. And this is how you will see the options.

68
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And you also see that that's what happens to the other entries.

69
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They get updated to reflect what was the corresponding student advisor I.D. for those entries in the student entity.

70
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So this essentially makes makes this sort of concept pretty intuitive.

71
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You as a you as an end user who has to make additions or modifications to the database.

72
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You just see what's relevant to you as opposed to, let's say, what's internally an administrative I.D. used for advisors or students.

73
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
There could be multiple advisers with the same last name.

74
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You have an option where you could look up as a kid.

75
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If I go back to the design view, if you remember, we had made it as one.

76
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Come on. This the last thing I could do the same thing was as to last names.

77
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So let's look at the advisor, that example. So if I create.

78
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Should, yeah. I'm going to oh, this is not an existing adviser,

79
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
but we have many Sagrera and we have Denise Anthony and I'm sort of just mixing those names up to demonstrate this example.

80
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So I create this. And now when I go to mine, student form.

81
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll have to call these guys up. Wouldn't be here.

82
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And then I go to my student farm. And when I go to a new entry, you see, I.

83
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:29,000
72 interesting. What do I got?

84
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh, see, I have two Anthonys here. Right. And that could be a problem.

85
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So what you could do is you could create when I was creating the look up wizard, as opposed to just one entry,

86
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
which is the last name I could have, the last name on the first name as my dropdown options.

87
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And let's quickly create that Bush and not be happy to do that. But I'm going to just quickly make that option as well as the latest record.

88
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes. And let's close this wooden table, can we?

89
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So I think we might have to recreate a relationship again that we had.

90
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So we delete this relationship. Yes.

91
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And we come to the student table design view again.

92
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's make it look up next. Next one.

93
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The first name I want, the last name. Next.

94
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Next. And I will finish. Yes.

95
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So I created that. And now I do the same thing.

96
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I. This is the foreign Kikhia. I bring a towel. I enforce referential integrity.

97
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I create the one to many relationship. Let's close the relationship and we save it.

98
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And now when I go to my student entry.

99
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yes. So I see the first name on the last. OK.

100
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So this is how we make our table a bit more intuitive. So with this, I'll end this video.

101
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:35,851
And let's come back to the second video where we will talk about relationship types.
