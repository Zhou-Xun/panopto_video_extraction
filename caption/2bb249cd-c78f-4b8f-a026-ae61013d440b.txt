00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,760
This class is offered me tremendous insight into the state of climate change and climate justice

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,830
in today's world and thinking back to the first week of class and taking the six Americas quiz,

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,300
I was not surprised to find out that I fell in the alarmed category,

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,060
but I was concerned to see that only 26 percent of fellow Americans were classified that way as well.

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,020
It's evident based on the materials in this course that humans are altering the patterns of Earth's climate.

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,630
And further, it's evident that these patterns dramatically impact marginalized communities,

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,490
even though these communities contribute the least to the problem and that's globally, not just nationally.

8
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:45,090
And to be candid, one of my biggest challenges I have when it comes to engaging in climate change or climate justice discourse is my cynicism.

9
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:52,440
It seems as though at every turn, no matter how much proof we present, we continuously fail to get the support that we need for strong climate

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,170
positive policies and adaptations that would protect ourselves from this issue.

11
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,680
The results of the Six Americans quiz reinforces that cynicism for me a little

12
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,900
bit to think that nearly 25 percent of the country falls in the disengaged,

13
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,980
doubtful or dismissive category. It's a bit disheartening, and frankly,

14
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,180
I kind of have to assume that that number is underrepresented because I imagine many

15
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,770
folks who deny climate change would not participate in a climate change survey.

16
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,330
But nonetheless, this class has made it clear to me that as public health professionals,

17
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:30,740
we can't abide by that cynicism and just give up if we're committed to principles such as health equity and social justice.

18
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:35,600
And there's no debating that climate change is a justice issue and must be treated as such.

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,150
And Public Health already looks at health disparities related to access to health care, built environment,

20
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:48,200
quality, food education, income, and that's the same framework we need to apply when addressing climate change.

21
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,090
I also really enjoyed the opportunity in this class to dove deep into a specific environmental

22
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,940
justice issue that was and is impacting a community from my hometown of Kalamazoo.

23
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,160
Being that it literally hits close to home,

24
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:08,900
I think it made climate justice a more tangible issue to me instead of just this ambiguous, unsolvable problem.

25
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,330
And I think this course is also a bit of a double agent.

26
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:17,870
It's clearly an environmental health course, but I think it's fair to say it's also a communications course in disguise.

27
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:24,350
The assignments had us use a wide array of different communication strategies to convey the same message to different audiences,

28
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:30,050
and being able to communicate climate justice issues adequately to everyone from legislators to laypeople

29
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:35,840
is key in garnering the support we need for the policies that would help address climate change.

30
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,460
And this class has been immensely helpful in that regard. So I'm very grateful to have taken this course.

31
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:46,990
I appreciate Professor Charles's ability to inspire me to incorporate environmental justice into my public health vernacular.

32
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,691
And thanks again, I'm looking forward to graduation.
