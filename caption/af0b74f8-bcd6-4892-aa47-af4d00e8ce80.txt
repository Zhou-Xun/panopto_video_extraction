1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:13,290
Okay. So, yes, so last time we talk about the phone, the Internet arrival time and then the arrival time distribution, and so the entire arrival time,

2
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:24,150
remember that for standard reports on process, we use this equivalence relationship between the state space event versus the random time.

3
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:32,180
Given that when we establish the four standard person process, the interval time will be II,

4
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:42,060
the exponential longer distributed for the arrival time but only study of the conditional distribution.

5
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,220
So elimination of a single event occurred in a time interval.

6
00:00:47,580 --> 00:01:01,170
We know it's the arrival time is uniformly distributed in this interval, so it's very important to distinguish what is interpreted as arrival.

7
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:12,390
So today we're going to use this for a different type of the problem before that where we're talking about thinning of the force on process.

8
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:24,980
So this started being a variant of simplifying process, some calls.

9
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,689
So later on we're going to have a lecture on generalization of a person.

10
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:40,260
So this is already a special case. So this is some of the process build upon on the focus on process.

11
00:01:41,100 --> 00:02:02,520
And so the definition of this is we have an overall person process and I've seen our whole song process say and he went through a lot of that.

12
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:15,270
So the difference here is we're going to suppose each of the event can be classified into a SOP type subtype.

13
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:23,310
Okay. Now in the person process, every event, are this the same time?

14
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,620
We don't say there's a difference there, different difference between humans.

15
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,520
We just generally say events occur, right and the event occurred.

16
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:40,139
Those event are considered to be the same time, but you can't further classify those event into different types.

17
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,470
Right.

18
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:52,739
For example, if later on we have first a death process so you can consider a birth event and now you can consider a male birth versus a female birth.

19
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,710
So that's even it's the birth. The new subtype is example applications.

20
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:24,300
So suppose each event can be classified into a type II.

21
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:43,330
So possible types are one, two, two and three and types of event with probability and a probability.

22
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:54,830
APL by I obviously in summation I put one, two and five one and so that means they're mutually exclusive.

23
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,320
If you're classified into white, then you can't be classified into that event, type two event.

24
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:08,160
And as I'm not, I'm in all of these, the classification probabilities have to have one.

25
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,580
So this is basically all these events are mutually exclusive.

26
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:29,160
So now there is a natural interest to consider this induced evolution and types of the different stochastic process.

27
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,830
So this is a called the thinning of the pool, some process that now we can consider.

28
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:42,070
So what about and given this is our assumptions.

29
00:04:49,970 --> 00:05:11,230
This is the point of interest. And I, um, the amount, the counting process of pie pies.

30
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,310
But, um.

31
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:29,480
Right. So we're interested to figure out what is the, what is the property or what exactly is that a 90.

32
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,600
You see, the last month or so you find you're.

33
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:03,800
So this is this type of the problem is known that sort of fending off a Paulson process you've got overall Paulson process,

34
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,430
but the composition of who you want to see is.

35
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:19,550
And different types of you find them that you want to look into each individual not only but that's not nice the finding of the person process.

36
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:30,190
So. So we know the only random variable case.

37
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:36,429
If you have right random variables you can put on a random variable has this

38
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:43,300
property if you add the up is called a super position of a person random variable.

39
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:53,110
The sum skew is a force. All right. It's basically trying to contain different types of single time point a steal person.

40
00:06:53,320 --> 00:07:01,350
And then the opposite of this, it's kind of a deconvolution or that decomposition, it's all a little bit like this, the thinning of the poor song.

41
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,390
So obviously the hypothesis is saying the 90.

42
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:21,990
Our independent person.

43
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:40,080
So we we I don't think we rigorously define independence between the stochastic processes, but the idea is similar.

44
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:49,440
Right. So from a does intuitively that means they don't share information.

45
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,509
But you can always using this conditional from all of these saying, for example,

46
00:07:54,510 --> 00:08:02,690
that if he doesn't own one, he doesn't depend on any information of the type to event.

47
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:11,100
For example, P two, which is the main characteristic of the type two events and then three so on, so forth.

48
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,969
But so that means this independent part.

49
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,480
We need to pay attention trying to improve this.

50
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,140
And then second thing is they are also post process.

51
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,290
Can we show that right?

52
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:34,880
So how do we show a process? Is a process on. As always, go back to the definition.

53
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,860
So we know that for some definitions, then let's just check it.

54
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:45,080
So that 9090 is at the time zero.

55
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:49,430
What is a column of the type, mind you,

56
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:58,400
but it's always been zero because the overall event is zero as a composition of the overall event, it has to be zero.

57
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:05,870
It's a constant process. Plus, we do we have independent increment.

58
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:20,120
Again, independent increment means if the two types of events occur in two,

59
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:27,920
then overlapping time intervals there are supposed to be independent or you need to assert their independence or not.

60
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,410
So those are also properties inherited from the overall process, right.

61
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,340
Is the overall process have independent increment.

62
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,770
Now you can argue with the individual event being a Type II or so.

63
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:48,830
They are not all not correlated in any way, not dependent any way.

64
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:55,580
So if you focus on specific type of event, there also should be you should also have independent increment.

65
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,650
The same thing you can argue for stationary increment.

66
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:17,610
Basically saying they increment doesn't mean plans are as far the interval is fixed this one stationary increment.

67
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:25,770
So this one happened to be it's all trivial to to show because later on when I relax that

68
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,580
and now you will immediately find out station or increment there is no longer on hold.

69
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:40,709
But in this case there is a easy way to arguable the station increment is satisfied for even for a

70
00:10:40,710 --> 00:11:00,420
night for that specific and partially because of that i the p t is vii is constant or with respect.

71
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,170
So there's this classification. Probability is a constant.

72
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,510
That makes it a stationary increment still valid.

73
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:26,900
Okay. So. So next few things is.

74
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:40,630
So the key thing is the DNA. So we need to show this and the probability that h.

75
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:48,100
So the probability of anni h. So the for the small window h goes to zero.

76
00:11:49,660 --> 00:12:01,330
How we find out the and the the marginal distribution for this small window event still follow that linear approximation.

77
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,840
Right. So this needs a little bit more.

78
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:20,110
And now we're showing it here. So remember there is the food distribution, but this is using the old age approximation.

79
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:31,620
You only need to argue two conditions, but in this case we're going out first to our people and we show.

80
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:39,130
What about the probability? I say I age where there are equal to two.

81
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:51,400
So it's within the time interval age. So this one is has to be less than or equal to a probability and h less are equal to two.

82
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,980
Right. Because that's the overall event occurred.

83
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,060
So that counts more than the I. This is the part.

84
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:08,980
This is the whole. Yes. Should the inequalities in the probabilities be the same or are they supposed to be flipped?

85
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,670
Uh oh, that's right.

86
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,840
You know, there's so many. Yes.

87
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,800
Thank you. So this is a part of this.

88
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:31,709
So this is always true. And this one is always this one greater than or equal to zero again.

89
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:46,620
So this implies the probability and ih0, it's also in 0h20h.

90
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,290
All right, so there's a half done next.

91
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:05,610
So this is of, um, let's say this is the ABC was the d doesn't matter for the order B we probably need a linear thing.

92
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:11,520
So what about the probability and I h equal to one.

93
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,719
All right, how to calculate this again?

94
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:29,320
This is more interval we could always do is again thinking about the this is a stop event of the overall person process.

95
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,239
So we need to get the overall pulse on processes involved.

96
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:47,250
And so what we can do is compute this probability and by being equal to one, conditional on the right, conditional on more information.

97
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:55,020
So this is a total expectation law. The probability is the same as the expectation.

98
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:00,750
And in this case, now you just need to consider what is the probability.

99
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:14,840
And I actually to one well and they actually go to zero and multiply by probability the other zero so nothing happens.

100
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:20,970
If nothing happens, how could the supplement occur? So that means this problem, conditional problem has to be there.

101
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,470
All right.

102
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:36,120
The second thing is, what is the nature equal to one conditional on an h equal to one, and then multiply by the probability of H equal to one.

103
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:50,220
So first for this one. So you see, you know, y event occurred, what is the probability that y you is sub by the subtype i.

104
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,120
By the definition, supposed to be the pie. That's exactly the classification.

105
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:02,200
So the classification probability is exactly this conditional.

106
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,340
If I know what event occurred, that's a subtype.

107
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,830
That's a type five. And that's exactly this. That's pie, right?

108
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:17,590
So this is a pie. And then what about this h equal to one?

109
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:21,760
So I claim that's a lot of h0h.

110
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:28,420
All right. So this one, you go through this and then we're not done yet.

111
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:37,130
We need to keep computing for the other possible.

112
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:43,100
And they should. But odds are you can't see.

113
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,050
So the last thing as you can write, though.

114
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:58,780
Oh, I forgot to write. Your offices are supposed to place, right?

115
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,520
So you could keep counting the probabilities.

116
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:10,180
I think she put two and two equals one.

117
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:20,290
Sorry. H green rises to multiply by the probability of a non-issue.

118
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,990
That completes the whole expectation.

119
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:33,130
Right. So this one, you don't need to figure out what that exactly is.

120
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:42,370
I'm pretty sure that there is some number, but you what you know is the first the term is a valid probability and so bound by zero one.

121
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,600
The second term is a ohange. So that whole thing is opaque.

122
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:56,850
So that means of. So this whole thing implies the probability which.

123
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,800
One is a fully long API time, age plus old age.

124
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:12,150
If you combine all the old age together, so the pi times old age is also a wager.

125
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:17,440
And so you combine all the old age, you still get old age back.

126
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:28,560
So we pass. And then the ones where we're all on the very top of the board, an age where you could get to this age.

127
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,210
So that's sufficient to show this age these.

128
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,640
The pie, pie, the survivor and the counting process is also important.

129
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:53,500
Right. So. Well, if you'd like, you can also show a probability of h equals zero is one minus h.

130
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:03,750
H. You can do the similar calculation or you just doing, but using the rules and all the probabilities have.

131
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:10,540
I have to add up to one. So this is have to either the case one minus one h.

132
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:17,379
Nevertheless so all this process the independence between the other event and it's

133
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:25,920
also showing here this an I h is not depending on any properties of the other u,

134
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,959
but there is no p one.

135
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,400
Well, there's no not anything coming from the other type of the U.

136
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:43,690
But there are four of you also showing the stochastic process is the sort of for the soft events or the type different types of event.

137
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,800
They don't share information, right?

138
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:56,110
Then when we say information usually refers to unknown parameter, the lambda is no, don't considered to be sharing information.

139
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,590
So that's approve of the thinning of the force on. Okay.

140
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,730
So that's pretty straightforward.

141
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:16,260
But also the whole thing is trying to demonstrate if you have at this point, at least if you want to show something as a force process,

142
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:23,730
what you need to do is just checking the definition, which contains of the five assumptions.

143
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:33,990
Three of them are kilovolt. Two of them are trying to define the the marginal distribution of an H.

144
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:41,960
Right. On the age equal to zero and reach equal to one supposed to be greater than us.

145
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:49,790
This simple linear and then over an inch greater equal to two can be written just as the old age.

146
00:20:51,950 --> 00:21:01,070
But any questions? If not, we're going to move it more to a more difficult case.

147
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:10,290
So let's. So this the second type of the problem has the similar flavor.

148
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:23,410
So we are also going to have the types of events, but in this case, with the classification probability, it's going to be time dependent.

149
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:38,050
Right. So we know if that event occurred in the different time points, the classification probability is going to be different.

150
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,340
So this is a really that's the key difference.

151
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:48,790
That's just and then this is a call a sudden falling off, a plus on process.

152
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,630
Although some polling.

153
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:17,960
So in this case, you can view that. We can view the passing on the finishing of the song, but pay attention to classification.

154
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:47,760
Probability is a function of time and so i i type y the event.

155
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:57,810
It's time. I.

156
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,280
It's given by its p.

157
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:14,240
Y. So we make the API no longer constant over the time,

158
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:23,930
but making the ys is a parameter right to with different you can to read this up to the different time points,

159
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:30,290
you may get different answers of the pie one obviously.

160
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:44,030
We have the constraint on the one to DIY one for y.

161
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:48,020
Read the URL or equal to zero. So for all the y.

162
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:54,180
So this has to be true because the events are still mutually exclusive.

163
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,600
You still want the mutual fund that all the events are mutually exclusive.

164
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:07,280
So. Even then, the particular classification probability is time dependent.

165
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,110
The constraints remain the same. They need to add up to one and the endpoints.

166
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:29,780
All right. So. So you think now you can still consider an idea, but it's no longer a out process.

167
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:34,640
You can think of which particular property is violated.

168
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:40,700
Okay. So so the a90 is not no longer a plus on the process.

169
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:54,470
Um, I kind of the Hindu is one of the global property get violated on this so there's a time dependance so that seems kind of relevant to the,

170
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:01,580
the stationary increment. Um, it's no longer a standard pause on process.

171
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:10,100
So next lecture we'll talk about, um, homogeneous was on process and we can revisit this problem before today.

172
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,940
What we need to figure out is the marginal distribution of online, how we figure all this.

173
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:28,790
So instead of figure all the whole process, um, well, you just need to figure out for the marginal distribution of a number run the variable a 90.

174
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:40,500
So the claim is this one. I tease our person around the variables with the mean.

175
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:57,370
0ttiy de y right?

176
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:04,400
So this is more complicated, but toward the end when we finish the derivation.

177
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:24,410
It's become clear why that's. This other the other thing is all these different types of events are independent.

178
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:30,630
I see that right there. But we cannot. We're going to prove that point.

179
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:36,020
That's what. All right.

180
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,180
So how do we show this? Essentially all you need to show.

181
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,129
This is about sinkhole. Single random variable. You only need to show it.

182
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:53,150
The probability mass function is a poor song. Calls the poor song for us enough.

183
00:26:54,590 --> 00:27:01,790
And in this case, because there is a you know, you need to connect to the overall whole song process.

184
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:06,850
We still view that the overall the process still poor song just like the sending off the poor song.

185
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:12,370
It is just that the classification probability becomes time invariant, right?

186
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:31,630
So let's consider if we can. So if this is true, then what we can do is show why people want them to this to it all the way up to an anti am.

187
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,070
I think I use the case in the lecture notes. So now we have key types rights.

188
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,150
Okay. So those same can be factorization.

189
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:56,590
So if I'm like each of this factories, the density of the probability mass function follows the force.

190
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,920
So. So that's the idea.

191
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:08,650
If you have all of these and the events occur by the time t so at the time t you are basically counting for each stop you balance.

192
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:14,670
Okay, I'm done trying to see what is the joint probability.

193
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:30,170
So how do we do this? So what we can do is simply again, the idea is this one is a follow up event.

194
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:36,620
We need to put more information on and I'm trying to compute, trying to connect explicitly compute,

195
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:44,720
connect to this probability statement to the overall persona about which we know the property pretty good.

196
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:53,100
So again, we're going to use the total expectation law in this case by conditional on the following.

197
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:18,220
So this set remain the same. That's conditional on the summation I want to k and I t equal to.

198
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:39,350
All right, so let's so the summation of this alliance is going to be the total violence occurred by the time t in the overall impulse on K right.

199
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:51,860
And then multiply by the probability and T okay.

200
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,849
So this will be true because this is the same total expectation law and just conditional

201
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:05,569
on t and only one valid unty value will result in this conditional probability.

202
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:12,080
It's not zero, right. If you have your anti take of any value.

203
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:20,850
Other than this, some of the results in the conditional probability will be zero, right?

204
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,210
Because by the definition, this is a total event.

205
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,220
This is a mutually exclusive subtype event.

206
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,030
The subtype that events add up has to be the total number of events.

207
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:40,600
So if it's totally valid for 2012, as long as it's not equal to this, the conditional probability will be zero according to this.

208
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:48,249
And the only thing I need to multiply is this. But the other way to argue is that you can further condition that.

209
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:52,300
You can marginalize the total until you get the same results.

210
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,320
This is easy to calculate. We have the overall plus argument.

211
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:01,690
The thing is about this. What about an T?

212
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:10,030
So now you know the anti equals this what is what about each stop events occur have this sort of unwanted equal to only

213
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:22,090
one and two to equal to into and okay right conditional you have overall what you want you go to the total ensemble this.

214
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:42,680
All right. So think about it. This is an all the trivial problem and it's a different types of problem.

215
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:50,780
Right. It's not necessarily thinking about the stochastic process is, you know, the sum is unknown and then each other.

216
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,460
So this should remind you of some sort of polynomial, some points.

217
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,209
All right. Although the answer may not necessarily be multi normal,

218
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:09,710
but it's you could if you could show the overall event it's I say began and now we can solve each of the events.

219
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:18,230
Got some pull that with a fix the probability and this the conditional probability part is indeed a multi formula.

220
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:19,590
Right.

221
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:30,560
So the overall event there are overall there are three which just trying to use the different let's say ten events occurred and then the first event,

222
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,490
first type of event, this one second type event is two.

223
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:39,500
So certain type of event is seven. What is the distribution, right?

224
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:45,350
So that so those are you can formulate that as a more multi normal.

225
00:32:45,830 --> 00:33:06,050
But the thing about this is you need to figure out so the conditional probability can be connected to two or a multi normal distribution.

226
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:13,550
I mean just right not exclusively so conditional.

227
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:42,980
And can we formulate some probability in multiple distribution in a multi.

228
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:57,839
So you need to identify that multi normal distribution. So the multi normal distribution is basically saying, you know, what is the probability?

229
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:08,430
I sample a nine. All right. So that is p of my corresponding apl fi.

230
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:15,060
Here is the probability event.

231
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:25,410
It's I if I sample event, but in this time interval that you run I conditional on.

232
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:32,160
Um. So I do not have s they find.

233
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:44,760
The final thing, I would say Mrs. Abbas is in zero.

234
00:34:50,840 --> 00:35:01,040
Right. Think about this. This is the probability of a, you know, the polynomial usually that we use a dice, sort of a concept, a two.

235
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:12,470
You know, to model this story. I'm a mom. So if they show the face, I then the conditional along you know,

236
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:21,620
the arrival time it's below in this zero t so if a band occurs in that, what is the probability that you buy this type?

237
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:31,560
So we need to calculate this. If we figure out PI for all of these events, then the conditional probability is simple a multi normal, right.

238
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:36,110
So the key is calculate this. All right.

239
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:42,860
So we're getting closer to the to the assumptions, but not exactly.

240
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:51,230
All right. So we know arrival time is going to be in zero T and then what is the probability of event this time?

241
00:35:51,770 --> 00:36:02,780
All right. What we know, the information, what we know is if the probability is I if it tell me exactly.

242
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:12,940
What the event occurs. So you need an exact time and under what conditions on is just simply arrival time in the interval.

243
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:21,350
So you see the disconnection, but if you see that this connection is also make the whole thing easier so you can imply the power all.

244
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,640
Right by conditional on more things to compute this things, right.

245
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:33,920
So then what we do is just using the power of probability.

246
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,850
And I know I'm gonna conditional on more information.

247
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:49,320
Let's say as small as and as zero.

248
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:57,410
And then we conditional. Well, we need to get back to the original form.

249
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,230
So just as belongs to zero.

250
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:14,969
Yeah. All right, so you have a linear expectation computed with respect,

251
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,710
more information so that more information is we're going to say we know exactly

252
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:26,090
if we know exactly what that as is the assumption already telling you that's P.

253
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:50,570
S so so the inverse probability is expected about so you know this API that's at that and it's not t.

254
00:37:53,300 --> 00:38:02,570
If this makes sense. Right. So that in there, if there is a event is I is occurring to the US and that has to be also the zero teeth on this piece.

255
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:15,670
Yeah. So it's step by step. It's supposed to. All right, now, um, so this, you know, the.

256
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:23,450
So the key thing is turning to this taller wall to try to compute this.

257
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:35,510
And then you should convince yourself that the expectation you should give the exact piece and this one is as belongs to additional.

258
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:40,560
So the answer is a random variable here.

259
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:49,550
That's yourself. Is everything all right? So think about the P as is just a integration of all possible arriving time.

260
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:55,070
Right. So the assets are random variable here and now we need to figure it out.

261
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:07,000
But given the event occurred during zero on T is a poor song process, what is the distribution of the arrival times?

262
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:12,230
Right. So to be able to calculate this, you need to know that.

263
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:18,600
The distribution is a uniform distribution at the arrival time.

264
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:26,300
So that means once the expectation is simply high as follows.

265
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,820
02t. One over t.

266
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,710
Yes. See if I got this right.

267
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:43,490
You know what? I got it right. So easy.

268
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:50,330
Yeah, yes. Yes. Okay.

269
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:55,670
So feel very good about this. So this is gave us the pie.

270
00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:03,020
The the multi normal sampling probability that even is I conditional on the arrival time

271
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:12,560
in zero t is this quantity that is pretty close to actually India in the off searches.

272
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:21,560
And we have time. Oh, I think now the rest of these are pretty straightforward.

273
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:30,920
So you have pie is defining them, I think.

274
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:49,350
Let's say the p i t so this is the if you roll dice the dice landed on the face i is this probability one over t0tti as the as.

275
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:58,340
Okay. I don't know if you have still have the original conditional probability.

276
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:12,510
But so this is the conclusion we're getting to the I'm so thinking about the

277
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:21,120
the overall joy and probability of life and to t so let me write this way.

278
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:27,930
So the probability of one or two in one opportunity.

279
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:32,100
Okay. Okay.

280
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:37,860
So we, we factor this into the two parts. One is the multi normal distribution.

281
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:45,140
So that's the summation of I. You could be one.

282
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,420
Okay. So. Okay.

283
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:55,640
So this is dumb. So I'm trying to write a one.

284
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:02,200
I prefer to think. I love the view.

285
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:07,840
One to the other, 1 to 2 and to.

286
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:19,090
Okay. Okay. So this part is the conditional probability.

287
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:26,370
Right. So each of these conditional on the overall event is summation of the okay nine.

288
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:36,940
So you got this. And now we also have the the probability of a nine equal to the summation equal to 20.

289
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:51,460
So that is e that's a for something about the powerful E to the longer t on the C summation of the nine divided by summation of factorial.

290
00:42:51,730 --> 00:43:01,030
So, so you have a multi normal probability mass function multiply by that one come

291
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:06,280
from the put the overall plus on you that there's total number of about money,

292
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,330
but then you get some concentration here, here.

293
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:15,130
And then you could split the lambda.

294
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:27,070
Um. P So next they just reorganize this and that make you make it easier to identify the conclusion.

295
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:34,750
So I put all of these i's together. So you're going to get into that long, the API.

296
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:45,490
P because the lambda t equal to a long time summation.

297
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:50,890
Um, I. All right.

298
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:58,420
We did show the overall summation of the pi also adds up to one individually at any time.

299
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:01,540
The last one, the p t is that integral.

300
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:06,130
Right. The average over the. The uniform distribution.

301
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,760
But. But they should add up to one. So this one summation.

302
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:17,170
Summation is one. And then you get the factorial, the common function come from here.

303
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:22,570
And for l multiply by lambda.

304
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:27,300
So you get the lambda. Somewhere right here.

305
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:41,910
And then you can also get on the P.I. Okay.

306
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,870
I'm the API. Come from here to the end.

307
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,160
Okay, then you multiply those things together by 41 to.

308
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:58,290
Okay, that is if you reorganize this.

309
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:02,400
So this is not necessarily going to be fair.

310
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:09,930
And just showing you this is you can split this. This is the results.

311
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:17,100
And on this results you can factories it into just basically K different Poisson

312
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:23,790
probability mass functions right so each that means two things each of this.

313
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:37,270
A 19 follow up for song distribution. And then because the take the product the product, the form means they are also independent of each other.

314
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:44,060
They. Well, we are over the time.

315
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:48,800
I could give a little bit recount next time just go through the overall logic.

316
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:54,460
But this is the most important. Okay.

317
00:45:55,750 --> 00:46:07,250
I'll see everybody on Wednesday. Yes.

318
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:12,240
Be. All.

319
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:46,440
Mean, you know that the release of violence just seconds away, I was like, I saw that.

320
00:46:47,400 --> 00:47:07,230
Yeah, that was the last thing that you want to remember.

321
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:15,090
The New York Times.

322
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:26,250
It's not like that, but it's yeah, they're somewhere.

323
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:42,440
Someone took yours. Let's go outside. I think you owe this one.

324
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,010
That's your salary. It's not your.

325
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,610
400 and.
