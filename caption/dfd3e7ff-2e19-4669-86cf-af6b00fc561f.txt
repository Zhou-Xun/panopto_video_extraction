1
00:00:01,339 --> 00:00:08,629
All right. Hello, everybody. I'm sorry for the slight delay here.

2
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:16,079
While you're all getting settling. I've been doing some emergency surgery on my slides.

3
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:22,489
I don't know if anyone's used pole everywhere before, but I think I should have been a little thrown off by their tagline.

4
00:00:22,499 --> 00:00:28,189
60% of the time works every time. Total failed today, but I think I've fixed it so fingers crossed.

5
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,109
We'll go ahead and get started. Welcome. For those of you here for public health 514, you're in the right room.

6
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:38,549
Anybody who here for another class, you're welcome to stay. But this is not your class.

7
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:43,289
So we're just going to dive in a little bit of an orthodox fashion here.

8
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:49,799
And what I'm going to do to get us started is have you run through a series of seven questions here?

9
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,549
And so I've got a poll everywhere is built in for each of these.

10
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:59,999
What I'd love to do is give you all about 60 seconds or so to think about each question that I'll pose to you.

11
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:06,989
I encourage you to turn to the person next to you and maybe run by some options there and then go into poll everywhere.

12
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:10,169
And I'd love to see what the classes are overall thoughts are.

13
00:01:10,169 --> 00:01:14,639
And so without further ado, we'll go ahead and get started a couple minutes late here.

14
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:25,139
And my first question to you is name a chemical, a biological and a physical stressor that you might encounter in the environment.

15
00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:28,979
So again, go ahead, think about that. Talk to your neighbors.

16
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:33,569
And then we've got a poll going on and it looks like some of you have already popped in there.

17
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:38,009
And so please pop into the poll and let's populate this with your thoughts.

18
00:01:38,009 --> 00:02:14,789
Go ahead. Also as usual, I think if you want to put multiple words in a response, I think you need to put an underscore or a dash between them.

19
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:50,159
All right, so the responses are flowing in here. Please keep them coming. I'll save this word Cloud.

20
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,659
One thing I'm going to try not to take personally is right up at the top here.

21
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:58,948
You keep seeing our Neitzel appear. My you miss idea I. I am not a stressor.

22
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:04,049
I promise. I'm your friend. I'm your ally. You'll grow to learn that over the course of the semester.

23
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:11,549
So in terms of more conventional stressors, all the things I'm seeing on here, someone's entered your mom,

24
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:20,608
and that's maybe borderline things like COVID 19, things like lead pollution, smoke, carbon dioxide.

25
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:23,999
This classroom, which I 100% agree on.

26
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:31,409
Musculoskeletal problems each pylori which is linked to ulcer formation.

27
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:40,468
We got things like cortisol on here. So one of the distinctions I'm going to make over the course of the semester is stressors

28
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:45,119
basically are things from an environmental health perspective that come from outside the body.

29
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:49,708
Cortisol is a response. So that's an indicator of some of you.

30
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:53,579
At least one of you clearly knows in terms of physiological stress.

31
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:57,599
So that's an indicator of stress, but it's not a stressor all by itself.

32
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:05,279
Again, lots of answers flowing in here. We've got things like smog, PM 2.5 or particulate matter 2.5.

33
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:09,268
Chlorpyrifos, high fructose corn sirup, radon.

34
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:14,729
So you're all absolutely on the right track here. We've also got some physical hazards like vibration.

35
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:21,809
I think I saw radiation on here, of course, cold, which will be a stressor, unfortunately, in the next several months of our lives here.

36
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:29,459
So. So this is great. You're all very much already on the right track here in terms of identifying some some stressors here.

37
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,318
I see things like infrastructure.

38
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:40,109
So we can certainly think of the built environment around us as perhaps a physical stressor that certainly can potentially lead to harm in our bodies.

39
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:46,049
So thank you so much. With that, I will again just provide you a few additional examples here.

40
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:50,909
So COVID 19 featured regularly in your responses, no surprise there.

41
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:54,509
But of course, there's tons of different types of biological hazards out there.

42
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:00,569
We think about viruses like SARS-CoV-2, we think about fungi, we think about bacteria.

43
00:05:00,989 --> 00:05:04,018
Also, if you're a veterinary technician or a veterinarian,

44
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:08,309
you're probably not so worried about the bacteria as much as maybe the dog that's going to bite you.

45
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:12,209
So larger organisms can be biological hazards to people?

46
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:15,809
Absolutely. Chemical hazards. You mentioned many.

47
00:05:15,809 --> 00:05:20,429
We could also think of ones perhaps that are a little less exotic than some of the ones you mentioned.

48
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:24,208
So cleaning products, cigaret, smoke, carbon monoxide,

49
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:30,899
all of us have exposures to these maybe not so much cleaning products on a regular basis, at least in my household, but the others certainly.

50
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:36,929
And then physical hazards are essentially energy that's getting imparted onto our body.

51
00:05:36,929 --> 00:05:47,158
So things like UV radiation from the sun noise exposure, my, my particular area of research, you know, electromagnetic frequency radiation.

52
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:52,558
So these are essentially the the scope of the course that we're going to talk about these biological,

53
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:57,119
chemical and physical hazards that all of us encounter all day, every day.

54
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:03,719
So with that, let's jump into our second question here. Again, feel free to to turn to your seat, mates.

55
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:12,089
How many chemicals do you think there are currently in U.S. commerce or, in other words, being sold and traded in the United States?

56
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:40,809
Go ahead. How?

57
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:29,319
All right. So while you're wrapping up your answers here, I'll highlight, you know,

58
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:33,608
these word clouds are always such a great time because of the sort of span that we get here.

59
00:07:33,609 --> 00:07:37,029
So, you know, big numbers right in the middle here, 000.

60
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:41,499
I'm hoping that's just a mistake. But there are more than zero chemicals in U.S. commerce.

61
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:45,819
On the other hand, we have questions like how can we count? Which is actually a great question.

62
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:49,149
We've got trillions, we've got millions, we've got everything.

63
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:54,819
I think I saw in here hella chemicals. So that's a little qualitative.

64
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:59,558
But, you know, I think still means a lot over 9000 million.

65
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:04,208
So, you know, tons of different guesses or estimates here.

66
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:08,439
And I'll say it's totally reasonable to not have any idea.

67
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:14,528
The number that I'll throw out here is 85,000 chemicals in commerce.

68
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:18,549
And I noticed a few of you had that answer in there. Don't look ahead in the slides.

69
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:22,028
That's cheating. So I say this is the right answer.

70
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:26,679
This is not the right answer. The right answer is we don't know which should be scary all by itself.

71
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:30,579
This is kind of our best guess as to how many chemicals are out there.

72
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:36,639
So this number, while absolutely wrong, is the number we're going to sort of work off in this class.

73
00:08:36,939 --> 00:08:41,049
The thing we should know about this number is sort of twofold. One, it's a really big number.

74
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:45,729
And two, it increases every year as we invent new chemicals.

75
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:52,869
So just think about, you know, chemicals that you might be exposed to on a daily or even a more regular basis.

76
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:54,999
That's probably a relatively small number.

77
00:08:54,999 --> 00:09:02,019
But if we zoom out and consider the entire universe of chemicals you could be exposed to, it's a pretty overwhelming number.

78
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:07,509
All right. Now our third question, we come to a question to be here.

79
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:13,658
So there are so-called high production volume chemicals in the U.S. are PVS,

80
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:18,909
which I know for some of you might also stand for, you know, other, for example, viruses.

81
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:22,359
But for each, yes, we're going to consider these high production volume chemicals.

82
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:27,039
So these are the chemicals that we make and use the most of in the United States.

83
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,409
So my question for you is, of the 3000 of these so-called high production volume chemicals,

84
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:40,149
what percent of them do you think we have basic information on regarding their health risks to humans?

85
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:49,238
So I'm looking for a percentage answer here. And in this case, I'll I'll save you the trouble and give you some bounding options here.

86
00:09:49,239 --> 00:10:20,038
I'll look at them coming in quite quickly. So I will just comment.

87
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:25,379
I can see already that we've done an effective job of converting you into jaded and cynical students here,

88
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:29,759
where you're you're guessing, most of you, that it's not very many of those chemicals.

89
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:35,848
So we've got a full two thirds of the class that think it's one quarter or less of those

90
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:40,079
high production volume chemicals that we have basic health risk information about.

91
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:45,449
I love the optimists up here. 5% of you think we know everything about all the chemicals out there.

92
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:50,458
And of course, we've got folks in between. So let's jump ahead to the answer here.

93
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:55,679
And I apologize. My my poll everywhere surgery is showing we got some duplicate slides.

94
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:01,949
But in terms of the answer to this question, so as I said, there's about 3000 high production volume chemicals.

95
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,278
We're making more than £1,000,000 of each of these per year.

96
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,159
So these are chemicals that we make and we use a lot of presumably if we know anything about any chemicals,

97
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:16,829
it's going to be these that we make the most of. Now, when it comes to environmental health, there's a few things, six things,

98
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:21,988
really, that we want to know about a specific chemical to understand its toxicity.

99
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:28,259
We call this the screening information data set. And so these six things are acute toxicity.

100
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:32,128
In other words, if I were to drink this chemical right now, is it going to kill me right now?

101
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:36,389
Is it acutely poisonous? We also want to know about chronic toxicity.

102
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:44,279
So if I drink, say a little bit of this chemical over time, over years or decades, is it going to be toxic to me over that lengthy period?

103
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:48,959
We want to know about developmental and reproductive toxicity.

104
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:56,459
So is this going to impair my ability to have children or is it going to cause problems in my children through its toxicity?

105
00:11:56,909 --> 00:12:03,718
We want to know about mutagenesis. In other words, if I give this chemical to a bacteria, for example, is it going to cause that bacteria to mutate?

106
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:07,528
Which sounds pretty scary. We want to know about eco toxicity.

107
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:14,159
So even if it's fine for me as a human, if I release this chemical into the environment, is it going to cause damage there?

108
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:18,269
And then the last thing we want to know is so called environmental fate.

109
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:21,809
Meaning if it does get out into the environment, what happens to it?

110
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:30,059
Does it break down immediately due to UV radiation, or is it a so-called forever chemical that's going to hang around and not degrade over time?

111
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:34,799
Now, most of us, I think in the United States, as we go on our merry way, think,

112
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,038
well, of, of course, the chemicals that I'm dealing with on a daily basis.

113
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:44,759
Somebody has looked at these and made sure that they're safe for me to use or consume or otherwise experience in my life.

114
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:48,569
In fact, for these just 3000 chemicals that we make,

115
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:57,269
the most of 93% of them are missing at least one of these basic tests for us to be able to to know how toxic the chemical is.

116
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:01,708
And a full 43% of these are missing all of these tests.

117
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:08,579
In other words, we have no idea what these chemicals might do to human health or to the health of the ecosystem around us.

118
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:15,809
So this is a bit of a shocker, I think at least it was when I learned it that chemicals that we might assume,

119
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:18,869
you know, they're used in commercial products. I experience these things.

120
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:25,499
Somebody had to check that these were safe. Right. In fact, the answer is a shocking no for almost half of these chemicals.

121
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:31,109
And actually, the other point I'll make is, again, these are the 3000 chemicals we make the most of.

122
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:34,829
What about the other 82,000? What do we know about them?

123
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:38,169
Probably not as much as we should. All right.

124
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:43,128
Moving on to our third question here. So now we're going to talk about water pollution specifically.

125
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:49,698
So globally, water bodies that serve how many billion people on the planet are polluted by either

126
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:55,299
chemical or biological or physical stressors or some combination of those stressors.

127
00:13:55,309 --> 00:14:14,279
So go ahead and let me know what you think there. Anybody know how many people live on planet Earth off the top of their head?

128
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,559
Seven and a half a billion somewhere in that range. Totally acceptable answer.

129
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:24,768
So we've got sort of most everybody down to not very many folks.

130
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:32,749
And it it looks like we don't have so many takers for a few humans being potentially exposed to polluted water.

131
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:44,709
So it looks like our answers are stabilizing here. About half of you are a little more than half think that potentially two thirds or

132
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:50,289
three quarters of the human population is served by water bodies that are polluted.

133
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:54,309
And the answer here is actually 5 billion.

134
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:58,059
So it's a little less dire than those of you who thought more than 6 billion is.

135
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:07,539
But 5 billion is still a lot of people. So more than well over half the people on Earth, in fact, about 67% of our population.

136
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:14,439
So this is troubling, of course, because water is a critical requirement for life, human and otherwise, on the planet.

137
00:15:14,469 --> 00:15:17,369
Now, I've shown you a couple of maps here as we go through the course.

138
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:21,999
I'm going to use maps wherever I can, because I think they can be very useful to tell a story.

139
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:30,099
And on this one, I'm going to highlight this is a map not of pollution necessarily, but of so-called water security threat.

140
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:34,449
So do you not have secure, stable access to water?

141
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:39,009
If the answer is yes on this map, your area is going to be closer to the red.

142
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:42,849
And if you do have a stable, secure water supply, it's going to be closer to blue.

143
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:47,289
Now, your water supply could be unsecure because it's polluted.

144
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:51,579
It could be that you also live in an area where precipitation is highly variable

145
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:56,109
and it's not reliable that you're going to get rain or other access to water.

146
00:15:56,499 --> 00:16:04,639
But we can look here and see there are definitely winners and losers, losers on the planet in terms of access to secure water.

147
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:12,019
So if we look at much of North America here, Canada and Russia, the water security threat is quite low.

148
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:21,039
On the other hand, if we look at most of Europe, Southeast Asia, East Asia, and even this bright stripe right down the middle of the United States,

149
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:25,859
we can see people there who do not have secure and stable access to water.

150
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:32,339
Now, a question for all of you. This bright orange stripe down the middle of the U.S., anybody have an idea what that is?

151
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:38,039
Yeah, please. So the Mississippi is a great answer.

152
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:48,309
Other ideas of what this might be. So it turns out that Mississippi runs a bit east of this line, sort of south from Minnesota.

153
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:51,699
So just a little bit to the right on the graphic. What this actually. Yeah, please.

154
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,429
It. Rocky Mountains, another great gas. Those are a little bit to the west here.

155
00:16:56,439 --> 00:17:02,489
Those would be sort of under my cursor right now. In fact, what this indicates is the Ogallala Aquifer.

156
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:08,558
This is an incredibly important subterranean body of water that essentially has powered

157
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:15,188
our agricultural system in the Plains and the Midwest since this country was colonized,

158
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:21,699
at least. And so this aquifer has been being drawn down at a rate faster than it's recharging.

159
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:27,129
In other words, or maybe to put it in different words, a well that a farmer might have dug,

160
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:32,018
say, 100 years ago, might have had to go down, say, 15 or 20 feet to hit water.

161
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:39,759
Now they might have to go down 60 feet to hit water because we've sucked so much water out of the ground and it hasn't had a chance to recharge.

162
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:48,039
So here, even in the United States, where we are so fortunate to have, you know, generally access to clean water and abundant water,

163
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:54,608
we've got an entire swath of our country that is at risk of not having enough water to grow the food that we all depend on.

164
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:59,619
Now, of course, here in Michigan, we are surrounded by a full 20% of the world's fresh water.

165
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:00,819
We're incredibly fortunate.

166
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:07,598
But again, I'll highlight within the U.S. and certainly across the world, there are regions that are under severe water stress now,

167
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:12,399
and it's only going to get worse with climate change, as we'll talk about throughout the course.

168
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:18,438
All right. So let's do our next question here. This one has to do with air pollution.

169
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:24,289
So how many Americans do you think might live in areas that have air pollution levels

170
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:29,029
that exceed what are called the National Ambient Air Quality Standards of the NACS?

171
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:35,149
These are basically the federal government's best guess at what's a safe level of air pollution to be exposed to.

172
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:39,259
So how many people live in areas that are above those safe levels?

173
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:43,698
Go ahead. Any idea how many Americans there are?

174
00:18:43,699 --> 00:18:49,509
Again, just as a bounding estimate here. Say 340 million.

175
00:18:49,509 --> 00:19:27,018
We'll just estimate around there. All right.

176
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:35,449
So it looks like our numbers are stabilizing here with about half of you, a little more than half thinking, 127 million out of,

177
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:45,469
say, 335 million or so, 8% saying the vast majority of Americans and another 8% saying, you know, maybe 20% of Americans.

178
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:52,759
So if we look at the statistics available to us, our best guesses is 127 million.

179
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,828
So for those of you who answered that, absolutely right.

180
00:19:54,829 --> 00:20:02,539
So that's about a third of our population that the federal government recognizes is breathing more air pollution that is healthy for them.

181
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:11,538
So that's a big number of people. And one of the things we're going to talk about throughout this class is how we might come into contact with

182
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:17,149
things like air pollution and how that air pollution might get into the environment in the first place.

183
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:22,909
So a little bit later in the class, we're going to talk about the fact that air pollution can come from natural sources,

184
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:26,869
certainly, but also comes from anthropogenic or human sources.

185
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:34,639
And those sources may move around in space and time, like cars and trucks and trains, or they may be fixed in space like a factory.

186
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:39,499
But the bottom line, again, is that many of us, a full third of Americans,

187
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:43,549
are breathing air that the federal government does not consider to be healthy enough.

188
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:50,929
So something else to think about. One of the ways that the government has developed to communicate this information

189
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:55,818
to you and I sort of the public is through things like the air quality index.

190
00:20:55,819 --> 00:21:04,489
And so any of you who have a weather app on your phone, chances are that app probably has an AQI or an air quality number in there.

191
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:10,999
That number comes from the government, and it's a single number that's designed essentially to tell you how healthy

192
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:16,149
or how unhealthy is the level of air pollution in your specific area today.

193
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,449
So if you open your app up and it's good, that's great. Consider yourself fortunate.

194
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:27,679
But there may be days and certainly there are right here in Ann Arbor where we have moderate or even unhealthy levels of air pollution.

195
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:32,419
So the nice thing about this and maybe this is especially relevant to those of you in health behavior

196
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:38,179
and health education is we can use information like this to push out advice to the population like,

197
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:43,909
hey, today is not a great day to run a marathon because you are breathing hazardous levels of air pollution.

198
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:51,109
So we do have ways that we can try to influence public behavior towards healthier existence, basically.

199
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:55,729
All right. Another question here has to do with inhalation.

200
00:21:55,729 --> 00:21:59,569
So we just talked about air pollution. Let's talk about how much air we breathe into our bodies.

201
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:06,469
So how many liters of air do you think the average person might breathe in over the course of a day?

202
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:28,509
And again, I'll give you a range here to choose from. And just as a reminder, this is about a liter of air, about about the size of my water bottle.

203
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:56,558
All right. So it looks like our numbers are stabilizing a bit here.

204
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,628
So it looks like about 40% of you or so have actually looked ahead to the next slide.

205
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:08,409
Shame on you. The answer is, in fact, 11,000 jobs. I'll talk about in a moment, but I will throw out in environmental health.

206
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:12,188
We are a very quantitative discipline. So we we like numbers.

207
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:14,559
We use them to quantify the environment around us.

208
00:23:14,889 --> 00:23:19,989
But a lot of the numbers we we talk about, like how much a person inhales over the course of the day,

209
00:23:19,989 --> 00:23:24,278
can be very inscrutable and unclear to the the public.

210
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:29,589
So I will try to explain every number we throw out in this class just to make sure there's context around it.

211
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:35,819
So as I said, an average person breathes about 11,000 liters of air per day.

212
00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:40,058
Now, if you're a super athlete and exercising that number is going to be bigger for you.

213
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:47,858
If you're a very sedentary, very small person with small lungs, that number is going to be much bigger than you probably breathe in.

214
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:53,649
But that's kind of our average estimate. So that's one way that pollution can get into our body when we breathe it in.

215
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:55,779
Another, of course, is when we eat.

216
00:23:56,259 --> 00:24:03,759
And so outside of the Thanksgiving to December period, it's usually about two kilograms a day that a typical person would eat.

217
00:24:04,389 --> 00:24:10,419
And of course, we also drink water. So the average person's going to drink something like two liters of water per day.

218
00:24:10,689 --> 00:24:17,709
So all of those represent ways that potentially harmful contaminants can get into our body and that we need to understand.

219
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:20,798
All right. And finally, we come to our last question here.

220
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:30,639
So what percent of the total burden of death and disease on the planet Earth do you think might be caused by environmental hazards?

221
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:16,559
All right. So we got a little bit of movement here, but it looks like 2% of you think it might be 90 plus percent.

222
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,189
I would say that would be great job security for those of us in environmental health.

223
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:24,659
11% another 3% of you think it's as low as 11%.

224
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:30,359
That would not be such great job security, but might indicate that we could knock all these environmental hazards out and be healthier.

225
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:34,209
And in fact, those of you who guessed 25% are correct.

226
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:39,449
So when we look across all ages, all groups of people around the world,

227
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:45,429
the answer is about a quarter of death and disease is due to what we consider modifiable environmental factors.

228
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:49,969
These would be things like pollution that we're exposed to that's across all people.

229
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:54,209
When we look just at children, the burden is more like a third.

230
00:25:54,659 --> 00:26:03,179
And the reason for this is primarily due to access to safe and reliable drinking water, as well as water for sanitation.

231
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:09,959
So there are a billion people, you know, about one in eight people on the planet who lack access to a safe,

232
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:18,239
steady source of drinking water and about two and a half billion who lack a safe way to dispose of their waste through sanitation.

233
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:26,129
And the group that pays the price with an incredibly unfair burden of that lack of sanitation is children.

234
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:32,368
So if you look at the cause of death among children around the world, diarrheal disease is always right up at the top.

235
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:36,869
And it's it's children who, for a variety of factors we'll talk about in the class,

236
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:42,479
are just exceptionally vulnerable to certain environmental hazards, including lack of access to clean water.

237
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:48,819
So I appreciate you all taking a moment to populate those polls.

238
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:51,718
I hope that was interesting. In fact, let me just get a quick show of hands.

239
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:56,458
I'm never quite sure if poll everywhere is like a positive for people or not so positive.

240
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:59,549
So hands up if you enjoy doing polls in class.

241
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:05,219
Okay, I'll take that as a good sign. I will I will keep using those and hopefully they'll work better next time.

242
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:12,809
So what I want to highlight here is while there's actually seven questions that we walked through, you may have seen kind of disparate.

243
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:17,009
What I was walking you through essentially is what we call the exposure disease model.

244
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:22,828
So this is a framework that we use in environmental health to explore the circumstances and settings

245
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:29,098
around us and try to understand how something in the environment might come to harm the health of humans.

246
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:38,069
And so the first question was with regards to sources, so where do some of these harmful stressors come from in the environment?

247
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:44,669
We also talked about how much we might know about the specific source in terms of risk information.

248
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:49,438
The third question we walk through is about the movement of pollutants through the environment.

249
00:27:49,439 --> 00:27:52,589
So it's not just enough to know that there's a chemical out there.

250
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:58,259
We need to know how is it moving around and potentially ultimately coming into contact with people.

251
00:27:58,949 --> 00:28:03,959
That contact between a hazard and a person is what we call exposure.

252
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:09,778
That was question for that. We talked about we are also very interested not just in exposure.

253
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:15,599
In other words, was I maybe in a room where there was a hazardous chemical present I might have been exposed?

254
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:22,139
Really, what we're interested in is how much of that chemical might have gotten into my body and potentially be able to harm me.

255
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:31,409
That's what we refer to as the dose. And then of course, the adverse health effect, any type of disease that you can think of, you know,

256
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:36,868
there's some environmental hazard out there that can at least contribute to the development of that disease, if not cause it outright.

257
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:38,938
And so what we're trying to do here, again,

258
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:45,059
is relate what's going on in the environment to human health and ideally is environmental health scientists.

259
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:54,779
We figure out points in this framework where we can intervene and stop that chain from progressing to potentially adverse health effects or death.

260
00:28:56,459 --> 00:29:01,049
All right. So that was, again, maybe a little bit of an unorthodox introduction to the class.

261
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:05,938
It occurs to me I'm not sure everyone can hear me. So someone in the back, are you able to hear me okay.

262
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:09,659
Back there? Okay, great. So let's talk about public health.

263
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:14,038
514 you've already gotten a little bit of the taste of the class, if you like.

264
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:17,309
What you've seen so far, you're in for a good run.

265
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:25,499
And if not, I'll do my best to make it better. In terms of this class, I would encourage you all to to get to know the canvas website.

266
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:31,078
I've invested a fair amount of time to make that hopefully pretty intuitive and easy to use.

267
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:35,009
I'll absolutely encourage you to at least take a pass through the syllabus.

268
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:40,709
I will also definitely encourage you to raise your hand and ask questions in class

269
00:29:41,069 --> 00:29:44,909
and something else that I'll mention now and I'll try to remember each session.

270
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:48,359
So we've got our guys in the corner here who I'll introduce in a moment.

271
00:29:49,139 --> 00:29:51,628
They're going to be monitoring the chat during the lectures.

272
00:29:51,629 --> 00:29:56,999
So for those of you who are comfortable raising your hand and asking a question or raising a concern, please do.

273
00:29:56,999 --> 00:30:01,199
That's not everybody, though. And so if you want to send a message to the GSI,

274
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:06,448
they can either answer that on the chat or they can stop me in the lecture and I can address the question, too.

275
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:10,139
So I, I want to make sure that nobody leaves here with unanswered questions.

276
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:18,028
Absolutely. What we're going to cover over the course of the next 14 weeks are initially some of the core principles.

277
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:24,659
You know, what do I mean? When I talk about environmental health, we're going to talk about different environments where all of us spend time.

278
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:31,319
And then for the last essentially half of the class, we're going to zoom in on two huge issues that we're grappling with.

279
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:39,839
The first is climate change, which is the preeminent risk to human health that has ever existed, and certainly that exists in our lifetime.

280
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:46,709
And then the issue of environmental justice or inequitable distribution of hazards among populations,

281
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:49,979
we're also going to talk about risk assessment and risk management.

282
00:30:49,979 --> 00:30:54,118
So how do we look at things and decide that's a problem that needs to be fixed from an

283
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:58,889
environmental health perspective and what can we do to actually implement that fix?

284
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:03,808
So that's what we're going to talk about. What you are all going to do is a number of different things.

285
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:06,989
So I've got different types of assignments that you'll all complete.

286
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:09,209
I'll I'll talk about those in just a moment.

287
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:15,429
I've tried to mix up the kinds of assignments you're doing because not everybody is good at tests and not everybody is good at writing papers.

288
00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:19,259
So you'll have a chance to shine on at least some of the assignments.

289
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:22,768
I'm actually hoping that at least some of you enjoy this class too.

290
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:28,348
I know many of you are here because it's a core requirement and maybe this was not your first choice class to be in this semester.

291
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:35,219
I'm glad you're here and I am going to do my best to make it so that by the end of the semester you were glad you were here too.

292
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:40,889
So one of the things I'm going to try to do in every lecture is drive home to each one of you.

293
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:49,589
Why Environmental Health Is So. And how it touches your life individually on a daily basis, as well as all of the people around you.

294
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:54,779
Now we've got really four competencies that we're going to cover in this class.

295
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:59,459
We've got two that come from the Council for Education and Public Health, our accrediting body.

296
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:05,219
So we're going to run you through some exercises and let you feel proficient

297
00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:09,839
at evaluating policies for their impact on public health and health equity.

298
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:14,669
And also to apply systems thinking tools to a public health issue.

299
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:18,129
And then we've got two specific competencies here.

300
00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:23,128
So one is I'd like you all to be able to recognize at least some of the common environmental as well as

301
00:32:23,129 --> 00:32:29,339
occupational hazards that people might encounter and what those hazards are likely to do to their health.

302
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:35,969
And then secondly, I'd like you, at least at a high level, to be able to identify and maybe recommend, gosh, here's a problem.

303
00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:42,329
What's an appropriate control or a fix to reduce the impact of that problem on human health?

304
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:48,899
So I haven't even mentioned who I am. I'm Rick Neitzel. I guess we've come to that time of the lecture now.

305
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:53,789
I'm a professor in Environmental Health Sciences. I've been here for 11 years now.

306
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:59,368
I actually direct our industrial hygiene program, which focuses on occupational health.

307
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:05,129
So my sort of passion within public health is the protection of worker health and safety specifically.

308
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:09,989
And I thought, rather than talking to you about just sort of generically the type of work I do,

309
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:14,999
I would highlight some of the places that I've had the opportunity to work and the types of things I've worked on.

310
00:33:15,389 --> 00:33:19,198
I will say I think I'm totally representative of the faculty that we have in

311
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:22,799
Environmental Health Sciences in that a lot of my work happens domestically,

312
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,839
but much of it happens globally and tackles different hazards that are out there around us.

313
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:37,829
So I worked on a prospective cohort study of aluminum smelting workers trying to understand how that work might impact their health.

314
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:41,399
This work is really, really physically demanding.

315
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:46,469
Lots of exposures to things like molten metal that can ruin a worker's day very quickly.

316
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,249
So that was domestically. On the other hand, I have been working with some colleagues in Sweden for about ten years now on

317
00:33:53,249 --> 00:33:57,568
what they consider a small retrospective cohort study of only 10,000 workers.

318
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:01,979
The national health care schemes really put you on a different level of research you can do.

319
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:09,689
So in this case, we have been studying the exposures that pulp and paper mill workers have to things like noise,

320
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:16,379
also paper dust and also working shifts. In other words, sometimes working at night, sometimes in the day.

321
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:21,809
Each of those things independently, believe it or not, is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

322
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:25,649
And we're trying to understand what their joint risk might be to human health.

323
00:34:27,249 --> 00:34:30,249
I've also done some work in Ghana, in West Africa,

324
00:34:30,249 --> 00:34:36,189
on artisanal and small scale gold miners trying to understand the hazards that they face on the job.

325
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:40,929
I wrapped up a study a few years ago, actually, a quick show of hands.

326
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:44,029
How many of you were born in Michigan? Okay.

327
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:48,629
So many, but not all. I'm sorry for the tuition burden of everyone who wasn't born in Michigan.

328
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:54,479
I'll just drop that right here. For those of you born in Michigan looking around this, this applies to all of you.

329
00:34:54,479 --> 00:35:02,509
So when you were born, one of the first things that the medical team did was to take a so-called heel stick or a heel prick.

330
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:06,869
So they grabbed a little bit of blood out of your heel and put it on a card.

331
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:14,039
And the blood spot on that card was then analyzed to identify any genetic diseases that might be remedied at birth.

332
00:35:14,249 --> 00:35:17,969
And if they're not, could be very deleterious to your health later in life.

333
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:20,968
So that's great. It's a screening and intervention program,

334
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:28,349
but the state then sends those cards off to a warehouse in Detroit where they have sat for up to 30 years in some cases.

335
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:31,888
I actually got a grant. Keep in mind, I'm an occupational health researcher.

336
00:35:31,889 --> 00:35:34,079
I got a grant from the Gerber Foundation,

337
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:42,179
makes baby food to get some of these newborn dried blood spots and also gets hearing test results for these infants.

338
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:49,108
And try to figure out is what was in the newborn dried blood spots predictive of having a hearing loss at birth.

339
00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:52,979
And in fact, we saw that infants who had higher levels of cadmium,

340
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:58,499
a heavy metal in their blood, were more likely to fail their hearing screening at birth.

341
00:35:58,499 --> 00:36:00,909
And again, that's another point at which we can intervene.

342
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:07,589
So that was a topic a bit off the beaten path for this occupational health researcher, but still very interesting to me at least.

343
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:15,389
I had done work in Chile and Thailand looking at workers who take your old electronics.

344
00:36:15,749 --> 00:36:21,478
So your phones, your computers, your coffeemakers, your I won't say fax machines, cameras.

345
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:24,598
Let's go with that. When you dispose of those,

346
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:30,839
some of those inevitably make their way to low and middle income countries where people strip them down to get the precious metals from inside.

347
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:37,378
So they're doing recycling, which is good, but the downside is they expose themselves and their families.

348
00:36:37,379 --> 00:36:45,179
This work is mostly done in homes to all sorts of different heavy metals and other nasty chemicals and physical hazards as well.

349
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:53,479
I did a study a couple of years ago looking at the risk of people getting hurt in aircraft maintenance facilities.

350
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:57,469
So aircraft, as you know, flying around are actually an incredibly safe way to travel.

351
00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:01,938
But it's not that way when you're the maintenance worker trying to keep that plane safe.

352
00:37:01,939 --> 00:37:05,929
Lots of hazards on the job there. That that was a project in Kuwait.

353
00:37:07,009 --> 00:37:10,638
I've done some work here in Michigan and throughout the Midwest looking at mining

354
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:15,259
workers and their risk of getting injured on the job from a mixture of things.

355
00:37:15,259 --> 00:37:19,999
One is potentially noise exposure, which might distract them and cause them to make a mistake.

356
00:37:20,299 --> 00:37:21,708
One is having a hearing loss.

357
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:27,858
Maybe they can't hear that they're in a dangerous situation and a third is wearing earplugs, which you might think, well,

358
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:34,009
it's keeping their hearing safe from noise, but it's actually giving them a hearing loss at the same time, an artificial temporary hearing loss.

359
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:40,039
And so we've seen in several different cohorts that their injury risk goes up if they're in noise

360
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:44,449
and it goes up even more if they're in noise and have a hearing loss or wearing hearing protection.

361
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:47,988
And then the last study I'll mention here is one that's ongoing.

362
00:37:47,989 --> 00:37:53,839
So the Apple hearing study some of you may have heard of this is a study that is now in its third year.

363
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,959
We've got over 160,000 people enrolled.

364
00:37:57,379 --> 00:38:01,489
And people are choosing to share with us information about noise in their environment.

365
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:07,849
For the first time ever, they're sharing information about how much sound they get through their headphones and their earbuds.

366
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:12,349
And they're also taking app based hearing tests so we can start to understand

367
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:16,729
what are Americans exposed to kind of at a national level in terms of noise,

368
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:23,659
how is that impacting their hearing? And we also have some cardiovascular measurements, too, so we can relate noise to cardiovascular health.

369
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:29,109
So again, I have a lot of different projects here that I've been fortunate to work on.

370
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,489
Most of them have an occupational health grounding.

371
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:40,399
And I'll say, as I did before, you know, we have lots of environmental and occupational hazards right here in the U.S. But for every bad hazard here,

372
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,819
there's one that is worse, undoubtedly somewhere else in the world.

373
00:38:43,819 --> 00:38:47,179
So we are definitely not constrained to just looking at the U.S.

374
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:54,438
So with that, I'd love to have our three guys come up if you're comfortable, and I'll just let the three of you introduce yourself.

375
00:38:54,439 --> 00:39:02,899
I'm very excited to have Christina and Bridgette and Swati, so we'll give them a moment to transition up to the stage here.

376
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:09,259
While they're doing that, I'll mention that if you go to the teaching team link on the campus site,

377
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:15,468
you'll see all of our three guys here and you'll see that I've assigned you by last name to GSI.

378
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:20,989
So, for instance, Christina has folks with last names from E to h.r.

379
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:29,688
So let you come up here, you are going to be essentially assessed by the the gsi who your last name falls within.

380
00:39:29,689 --> 00:39:34,098
But all of the guys are going to hold the office hours. You're welcome to go to any office hours at all.

381
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:38,899
So please, Christina. Thanks, Rick. Hi, I'm Cristina Gomez.

382
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:43,439
I am a second year industrial hygiene student, so I work closely with Rick.

383
00:39:44,189 --> 00:39:52,229
And so my background actually is that I in my undergrad, I actually got a B.S. in environmental science and minored in biology.

384
00:39:52,229 --> 00:39:58,979
So I'm very familiar with all this information. Office hours are going to be on the campus site for me and they were going to be

385
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:05,459
there are going to be on Wednesdays in-person on the two or one sixth floor.

386
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:12,299
So the department's four in the tower section from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.

387
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:21,689
And then I will also have virtual if you guys can't attend the in-person if you guys needed help on Thursdays from 12 to 1.

388
00:40:22,259 --> 00:40:25,289
And so that would also be on there as well. Yes.

389
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:29,698
Wonderful. So thank you, Christina. And I'll say we've tried to make a mix here.

390
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:35,159
And Bridget, please come on up. Tried to make a mixture of office hours at different times of day and different days of the week.

391
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:38,279
And some of them virtual and some of them in person. So, please, Bridget.

392
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:43,618
Hi, I'm Bridge. I am a second year environmental health promotion and policy MPH students.

393
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:48,449
I've taken classes in E, HS and VCE primarily, so you might have had a class with me.

394
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:54,989
I'm also doing a certificate with the School for the Environment, Sustainability, Environmental Justice.

395
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,188
My office hours are going to be on Tuesdays right before class.

396
00:40:59,189 --> 00:41:03,269
I will also be in-person on the sixth floor in the suit lounge area.

397
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:09,719
I'll probably try to get that like 1130. I think I'm canvas it sounds like 12 so I'll probably be there like 1130 until class starts.

398
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:14,459
So if you need to talk to me. But thank you, Bridget and somebody.

399
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:25,769
Hello everyone. My name is Swati. I am a second year MBA student in the General Environmental Health Sciences program.

400
00:41:26,729 --> 00:41:39,029
Most of my interests lie around toxicology, and I also work as a foreign part time research assistant at one of the toxicology labs here at speech.

401
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,069
And I'm also pursuing a graduate certificate in Risk Sciences in Human Health.

402
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:49,829
My office hours are will be on Mondays and Wednesdays.

403
00:41:49,829 --> 00:41:54,658
So Mondays I will be having virtual office hours from 3 to 4.

404
00:41:54,659 --> 00:42:01,379
And on Wednesdays I'll have in-person office hours again at the sixth floor lounge.

405
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:05,579
The US Department from 4 to 5.

406
00:42:05,939 --> 00:42:12,839
So wonderful. Thank you, Swati. As I said, you know, you don't need to hold those dates and times in memory.

407
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:18,688
They are all on canvas already. And just to reiterate, so when we talk about the sixth floor lounge,

408
00:42:18,689 --> 00:42:24,089
if you go into the tower and go up to the sixth floor, there's the curved windowed area with tables there.

409
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:28,229
That's where the GSEs will be stationed and ready to answer any questions you have.

410
00:42:28,229 --> 00:42:35,759
So thank you all for coming up. So I feel very fortunate to have such a great team of guys who come from different backgrounds.

411
00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:40,149
One of the things that we're all going to quickly realize in this class is the IHS

412
00:42:40,169 --> 00:42:43,858
is a huge and very broad discipline and no one person is going to know it all.

413
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:49,379
So we've got a team here where if one of us doesn't know the answer, chances are someone else is going to.

414
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:54,718
So what are we going to be doing? Is the teaching team well, we're doing our absolute best.

415
00:42:54,719 --> 00:43:00,719
I will say I'm especially excited. I haven't taught in person in this classroom in three years, so it's nice to be back in here.

416
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:05,459
The caveats here. So this is only the second time the course has been offered in person.

417
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:12,929
As I hope you'll sense, I try to put a lot of effort and enthusiasm and thought into my classes, but inevitably there are hitches.

418
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:16,199
So if they come up, when they come up, we will deal with them.

419
00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:20,219
All of that is a way of saying if you've got issues,

420
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:26,159
concerns or suggestions for how we can do the class better, please don't ever hesitate to reach out.

421
00:43:26,969 --> 00:43:30,179
I'll also emphasize we're covering some sensitive areas here,

422
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:35,669
so we're going to spend about a quarter of the class talking about issues around environmental justice and environmental racism.

423
00:43:36,569 --> 00:43:41,009
This is a topic that's actually sort of been developed over the course of my career.

424
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:47,909
I'm still learning, too. So, you know, if I make mistakes, if I misspeak in class, you know, please don't hesitate to point that out.

425
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:51,209
This is also a learning opportunity for me as well.

426
00:43:51,659 --> 00:43:57,268
And the other thing I'll highlight is I think email will probably be the prime form of communication for all of us.

427
00:43:57,269 --> 00:44:05,369
We will do our best to respond to emails as quickly as possible, certainly within 48 hours, and typically much, much faster than that.

428
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:10,169
So that's what we're going to be doing. What are you going to be doing?

429
00:44:10,169 --> 00:44:15,268
The million dollar question here? So we've really got three different kinds of assignments that you'll do over the course of the class.

430
00:44:15,269 --> 00:44:20,129
We're going to have three homework assignments that are kind of weighted towards the front of the semester here.

431
00:44:20,999 --> 00:44:24,359
This is a typo. These are each worth 10% each. Apologies for that.

432
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:28,289
So this is going to be worth a total of 30% of your grade.

433
00:44:28,829 --> 00:44:32,249
We will have a midterm and the midterm I'll just get this out of the way.

434
00:44:32,249 --> 00:44:38,129
Now, it's going to be online. That, taken at your convenience, will have a one week period to take it over.

435
00:44:38,439 --> 00:44:45,329
It will be the kind of thing where once you start, you've got 140 minutes, or for those of you with accommodations, a longer time to complete it.

436
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:46,468
It's open.

437
00:44:46,469 --> 00:44:56,489
Note This is not intended to be a memorization class and so my only ask of you for the homeworks in the midterms is to work on your own independently.

438
00:44:57,299 --> 00:45:02,848
And then towards the end of the semester we're going to have two brief reports, each worth 25% of your grade.

439
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:06,479
These are three page assignments. They are not intended to be back breakers,

440
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:11,249
but I hope that they'll give you a chance to see sort of how some of these big

441
00:45:11,249 --> 00:45:15,059
issues around climate change and environmental justice actually relate to you.

442
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:21,809
The other thing I'll encourage all of you to do again is ask questions. Do it by office hours, do it by email.

443
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:28,379
Again, if you're in the lecture and you have a question, you can pop on to the chat and the guys can answer that very quickly.

444
00:45:29,009 --> 00:45:32,278
And once again, I'm not expecting any of you to memorize all this.

445
00:45:32,279 --> 00:45:38,699
If you go to the bottom of the syllabus page in canvas, all of this is listed right there along with the due dates and times.

446
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:45,028
So a little more on the brief reports. As I mentioned, one of them will be on climate change, one on environmental justice.

447
00:45:45,029 --> 00:45:50,549
The first one is going to be a group report. So we are going to assign you to try to mix you up.

448
00:45:50,549 --> 00:45:57,959
So it's not an age group and an epic group and a nutrition group, but rather so you have a chance to work with the other disciplines here.

449
00:45:58,349 --> 00:46:04,769
And I know what you're thinking immediately. Oh, a group project. So let me tell you this.

450
00:46:04,769 --> 00:46:09,179
This feels right to me. I'll just say that. So I get it.

451
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:12,598
Group projects can be painful. Hopefully this one will not be.

452
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:16,649
And even if they are painful, they are a part of working life.

453
00:46:16,669 --> 00:46:19,788
Once you graduate the second one, I'll give you an option.

454
00:46:19,789 --> 00:46:25,879
You can either choose to do that brief report individually, or if you like your group or have another group you'd like to work with.

455
00:46:26,539 --> 00:46:29,809
We can have that be a group as well. All right.

456
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:33,889
Any questions before we proceed on here with learning about the US?

457
00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:45,289
Yes, please. So if you go into canvas.

458
00:46:48,009 --> 00:46:51,548
There's this chat option on the left side. I'm so glad you asked.

459
00:46:51,549 --> 00:46:55,179
So we ought to be able to pop into chat here.

460
00:46:55,419 --> 00:47:00,459
And so it doesn't look like anybody has actually posted a question yet, but this would be where you would come.

461
00:47:00,789 --> 00:47:05,469
And you can you can even put in emojis if you like. Hey, this is going great, smiley face.

462
00:47:06,609 --> 00:47:10,539
Sorry, I don't mean to lead you, but this would be where you go to the chat.

463
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:13,719
And again, the guys are monitoring this. So I'm sorry I didn't mention that.

464
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:22,299
Great question. Yeah, another question. Well, that is a great question.

465
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:24,879
It looks like not because I can see someone's question here.

466
00:47:24,889 --> 00:47:30,569
So I would say if you have a question you'd like to ask anonymously, probably the best way to do that is email and I.

467
00:47:31,179 --> 00:47:36,939
So that may be the GSEs. If you could just glance at your emails through the class, I won't be checking my email in class, I guarantee you that.

468
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:40,799
But perhaps our GSEs could too. Great question. Any others?

469
00:47:40,809 --> 00:47:44,909
Those were really good. All right.

470
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:49,259
So let's talk a bit more about environmental health sciences.

471
00:47:49,259 --> 00:47:56,529
So, you know, perhaps logically, I'm going to start you off with the basics here, including like what exactly is environmental health?

472
00:47:56,549 --> 00:47:59,999
We're now an hour into the lecture and I haven't even defined it for you.

473
00:48:00,509 --> 00:48:05,548
So there's competing definitions out there that are all of a relatively similar flavor.

474
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:14,848
So the World Health Organization, you know, the preeminent international public health group, defines environmental health as aspects of human health,

475
00:48:14,849 --> 00:48:18,839
including quality of life determined by factors in the environment,

476
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:24,479
including physical, biological and chemical hazards, as we've talked about already.

477
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:30,089
I'll also make a point here. I'm going to use the terms, hazards and stressors interchangeably,

478
00:48:30,089 --> 00:48:35,909
both intended to indicate things in the environment that if you come into contact with them, could potentially harm you.

479
00:48:37,169 --> 00:48:40,828
We've also got, of course, our National Institutes of Health here in the United States.

480
00:48:40,829 --> 00:48:46,018
And within that there is a National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences or an IHS,

481
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:49,229
and they have maybe a more pithy definition of their mission,

482
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:54,749
which is to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives.

483
00:48:54,779 --> 00:48:57,809
So you can see both of these definitions are pretty broad.

484
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:02,879
They implicitly address a lot of things that we'll cover in class, like access to food,

485
00:49:03,419 --> 00:49:08,939
access to healthy air, to safe water, to safe means of disposing of waste.

486
00:49:08,969 --> 00:49:15,629
This also encompasses issues like sustainability, which are, you know, finally sort of getting the attention there do.

487
00:49:17,339 --> 00:49:20,668
So I talked about the global burden of disease and death.

488
00:49:20,669 --> 00:49:28,199
And I said about 25% of all the death and disease around the planet is due to environmental modifiable factors.

489
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:38,689
Our best guess or estimate is that about 9 million people died just in the year 2015 alone, just due to exposures to pollution.

490
00:49:38,699 --> 00:49:47,279
So just to put that in context, that's about 16% or almost one in five people due specifically to pollution here.

491
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:53,129
It's three times the death toll of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined,

492
00:49:53,609 --> 00:50:00,959
and it's 15 times the number of deaths that occurred from all the wars and other sorts of violence on the planet.

493
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:06,179
So we should appreciate that the environment can be a great source of health and enjoyment for us.

494
00:50:06,689 --> 00:50:09,929
But for about 9 million people a year, it's actually killing them.

495
00:50:09,939 --> 00:50:12,419
And so this is, of course, something we want to intervene on.

496
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:21,389
We also have to recognize, and I touched on this already, that environmental burdens are not equally or equitably distributed around the world,

497
00:50:21,389 --> 00:50:25,559
and there are many countries that are much more severely affected than others.

498
00:50:26,009 --> 00:50:32,909
Or even putting countries aside. There are many areas of the United States that are much more severely impacted than others.

499
00:50:33,209 --> 00:50:43,108
So if we look internationally at the most polluted countries, for lack of a better word, then we're looking at a greater burden than 25%.

500
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:50,459
And so it turns out, in fact, that about nine out of ten or 92% of all the pollution related deaths around the

501
00:50:50,459 --> 00:50:54,868
world each year happen not in high income countries like the United States,

502
00:50:54,869 --> 00:51:02,939
but in low and middle income countries. So immediately we can start to see this is not a health equity situation, it's a health inequity situation.

503
00:51:04,299 --> 00:51:12,969
We also have to recognize, and I'll reiterate this repeatedly in the course that the diseases that result from pollution are most prevalent,

504
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:17,019
most common among minorities and marginalized populations.

505
00:51:17,289 --> 00:51:22,899
So we'll talk about environmental justice specifically at the end of the class and how we can get at this very important issue.

506
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:30,048
So it's one thing for me to throw out statistics like 9 million people died of pollution in 2015.

507
00:51:30,049 --> 00:51:35,659
But, you know, where do these statistics come from and what types of pollution are actually killing people?

508
00:51:36,169 --> 00:51:43,158
So I'll highlight in the graph on the left, there are different groups out there that are looking at the available data, which is never enough data.

509
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:44,569
So all of these are estimates,

510
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:52,699
but looking at the available data and trying to figure out how many or what fraction of deaths are directly attributable to the environment.

511
00:51:52,699 --> 00:51:58,489
And so we've got groups like the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.

512
00:51:58,819 --> 00:52:01,159
We also have the World Health Organization and others.

513
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:08,339
And so these groups bring different methodologies, sometimes slightly different data sets to bear, and they try to ask these questions.

514
00:52:08,779 --> 00:52:15,469
And the good news is, although each of these bars represents a different time period or a different agency doing the estimates,

515
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:24,139
the results are pretty consistent here. So if we look at the number of people dying from pollution every year, it turns out that of that 9 million,

516
00:52:24,649 --> 00:52:28,788
about six and a half million of those deaths occur specifically due to air pollution.

517
00:52:28,789 --> 00:52:29,929
What we're breathing in.

518
00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:41,899
Somewhere on the order of maybe 2 million deaths a year occur from water pollution, pushing a million deaths a year occur from occupational exposures.

519
00:52:41,899 --> 00:52:48,019
So that could be, you know, getting exposed to a cancer causing agent at work, getting run over by a truck at work.

520
00:52:48,769 --> 00:52:53,749
Basically, anything that might harm or in this case kill you at work is going to get included there.

521
00:52:54,199 --> 00:53:03,229
And then we've got maybe a half 1000000 to 800000 people a year who are dying as a result of exposure to soil or chemicals or specific metals.

522
00:53:03,799 --> 00:53:09,319
So from an intervention perspective, you know, immediately we should be thinking about what could we do about air pollution,

523
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:13,219
because this seems to be driving the largest number of deaths.

524
00:53:13,579 --> 00:53:18,708
But as I said already, you know, if we're looking at children and their health specifically,

525
00:53:18,709 --> 00:53:24,469
it might actually be water where we want to intervene because it's so tightly linked to diarrheal disease.

526
00:53:25,759 --> 00:53:31,218
So again, just to put this in context, so I've been telling you about these 9 million deaths in 2015.

527
00:53:31,219 --> 00:53:42,948
That's the leftmost bar on the chart on the right behind that would be tobacco smoking with about 7 million deaths in 2015, again followed by AIDS,

528
00:53:42,949 --> 00:53:50,959
malaria and tuberculosis, sort of communicable or environmentally based diseases, and then things like alcohol use and malnutrition.

529
00:53:50,959 --> 00:53:53,239
And of course, there are many other things that kill people.

530
00:53:53,659 --> 00:53:58,638
But again, just to highlight the environment, which many of us might gloss over and think, you know, how bad could it be for me?

531
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:03,829
Well, it actually kills more people than cigaret smoking, so pretty bad is the short answer.

532
00:54:05,419 --> 00:54:12,768
I also want to highlight that where you live and the amount of income available to you also strongly

533
00:54:12,769 --> 00:54:17,839
predicts which types of these hazards are going to be the ones you're most concerned about.

534
00:54:17,849 --> 00:54:25,549
So what we're looking at here, we've got, again, the number of global deaths on the Y axis and we've got different income levels by country.

535
00:54:25,969 --> 00:54:30,919
So low income, lower middle, upper middle and then high income countries.

536
00:54:31,279 --> 00:54:36,229
And then the colors on here, we've got purple indicating the soil or chemical or mental hazards.

537
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,069
Green for occupation, orange for water and blue for air.

538
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:44,598
So for low income countries around the world, you can see the burden of disease.

539
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:51,769
Their burden of mortality in this case is kind of split between air pollution and water pollution pretty evenly.

540
00:54:51,769 --> 00:54:58,848
So the blue and the orange bars are about the same size. If we jump to the next category of lower middle income countries here,

541
00:54:58,849 --> 00:55:06,829
we can see air pollution now accounts for the majority of deaths, but water is still making a pretty significant contribution.

542
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:14,599
And then soil and occupation kind of bring up the the rear here as we transition to upper middle income countries here.

543
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:19,279
Now, you can see water pollution has dropped down to kill a very relatively small

544
00:55:19,279 --> 00:55:23,269
number of people and the vast majority of deaths are due to air pollution.

545
00:55:23,659 --> 00:55:30,948
And then if we consider high income countries around the world here, we can see water has virtually disappeared as a cause of death.

546
00:55:30,949 --> 00:55:33,769
Air pollution remains the leading cause of death.

547
00:55:34,669 --> 00:55:40,669
Soil and chemicals and metals are a small fraction, and then the occupation remains sort of in the running.

548
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:47,869
So again, where you live and the amount of income in your country where you're residing has a strong

549
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:52,758
kind of relationship with the types of pollution that are most likely to kill you.

550
00:55:52,759 --> 00:55:56,389
And you can see that changes across the categories we look at.

551
00:55:57,719 --> 00:56:00,959
So we can look at this at a finer level, of course.

552
00:56:01,289 --> 00:56:06,569
Previously I was looking at countries bounded by income, but we can also look at individual countries.

553
00:56:06,569 --> 00:56:07,979
And so on this map here,

554
00:56:08,759 --> 00:56:17,399
the red colored countries are countries that have the highest rates of death attributable to environmental pollution per 100,000 people.

555
00:56:17,819 --> 00:56:24,478
And the lighter colored countries of of white and yellow here are going to be the countries that have the lowest rates of death.

556
00:56:24,479 --> 00:56:29,129
And so, again, you can see these death rates are very inequitable, really distributed around the world.

557
00:56:29,429 --> 00:56:36,479
We're quite fortunate here in North America to have, you know, some of the lowest death rates from environmental pollution in the world.

558
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:43,499
Not so much for South America, where at least the west coast of South America has higher rates.

559
00:56:43,919 --> 00:56:50,399
We can look at Russia and Mongolia and China and see they are sort of in the middle category here.

560
00:56:50,789 --> 00:57:00,629
But if we zoom in on South Asia, the Indian subcontinent, parts of sub-Saharan Africa and even parts of Eastern Europe, including Ukraine, of course,

561
00:57:01,259 --> 00:57:08,309
in the news constantly for the past 11 months, these are the places where people have the highest rates of death due to environmental pollution.

562
00:57:09,409 --> 00:57:13,548
So we're going to talk about why that might be over the course of the class and always

563
00:57:13,549 --> 00:57:18,288
want to keep in mind to how can we address the people who need assistance the most,

564
00:57:18,289 --> 00:57:21,649
which, as you can see here, is not all countries in the world,

565
00:57:21,649 --> 00:57:29,809
but rather there are countries that have more exceptionally high death rates and need greater and more immediate interventions, let's say.

566
00:57:31,609 --> 00:57:34,819
Another thing I'm going to do in this class, which I hope isn't too disorienting,

567
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:40,249
is try to flip flop between kind of a global perspective and then trying to keep it local wherever we can as well.

568
00:57:40,279 --> 00:57:47,059
So, you know, we were just looking at a map of the world and talking about how environmental health is is absolutely a global issue.

569
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:53,209
But we could zoom in and talk about local issues, too. How many of you have heard of the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland?

570
00:57:54,109 --> 00:58:01,249
A handful. Okay. So some of you may know, probably those of you who raised your hands that prior to the 1960s,

571
00:58:01,249 --> 00:58:06,198
the Cuyahoga River that runs right through Cleveland was so polluted with industrial

572
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:11,839
waste that the river itself actually caught fire more than a dozen times.

573
00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:16,729
So that's not something that water is supposed to do, just so we're all on the same page of that.

574
00:58:16,939 --> 00:58:20,119
And in fact, this was such a terrible incident that this, among others,

575
00:58:20,119 --> 00:58:27,049
actually led to the formation and the passage of regulations and laws designed to protect the environment in the U.S.

576
00:58:27,619 --> 00:58:33,319
So once the Environmental Protection Agency was established in the 1970s, rivers like the Cuyahoga got cleaned up.

577
00:58:33,319 --> 00:58:40,878
That's great news. So, in fact, I was near the Cuyahoga River three years ago and I was watching a bald eagle nesting on the river now.

578
00:58:40,879 --> 00:58:45,169
So the good news is, with concerted effort, we can address this pollution and clean it up.

579
00:58:45,169 --> 00:58:51,348
That's great. Of course, the Cuyahoga flows through Cleveland into Lake Erie, one of our Great Lakes.

580
00:58:51,349 --> 00:58:57,049
And some of you at least locals may remember that in the summer of 2014,

581
00:58:57,769 --> 00:59:04,339
the environmental conditions were just right for a massive bloom of blue green algae in Lake Erie.

582
00:59:04,339 --> 00:59:10,399
Lake Erie is the shallowest and the warmest of the Great Lakes and most susceptible to these algal blooms.

583
00:59:10,699 --> 00:59:17,539
It also suffers more than the other lakes from runoff from farm sites or farms with fertilizer.

584
00:59:17,699 --> 00:59:22,519
That tends to sort of boost these bloom, at least in terms of probability.

585
00:59:22,999 --> 00:59:28,728
And so the city of Toledo, just an hour south of Ann Arbor here, gets its drinking water from Lake Erie.

586
00:59:28,729 --> 00:59:38,899
And in 2014, these harmful algal blooms actually of a particular kind of cyanobacteria that's extremely toxic to humans and pets,

587
00:59:39,229 --> 00:59:45,138
actually resulted in water that the city of Toledo was sucking into their water treatment plant that could not be treated.

588
00:59:45,139 --> 00:59:51,919
It was too toxic. So here we have a major U.S. city just an hour south of us that was not able to provide

589
00:59:51,919 --> 00:59:57,379
drinking water to about 500,000 people over the space of the better part of a week.

590
00:59:57,799 --> 01:00:03,169
So, again, we are a very high income country with pretty resilient infrastructure in comparison to lots of places.

591
01:00:03,469 --> 01:00:12,169
But here's an example where a stable or once stable supply of drinking water became unusable because of the contamination we've put into it.

592
01:00:12,379 --> 01:00:15,529
And the citizens of Toledo paid the price, unfortunately.

593
01:00:17,059 --> 01:00:20,449
So we're going to talk about lots of different topics in this class.

594
01:00:20,479 --> 01:00:26,179
Again, it is a survey class. My hope for all of you is we'll touch on a few topics where you're like, Wow, I'd like to learn more about that.

595
01:00:26,449 --> 01:00:30,049
Then of course, you're going to be like, Darn, we didn't learn more about that because we moved on to the next topic.

596
01:00:30,049 --> 01:00:38,268
Apologies. Some of the things we're going to talk about that are absolutely hot topic or sort of prime issues today are things like climate change,

597
01:00:38,269 --> 01:00:43,849
like water pollution, like air pollution. We've got other issues that we've been dealing with forever,

598
01:00:44,029 --> 01:00:49,219
things like what do we do with solid and hazardous waste once we've created it so it doesn't make us sick?

599
01:00:50,209 --> 01:00:53,659
We can also think about things like nanotechnology.

600
01:00:53,659 --> 01:00:57,469
So how many of you put on some kind of cosmetic product today?

601
01:00:57,619 --> 01:01:01,219
Skin cream, deodorant? I'm hoping all the hints.

602
01:01:01,219 --> 01:01:04,909
Yeah. Okay, so those products are great, don't get me wrong.

603
01:01:04,909 --> 01:01:12,319
But for instance, sunscreen, which many people use, the active ingredient in sunscreen is nanoparticles.

604
01:01:12,619 --> 01:01:17,299
And there is research that shows that almost immediately after you put that sunscreen on your skin,

605
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:22,368
those nanoparticles, some of them stay on your skin, some of them migrate very quickly into your bloodstream.

606
01:01:22,369 --> 01:01:26,239
And now they're in your body, which is not where they're supposed to be. Is that bad for you?

607
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:29,809
We don't really know. We know there are definitely benefits to using sunscreen,

608
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:34,729
but we want to make sure that we're not introducing toxins, you know, voluntarily into our bodies.

609
01:01:35,569 --> 01:01:43,879
We're also increasingly aware of the relationship between the built environment around us and how it can either promote or hinder our health.

610
01:01:44,419 --> 01:01:48,739
We've got very long standing issues with things like pesticides.

611
01:01:49,549 --> 01:01:55,609
Injuries are a major area of research in environmental, health, sustainability, occupational health.

612
01:01:55,639 --> 01:02:00,199
All of these things are things that we we focus on and need to learn more about.

613
01:02:02,149 --> 01:02:07,069
All right. So let's come back to the exposure disease framework that I introduced to you earlier.

614
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:15,649
So again, this is a way for us to look at any environment and try to evaluate what might be hazardous there and where is it coming from.

615
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:20,808
So the source is critical to understand what's it going to take for that hazard, that stressor,

616
01:02:20,809 --> 01:02:26,029
to move through the environment and eventually come into contact with people where we have exposure,

617
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:29,149
that chemical or other hazard, you know,

618
01:02:29,149 --> 01:02:36,079
how readily does it get into the body and give us an actual dose and how does that dose relate to adverse health effects?

619
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:41,419
So it's a very simple model, but we can use it to explain even the most complicated exposure scenarios.

620
01:02:42,909 --> 01:02:47,798
So I've already defined for you. Hazard I'll just do it again one more time to make sure it sinks in.

621
01:02:47,799 --> 01:02:55,089
So when I say hazard or when I say stressor in this class, I mean a chemical or a biological or a physical agent.

622
01:02:55,449 --> 01:02:59,858
Or it could be some set of conditions that is capable of causing a biological response.

623
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:04,059
And that response could be, I touched a poison ivy plant and I got a rash.

624
01:03:04,389 --> 01:03:11,499
Or it could be I drank a particularly nasty chemical and I died immediately and everything in between there.

625
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:15,188
Now, I do want to make one point clear here.

626
01:03:15,189 --> 01:03:20,949
So when I talk about biological stressors previously in the class and some of you may be thinking this too,

627
01:03:20,949 --> 01:03:24,339
I've had people raise their hand and being like, Is that like being pregnant?

628
01:03:25,509 --> 01:03:30,458
Which is the ultimate biological stressor, make no mistake. But pregnancy is a natural condition.

629
01:03:30,459 --> 01:03:37,059
It's not a disease state. It's not something that's induced by exposure to a harmful chemical or biological or physical agent.

630
01:03:37,059 --> 01:03:41,438
So yeah, I guess we could maybe we could split words there, split hairs.

631
01:03:41,439 --> 01:03:48,159
But the point being that when when we're talking about environmental health, you know, we are absolutely concerned.

632
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:52,808
In fact, we're especially concerned about pregnant women because whatever they're exposed to,

633
01:03:52,809 --> 01:03:56,529
the fetus is also getting exposed to in a very vulnerable time of its life.

634
01:03:56,889 --> 01:04:00,819
But we don't consider that condition of pregnancy to be a stressor.

635
01:04:00,819 --> 01:04:10,589
It's just a natural non disease state. So you have all thrown out in our poll everywhere, some great examples of chemicals.

636
01:04:10,589 --> 01:04:14,339
You know, I'll just highlight that things like water, water is a chemical.

637
01:04:14,339 --> 01:04:19,529
And believe it or not, water can kill you. You can drown in it. You can get water poisoning, basically.

638
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:29,458
So we've got sort of the mundane things like water. We've got more exotic sounding chemicals like bisphenol A and one four dioxane.

639
01:04:29,459 --> 01:04:34,618
We're going to touch on all of these over the course of the class. I've also mentioned biological hazards.

640
01:04:34,619 --> 01:04:37,739
So again, we can think about animals. We can think about plants.

641
01:04:37,949 --> 01:04:41,759
Poison ivy. My daughter, believe it or not, has been bitten by a monkey.

642
01:04:42,449 --> 01:04:52,379
Maybe we'll come to that story later. Those are both biological hazards, but so are things like tuberculosis and the flu virus and SARS-CoV-2, etc.

643
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:59,188
So the third category that I think people often tend to gloss over are these physical hazards.

644
01:04:59,189 --> 01:05:06,779
And so, again, just to reiterate here, when I say a physical hazard, I mean there's some type of energy that's being imparted onto or within the body.

645
01:05:06,779 --> 01:05:14,489
So if I'm being exposed to noise or ionizing radiation or a vibrating surface or a musculoskeletal hazard,

646
01:05:14,489 --> 01:05:22,438
where the energy in my body is not being distributed in a safe and healthy way or just a straight up safety hazard, like something I might trip over.

647
01:05:22,439 --> 01:05:30,329
All of those things would be considered physical hazards. So I will not repeat those again.

648
01:05:30,749 --> 01:05:39,839
And so collectively in environmental health, our job is to ideally identify and prevent exposures to all of these potential hazards.

649
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:43,409
Now, of course, I threw out that number of 85,000 chemicals.

650
01:05:43,409 --> 01:05:48,448
The fact that we don't even know how many chemicals there are is a little concerning with regards

651
01:05:48,449 --> 01:05:53,379
to our ability to identify it and sort of ensure that exposures to those chemicals are correct.

652
01:05:53,399 --> 01:05:56,699
So we got a huge number of stressors out there to deal with.

653
01:05:58,069 --> 01:06:04,789
Now, I mentioned already that we've got different sources that we have to consider, and I've shown you this figure once already.

654
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:09,979
So I just want to unpack this a little bit here. So we have natural sources.

655
01:06:10,969 --> 01:06:18,439
Let me just ask, does anybody know what the biggest source of sulfur dioxide pollution is in the state of Hawaii?

656
01:06:21,159 --> 01:06:29,169
Please. Yes. It's historically been Kilauea volcano and recently it was Kilwa and Honolua that were erupting at the same time.

657
01:06:29,469 --> 01:06:36,309
The eruption. Emissions of sulfur dioxide totally dwarf anything that humans in that state put out.

658
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:43,838
So, you know, the Earth itself can cause pollution. Any of you who are from the West Coast and have lived through wildfire season,

659
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:47,739
which has actually impacted us here in Ann Arbor, too, at several points.

660
01:06:48,109 --> 01:06:51,639
You know, wildfires are a natural, naturally occurring event, though.

661
01:06:51,639 --> 01:06:56,619
They're often started by humans, and certainly they've been exacerbated by climate change.

662
01:06:56,859 --> 01:07:02,349
But that's a form of natural air pollution. They can be also, of course, started by things like lightning.

663
01:07:03,549 --> 01:07:08,589
So that's a natural source of pollution. Those are not trivial in environmental health.

664
01:07:08,589 --> 01:07:14,679
We tend to focus more on what we can do something about which are the human created or the anthropogenic sources of emissions.

665
01:07:14,679 --> 01:07:21,219
So we can think about cities like Ann Arbor. This is essentially a concentration of pollution sources here.

666
01:07:22,269 --> 01:07:26,169
It's a wide area. Lots of people doing lots of different things.

667
01:07:26,169 --> 01:07:30,248
But collectively the city is emitting lots of different pollution types.

668
01:07:30,249 --> 01:07:37,118
So we can consider that what we call an area source. It's not one particular house or one particular factory or one particular car,

669
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:41,409
but rather the whole urban agglomeration that's leading to that pollution.

670
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:51,489
Farms are another great example of an area source of pollution, so farmers will put out, for instance, fertilizers to help their crops grow.

671
01:07:51,879 --> 01:07:55,479
When it rains, the fertilizer will, at least to some degree,

672
01:07:55,479 --> 01:08:00,429
be washed out of those farm fields and often into Lake Erie, like we talked about earlier.

673
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:05,259
So it's not just one farm that's causing that. It's all farms that are leading to that runoff.

674
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:14,079
Roads are another great example. So as busses and trucks and cars drive on a road, they're dropping little bits of oil and God knows what else.

675
01:08:14,379 --> 01:08:20,379
That stuff stays on the road for the most part until it rains and then the rain washes it off the roadway and into our waterways.

676
01:08:20,619 --> 01:08:29,169
Again, it's not one road, it's all of the roads. So we would consider that more of an area source or we can also think about a single source.

677
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:35,319
So not an area, but a specific source here. And that can either be mobile, as I mentioned earlier, or stationary.

678
01:08:35,739 --> 01:08:39,038
So mobile sources are mobile. They move around.

679
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:47,858
This would be airplanes, trains, cars, trucks, busses, etc. and they are a very important type of pollution source.

680
01:08:47,859 --> 01:08:52,239
But on the other hand, we have stationary sources, sources that don't move.

681
01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:59,708
So a sewage treatment plant like we have on the east side of Ann Arbor or a power plant or any type of industrial facility,

682
01:08:59,709 --> 01:09:03,519
those are point sources or stationary sources.

683
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:09,609
And so to truly get a handle on pollution, we have to look at all of these sources individually,

684
01:09:09,609 --> 01:09:14,439
but also in aggregate to get a, you know, the best idea we can of the big picture.

685
01:09:15,829 --> 01:09:19,908
So that's sources again. The first box in our exposure disease framework.

686
01:09:19,909 --> 01:09:23,159
The second box is movement of pollutants here.

687
01:09:23,179 --> 01:09:28,188
So once a source introduces a hazard into the environment, frankly,

688
01:09:28,189 --> 01:09:32,899
if there is no people around from an environmental health perspective, we're not that concerned.

689
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:36,499
And it's not to say the ecosystem in the environment in general is not important,

690
01:09:36,499 --> 01:09:40,189
but we've got the whole school of environment and sustainability that focuses on that.

691
01:09:40,549 --> 01:09:43,278
We only get concerned where people are involved.

692
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:49,459
So the source creates the hazard and then the hazard is going to move through the environment and come into contact with people.

693
01:09:49,459 --> 01:09:55,368
That's really where we get involved. So let's think about how a pollutant might move through the environment.

694
01:09:55,369 --> 01:10:00,829
So let's say we're in a neighborhood here and some years ago some nefarious company

695
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:05,929
dropped some some canisters here of God knows what in the middle of our community.

696
01:10:05,929 --> 01:10:12,979
So we've got this waste pile and this sounds like a maybe a far fetched notion, but this happens all the time, believe me.

697
01:10:13,429 --> 01:10:18,348
So we've got some kind of chemical waste in these containers here and it's being released

698
01:10:18,349 --> 01:10:21,769
into the environment and maybe it's being released in a couple of different ways.

699
01:10:21,769 --> 01:10:25,429
So let's say the chemical inside these barrels is volatile.

700
01:10:25,759 --> 01:10:29,629
In other words, if it's exposed to air, it's going to tend to evaporate and float away.

701
01:10:30,019 --> 01:10:36,649
Well, if I've got people around this area who are breathing the air, they are potentially exposed.

702
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:43,189
So these kids playing here that chemical might volatiles and be blown over to where the kids are playing and now they're breathing it in.

703
01:10:43,819 --> 01:10:46,638
Maybe it blows a little further and now it's in someone's house.

704
01:10:46,639 --> 01:10:54,229
So now we have a movement of pollutants through air specifically, but that's not the only way that pollutants move.

705
01:10:54,229 --> 01:11:00,919
So for instance, let's say the chemical is spilling out of the barrels and it's leaching into the soil.

706
01:11:01,609 --> 01:11:08,389
And as it moves into the soil, ultimately it hits an aquifer, an underground body of water,

707
01:11:08,749 --> 01:11:16,669
which is where any of you who live in a home that operates on well water, that's where that well water likely comes from, is an underground aquifer.

708
01:11:17,059 --> 01:11:21,799
So if the chemical makes it through the ground into that aquifer, it's then going to spread out through the water.

709
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:27,829
And maybe we've got some unfortunate households that are using that very aquifer to get their drinking water.

710
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:33,858
So now they're getting exposed through air, as we talked about earlier, but also through the water that they're drinking out of there.

711
01:11:33,859 --> 01:11:38,779
Well, we've got some other types of movement that it can occur also.

712
01:11:38,779 --> 01:11:44,359
So this chemical clearly has ended up in the air, in the water, but it's also contaminating the soil.

713
01:11:45,139 --> 01:11:48,288
And the chemical may not necessarily go down into the soil.

714
01:11:48,289 --> 01:11:49,789
It may spread laterally.

715
01:11:50,449 --> 01:11:59,149
And so any time we have children, especially who uniquely among the different human age groups are often down in the soil, sort of playing with it.

716
01:11:59,149 --> 01:12:06,499
Now we've got the opportunity for maybe skin contact for the kids playing in this contaminated soil or God forbid, kids are disgusting.

717
01:12:06,499 --> 01:12:10,039
They're eating that contaminated soil, which they absolutely will do.

718
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:19,819
Or maybe the volatiles chemical from that barrel is blowing a little ways towards a farm and then it's depositing on the crops.

719
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:24,169
So now we've got chemical contamination of those crops and we're then eating the crops.

720
01:12:24,439 --> 01:12:28,369
So now we have a food based exposure route here.

721
01:12:28,369 --> 01:12:32,869
So lots of different ways that any type of hazard can move through the environment.

722
01:12:33,169 --> 01:12:34,339
And again, in environmental health,

723
01:12:34,339 --> 01:12:41,869
our job is to kind of suss out how is the chemical or biological or physical agent moving around and how can we interrupt that chain?

724
01:12:44,589 --> 01:12:50,978
So I've talked about human exposure previously. This is the third box in our exposure disease framework and all.

725
01:12:50,979 --> 01:12:57,939
I mean when I say exposure is again contact between a person and a potentially harmful hazard or stressor.

726
01:12:58,569 --> 01:13:07,059
Now, one thing to realize, you know, I could very readily categorize all of our exposures if we all spent 24 hours a day in this godawful room.

727
01:13:07,479 --> 01:13:14,769
Thankfully, we don't. So all of us will go to different classes, go to our homes, maybe ride in a car or bus to get there.

728
01:13:15,129 --> 01:13:19,598
So we have to recognize that exposures sometimes are in common among a group,

729
01:13:19,599 --> 01:13:25,389
but all of us in the end are going to have unique exposures because we move around in time and we move around in space,

730
01:13:25,599 --> 01:13:32,079
and those exposures are going to vary accordingly. So exposure assessment is is kind of a subdiscipline within environmental health.

731
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:37,779
It's what I tend to specialize in. And it's it's really hard, but we can boil it down to a couple of things.

732
01:13:37,789 --> 01:13:43,268
So really the three things we need to know to understand a humans exposure are first,

733
01:13:43,269 --> 01:13:49,659
the intensity sort of how much of this agent or hazard or stressor is there in the environment.

734
01:13:50,109 --> 01:13:59,299
Second, we need to know about frequency. In other words, how often do I or does somebody else come into contact with this particular hazard?

735
01:13:59,319 --> 01:14:06,399
And then third is the duration. When I come into contact with this chemical, how long in my exposed, for instance?

736
01:14:06,879 --> 01:14:10,958
So knowing all three of those is critical to understanding exposure.

737
01:14:10,959 --> 01:14:18,368
And I encourage you, in fact, your first homework assignment is going to be to look in the news relevant to your hometown,

738
01:14:18,369 --> 01:14:24,399
wherever you come from, and to find an environmental hazard or an environmental health issue that's happening there.

739
01:14:25,449 --> 01:14:33,819
And one of the things that the media and the press are almost always guilty of is they will focus on intensity and they'll be like, oh, my gosh,

740
01:14:33,819 --> 01:14:41,229
there were so many parts per billion of this particular chemical in this community and they won't talk at all about frequency or duration.

741
01:14:41,619 --> 01:14:47,469
So if that chemical is present in the community but nobody is coming into contact with it, there's no exposure.

742
01:14:47,469 --> 01:14:48,549
We're not actually worried.

743
01:14:48,819 --> 01:14:57,039
That doesn't mean we want the chemical in the environment, but it means we're not so worried about human health, so be immediately suspect.

744
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:03,398
I would say if you see an article that only talks about intensity or only talks about frequency,

745
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:08,179
unless we know intensity, frequency and duration, we don't truly understand exposure.

746
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:10,748
And those are three words that might not come to you readily.

747
01:15:10,749 --> 01:15:15,929
So I'll say when it comes to exposure, we want to know how much, how often and for how long.

748
01:15:15,939 --> 01:15:19,029
Those are the three equally important parameters of exposure.

749
01:15:19,299 --> 01:15:25,778
And once we know all three of those things, we could start to make at least an educated guess about how much exposure a

750
01:15:25,779 --> 01:15:30,069
person or a group of people might actually be getting to a particular hazard.

751
01:15:32,129 --> 01:15:40,589
Just to sort of wrap up the exposure disease framework here, I also want to talk about adverse health effects and dose.

752
01:15:41,219 --> 01:15:49,679
So dose as a kind of at a high level defined earlier is just how much of this particular agent is getting into my body.

753
01:15:50,249 --> 01:15:53,429
Coming into contact with the chemical can be harmful if they're chemical.

754
01:15:53,429 --> 01:15:56,879
Is the the oil in poison ivy that gives you a rash.

755
01:15:57,149 --> 01:16:01,679
You know, you just have to get that on your skin. It doesn't have to actually get into your body to cause a problem.

756
01:16:02,129 --> 01:16:08,129
But for many chemicals and certainly biological agents, it's not just what gets it on in our skin that we're concerned about.

757
01:16:08,129 --> 01:16:15,129
It's how much actually gets into our lungs or our kidney or our brain or whatever the that organ is that we're most interested in.

758
01:16:15,959 --> 01:16:20,819
So dose is a critical concept here. And then lastly, I'll mention just adverse health effects.

759
01:16:20,819 --> 01:16:28,319
And I already alluded to the fact that this could run the gamut from something that's extremely mild and totally reversible,

760
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:31,739
like a small skin rash all the way up to death.

761
01:16:31,739 --> 01:16:38,548
And so what our discipline of toxicology, which is another sub area of environmental health,

762
01:16:38,549 --> 01:16:46,679
what they do is to try to relate how much dose gets into a person to what kind of health response they might have.

763
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:54,359
And so what we're looking at here is something called a dose response curve, a very sort of conceptual one.

764
01:16:54,779 --> 01:17:00,659
So we've got an increasing response on the Y axis going from no effect to a much worse effect.

765
01:17:00,659 --> 01:17:06,268
And on the x axis we're looking at increasing dose. So zero dose means none got into my body.

766
01:17:06,269 --> 01:17:09,089
And the higher the dose goes, you know, potentially the most concerned.

767
01:17:09,089 --> 01:17:15,298
We are just curious, looking at this dose response curve and the responses on here,

768
01:17:15,299 --> 01:17:23,759
which range from no effect to giddiness to sleep to a deeper sleep to unconscious to labored breathing to death.

769
01:17:24,149 --> 01:17:29,549
Any guesses what chemical this particular dose response curve might be associated with?

770
01:17:31,469 --> 01:17:41,009
Please. Alcohol? Absolutely right. So here's a great example of an exposure that many of us seek willingly and often,

771
01:17:41,639 --> 01:17:47,069
even though in the wrong dose, that particular chemical could absolutely kill us.

772
01:17:47,939 --> 01:17:50,939
And so this is another complicated factor in environmental health.

773
01:17:51,209 --> 01:17:54,599
I asked earlier, how many of you use skin or cosmetic products?

774
01:17:54,689 --> 01:17:57,859
Most people do. Many people drink alcohol.

775
01:17:57,869 --> 01:18:02,639
So in addition to the sort of unavoidable environmental hazards were exposed to,

776
01:18:02,639 --> 01:18:09,299
we have these things that we seek out and purposely do, and those in their own way are extremely difficult to understand.

777
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:15,669
So just to kind of recap us on the exposure disease framework here, again, it's very simple,

778
01:18:16,089 --> 01:18:22,598
not intended to be complicated, but with this very simple framework, we can do a bunch of useful things.

779
01:18:22,599 --> 01:18:27,159
We can identify, well, what are the sources of a particular hazard around us?

780
01:18:27,159 --> 01:18:29,879
Where is this harm originating from?

781
01:18:30,519 --> 01:18:36,189
We can evaluate well how the different types of stressors in the environment actually come into contact with people.

782
01:18:36,189 --> 01:18:42,219
Where we start to get concerned and we can start to analyze the associations between things that you and I

783
01:18:42,219 --> 01:18:49,059
and the public are exposed to on a daily or less regular basis and health impacts that we might experience.

784
01:18:49,059 --> 01:18:57,099
And of course, that's where the field of epidemiology comes in and is incredibly useful to quantify those associations.

785
01:18:58,729 --> 01:19:01,968
So again, just to give you a little bit more context,

786
01:19:01,969 --> 01:19:08,329
I'd like to walk you through now a couple of different sort of seminal or game changing environmental health events that happened.

787
01:19:08,749 --> 01:19:14,899
The good news is, while these individual events are pretty depressing, as we'll see all of them motivated changes for the better.

788
01:19:15,229 --> 01:19:21,739
So always looking for the silver lining, of course. How many of you have heard of the Broad Street Pump?

789
01:19:21,739 --> 01:19:24,049
I know this is pretty groundbreaking stuff. Okay.

790
01:19:24,799 --> 01:19:29,649
If you had been in a school of public health and not heard of the Broad Street Pump yet, we're doing something wrong.

791
01:19:29,659 --> 01:19:35,929
So that's that's a good sign. Nevertheless, let me just very quickly repeat what happened with the Broad Street Pump incident.

792
01:19:35,929 --> 01:19:43,819
So if we imagine ourselves, you know, 170 years ago in the city of London, in a very dense,

793
01:19:45,229 --> 01:19:53,329
tightly packed and sort of lively city, a city that mostly drew its water from the Thames River that flows through London.

794
01:19:54,349 --> 01:20:00,889
So the common way for people to get drinking water at the time was a pump that was installed in the neighborhood that again,

795
01:20:00,889 --> 01:20:05,269
for the most part, sucked water out of the Thames or other local water sources.

796
01:20:05,749 --> 01:20:11,599
Well, London at the time and previously had dealt with a number of epidemics of cholera.

797
01:20:11,609 --> 01:20:20,239
So this is a deadly waterborne disease. And in any one of these epidemics, there were dozens to potentially hundreds of people who died.

798
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:23,779
So this is a real public health burden on the city of London,

799
01:20:24,739 --> 01:20:31,129
which people had sort of struggled to figure out where is this epidemic coming from in the community.

800
01:20:31,549 --> 01:20:39,019
This is sort of pre germ theory. People didn't really understand Vibrio cholerae or any of the other organisms that can make us sick in water.

801
01:20:39,589 --> 01:20:44,389
But along comes John Snow, sort of the father of epidemiology, who said,

802
01:20:44,569 --> 01:20:53,359
let's take a look here spatially and see if there's some relationship in the communities that are being impacted by cholera.

803
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:56,139
I mean, it's one thing to know there's hundreds of people sick in the city.

804
01:20:56,389 --> 01:21:00,919
It's quite another to know that those hundreds of people all live in the same building or on the same block.

805
01:21:01,219 --> 01:21:07,579
And so, in fact, as John Snow mapped out the number of cholera cases in this particular neighborhood,

806
01:21:07,939 --> 01:21:18,079
he discovered that the cases looked to be much more common that were spatially located close to the Broad Street pump that you see pictured here.

807
01:21:18,409 --> 01:21:25,669
And so he made the leap. Maybe it's something about the pump that's actually making people sick and killing them as a result of

808
01:21:25,669 --> 01:21:30,979
cholera and was able ultimately to convince the local authorities to remove the handle on the pump,

809
01:21:31,309 --> 01:21:35,569
meaning you could no longer pump water there. You had to go somewhere else to get your water.

810
01:21:35,899 --> 01:21:41,958
Now, John Snow himself admitted that although there were 616 deaths from this epidemic and the epidemic

811
01:21:41,959 --> 01:21:46,639
stopped at about the time that he removed or convinced the authorities to remove the pump handle,

812
01:21:46,939 --> 01:21:49,939
the epidemic was already sort of flaming out on his own.

813
01:21:50,179 --> 01:21:57,348
Nevertheless, you know, he is credited for making this spatial epidemiological connection and convincing

814
01:21:57,349 --> 01:22:00,559
the government to do an intervention that undoubtedly save some lives.

815
01:22:00,889 --> 01:22:03,739
So this is a great example specific to water pollution.

816
01:22:03,739 --> 01:22:10,218
And we'll talk about other types of pollution where even without having all the sort of necessary biological facts,

817
01:22:10,219 --> 01:22:15,219
he was able to connect the dots here and identify the source of this particular outbreak.

818
01:22:15,229 --> 01:22:18,919
So, you know, we owe a great deal to that. To John Snow.

819
01:22:20,119 --> 01:22:23,959
Sticking with the London theme, but jumping forward 100 years in time.

820
01:22:23,959 --> 01:22:25,699
Let's talk about air pollution.

821
01:22:26,209 --> 01:22:37,219
So London, due to its particular geographic configuration and weather patterns, is sort of prone to experiencing inversions.

822
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:43,009
Inversions, meaning warmer air is trapped at the ground and excuse me, cooler air trapped at the ground.

823
01:22:43,009 --> 01:22:48,528
And there's warmer air above meaning that pollutants tend not to rise into the environment.

824
01:22:48,529 --> 01:22:53,329
They stay at ground level. And so London had had many of these so-called smog.

825
01:22:53,329 --> 01:22:57,319
But in 1952, there was the great London smog or the great London fog.

826
01:22:57,589 --> 01:23:02,839
These photos on the left are daytime photos. That's how bad the air pollution was in the city.

827
01:23:03,049 --> 01:23:06,409
The problem is London at the time was primarily heated by burning coal.

828
01:23:06,409 --> 01:23:09,739
Coal is incredibly dirty, puts out a lot of air pollution.

829
01:23:10,459 --> 01:23:13,609
And this was a cold period where London was burning a lot of coal.

830
01:23:13,849 --> 01:23:17,969
That coal was all trapped at ground level. So that sounds unpleasant, right.

831
01:23:17,999 --> 01:23:19,459
And certainly difficult to drive.

832
01:23:19,909 --> 01:23:26,118
But for the first time really in history, the City of London had been making measurements of different types of pollutants.

833
01:23:26,119 --> 01:23:30,679
So they had been looking at sulfur dioxide, which kill away a volcano puts out.

834
01:23:30,679 --> 01:23:37,579
But it turns out burning coal also emits as well. And then just a more generic measure of smoke particles in the environment.

835
01:23:38,269 --> 01:23:44,869
And like any good public health agency, they were also counting the number of people who died on any given day.

836
01:23:44,869 --> 01:23:54,889
And what they saw is over this one week period in 1952, smoke shot up from its prior concentrations, sulfur dioxide shot up.

837
01:23:54,889 --> 01:24:01,188
This is all due to that air inversion and at the same rate, the number of deaths shot up, too.

838
01:24:01,189 --> 01:24:11,359
So finally here we have the first example, sort of empirically collected data that showed as air pollution went up, more and more people were dying.

839
01:24:11,749 --> 01:24:13,938
And depending on which estimates you look at,

840
01:24:13,939 --> 01:24:21,259
somewhere between four and 10,000 people in the city of London died directly as a result of this air pollution event.

841
01:24:21,859 --> 01:24:27,409
So this you know, I'm saying it's kind of a groundbreaking event. It's a tragic event with many thousands of people dying.

842
01:24:27,409 --> 01:24:33,468
But it's the first event where we can really say, hey, look, this wasn't just a bunch of people randomly dying on a particular day.

843
01:24:33,469 --> 01:24:37,009
This was very tightly associated with greater air pollution.

844
01:24:38,429 --> 01:24:42,329
You know, a third example, we can go to soil or even food here.

845
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:45,959
How many of you have read Silent Spring by Rachel Carson?

846
01:24:46,139 --> 01:24:49,799
Some of you. Okay. Highly encourage you to read it. It's a great book, very readable.

847
01:24:50,339 --> 01:24:54,089
So probably most of you have heard of the chemical DDT.

848
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:57,449
It's kind of a miracle pesticide.

849
01:24:57,989 --> 01:25:05,638
So DDT was identified as a high efficiency contact poison for insects back in the 1940s.

850
01:25:05,639 --> 01:25:13,709
And in fact, in 1948, Paul Mueller got the Nobel Prize for discovering that DDT is really good at killing insects.

851
01:25:14,069 --> 01:25:19,109
Now, why do we want to kill insects? Well, they're gross number one. I'll be the first to say that spiders are just the worst.

852
01:25:19,769 --> 01:25:24,659
But number two, there's a lot of diseases that insects give to people, including malaria,

853
01:25:24,659 --> 01:25:30,179
which is probably killed more people than all other causes of death combined over the history of human existence.

854
01:25:30,179 --> 01:25:36,508
So just to give you a snapshot, if we go to the island of Taiwan in 1945,

855
01:25:36,509 --> 01:25:42,989
there were a million cases of malaria on this small island just in the year 1945.

856
01:25:43,469 --> 01:25:51,539
Now, DDT was discovered in 1948, and in the 1950s it started to get applied quite liberally all around the world.

857
01:25:51,839 --> 01:25:55,378
Fast forward to 1969. If we go back to Taiwan,

858
01:25:55,379 --> 01:26:04,858
they've gone from 1000000 to 9 cases of malaria because all the mosquitoes that were carrying malaria were killed basically by DDT.

859
01:26:04,859 --> 01:26:10,018
And so this era of human history is where that phrase better living through chemistry comes from,

860
01:26:10,019 --> 01:26:15,149
like bugs bothering you, let's find a chemical and kill them all. It doesn't really sound good when you say it that way.

861
01:26:15,149 --> 01:26:20,219
So Rachel Carson comes into the equation because in the early 1960s,

862
01:26:20,609 --> 01:26:28,739
she started to notice there were declining numbers of songbirds in her neighborhood where DDT was sprayed and and others started to notice,

863
01:26:28,739 --> 01:26:34,559
like, wow, the the mornings where we used to hear all these birds calling and singing are strangely silent,

864
01:26:35,099 --> 01:26:39,779
wrote this book, essentially linking DDT to these impacts on birds.

865
01:26:39,779 --> 01:26:44,669
So we're killing mosquitoes that we hate, but we're also potentially killing birds that we love.

866
01:26:45,449 --> 01:26:54,449
And so additional research essentially proved that DDT quite harmful to insects tends to bio magnify up the food chain where birds

867
01:26:54,449 --> 01:27:01,799
that eat a lot of bugs will end up with a ton of DDT in their system and it was causing them to have reproductive failure and other,

868
01:27:03,299 --> 01:27:10,288
you know, terrible adverse impacts on the birds. So here's a dilemma which we often face in environmental health.

869
01:27:10,289 --> 01:27:14,669
On the one hand, we've got a chemical that actually saves human lives, undoubtedly.

870
01:27:14,669 --> 01:27:19,828
So DDT kills malaria bearing mosquitoes and prevents death.

871
01:27:19,829 --> 01:27:23,759
Absolutely. But it also has untold damages on the environment.

872
01:27:23,759 --> 01:27:29,849
And in fact, we're not actually that sure that it's good for people or that it's not really bad for people on the flip side.

873
01:27:30,209 --> 01:27:35,129
So we've got to balance these impacts always and make sure that something that appears to be

874
01:27:35,129 --> 01:27:39,599
promoting human health isn't in fact subverting human health while it trashes the environment.

875
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:49,138
And a fourth example I'll give a little more recently here, so 1986, I'm sure those of you who have HBO, Max, have seen the show Chernobyl.

876
01:27:49,139 --> 01:27:53,189
And if you haven't, you must see it. It's amazing, super depressing, but really well done.

877
01:27:54,209 --> 01:28:03,029
So we've got the Chernobyl reactor here. Probably many of you, if not all of you, have seen some image of this reactor shell after the explosion.

878
01:28:03,749 --> 01:28:08,699
So here we've got a safety test gone wrong under its Russian operators.

879
01:28:08,939 --> 01:28:12,029
We have a meltdown, a catastrophic meltdown of a reactor.

880
01:28:12,299 --> 01:28:20,938
And really, you know, one of the first times in human history where we have a very widespread exposure.

881
01:28:20,939 --> 01:28:28,709
So the map on the right here is showing for one particular radionuclide cesium 137 how that radionuclide spread

882
01:28:28,709 --> 01:28:34,589
out from Chernobyl located in this red zone here and impacted essentially the entire European continent.

883
01:28:35,309 --> 01:28:42,329
So, you know, with DDT, we saw the possibility of humans introducing a chemical globally and causing huge damage.

884
01:28:42,569 --> 01:28:46,468
But we didn't really have, let's say, accurate measures of, well,

885
01:28:46,469 --> 01:28:51,839
how much DDT was actually getting applied, whereas in 1986 we were actually tracking these things.

886
01:28:51,839 --> 01:28:57,149
In fact, it was the Swedes who discovered the Chernobyl meltdown by some measurements they were making normally.

887
01:28:57,959 --> 01:29:03,329
And so here we've got a, you know, a continental, if not larger scale impact,

888
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:09,299
but we actually have better estimates and measurements of where the particular radionuclide were deposited.

889
01:29:10,859 --> 01:29:15,059
Even with this data and the fact that we track things like cancer,

890
01:29:15,329 --> 01:29:21,929
there's still a huge amount of uncertainty in terms of how many people have died as a result of the Chernobyl meltdown.

891
01:29:21,929 --> 01:29:29,278
Some of the estimates are as few as a couple of thousand deaths, and some of them are upwards of 100,000 deaths over time from cancer.

892
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:35,369
I think kind of the most plausible estimates are about 16,000 people dead from this single nuclear meltdown.

893
01:29:36,269 --> 01:29:44,239
So here you can. Again, lots of very catastrophic, very tragic events at local all the way up to global scales.

894
01:29:44,259 --> 01:29:48,309
I just want to highlight these things happen way more often than you were probably aware.

895
01:29:48,759 --> 01:29:57,009
So if we just take, for instance, the last 70 years or so, we can see there's been events in Japan, in minimart.

896
01:29:57,219 --> 01:30:03,039
Some of you may have heard of M.I.T., a disease which is methylmercury induced birth defects.

897
01:30:03,939 --> 01:30:09,098
Love Canal in New York we're going to talk about later is kind of a case study in the class, Bhopal,

898
01:30:09,099 --> 01:30:15,939
India, which predates most of you, but occurred at a, let's see, a vulnerable time in my own lifetime.

899
01:30:16,269 --> 01:30:20,199
Some of you may know in the mid eighties or the early 1970s, right here in Michigan,

900
01:30:20,199 --> 01:30:28,629
there was a massive contamination issue with a chemical called PDBs that got into our food supply inadvertently or got into livestock food supply,

901
01:30:28,629 --> 01:30:34,239
and then livestock got into us and we ended up with millions of people exposed right here in Michigan.

902
01:30:34,749 --> 01:30:42,249
So, you know, the story goes on. Of course, we have the tragedy with lead in drinking water in Flint, which, you know, started in 2014.

903
01:30:42,309 --> 01:30:46,959
I don't want to put an end date on there because certainly the impacts are still being absolutely felt.

904
01:30:47,379 --> 01:30:53,589
And then more recently, we've started to realize that some of these miracle chemicals pee fast and pee fast.

905
01:30:53,619 --> 01:31:00,579
These so-called forever chemicals that do really cool stuff when you apply them to materials are not very good to have out in the environment.

906
01:31:00,579 --> 01:31:04,689
And what's they get there? They don't go away. They're sticking around for a long time.

907
01:31:05,919 --> 01:31:11,288
So I want to reiterate, these events are absolutely tragic, but they are also learning opportunities.

908
01:31:11,289 --> 01:31:20,739
And so the good news here, the discovery of the cholera issue around the Broad Street pump really led to the field of

909
01:31:20,739 --> 01:31:25,509
environmental epidemiology was a huge boost towards actually treating our water before we drink it.

910
01:31:26,019 --> 01:31:32,469
The London smog led to some of the very first air pollution standards passed in the world that are protecting health even today.

911
01:31:32,949 --> 01:31:39,129
You know, once we started figuring out that DDT, while it's bad for bugs, is also bad for lots of other organisms,

912
01:31:39,129 --> 01:31:46,269
we actually banned that here in the United States and started to recognize, hey, you know, pesticides are actually designed to kill stuff.

913
01:31:46,659 --> 01:31:49,989
So if I get pesticides on me, are they going to kill me? Well, maybe.

914
01:31:50,259 --> 01:31:56,379
So we started to get a lot more recognition that we shouldn't just use pesticides without understanding their impacts.

915
01:31:56,799 --> 01:32:04,059
And then the Chernobyl led directly to improvements in the way we design and operate nuclear power plants so we can learn from these tragic events.

916
01:32:04,359 --> 01:32:10,899
Of course, our goal in environmental help is to be proactive. We want to predict these things and prevent them from ever happening.

917
01:32:10,899 --> 01:32:17,199
They do happen. We need to learn from them. But ideally our past learnings can help prevent future events.

918
01:32:18,989 --> 01:32:25,409
All right. So starting to wind down here, I just want to reiterate, we've we've talked about hazards kind of to death at this point.

919
01:32:25,409 --> 01:32:33,929
So, you know, I want you to take away from this discussion that chemical and biological and physical hazards are all around us all the time.

920
01:32:34,139 --> 01:32:40,438
And it's our job in environmental health to understand how are we coming into contact with them, how are they getting into our body?

921
01:32:40,439 --> 01:32:44,839
And if they do, are they bad for us? We've talked about exposure.

922
01:32:44,869 --> 01:32:53,539
So again, I need to know how much of a particular stressor or hazard, how often and why exposed and how long do those exposures last?

923
01:32:54,019 --> 01:33:00,139
So I can truly get a sense of of how much contact I have with this potentially harmful material.

924
01:33:01,009 --> 01:33:04,939
I'll take a moment here and just repeat what I said earlier.

925
01:33:04,969 --> 01:33:08,118
So in DHS, we really love to quantify things.

926
01:33:08,119 --> 01:33:15,079
We're a very quantitative discipline. So it's not enough to just say, hey, you've got exposure to this particular chemical.

927
01:33:15,079 --> 01:33:21,999
No, I want to know how much exposure like a number. And so we can express that in a number of different ways, actually.

928
01:33:22,009 --> 01:33:29,899
So for some types of chemical. So for instance, if I'm a community member and there's a factory in the middle of my community,

929
01:33:30,259 --> 01:33:32,809
probably got an environmental justice issue to begin with.

930
01:33:33,139 --> 01:33:39,469
But one of the things I might want to know is, well, how many kilograms of explosive material are stored in that factory?

931
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:47,139
That is a measure of potential harm if is if that particular chemical explodes or for radiation.

932
01:33:47,179 --> 01:33:56,478
So any of you have ever done a radon test? The units there are pico curies of radioactive contaminant per liter of air or water.

933
01:33:56,479 --> 01:34:01,369
So I can express a concentration here in the case of noise.

934
01:34:01,519 --> 01:34:09,319
We present noise in terms of decibels, which are actually a ratio of how loud is something compared to the minimum of sound that a human ear can hear.

935
01:34:10,549 --> 01:34:13,159
And we have lots of different ways of expressing concentration.

936
01:34:13,169 --> 01:34:25,458
So I might say, gosh, how much pesticide am I eating per kilogram of my body weight or how many micrograms of a pesticide are in this,

937
01:34:25,459 --> 01:34:28,879
you know, point 25 kilogram apple that I'm about to eat?

938
01:34:29,599 --> 01:34:36,529
So just to give you some examples here, when we talk about contaminants that we might breathe or drink or ingest,

939
01:34:37,279 --> 01:34:40,579
we are often talking about what is the mass of material.

940
01:34:40,609 --> 01:34:48,289
So if I breathe in a cubic meter of air or, you know, 11,000 liters of air over the course of the day,

941
01:34:48,859 --> 01:34:53,849
how much contamination is in that air and what's the total mass of that contaminant that's getting in me?

942
01:34:53,869 --> 01:34:57,739
So I might say in this air I'm breathing right now, there are you know,

943
01:34:57,739 --> 01:35:05,799
there's 0.1 microgram of a particular chemical that could be harmful per that one cubic meter of air.

944
01:35:05,809 --> 01:35:13,789
So that's one way we can express things. I can also see how many micrograms of a chemical are present in every liter of water that I drink,

945
01:35:14,299 --> 01:35:18,529
or how many grams of a particular pesticide am I ingesting with my food?

946
01:35:18,859 --> 01:35:25,279
I could also say not just in the environment. Probably most everyone in here has had a blood draw at some point in their life.

947
01:35:25,639 --> 01:35:31,849
And for those of you born in Michigan as children, the state by law was supposed to take your blood and see how much lead was in it.

948
01:35:32,419 --> 01:35:40,069
And they were looking at your blood lead levels. So how many micrograms of lead are present in every liter or deciliter of your blood?

949
01:35:40,099 --> 01:35:47,899
These are all ways that we can express contamination. Another way we can do it, which is one that's a little more popular in the lay media,

950
01:35:47,899 --> 01:35:53,358
I would say, is talking about things in terms of parts per million or parts per billion.

951
01:35:53,359 --> 01:36:00,199
So I might say, you know, there's 80 parts per million of this particular chemical that I'm potentially breathing in right now.

952
01:36:01,399 --> 01:36:07,069
So those are all different ways for us to express the intensity or the concentration of a chemical.

953
01:36:07,339 --> 01:36:15,079
And I'll just give you two different examples here. So as I've already indicated, my passion is to protect workers, sort of first and foremost.

954
01:36:15,499 --> 01:36:19,728
So we have the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or OSHA.

955
01:36:19,729 --> 01:36:26,479
Probably everyone has heard of that. OSHA has established a limit for workers who might breathe in formaldehyde.

956
01:36:26,989 --> 01:36:30,469
And so, you know, a job that comes to mind immediately would be embalmers.

957
01:36:30,829 --> 01:36:35,269
People who prepare bodies, they pump formaldehyde in to prevent the body from decaying.

958
01:36:35,749 --> 01:36:44,089
So OSHA has said a worker who has formaldehyde in their workplace air can only be exposed to so much formaldehyde and no more.

959
01:36:44,449 --> 01:36:52,959
And the magic number there based on health studies is point 75, parts of formaldehyde per million parts of air.

960
01:36:52,969 --> 01:36:58,819
So that's a concentration just to give you maybe a sense of what a part per million is.

961
01:36:58,819 --> 01:37:06,348
So one part per million would be the same basically as a little drop of ink in a large kitchen sink filled with water or,

962
01:37:06,349 --> 01:37:11,959
you know, some other fun facts or part per million is the same as one inch in six miles or one minute in two years.

963
01:37:11,959 --> 01:37:19,399
I don't know who sits around and thinks that stuff up, not me. So that's one example of a an exposure limit that's been established.

964
01:37:20,119 --> 01:37:26,389
On the other hand, the Environmental Protection Agency has said every American who is on a public drinking

965
01:37:26,389 --> 01:37:33,049
water supply system can only be exposed at most to ten parts per billion of arsenic.

966
01:37:33,469 --> 01:37:42,619
So, in other words, ten molecules of of arsenic in 1 billion molecules of water and an even smaller fraction here.

967
01:37:43,029 --> 01:37:50,129
So that would be the same basically as a drop of ink in a large swimming pool, a very small amount, you might think, oh, a part per billion.

968
01:37:50,139 --> 01:37:53,348
How bad could that be for me? For some chemicals, that's a non-issue.

969
01:37:53,349 --> 01:37:56,979
For others, one part per billion could be enough to potentially kill you.

970
01:37:57,429 --> 01:38:00,789
Again, it all depends on the particular chemical we're talking about.

971
01:38:01,089 --> 01:38:04,359
So being able to quantify concentration is really important.

972
01:38:04,659 --> 01:38:11,799
So we can then assess the environment and figure out, is this too much or is this an allowable level of this particular hazard?

973
01:38:13,389 --> 01:38:19,869
Dose, as I said earlier, is just our best guess at how much of this stuff is actually getting into our body.

974
01:38:19,899 --> 01:38:26,769
We're not just coming into contact with it. We've either breathed it in or we've drunk it or we've eaten it or otherwise gotten it in our mouth.

975
01:38:27,969 --> 01:38:31,989
And so I just want to reiterate here in our exposure disease framework,

976
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:36,129
we've got some hazard that could be out in the environment if there's no people around.

977
01:38:36,519 --> 01:38:40,869
From an NHS perspective, we're not concerned when people come into contact,

978
01:38:40,869 --> 01:38:46,779
then we have exposure and when that chemical crosses into a person's body, then we've got that dose.

979
01:38:47,949 --> 01:38:51,109
So a couple of things should kind of fall out of that explanation.

980
01:38:51,129 --> 01:38:56,769
One is, if you don't have exposure, you can never have a dose if you never come into contact with this stuff.

981
01:38:56,889 --> 01:39:03,069
There's no way it's getting into your body. So our goal in environmental health is to prevent exposures from ever happening in the first place.

982
01:39:04,119 --> 01:39:12,069
The other is just because a chemical or other hazard is present in the environment, it doesn't necessarily mean that you are exposed.

983
01:39:12,459 --> 01:39:20,009
So here is kind of a hypothetical map of a factory, and like most factories, this one has a smokestack.

984
01:39:20,019 --> 01:39:25,719
The goal of that is to take any toxins and emit them high up in the air where people aren't breathing.

985
01:39:26,289 --> 01:39:29,889
And so here you can see we've got a number of people living around this factory.

986
01:39:29,889 --> 01:39:35,619
So we've got folks on this side, some of whom live quite close and folks on the other side who also live close.

987
01:39:36,129 --> 01:39:41,019
The thing we have to recognize is every place on earth has a prevailing wind direction.

988
01:39:41,619 --> 01:39:43,778
And so this factory has a smokestack.

989
01:39:43,779 --> 01:39:50,589
And as the wind blows across that smokestack, it tends to blow in one direction and it's blowing that contaminant over in this direction.

990
01:39:50,589 --> 01:39:56,349
So these folks are getting a high exposure to this chemical, whatever is coming out of the smokestack,

991
01:39:56,709 --> 01:40:02,649
whereas the folks on the other side upwind have no exposure, even though they live the same distance away.

992
01:40:03,489 --> 01:40:06,608
So you can start to get the sense that just knowing someone lives in a community

993
01:40:06,609 --> 01:40:10,629
or lives near a factory doesn't tell us enough to know if they're exposed or not,

994
01:40:10,959 --> 01:40:16,949
much less if they're actually getting a dose into their body. So again, I'll throw out these terms.

995
01:40:17,249 --> 01:40:22,019
Concentration. And so by concentration, I mean how much of this stuff is in the environment?

996
01:40:23,069 --> 01:40:28,439
I'll talk about exposure, which is how much of this stuff am I coming into contact with?

997
01:40:28,709 --> 01:40:33,269
And then we'll talk about dose, which is how much is actually getting into me and might be able to harm.

998
01:40:35,579 --> 01:40:40,999
All right. Just wrapping up here, I'll say exposures and doses can be actually quite simple.

999
01:40:41,009 --> 01:40:45,148
So remember the last time you went to the dentist, maybe you got an X-ray.

1000
01:40:45,149 --> 01:40:48,419
It was a single X-ray. It was very well documented.

1001
01:40:48,419 --> 01:40:53,549
It was administered by someone who was trained to give you exactly so much radiation and no more.

1002
01:40:54,239 --> 01:41:00,869
It's something you know about and there's records of. So that's a that's a great example of an exposure that's very easy to understand.

1003
01:41:01,289 --> 01:41:05,429
Unfortunately, most of the exposures we deal with in environmental health are much more complex.

1004
01:41:05,429 --> 01:41:13,648
So imagine us trying to understand all the things that you drink in your drinking water over the course of a year, some of it at home,

1005
01:41:13,649 --> 01:41:19,468
some of it at the School of Public Health, some of it where you're traveling and trying to link that to health outcomes.

1006
01:41:19,469 --> 01:41:27,399
It's really, really complicated. And we have to recognize you may get exposed to a chemical in water and you may

1007
01:41:27,419 --> 01:41:31,558
get exposed to that same chemical from breathing air or from eating foods.

1008
01:41:31,559 --> 01:41:34,619
So that chemical can get into you in multiple ways.

1009
01:41:34,979 --> 01:41:39,659
And of course, it's not just one chemical. There are maybe thousands of chemicals you're exposed to.

1010
01:41:39,659 --> 01:41:42,659
So we're dealing with mixtures of different chemicals.

1011
01:41:42,899 --> 01:41:46,259
We're dealing with the fact that all of us do different things every day.

1012
01:41:46,499 --> 01:41:53,188
Some are exposures, some do not. Some of the chemicals we may not even know enough to ask, are you exposed to that?

1013
01:41:53,189 --> 01:41:56,849
And almost all of these exposures are going to be very poorly documented.

1014
01:41:57,509 --> 01:42:01,469
So for us to be able to say this chemical in drinking water causes cancer,

1015
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:08,399
you can tell that's that's a really challenging question to even understand what are the exposures, much less what's the linkage there.

1016
01:42:09,629 --> 01:42:13,108
So why do we need to care about exposures? Well, let me give you an example.

1017
01:42:13,109 --> 01:42:17,309
How many of you know that carbon monoxide is in it's fix in? In other words, if you breathe enough, it will kill you.

1018
01:42:17,819 --> 01:42:22,769
Okay, that's good. I want all the hands to go up. Carbon monoxide can kill you. You should have a carbon monoxide detector in your home.

1019
01:42:23,249 --> 01:42:27,028
Is that enough? It's not. Does that tell you anything about.

1020
01:42:27,029 --> 01:42:30,929
Well, how much carbon monoxide can I breathe without dying? Because that's a number I'm interested in.

1021
01:42:31,229 --> 01:42:36,358
How much does it take to be dangerous? Where am I going to get exposed to carbon monoxide?

1022
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:40,379
What are the sources? When might get exposed? Does this happen while I'm sleeping?

1023
01:42:40,379 --> 01:42:47,429
Is it? Well, I'm driving my car. And how would I actually go out and measure carbon monoxide to know if I'm exposed to the safe level or not?

1024
01:42:47,429 --> 01:42:50,788
So just knowing that a chemical is potentially harmful isn't enough.

1025
01:42:50,789 --> 01:42:55,379
We need to know enough to be able to measure this and understand exposures to it.

1026
01:42:56,039 --> 01:43:00,749
And again, carbon monoxide is a cheap example because we know a lot about carbon monoxide,

1027
01:43:00,749 --> 01:43:07,589
but there's these other 84,999 chemicals that we don't know so much about, so huge challenges in front of us.

1028
01:43:07,589 --> 01:43:13,739
And yes, so again, just connecting the dots here, the movement of pollutants in the environment,

1029
01:43:14,099 --> 01:43:18,509
that's the part of the exposure disease framework where we're talking about concentrations.

1030
01:43:18,509 --> 01:43:27,448
Just how much of this stuff is out there not in contact with people when we talk about contact between a person and a contaminant.

1031
01:43:27,449 --> 01:43:31,679
So I got some contaminated water on my skin. Let's say now I've got exposure.

1032
01:43:32,099 --> 01:43:37,619
And when we come to dose, that's how much of this stuff actually got through my skin and into my bloodstream.

1033
01:43:39,649 --> 01:43:42,829
Finally, I'll just say, you know, this dose response relationship,

1034
01:43:42,829 --> 01:43:48,408
we have this whole subdiscipline of toxicology that's dedicated to trying to understand

1035
01:43:48,409 --> 01:43:53,269
how much of a particular agent does it take to cause a particular health outcome.

1036
01:43:53,899 --> 01:44:01,189
Again, ranging anywhere from, gosh, I, you know, I got temporary blindness to I have permanent lung disease to death.

1037
01:44:01,699 --> 01:44:06,239
And once we have a dose response curve for multiple chemicals, we can start to compare them.

1038
01:44:06,259 --> 01:44:10,038
So Chemical B here has a very flat dose response curve,

1039
01:44:10,039 --> 01:44:14,929
meaning we can have a pretty big increase in dose and there's not much of an increase in the response.

1040
01:44:15,229 --> 01:44:22,188
So this is not a particularly toxic chemical, whereas chemical a you can see the dose response curve here is quite steep,

1041
01:44:22,189 --> 01:44:26,449
meaning a small change in dose can give a huge change in the response.

1042
01:44:26,449 --> 01:44:30,858
That's a chemical we're going to want to be concerned about because a slight variation

1043
01:44:30,859 --> 01:44:34,699
in how much exposure you get could result in a huge variation in your disease risk.

1044
01:44:36,289 --> 01:44:38,809
All right. So again, hazards and exposure assessment.
