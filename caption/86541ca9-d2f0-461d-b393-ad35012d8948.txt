00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,970
Hello and welcome to the final session of the How to Apply to Graduate School video series.

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:18,170
So if you recall, we're in the last stage of our application process and in this video  I will outline the tasks to be completed in months from November

3
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:25,640
through January and for the month of November will be making our finalizations and during the month of December

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,460
you will submit your application, and in January,

5
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:37,130
you complete your free application for federal student aid also explore other ways to fund your education.

6
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:44,990
So referring to our task outline that you've been referring to, referring to throughout your application process,

7
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:55,440
this chart will now serve as a checklist or you can create a checklist from this chart to identify the remaining tasks that need to be completed.

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,910
So like such, you will utilize the chart from your previous that you created earlier,

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:11,070
and you will outline everything that needs to be completed for the remainder of your application process.

10
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:20,610
Finalizing your college applications, make sure your GRE scores have been submitted to your prospective programs and uploaded to your applications.

11
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:26,700
Begin finalizing your personal statements. You want to review your essays for grammar mistakes.

12
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,620
You want to look at soundness. Does the essay make sense? How is the flow of the essay?

13
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:40,200
Also, are your essays short and to the point? Are your ideas hidden in a sea of words or are they straightforward?

14
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:50,020
Also made sure your personal statement reflects who you are as a person and make sure they are the best representation of you.

15
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:58,570
Additionally, review your resume as well for grammar mistakes and soundness as well. Check with SOPHAS or

16
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:04,480
the respective application portal that you're using to ensure that just that transcripts have been accepted.

17
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,730
Lastly, you want to make sure that your recommenders have sent their letters of recommendations

18
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:21,700
And for you. So after reviewing all of your application materials, you can now proudly and confidently submit yuor college application.

19
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:30,820
The last step can apply to graduate school is complete your free application for student aid, commonly referred to as FASFA.

20
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:37,750
So after submitting your college applications, now it's time to complete your free application for student aid.

21
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:43,900
So free application for student aid is the application administered by the Department of Education, that

22
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:50,830
checks for student eligibility for federal grant scholarships, workstudy and/or loans. Completing a FASFA

23
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,040
is not mandatory, but it is strongly recommended.

24
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,640
Many students are apprehensive about completing a FAFSA because they associate the application with borrowing loans,

25
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,810
Although completing a FAFSA assesses a student eligibility for loans

26
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:10,900
this does not mean you are obligated to take out your loan awards.  As stated compleiting a FAFSA

27
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,320
but also evaluates a students as well as a student's financial circumstances to

28
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:23,140
see if they qualify for maybe work study or a need based scholarship or grants.

29
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:28,030
The notion of taking out loans has gotten a bad reputation.

30
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:34,780
Those that take out loans should not be ashamed or regretful. Although paying off loans is not ideal,

31
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:40,620
is a valid method for funding is one college experience.

32
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:47,880
If you have to take out student loans, follow the three R's to accepting loans. You want to be responsible.

33
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,620
Create a budget for the school year year and only accept what you need based on your budget.

34
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,040
Be sure to stick to your budget throughout the school year.

35
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,980
Make sure that what you're taking out is relevant to your education. Your loan money, strictly covers

36
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:09,450
your education expenses, such as rent, tuition bills, food study abroad, opportunities and so on.

37
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:16,710
If possible, try to find a part time job to either try to find a part time jobs,

38
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:22,020
either through your university or through an organization that is relevant to your area of interest.

39
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:33,390
This is a great way to make extra money and gain experience. And lastly, start the repayment process sooner rather than later.

40
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,070
If you start the payments on your student start paying on the interest for your student loans

41
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:45,100
now this will prevent accruing interest while you're in school.

42
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,260
It is also important that students search for funding opportunities outside of the financial aid package

43
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:56,020
they have been awarded. Oftentimes students feel, they students are

44
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,310
awarded financial aid that only covers tuition.

45
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,790
Awards may not cover the cost of housing or books

46
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,720
and students are left to pay the additional cost themselves.

47
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:14,710
Searching for other sources of funding can assist student and cover these additional fees.

48
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:23,470
Everything helps.  Applying for a five hundred dollar scholarship is just as important as flying for a ten thousand dollar scholarship.

49
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:32,240
And no matter how small or large, makes a difference by five, about a five hundred dollar award could cover books or at least

50
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,300
one months rent. So other ways to fund your education, search

51
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:47,610
professional organizational websites such as the American School Health Association or the American College of Epidemiology.

52
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:56,400
The Smart the Smart Scholarship is a full scholarship offered by the Department of Defense to students, public health students

53
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,090
interested in epi or biostats that can apply to scholarships such as these.

54
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:08,280
Also look at assistantships. Assisting a university faculty

55
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,890
with teaching or part-time reasearch can cover partial tuition as well.

56
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:18,810
Working as a resident assistant is a great way to cover your housing costs.

57
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,260
during graduate school.

58
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:32,840
And lastly, working a full time job and going to school is not ideal, but you utilizing your job's education program to also assist do so.

59
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:40,250
Possibly you want to work full-time and maybe go to school part-time or vice versa.

60
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,680
So we have now reached the end of our about How to Apply to Graduate School video series.

61
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,220
I want to emphasize that making the decision to apply to graduate school is a huge milestone.

62
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:58,140
Applying to graduate schools means you have decided to go above and beyond the status quo.

63
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:06,000
I hope you all have found these videos to be both insightful and useful in your future quest in applying to graduate school.

64
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,080

65
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,450
