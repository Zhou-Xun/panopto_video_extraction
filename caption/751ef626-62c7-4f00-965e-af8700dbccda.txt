1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:54,540
No matter what kind of items that are indispensable N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A.,

2
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:42,359
N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A. Circuit of that.

3
00:01:42,360 --> 00:02:20,500
And I think it's a superb representation in the right direction, and it's something that I don't think enough people.

4
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:57,310
And you're for to have confidence.

5
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,310
That means you don't have to be here.

6
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:08,970
Yeah, I know.

7
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:18,840
And I'm just not there.

8
00:03:22,250 --> 00:04:04,470
Yeah, that's because they can't do anything in the basement, you know, the remote not working.

9
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:14,990
And it's a little bit. I don't have to worry.

10
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:22,440
Thank you until the morning.

11
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:36,180
And I just want to stop by and welcome to the program because you came out of office hours right after the election for me to stop violence.

12
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,360
And you know that's true.

13
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,250
And have a great weekend. Bless you.

14
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:01,790
Welcome. Thank you.

15
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:19,250
And. Okay.

16
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,560
Hi, everyone. My name is Dr. Anthony Energy. I did semester for public health back there for you.

17
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,180
Welcome to class.

18
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:35,660
So today we started a little late because I was having some issues with the projector because I'm an idiot, but basically, like, try to come on time.

19
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,879
So again, my name's Assad. I'm actually a law student.

20
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,600
I'm not a student in the public health school, but I have like a background in health care consulting.

21
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:51,229
That's why I'm teaching this class. And I think we can just go around the room with everyone wanting to use themselves.

22
00:05:51,230 --> 00:06:03,890
We can start with you. I would say it's like your epistemology, your answers to that would go that way.

23
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:10,850
I am the master ambassador of the House Environmental Health Sciences.

24
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,620
Yeah, I'm Sarah and I'm an equity program.

25
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:29,480
And here in the situation and I am in the program as well, I'm a medical student,

26
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:40,100
which shapes a lot of how I think about this family going with my seven year old in general approves of the treatment.

27
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:48,870
I understand I'm a first year general practitioner and that was overseer general sir.

28
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,879
Oh, yes. Oh, sorry time.

29
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:02,580
Yeah, I guess you're general slow abortion in the first year and two hypothetical students all of a sudden,

30
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:12,710
I don't know for sure all these different Emerson was like first your example on what you do credit program MPH Evanston.

31
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,870
Um, hi, my name is National Health. I'm from General National.

32
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:25,430
I'm doing problems in a lot of New York in the foreign component.

33
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,960
I am and I'm also. Okay, well, nice to meet you all.

34
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:38,419
I'm so today we're going to be going over canvas and then I'll introduce you to the policy lab,

35
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,020
which is kind of the assignment we have on a weekly basis in this class.

36
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:49,250
And then I'll talk about some other group assignments. You'll have some next steps for next week and then I can answer any questions you might have.

37
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,080
So we just did this. So basically, like if you ever have any questions, you can email me.

38
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:06,709
Please use the following format, which is have public held 513 in the subject line and then expect 24 to 48 hours for response.

39
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,870
You can email me or you can email Professor Kennedy with questions. And then for more general questions,

40
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:16,370
I would recommend posting them to the discussion board on canvas just because that's

41
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,060
where everyone else can see them as well that other people may have the same questions.

42
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,720
All right, so now I'll go over canvas. So this is the classic canvas side.

43
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,390
If you go to the main page, you'll see all of them.

44
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:41,080
You'll see the syllabus right here in the top left corner. There's no downloadable PDF syllabus.

45
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,690
It's all just like on canvas. So you can click on that and you can scroll through it.

46
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:56,030
It'll have information about the professor, all of us, GSI, and then there's also the course pack.

47
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:01,730
So the course pack is basically going to be where all of your materials will be for this semester.

48
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:09,590
Every case will be in there. All your readings are there. So if you just like click there, then you can buy it from Harvard Business Publishing.

49
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,810
If you don't have an account yet, I would suggest creating an account and then buying the course back.

50
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:26,090
And then other than that, there's other things in the syllabus course goals, incompetence, use, and requirements and grading.

51
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,589
So I'm going to go through requirements and grading real quick other than the policy

52
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,730
levels which we'll be having on a weekly basis and which you guys will work on in class,

53
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,210
there are also going to be some individual assignments.

54
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,740
The first of those is the health system assignment, which is due on February 24th.

55
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,880
That will count as 25% of your final grade. So it's a big assignment.

56
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:54,300
And basically you're just going to be taking. A health care delivery organization or a health care nonprofit.

57
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:00,120
And then comparing and contrasting the organization structure and function of health care

58
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:05,040
and public health and regulatory system as they relate to that specific organization.

59
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,950
So that's still like a while away, some months, but just keep that on your radar.

60
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:23,400
And I would say just start brainstorming kind of what organization you think you'd want to work on and then recourse assessment.

61
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,220
Did you guys get sent a pre course assessment by Sheila? Okay.

62
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,310
So I would recommend just feeling that out as soon as possible if you haven't already yet.

63
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,130
So the class will also be divided into kind of two main sections.

64
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:48,450
The first section is the structure and function of public health and regulatory systems, and the second is policymaking, advocacy and negotiation.

65
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:54,060
Each of these sections will go over it over several weeks and there'll be several cases on each topic.

66
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,420
All right. So now I'm going to talk about kind of like the main component of this class, which is the case analysis.

67
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:12,660
Each week you're going to have around 40 to 50 minutes all in class to create a case presentation for the specific case that you read for that week.

68
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,780
There are different ways to approach each case, but each presentation will kind of have the same basic structure,

69
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:25,800
and all of the information for these presentations will be in the case itself, and there won't be any need for you to do any external research.

70
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,229
If the slides ever turn in a way there'll be mark played and for each day to late, they're late.

71
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,900
There's going to be a specific amount of points that are taken off.

72
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,720
I'm going to go over that in a little bit, but I think it's something like 5 to 10 points.

73
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,690
And then in order to get credit for the class, you have to attend the discussion section.

74
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:51,360
You have to work on your team and you have to turn in your set of slides at the end of the section,

75
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,440
and then students can commit their slide decks to students while you guys are in the previous section to this doesn't apply to you.

76
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,440
But basically there's a Wednesday and Friday section of this class.

77
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,510
The Wednesday sections. First we just tell them not to submit their cases to you guys.

78
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:15,770
All right. So now I'm going to go over the main sections of the case analysis, situation,

79
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,470
questions and brainstorming, hypothesis, proof and action, and then alternatives.

80
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,449
So we'll start with situation. So in any case that you work on,

81
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:32,790
the first thing that you want to do after you read the case is identify if the situation is a problem, a decision or an evaluation.

82
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,050
And if you want to see more about the definition of each of those three, they're listed here.

83
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:43,950
Basically, you want to figure out what the issue is that you're working on and how to approach it.

84
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:47,310
And it's important. In order to do that, you first have to identify it.

85
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:54,900
But what we would recommend is not to spend too much time on this specific section just because it's only worth one point.

86
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:05,040
So even if you get it wrong, it's okay. And as long as you kind of let us know what the problem, decision or evaluation is,

87
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,920
and you have a way of justifying that and you can explain it, we can say that we'll still give you credit for this section.

88
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,580
Any questions about this? Or about anything else I said I'd realized I didn't party at.

89
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,110
No. All right.

90
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:32,720
So, for example, one situation could be the opioid epidemic, which was one of the cases that the students did last year.

91
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:39,470
So when you're stating a problem, then you have to say why it's a problem, right?

92
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:47,900
So the reason the opioid epidemic is a problem is because between 1999 and 2017, 400,000 people died from it.

93
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,010
And despite increasing knowledge of the problem,

94
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,500
the last decade still saw a lot of increases in overdose deaths from synthetic opioid, such as fentanyl.

95
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:07,080
And that kind of speaks to the magnitude of this issue. And then we don't have an example for decision or evaluation.

96
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:14,570
But similarly, if you identified that you have a decision to make or an evaluation to conduct for an existing intervention,

97
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:21,110
you would have to state kind of why that evaluation needs to be conducted and for decisions.

98
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:26,270
What are the different what are the different aspects of the decision that have to be made?

99
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,230
The next section is required question and supporting context.

100
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:40,220
So this is basically what questions do you need to answer to adequately assess the situation?

101
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:45,560
So, for example, if there's a problem, you would have to know kind of what the problem is,

102
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,530
who's responsible and what exactly you're trying to address.

103
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:54,140
If it's a decision, you would have to know what the decision options are and kind of what is at stake.

104
00:14:54,530 --> 00:15:03,920
And for evaluation, you would have to know who is responsible for the evaluation and what are the criteria on which the evaluation will be conducted.

105
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,070
Right. And then one important part I'd like to highlight is that with the vast majority of this case,

106
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:13,970
these cases, there will be issues related to health equity and also to systemic racism.

107
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:20,029
And these are issues that you will have to highlight and talk about because they're central to every case.

108
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:27,570
And health equity and systemic racism are both. Central to addressing public health policy in the United States in general.

109
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,510
So these are things that you will have to bring up in the majority of cases.

110
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,350
Okay. So examples of questions could be like, what is the problem you're trying to address?

111
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:48,059
Right? So in the case of the opioid epidemic, the problem would be an increase in overdose deaths in synthetic opioid,

112
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,090
such as IMS, or least illicitly manufactured fentanyl.

113
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,870
Other questions that you might have could be who is responsible?

114
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,730
And that could be a variety of different people and a variety of different factors.

115
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:06,180
So we would recommend just kind of asking the question and then also listing some of those factors.

116
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:14,130
That being said, though, when I'm showing you these examples, there are multiple slides on each of these topics like situation, question,

117
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:23,819
etc. But really you should only have one slide per topic and at the end of the class you should be submitting a document or a PowerPoint.

118
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:30,600
That's a total of six slides. The reason we ask this is because we just like to keep it short and sweet because it's easier for grading.

119
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,100
And also, I'm sure it's less painful for you guys than to make like a 20 slide presentation.

120
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:45,209
And then health equity questions could be how to reach marginalized communities or how to ensure

121
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:49,200
that the opioid epidemic doesn't disproportionately impact communities that are marginalized.

122
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,580
The next section is your hypothesis.

123
00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:02,290
For your hypothesis, you just have to identify it and describe how it will impact the problem, the decision or the evaluation.

124
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:08,620
This is honestly the most important section of the slide deck because it's not only is it worth the most points,

125
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:13,840
but it also kind of is your solution or your proposed solution to the problem.

126
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:21,700
So make sure to kind of think through this part really well and make sure again to talk about how you will address any

127
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:29,710
issues related to health equity and systemic racism and incorporate that into your hypothesis and your proposed solution.

128
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:41,229
Examples of hypotheses for hypotheses for the opioid epidemic could be improving physicians pain management training, right?

129
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:51,820
So when you're stating this hypothesis, don't only state the statement, but then also talk about what the differing.

130
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,450
I guess sub sub aspects of that statement are.

131
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:03,780
So for example, if you're talking about improving physicians pain management training, you want to talk about how exactly you would do that.

132
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,280
So giving powerful pain medication and priority to patients who are experiencing

133
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,810
severe pain or administering medication in a systematic and standardized approach.

134
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,770
Or training physicians to recognize addiction to opioids.

135
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,800
And also helping patients manage withdrawal symptoms.

136
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,490
And then these are some other examples of hypotheses like increasing transparency could be another example.

137
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:37,370
And then you would have to explain how you would do that. The next section is proof and action.

138
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,540
Proof is the evidence that you have to support your hypothesis.

139
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:47,300
And action is discussing how you would actually implement the decision that you're recommending.

140
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:52,310
Right. So for proof, you would basically need to present data to support your hypothesis.

141
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:58,850
None of this data is something you have to do external research on because we don't want you to have to do that for any of these cases.

142
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,480
But any data you're using can be found within the cases.

143
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,370
And then if there's anything that you think would be helpful to know for any specific case.

144
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,140
But it's not like in the case itself. Then you can.

145
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:19,290
Basically just say that this evidence would be helpful and I would like to see it, but it's not in the case.

146
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,080
Right. But you don't actually have to go out and find it.

147
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:31,780
So for the opioid epidemic example, that proves to be stats on opioid consumption, overdoses and deaths by race and economic status.

148
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:39,220
And then in other thing would be data on financial ties between opioid manufacturers, physicians and also advocacy groups.

149
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,390
And action would be how your decision is implemented.

150
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,320
For example,

151
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:55,209
opioid prescription and pain management will follow revised guidelines adopted by professional societies and in states health departments.

152
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,840
And the FDA should have one shared central system which allows them to collect data.

153
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,629
Basically just talking about like how the hypothesis will be implemented and also

154
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:09,070
what actions will be taken specifically in order to implement that hypothesis.

155
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,060
Any questions? You got any of this? No.

156
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:26,560
Okay. The next section is alternatives and weaknesses.

157
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:34,940
This is where you're going to describe what the weaknesses are of your hypothesis and then also identify two alternatives to what you're recommending.

158
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,549
So when you're identifying the weaknesses,

159
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:45,080
you just have to talk about how what some of the drawbacks could be with your hypothesis, what are some of the pitfalls?

160
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,940
And then for alternatives,

161
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:59,060
you want to talk about some of the other hypotheses that could potentially be either better or worse implementations for your specific solution.

162
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:06,240
And you can you should describe how the alternatives might be stronger or weaker responses to the case.

163
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,750
But you don't have to identify individual weaknesses for each of those alternatives.

164
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:20,420
So these are just some examples of alternatives. I'll just let you guys read them for a minute and then I'll go to the next slide.

165
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:45,680
And then these are some examples of weaknesses. All right.

166
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:55,350
Okay. So as I said before, your slide outline shouldn't be more than six slides.

167
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:00,780
That would include the cover slide. And the cover slide obviously would have your names.

168
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,620
And who are the group members on your group.

169
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:13,410
And then your next five slides should be the situation, the questions and brainstorming, your hypothesis, your proof of action.

170
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:20,160
Proof and action, and then your alternatives. All right.

171
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:25,710
So this is a late word policy. Obviously, we encourage you to submit all of your work on time.

172
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:33,510
But in this situation that that's not possible. Each student is eligible for one extension for any reason for these assignments.

173
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:39,000
So these assignments listed here are the assignments that you have in addition to your weekly policy labs.

174
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,100
And you can have a three day extension for any reason for one of these.

175
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:50,310
So for example, like if you want to call in sick and you're not actually sick, you want to fake it like that.

176
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:59,219
You can use that as a reason for extension for any one of these. And the additional extensions will be available in emergency situations.

177
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,280
But this three day extension is like regardless of what the reason is.

178
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,520
So you can ask for it and we will like ask any questions.

179
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:15,180
Okay. So, policy lab attendance. Um,

180
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,320
try to come to these discussion sections on time because this is where you're going to be working

181
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,760
on the policy labs and you're going to be submitting the labs at the end of the section.

182
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,440
So just make sure you come on time. Make sure you come to as many as possible.

183
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:39,160
But in the event that you're ever not at one, that you can submit a presentation yourself for that case a week after the policy lab,

184
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,670
and you're allowed to do this up to two times the semester. Okay.

185
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:52,340
Any questions about the late work or attendance policy? No.

186
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,710
All right. Okay.

187
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:03,560
So my office hours were originally 2 to 4 on Thursdays.

188
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:09,640
But I talked to the section that met on Wednesday, and they said that most for most of them, it didn't work.

189
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,020
I think for the epidemiology students, you guys have classes during that time, is that right?

190
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,700
Yeah. All right.

191
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:26,859
So I'm going to send out a survey to all of you guys for office hours and just let me know what time was best for you and what whenever,

192
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,670
like the majority of people are available, I'll set office hours for that time.

193
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,440
If anyone isn't available during that time, just make sure to email me with any questions.

194
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:40,690
I'll try to be flexible with that. And then the next thing we're going to do is sign up for groups.

195
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,620
So. In the next 10 minutes.

196
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:52,230
Can you guys just like get yourselves into groups of 4 to 5 people and then I'll give you or I just like put a sign inside a copier,

197
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:59,840
just tell me the names of your group members and write the numbers. And if she believes. So you can start now.

198
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:17,580
Yeah. Okay.

199
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:26,430
Right. So you can.

200
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,740
You can.

201
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:49,890
You can, actually.

202
00:25:51,260 --> 00:26:05,090
Yeah. I mean that, really. I was very overloaded with resources like this, so.

203
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:10,040
Yeah. Is everyone in groups already?

204
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,540
Raise your hand if you're not on the spot. Okay.

205
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,570
Anyone who's not in a good reason, I don't know.

206
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:33,590
All right, cool. So this puts you in groups. All right, I'll start with this group over here.

207
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,550
Can you guys just, like, let me know your names and I'll send you to groups like on cannabis control fishing.

208
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:59,260
All right. You agree with six? Eight. Victoria Fisher, and then your name.

209
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:07,250
Take you to a page to 80 seconds.

210
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,770
All right, so here you'll be in a.

211
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:27,360
So you know, the first one, T.J.?

212
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:36,730
The first one. Okay.

213
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,960
The next group will be six B, we can start with you. You know, start the first one.

214
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:53,590
The last one. Three years are very obvious.

215
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:01,210
Mm hmm. Yeah.

216
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:14,100
Yeah, that's true.

217
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:28,840
So, Malika, they're on the train. You're doing okay?

218
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:32,680
No, this group will be sexy. What's your name?

219
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,540
Tanya. T on the s t t h.

220
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,850
Ribbon. Yeah, that's right.

221
00:28:41,480 --> 00:29:13,580
And then in 1989, your friends are starting to realize that you are the second second one this year or so.

222
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:24,140
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, you're right.

223
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:29,280
Yeah, I totally agree with you. I'm not saying anything.

224
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:34,570
Right, like all of you right now. And then you guys will be grouped 60.

225
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:52,720
You know, their names are connected to a society that we don't know, but there can be no specific guidance or others, I think.

226
00:29:53,510 --> 00:30:01,000
And then for the next letter, I made it more attention.

227
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,310
I don't know. We have more young men.

228
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:28,389
A lot of my first one, that's one of the big ones, know that those girls at my age or anything like that, I didn't watch them.

229
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:43,170
So I know like I knew that everything was like, yeah, I mean, I still feel like, you know.

230
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:53,080
Yeah. I was gonna come there and say there is such a huge society.

231
00:30:54,550 --> 00:31:09,020
And I think what I feel like, I just feel like it was.

232
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:13,929
It was like, you know, written by you guys.

233
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:17,350
I know. Like, what groups are out there. All right, cool.

234
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:33,219
Yeah. Six, eight, six, b, 16, 16. I didn't even know, you know, who and my guys were.

235
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,810
Just real quick, next week, just come prepared to conduct a case analysis.

236
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,240
There's a court there's a case in the court's back called the Geisinger Health System case.

237
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:48,760
It's actually also related to the opioid epidemic. Make sure you come having read that next week.

238
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:53,740
And then I also recommend reading how to analyze a case.

239
00:31:54,550 --> 00:32:02,880
But you don't have to just a recommended reading, but it could help with your first case analysis and then yeah, that's all.

240
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:07,300
Any questions? Nothing.

241
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:17,850
Yeah. All right, well, you guys can go. So I'm very proud.

242
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,410
Oh, really? Well, actually, it's ten.

243
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,830
It's 1030, right? Yeah. All right. I think I should hold you guys for at least 15 more minutes.

244
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:48,420
All right. You know, if I even go. Everything I got is really I don't know yet.

245
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:57,780
It should be I don't know what it's like to be in this.

246
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,540
You get to see all this like a little.

247
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:11,200
Mostly the story is over, so.

248
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:25,320
Yeah. I think that's fair.

249
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:49,570
Yeah. If you go through my files right here, you would have to know that we ran programs in 2018 with this algorithm.

250
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:54,589
You know what? I'm going to ask Professor Kennedy. She's going to put his life and all of the sections.

251
00:33:54,590 --> 00:34:06,330
But she also just emails her to. I was just like, Hey, this is where he's going to be able to rehearse.

252
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:10,740
And I was just like, I don't know what comes after.

253
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:16,950
Like, you're going to be like, I'm going to play with you.

254
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:25,390
I also got one more thing. If you want to like, just refresh who was in your group on canvas for two people.

255
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:32,340
And then I think on the student view, it doesn't say project group, it just says groups.

256
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:43,470
So if you click on groups then you'll be able to see was in you. I'm going to go out, be like, well.

257
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:51,630
Oh, my God. It was like the lightest you can do.

258
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,700
Anything is possible.

259
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:10,020
You know, I don't know what it's like, you know, like just going to be, like, knowing.

260
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:26,070
Yeah, that's good. I think that, you know, this much going on, my son was like crazy that was watching my peers to start doing my like, I don't know.

261
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:38,690
I really like to ask about that for a second or two.

262
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,430
Okay. Well, I think what we discuss now on then, I'm trying to figure that out actually.

263
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:49,680
You'll be applauding. Yeah, we'll be able but and when they're uploaded we'll send you get an email to let you know.

264
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,890
Oh, thank you. No problem.

265
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:08,310
So, yeah, I think that this one has just made everybody that wasn't really you.

266
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:17,850
I don't know. Like, you know, she's like a little prep princess.

267
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:23,150
It's one of those people. Yeah. Undergrad.

268
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:30,770
Yeah. Lot of interaction from this.

269
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,640
So. But my class is like one.

270
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:42,270
Oh, yeah, that's right.

271
00:36:50,320 --> 00:37:01,340
But even though I know they're so tiny, so badly, they're all early to start coming on with this week.

272
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,640
But I don't mind that like, other programs don't do interviews, so I just.

273
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:13,060
I find out now. Yeah.

274
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:19,610
When I think.

275
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:23,380
Yeah, no problem. But I miss that.

276
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:37,810
You two. Yeah.

277
00:37:47,220 --> 00:39:00,800
Yeah. And I are.

278
00:39:52,110 --> 00:40:05,330
But at the time I.

279
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:28,040
Very well for.

280
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,930
And closing.

281
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:56,590
Very well.

282
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:38,500
Wow. It might not be my father and me.

283
00:41:52,680 --> 00:42:00,640
So I.

284
00:42:50,780 --> 00:43:06,550
That's one part of the puzzle and one of the big ones.

285
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:17,310
That's I hear.

286
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:28,640
And. What?

287
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:47,590
But now they're doing all that they need, the more.

288
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:57,190
They were. Very.

289
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:16,060
That's. I know that.

290
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:57,490
But. I.

291
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:26,370
One. You know, I'm with them for over.

292
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:39,340
Very, very well. The.

293
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:56,240
Only about 30 or 40.

294
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:09,080
I mean, you could be aware of it.

295
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:26,840
I'm very confident that. I would be.

296
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:40,630
They have already been. And.

297
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:50,620
I don't know. Yeah, I'll take that.

298
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:57,700
I have to wrap it up.

299
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:14,850
Later. Part one.

300
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,380
I knew.

301
00:47:30,920 --> 00:48:06,100
I didn't know what. One are.

302
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:18,400
Has been a year and.

303
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:29,570
Nothing. Nothing. And they have nothing.

304
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:42,060
I on the more and one.

305
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:58,850
For me. Not only that.

306
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:15,050
535,000.

307
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:30,150
I believe. The.

308
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:51,610
Not. Think the number one and number two, that.

309
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:01,260
On the other.

310
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:26,860
All of them are. That's how.

311
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:39,350
But not. I don't know how.

312
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:52,030
And. There are things that have.

313
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:05,180
So you have a lot of.

314
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:41,030
Am. So they have a very.

315
00:51:49,390 --> 00:52:36,990
We have a plan. N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A.

316
00:52:54,290 --> 00:53:03,530
I have never said a word that had.

317
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:32,930
And like I said, they're not here for the moment.

318
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:50,760
And I have no matter where they are and how they survive.

319
00:53:50,760 --> 00:54:36,540
But that I haven't seen any evidence that I think that.

320
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:52,750
Yeah, I think you might not like that they got that right that.

321
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,450
Furthermore, in all of the.

322
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:16,510
I think I heard the.

323
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:32,180
I. And I.

324
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:47,130
My personal. That.

325
00:55:55,270 --> 00:56:05,410
Now some of you are out there in the.

326
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:26,740
I think I really do think that.

327
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:53,010
Oh, yeah. Oh, well, you know, I think I have something that I should.

328
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:06,170
Of. Holding back that.

329
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:35,700
And. Not.

330
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:37,250
That's right. I was at home with my husband.

331
00:58:38,480 --> 00:59:02,160
I heard our. And I was like, oh, yeah.

332
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:55,830
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

333
00:59:56,470 --> 01:00:13,710
And I think it's also true that there's the United States.

334
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:34,060
Whole. I.

335
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:53,370
We're not. I.

336
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:35,550
But I. And.

337
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:39,730
Level two. There.

338
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:10,590
And. That.

339
01:03:24,990 --> 01:04:21,980
No, I didn't. I.

340
01:04:43,010 --> 01:05:03,740
And I don't. We're going to.

341
01:05:37,510 --> 01:06:02,130
And then. Okay.

342
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:35,180
I. And.

343
01:06:56,710 --> 01:07:07,030
The. The.

344
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:46,040
I think. American.

345
01:07:50,730 --> 01:08:02,020
There. Our.

346
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:34,110
To your.

347
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:50,130
One. You're not.

348
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:01,780
When you get through that.

349
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:36,630
I can't. The.

350
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:45,030
Because I heard that.

351
01:09:54,170 --> 01:10:04,890
I. I remember one time.

352
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:37,050
I'm. And we're doing.

353
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:50,240
We're. I.

354
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:12,390
I. I.

355
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:30,660
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

356
01:11:33,880 --> 01:12:45,900
And then. Now I know that there are a lot more than 700 or 140 or 50, 140, 530, 330 531.

357
01:12:46,050 --> 01:13:06,000
And. But I.

358
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:19,020
No. I really haven't heard from him.

359
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:33,050
Not. Yeah, I like that.

360
01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:50,750
Yeah. Have you have a better time that.

361
01:13:58,210 --> 01:14:04,950
Now put them all together.

362
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:23,100
It is another. I want to look at your.

363
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:52,430
I know that. I wonder what I would have.

364
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:06,170
And, uh. I know.

365
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:18,210
You didn't have to do one, and.

366
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:43,920
All right. And nobody on the other side of the fence.

367
01:15:54,210 --> 01:16:02,070
I. And.

368
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:14,430
I have a of.

369
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:30,830
And I think the American.

370
01:16:45,980 --> 01:17:02,010
But then I remember that the night that I had.

371
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:16,250
I like to work right now.

372
01:17:18,360 --> 01:18:04,530
But it is. And over the park on Highway 135.

373
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:13,060
I don't know how I know that I.

374
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:19,930
But. Okay.

375
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:33,950
They want to. But I.

376
01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:39,660
Are you?

377
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:59,040
Religion. I.

378
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:14,670
In the back of your mind?

379
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:22,370
Yeah, I think so.

380
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:36,110
I wouldn't know what. You're.

381
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:55,770
I think that there are other things that.
