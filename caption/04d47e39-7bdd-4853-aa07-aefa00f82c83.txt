1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,420
Maybe we can help you with that.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:26,070
Yeah, maybe I should get hung up and I'm like, okay, good morning, everybody.

3
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:39,480
So you have a quit. It was just hope it on and it's on campus.

4
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,249
All you need to do is download the spreadsheet.

5
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,840
That is, you've answered a couple of questions.

6
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:58,770
Upload the study you have a the it will close totally you you probably will need about 15 minutes.

7
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,960
I would say it would close immediately.

8
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:24,800
But you know I know you do about 15 minutes is is extra bonus points are Internet ready so nobody will be penalized for not taking or not doing that.

9
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:40,650
No, no, no. I'm sorry. Was so the way the extra points work is that I compute your final grades without the extra points to do with your a B.

10
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,350
You know, I would be close super. So without any extra points.

11
00:01:46,350 --> 00:02:00,550
And then I put them in to see if any of you move with an extra layer so nobody will be penalized because I use that.

12
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:15,670
I mean the grades without the extra points and that doesn't I you know you don't need so the table is already done for you they for the table.

13
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:49,150
So all you need to do is answer. He.

14
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:23,940
For. Recording in progress.

15
00:03:47,880 --> 00:04:01,860
The Peak season 2017.

16
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:15,700
And you know, this is.

17
00:04:20,200 --> 00:05:18,340
You. The consequences for these beliefs and the circumstances that these athletes try to use responsibly.

18
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,630
There is a quiz on campus.

19
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:06,220
Hopkins. Reasonably.

20
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:29,840
It means. Got us.

21
00:06:47,120 --> 00:07:36,170
Ancient people. To comment on the content of the report here.

22
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:44,620
For those of you who just joined us. Go to conference and very sick with number four that I would like you to.

23
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,510
I guess you don't have to use older people everything.

24
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,460
You just have to answer questions there.

25
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,260
Those are the things I will close.

26
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,570
I mean, the whole assignment close a thing 30.

27
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,959
But I gave everyone 15 minutes.

28
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,000
So let's say now let's say ten more minutes.

29
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:55,870
It's. It is for extra credit.

30
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:15,010
So you need to told to.

31
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:50,450
This. I think it's safe to use this as a.

32
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,390
Good. I could.

33
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:44,590
This is my. Seven.

34
00:10:46,290 --> 00:11:09,270
I have been advising.

35
00:11:51,650 --> 00:12:06,150
This is. I think.

36
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:48,050
He's. It's.

37
00:12:53,020 --> 00:13:01,790
Well. I think.

38
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:39,050
Someone. Sounds to me like it's a coach, right?

39
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:41,040
China's amazing. I did.

40
00:14:49,340 --> 00:15:12,720
It's just, you know, it's like I just can't do three more minutes.

41
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:30,870
Three. I told you so much.

42
00:15:32,660 --> 00:16:12,360
I just have to wait to see stories just like this one.

43
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,310
60 million changed in 66 days.

44
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:35,620
That's right. It's just something I just.

45
00:16:37,300 --> 00:17:09,860
I was just like, you know, you just keep telling.

46
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:42,110
Which is not going to be just some closes at 36, Christine.

47
00:17:44,600 --> 00:18:00,040
She especially she's just writing it.

48
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:13,990
I'm sorry. She didn't like the structure.

49
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:33,000
Yeah. Right. Yeah, it's this.

50
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:51,500
It's just something. Daytime soap.

51
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,310
Just so now, please.

52
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:03,860
All your items and the most.

53
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:28,940
That's something you and I will discuss that with later if we have time.

54
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,470
When you don't do that with clauses.

55
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,000
So any questions about homework?

56
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,140
Number eight is due today.

57
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,670
You didn't even know there was a homework to do.

58
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:55,160
This is. All right.

59
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,890
Any questions? Everybody set with that homework.

60
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,250
Okay, but no, let's start by poking.

61
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:11,420
It's the same process is linear programing.

62
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,630
We are going to work on the homework number nine.

63
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:35,900
I just received a message that your exams are greater and greater and then I will release these after here, right after I check the grades.

64
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,360
And I have already uploaded their solutions to the test.

65
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:52,310
They are on their day. Be determined. So you go to assignments.

66
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:15,730
And then the solutions for the midterm exams are here and are all graded.

67
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:27,970
So I haven't been graded because I just finished maybe 15 minutes ago.

68
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:40,270
But I would do that as soon as we're done and would applaud the grades after and make sure that everything is right.

69
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,050
Sorry it took so long. All right.

70
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:54,970
Let's go on to assignment number nine and for assignment number nine.

71
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:08,970
I would like for you to. Download these templates and data and we are going to start with problem 4.632.

72
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:17,500
So I think you said relevant problem is useful, which is helpful to have that template.

73
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:33,910
So problem in 6.63 because you don't.

74
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,740
Okay. So it reads, please.

75
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:07,360
You know, you now have $10,000 and the following investment plans are available to you during the next three years.

76
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,910
Investment. A Every dollar invested now yields $0.10.

77
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:20,200
A year from now on, $1.50. Three years from now, investment be every dollar invested.

78
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,709
Now, $0.20 a year from now on, $1.

79
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,010
An infant's footwork, an investment.

80
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:32,170
See, every dollar invested a year from now yields $1.50.

81
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:40,120
Three years from now, during the year, you can place on invested cash money market funds that yield you can you can

82
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:46,300
place any invested cash in moti market funds that yield 3% interest per year.

83
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:53,860
However, you can invest at most $5,000 in any one of the plans A, V or C.

84
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:59,200
Okay. So what does it mean? It means that you have $10,000, right?

85
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,550
And there are three opportunities to invest that money.

86
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:08,770
So they are two of them that you can invest right now in year one.

87
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:22,840
Right. So those are invest in a need to invest and be like so you can put, you know, some money in the in the investment, right.

88
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:33,729
In those in the investment. And then those invested investment will yield $0.20 per dollar a year from now.

89
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:39,410
So in year two on $1 and then two year from now on, year three, right.

90
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,080
Are invested in vitamin C, you cannot invest in the investment C, year one.

91
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:51,190
You have to wait until the year two to invest. That's right.

92
00:24:51,640 --> 00:25:03,370
And you will yield, as you do in your investment in year to three year from now.

93
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:11,770
That will be your four. So it will return $1.50 per dollar in year.

94
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:28,209
Right. So that's the that's the you know, that's that's that's the description of the problem of the of the problem.

95
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:35,740
And what you want to do is have as much cash and a year for on hand as you can.

96
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:45,370
Right. So what I am going to do, there is a template here, but I'm not going to use that template because I,

97
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:51,880
you know, realize that there's more direct way to do this.

98
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:58,630
So for now, I'm just going to delete that then link here.

99
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:25,120
Yes. And what what I'm going to do is I am going to do is.

100
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:36,470
He will give me the scale of how much money I am going to invest and which money I am going to receive in a year.

101
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:43,430
So I got you one here. Let me make this a little.

102
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:10,160
So I'm going to put here wife one, your two.

103
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:19,740
It's been an extended study in Europe for.

104
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:34,350
So that's my day on the calendar right now.

105
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:42,800
And what I want to do now is put the opportunities of investment here.

106
00:27:43,370 --> 00:28:01,640
Right. So the opportunities of the investment will be or, you know, how much are my sources of it, of expenditure or my sources of revenue.

107
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:09,620
This is what I'm going to do. So I have a cash. But don't have.

108
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:30,580
Pretty. And then I, I can spend that kind of investment a.

109
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:48,410
This may be. I think that's been C, right.

110
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:59,360
They came to. Okay.

111
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:08,140
So he can concussion. Come here. And then these are things that I can't spend more than that one missing young investment.

112
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:15,860
See, I can also put money on the money market.

113
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:26,980
So at the end of the of the one, I can put some money in the money market and that's money market for year one or 20 or 30.

114
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:42,800
Right. We don't have the money markets for you or for the year or the number of year to spend money market in year three.

115
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:55,700
So those are I don't have a money market for year four because that that would mean that at the end of year four I would so money away.

116
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:01,910
But because I want to maximize the amount of money that I have on the hand in year four.

117
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,640
There's no reason to invest in your for because you get less money.

118
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:13,910
Right? So I'm just trying to get, you know, maximize the money that I get each.

119
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:24,260
And then the next thing I'm going to do is to put the balance right at the end of the year.

120
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:29,270
How much money on hand do I have at the end of that year?

121
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:37,640
After I start with my eight things thousand dollars on a I invest a certain amount of money here, here, here.

122
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:42,550
And let's see how how it goes.

123
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:53,030
It's. Good day. I'm going to add one column.

124
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:04,650
Those are going to be my decision.

125
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:11,610
Those are going to be decisions I'm going to invest in A and B and C on the morning mark.

126
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:28,290
And I am going to be okay here at the very end.

127
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:32,070
I thought you are past the balance.

128
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,890
Of the year one year in year three.

129
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:46,210
Okay. So let's see how we're going to do if I have.

130
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:58,790
So let's say that a start and the cash on hand is $10,000.

131
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:03,590
I start with since I wasn't doing okay.

132
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,450
The only opportunity that I have to get that thing.

133
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,380
So some dollars at that things I was on as I have in year one.

134
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:22,100
Right. And let's say that I invest in A, B and C money market.

135
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:27,920
One, two, one, three. I invest $1,000.

136
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:41,320
And now I have a cash on hand, which is $10,000 in the year.

137
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:44,970
I'm going to put it number one here.

138
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:53,020
Meaning that this is an inflow of money in year one for the cash on hand.

139
00:32:53,920 --> 00:33:02,590
And let's say that I'm going to invest in $10,000 is thousand dollars in a B in year in year one.

140
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:07,450
Right. The only time I can invest and BS in year one.

141
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:13,540
So I'm going to put it negative one saying I you know, it's this outflow of money.

142
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:17,440
A negative one. This is an outflow of one.

143
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,680
So I have an inflow of $10,000, an outflow of 1008 thousand here.

144
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:32,110
But let's say that I also put them money in the money market at the end of year one, and that is an outflow of money.

145
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:40,870
Right. So that means I put $1, I spend $1, spent $1, spend $1.

146
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:50,760
But the real amount I'm going to do by multiplying is number times based and indicator of outflow inflow.

147
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:58,690
Right. So I would say $10,000, ten one since I was on my minus is thousand, -1000, -1000.

148
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:01,780
And then it will give me the balance of the end of the year.

149
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:10,190
Right. So suddenly. So let's say that I do this is that some of.

150
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:25,920
Thank you. Oh, I see.

151
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:32,140
Show variables, including the cash on hand and the influence flow.

152
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:51,480
Indicator. Do you agree that that's the amount of money that I have at the end of the year, 7000, at the end of the year when I have $10,000.

153
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,890
Right. And then I spend a thousand in investment.

154
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:09,990
A thousand an investment, B, and then I put $1,000 in a money market, adding that, you know, these things out by those 3000.

155
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:15,860
So you get 7000. That's how I compute the path to the bottom.

156
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:21,360
This is the amount of money that I have on hand at the end of the year one.

157
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:26,370
And here is the end of the year to the end of the year and the year should be the end of year four.

158
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,980
How much money do I have on hand at the end of the year? One, two, three, four.

159
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:42,180
Okay, so let's do the same thing for year two or so.

160
00:35:43,740 --> 00:36:01,400
Okay, now, now, now, let me let me actually, you know, read the in the lines, the horizontal lines, the rows of cash on hand, $10,000.

161
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,999
I you know, the only time I have the things, I have some dollars on hand.

162
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,840
This is in year one, right? So I start with the one so that that's over here.

163
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:27,570
Now invest may be right for every dollar that I invest in in investments B, I am going to have to be in year one.

164
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:34,380
So it tells me that. Investment aid.

165
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:44,490
Every dollar invested, invested, invested. Now you'll ten $0.10 a year from now and $1.30 three years from now.

166
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:50,100
Then send someone dollars and $0.30. So that means.

167
00:36:52,500 --> 00:37:00,330
That I'm going to have. A return here of $0.10.

168
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:11,340
This may be $0.10, and then that's an inflow.

169
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:21,480
And three years from now, I get $1.30 or $1.30 three years from now.

170
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:26,760
So that that's going to be here for $1.30.

171
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:32,790
And those are going to be positive because those are inflow of money.

172
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:40,710
So if I have to if I want to know how much money these things have, some dollars are going to give me.

173
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:51,060
So it's going to give me $100 in the year 2008, $1,300 in airport.

174
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:58,640
So so that's that's my every time. So what happens in in with investment?

175
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,040
B, investment.

176
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:14,850
B yields 20, $0.20 of a year from now and $1.80.

177
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,440
Two years from now. 120.

178
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:31,080
$1.10.

179
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:40,890
Two years from now. So if I invest $1 in year one, then I get $0.20.

180
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,180
A year from now. And $1.10.

181
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:51,770
A year from now. All right. What happens with investments?

182
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:56,250
See, every dollar are invested a year from now.

183
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:07,890
Yields $1.50 on a year from now. So I got $1 and $1 invested.

184
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,990
Investment. See, that has to be in year two.

185
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:19,080
And that will yield $1.50.

186
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:28,300
30 years from now. That means in year four. All right.

187
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:38,680
So now I think what? What happened with money market one?

188
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:51,670
So every dollar that I have, so I have the opportunity to put whatever I don't invest right in the morning market if I have any any cash left.

189
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:02,770
So every dollar that I invest in money market, one that has to be in year one will return $1.03.

190
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:15,520
Right. A year from now. And then for money market two, I can only invest in year two and I will return $1.30.

191
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:24,220
And for money market three, I can invest, you know, at the end of year three.

192
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:33,160
And so we're here and I'm going to receive $1.50.

193
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:42,710
In Year four. So those are my inflows and outflows.

194
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:52,790
Now is if I right now, what I'm going to do is replicate this formula, right?

195
00:40:52,790 --> 00:41:09,440
So this is going to be this some problem. Oh, I see.

196
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:14,209
And variables in this time, including the question of time, is not a decision anymore.

197
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:17,330
But I think because it's fixed.

198
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:25,700
But we need to include that in this problem, because this discussion that I have at Angel that I have in the beginning of the year,

199
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:45,610
I use all these column so that between 7000 and then I can go to Greek.

200
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:56,030
And we know that all of these are our money.

201
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:31,740
These are little. But something like that.

202
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:44,520
Now, these numbers. You know, I'm going to I'm going to be checking out those numbers.

203
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:51,270
But I want to impose some constraint with this number to use balance.

204
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:55,380
I, I know that way.

205
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:59,970
What I want to maximize is my cash at the end of year four.

206
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:06,170
So that's going to be my objective function. Right? So I'm going to that.

207
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:33,680
Now what can you tell me? So I want to maximize these numbers, right, by changing these numbers.

208
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:45,530
This is how much money I can and you know how much money I will invest and put in the money market in year one, two and three right here.

209
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:52,010
Now, the question to you is, what can you tell me about these numbers?

210
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:56,870
And I have a negative number here like this one.

211
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:06,050
So a negative number means that I spend more than what I have.

212
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,840
So the outflows exceed the inflows.

213
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:18,320
I know I cannot do that. I have $10,000 at the beginning and I need to use that cash.

214
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:26,090
So after I use all the cash or whatever, I cannot I cannot have a negative number here.

215
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:31,930
Now, the question then is, should I have a positive number?

216
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:40,680
So think about this and don't think about this matrix.

217
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:48,980
Now, suppose that I have $10,000 to invest, right?

218
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:58,850
I have two opportunities to invest, let's say investment A and B, and then I need I can either put all my money,

219
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:13,460
investment A or B or I can put less than all my money is in A and B, why would I just constrain myself or not invest in investing all my money?

220
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:21,950
Well, because there is investment in C next year that I should have some money left to invest funding.

221
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:29,020
That means C probably because that's a that yields is large at the end of the year.

222
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:38,240
So what would I do? Do I keep my cash, as is my cash in my pocket waiting for next year to invest?

223
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,940
Do I have another alternative? What do you think?

224
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:49,879
I could. I could. I could do that money market once put in money market one.

225
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:54,890
Exactly. Because a money market, the one yields every single year.

226
00:45:55,250 --> 00:46:00,139
So instead of getting out, you know, putting my money in my pocket,

227
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:07,070
I'm waiting for next year, I put in the money market and I get $0.03 extra for per dollar.

228
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:07,580
Right.

229
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:20,150
So if I want to maximize my earning, I shouldn't have any cash on hand in my pocket or invest it at the end of the year because I can either put in A,

230
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:31,870
B or C later or I can put in the money market that every year you put the money $1 now and next year you collect the money, right?

231
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:39,410
So my point is that this number, these number, this number and this number should be zero.

232
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:46,670
This number, this number and this number cannot be negative and shouldn't be positive.

233
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:52,190
So therefore, the balance between what you get and what you expend.

234
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:57,320
So these are. Except for this one, right? Because the here is what we want to maximize.

235
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:09,590
So what I make my constraints are going to be that my balance in year 1 to 1 three should be zero.

236
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:19,100
So I can I if I have things thousand dollars, I need to put that $10,000 in a, B and money market, whatever it is.

237
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:26,660
I can decide not to do anything in the money market and just put in a B in the year two.

238
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:34,460
The same thing at the end of the of the year, I should have a balance of zero.

239
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:39,709
And what money do I have to invest all that return from investment?

240
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:44,300
A In year two, the return for me is better than be in year two.

241
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:49,400
And wherever I left in the money put in the money market last year.

242
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:53,450
Right that that gave me that you know this amount.

243
00:47:54,450 --> 00:48:10,130
So so then okay so let's let's get to to this and my let's go to solver.

244
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:20,870
So I notice that some of you are still a bit confused about the difference between solver and solver table.

245
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:30,109
They are not the same thing. So there is a routine optimization routine that comes with Excel and Solver.

246
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:39,530
Table is an add on to Excel that was written by the idiots who wrote that book that you are using.

247
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:43,189
It is an easy to use solver.

248
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:51,580
So Solver Table is to create a table of the friend that doing sensitivity analysis with linear programing,

249
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,330
building a table calling solver a lot of time.

250
00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:04,400
Right. But they are two different problems. You can work with solver kind of work very well with you.

251
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:15,620
And sober people might just give you some issues or both can be right or or you might not have installed silver and silver and they will work great.

252
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:23,920
But it doesn't have anything to do with it. But so where are we using silver and gold silver table right now?

253
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:31,370
So I'm going to move into that data in silver.

254
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:41,780
What is it? I want this. I want to maximize balance in year four.

255
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:45,340
Exact maximize the balance in the year.

256
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:56,509
All right. Take whatever I have on hand here for my change in these decision variables.

257
00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:02,839
Right. I cannot change that $10,000 initially because that's given to me.

258
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:07,220
Right. Then what would be the constraints?

259
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:13,370
Well, the constraints are that these balances should be zero.

260
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:22,800
If you want to optimum maximize your your, you know, your cash on hand.

261
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:28,090
Right. So you shouldn't you cannot invest something that you don't have.

262
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,339
So it definitely has to be greater than or equal to zero.

263
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:37,190
But it shouldn't be greater than zero, because then you'll be wasting money.

264
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:46,160
Right. And then I'm like, okay, I need to add another one.

265
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:58,520
The other one is that we were told that in and you can't spend more than $5,000 in each investment, A, B or C.

266
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:09,530
So it is that A, D or C has to be less than or equal to 2000 each one.

267
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:17,240
Should you verify that? That's correct.

268
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:23,660
That I cannot do this by more than $5,000 in either one of them.

269
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:35,570
Okay. So now I want to solve these bi linear programing seems like alpha and or negativity constraints out there.

270
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:43,490
And then I saw it and what I have is that I maximize my money.

271
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:49,790
I'm going to get 14,880 7000.

272
00:51:51,500 --> 00:52:04,490
And now the question to you is, what can you can you tell me what my scale, how much should I invest in in the first year and what?

273
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:13,770
You look at the first year and tell me I have $10,000, right?

274
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:18,690
And I spend that $10,000 because my balance here is zero.

275
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:24,050
So I started with $10,000 and then I spent the $10,000.

276
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:37,770
What did I do with the $10,000? You invested 5000 in investment, a 783 to be invested in a money market.

277
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:53,520
So I invested $5,000 in a $783 in investment B and $4,217 in the money to make the money market.

278
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,970
So he gave me some money for it for next year, right?

279
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:08,550
First and then what, you know, how do you spend the money in a in a year to.

280
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:17,480
So in year two, I didn't have any money left at the end of year one.

281
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:27,620
So what did I do in year two? 5000 an investment.

282
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:31,990
See, where did I get my photos and investments?

283
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:37,240
How do I get those $5,000?

284
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:52,480
Did you take it out of the money market and also do some of your returns on investment and investment and an investment each year?

285
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:56,230
Right. So it's up.

286
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:07,780
Then you go and inflows.

287
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:40,260
Also. Money you.

288
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:54,790
The inflow in in year one.

289
00:54:54,790 --> 00:55:13,180
Is this cash on hand, right? So one, so that's going to be $10,000 and the outflow is going to be the sum of 5007, 83 and 4207.

290
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:18,190
Right. So that's going to be the.

291
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:29,040
Some. Of.

292
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:46,230
I saw some -783 and negative four here.

293
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:50,940
Another -400 to 4270.

294
00:55:54,300 --> 00:56:11,250
And that's exactly 10,000, right? And that's why the balance is here, because the outflow, the inflow and therefore the same.

295
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:18,640
So what about that inflow a year or two?

296
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:38,760
So the inflow in year two is going to be. We want to know is going to be the sum total of the positive, right.

297
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:45,530
So the positive is going to be. These two the first.

298
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:59,840
Flight times. These two numbers they did last.

299
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:20,000
Have another positive here is number of times people 3 to 5000 and so my inflow was 5000 and mail flow is exactly right.

300
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:24,830
These investments come from donor.

301
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:47,680
And then you can you can then check that of the money that I have in in year three

302
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:57,250
will come from the investment B and the money market to actually go from the oh,

303
00:57:57,410 --> 00:58:02,350
there's no I didn't invest anything in my market. So it's just from investment.

304
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:06,640
B So that's going to be here.

305
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:24,320
It's going to be. It's going to be $1,783.

306
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:31,950
And then how much did I miss?

307
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:38,970
60, $161. And this is what I put in money markets three.

308
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:45,960
Right. So that's the outflow. So that means that 860 145 I got my inflow.

309
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:54,120
I insist that the equity market three, which is the same things in one.

310
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:37,070
And finally. Right. My my balance here doesn't have negatives, right?

311
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:40,549
Everything that you have is positive investment.

312
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:44,750
A return on investment. A return of the investment.

313
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:51,950
See the money market to I. I will give me the 14,887.

314
00:59:52,160 --> 01:00:00,140
Right. But what I what I did here is balance the inflows and outflows.

315
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:11,389
So I get the money from the return money market and then I get the money and then I decide to invest and invest every single time,

316
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:30,320
every single dollar. So I, I invest that $10,000 in, in year one, 5000 in a 783 in B and then I put in the money like that.

317
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:34,370
4217 that is gains thousand dollars, right.

318
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:43,100
And then I use I that's what I invest that and I have this is what I have it in thousand dollars in year two.

319
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:51,890
Then I get a return from investment A and every time from investment B and the return from the money

320
01:00:51,890 --> 01:01:01,310
market one and that give me $5,000 and what I need to do is spend those $5,000 in investment.

321
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:10,730
C Right. So that balance and any in, in, by the way, I need to put anything on money market to finance.

322
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:20,660
So it's absolutely needed. I put all the $5,000 a year two in a in investment C in year three,

323
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:30,200
I'm getting a return of the $783 what we investment fee and I'm not getting and that's the only

324
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:40,070
thing I'm getting right so because I put anything in in money market three so I am getting $861,

325
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:44,540
you know, reminiscent of the inflows for me.

326
01:01:44,840 --> 01:02:01,280
And what I did is I put everything on the money market money make this $361 just to add to my cash next year and then the year four.

327
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:08,130
Then I receive all these things rows, right? And then I get for 4887.

328
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:15,230
So there's absolutely no way to invest your money better than this.

329
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:17,570
Right? With the constraints that we have,

330
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:29,900
the clustering is that you can not put more than $5,000 in any of them independently is just to avoid minimize the risk.

331
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:39,560
Right. So you don't want one of the investment to with all your money, something that might have some downturn.

332
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:47,030
So that that's the point is is very useful template because it will help you analyze

333
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:55,420
know cash flows and how to put know who the scale of investments or is your forward.

334
01:02:56,540 --> 01:03:10,210
You know retirement if you want depending on how you plan your portfolio right depending on the heels of your portfolio,

335
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:25,430
they can make make this case, you know, and then later on in the in the past, we were so we're going to talk about how to analyze risk.

336
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:31,910
Right. And then with do these type of operations with type of quantification,

337
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:46,550
then we add the possibility that there's some variability in your yield, there's some variability in the, you know, in in the risk.

338
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:52,969
So you can relax the restrictions and see how the variability of the yield can affect

339
01:03:52,970 --> 01:04:04,040
your solution and figured out a way to invest money and maximize expected earnings,

340
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:16,429
but also control the risk. So this is the thing.

341
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:19,860
How to maximize your cash flow through. Years from now.

342
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:26,080
So we think that any questions about it? Yes.

343
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:34,180
72%. That that is just for me to explain what we did.

344
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:53,550
This is the complaint. So I'm going to this is going to start now with this problem.

345
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:21,880
Or 84. This is actually an interesting problem.

346
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:32,300
It is an unusual application of linear programing.

347
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:42,349
So it goes. Suppose that Eli Lilly and Pfizer are going to learn merger negotiations for Monsanto.

348
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:47,660
The following issues. What will the name of the company Inc. be?

349
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:51,320
Will the corporate headquarters be in Indianapolis?

350
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:57,280
That's what we really want. Or New York. That's what's Pfizer will.

351
01:05:57,890 --> 01:06:02,190
Which company's chairperson will be the chairperson of the merged or.

352
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:10,350
Great? Which company gets to choose the CEO on the issues of layoffs?

353
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:23,030
What percentage of each company you for present brands develop a remarkably simple method for the WHO adversaries to settle their differences.

354
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:28,040
These segments would be used to settle difference between all their adversaries.

355
01:06:28,370 --> 01:06:34,040
I think this is taking too far claims here.

356
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:49,050
These allocations are listed and each adversary allocates 800 points between all the issues and these allocations are listed in the file for 84.

357
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:54,950
With that, we're going to open now in the.

358
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:19,530
200 points of utility for David and Pfizer are as follows.

359
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:28,080
So who gets to put their name and, you know, put $10?

360
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,630
I don't know, ten points.

361
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:41,400
And if I had the 5.3, that that means that four really is more important than for Fischer, who, you know, what name the company you get.

362
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:49,920
And the headquarters where the headquarters are for Leni is much more important.

363
01:07:51,090 --> 01:08:00,270
That's where the headquarters are and get, you know, the headquarter location and that that's Pfizer.

364
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:04,170
But the Chairperson Pfizer cares more about that.

365
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:09,360
Who needs the CEO?

366
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:16,380
You know, I think cares more about that than they would.

367
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:20,370
If you only of know.

368
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:26,550
Would you still have to work the percentage of what you know,

369
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:40,980
which companies you prevail in in Leo That we're not treated the IT as a percentage rate because there is going to be a negotiation,

370
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:47,950
but they really, you know, assigns 25 points to that.

371
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:52,050
Pfizer is 30 points, you know, so it's very important for both of them.

372
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:56,370
But we're facing a bit. Okay.

373
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:59,640
So what we're going to do then?

374
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:24,580
So they adjust their procedure says that the best way to make decisions for each issue is to one give each adversary

375
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:33,160
the same number of points to ensure that each company prefer each allocation to the allocation of its opponent.

376
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:37,810
And three, maximize the number of points received by either parties.

377
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:54,670
So this is is trying to combine the make the decisions with trying to assure no envy.

378
01:09:55,150 --> 01:10:00,790
Right. So you get what you want and then the other gets what they want.

379
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:04,510
And if you look at your of the other person, let down the person.

380
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:15,830
But if you say what I got is better. And when the other person looks at you, the other person said, What I got is better because they value it.

381
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:39,310
So that's the truth. And that's that's all you need to copy is information.

382
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:51,220
The template I have here, the merger negotiation, those are the points that they allocate.

383
01:10:53,550 --> 01:11:00,450
The reason. These are the utility points where you make.

384
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:13,610
And so what now?

385
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:26,380
What we are going to do is use put a constraint on decision variables so that the decision variables are going to be their name.

386
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:31,990
For example, who thinks that a lily or a Fischer.

387
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:36,910
And those are going to be binary decisions.

388
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:40,780
Right. So one or zero. So going to have a one.

389
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:50,860
If a lily thinks of these the the name and zero that and the same thing for price.

390
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:55,299
So the point is that you cannot have the ones here.

391
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:59,410
You cannot have the ones here, but you can have two zero.

392
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:05,140
So one must be one thing or zero. So what might these is?

393
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:21,570
Let's say, for example, that I make these statements or is one zero or this one and zero six.

394
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:44,070
In one zero.

395
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:53,480
It has to be, you know, honesty.

396
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:01,040
And then we said that they lay off. We are going to try them as a proportion.

397
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:12,880
Right. So what proportion of the you leaders views should, should be considered for that, that from what proportion?

398
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:18,560
Pfizer. So that the numbers here has to be between zero and one, right?

399
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:21,649
Then no more. And they most out of the one.

400
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:38,930
So they say that .6.4. So now I want to make sure that one one of my constraints is going to be that some of these numbers must be one.

401
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:47,510
Right. So because these are binary variable, so they cannot be is one or two zero.

402
01:13:47,750 --> 01:14:05,620
So I'm going to sum. What is the first?

403
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:11,290
And that's going to be one of my constraints to make sure that all these numbers remain.

404
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:19,180
And later, I'm going to show you how to put the full strain that these numbers have to be either one or zero.

405
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:24,490
That's it. Finally, the layoffs wouldn't be vice versa.

406
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:30,960
It's really kind of 1.3 million fewer points that I'm thinking of.

407
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:37,930
Okay. That's helpful. So is that. Yeah, I, I just make it so front.

408
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:44,740
So we'll see. So let's see then.

409
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:59,640
If we if we have that right, if we have that scale of how many, how much points will really have, how many points Facebook had.

410
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:22,490
So. Right. What really is going to be the location for for many times the value that really has.

411
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:34,120
It's tough to really get 50 points where price is due to some growth.

412
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:53,090
This number is the same.

413
01:15:59,570 --> 01:16:09,370
So. Well, no, no.

414
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:20,670
I'm fine, sir. So you really got 55, sir.

415
01:16:21,330 --> 01:16:25,590
You know, 27. So that that's an imbalance, right?

416
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:31,910
So I'm going to simply get that difference between the two for two.

417
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:41,990
Murdered by those he's known for and what are they constrained that I am going to do?

418
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:46,110
The WHO said is that the difference between the two points of view?

419
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:49,570
Right. They should receive the same amount of money.

420
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,460
Now, did they think did they all ten?

421
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:11,290
The most interesting constraint is suppose that Lila looks at what Fischer from.

422
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:15,760
Lilly looks at what? Fischer. Gordon Fischer. Both headquarters.

423
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:25,880
I thought if you go to the headquarters, the CEO and 40% of The View unveiled.

424
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:40,000
Right. That's that's what they thought. So it really is saying, oh, if I had gotten the same thing it how much how how satisfied would I be?

425
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:49,840
And then what we're going to do is then evaluate what Fischer God with the values of leading role.

426
01:17:53,130 --> 01:18:12,220
Eventually? Well, I think. Equal prize for five years following applying the values of leaning.

427
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:25,460
So interesting. So if we had switched, Lilly would have been in the same room, felt the same.

428
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:29,350
So there's no envy for leave right now.

429
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:37,630
Let's see. For Pfizer or Pfizer, we'll evaluate what Lily got.

430
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:50,350
Even with what Lily got, we did not.

431
01:18:50,450 --> 01:19:03,609
You decide, sir. And as I said, it's envious of little guys because they don't.

432
01:19:03,610 --> 01:19:15,370
47. But if if they had gotten exactly what he got, they would they they would feel that Lily.

433
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:20,400
You know, but more points than they do value them.

434
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:24,700
Right. Because they would evaluate what Lily got as 53.

435
01:19:26,230 --> 01:19:36,220
So what we want to do and then we'll finish this about time, though, what we want to do is eliminate envy, right?

436
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:43,330
And make sure that we are going to maximize that point for Lily,

437
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:53,440
that it doesn't matter because the difference should be zero and making sure that there is no envy between them.

438
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:59,980
Right. Then just a pretty trivial extra point.

439
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:06,400
A crackpot. But we'll do that next.

440
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:19,460
Next time I want. I started with class asking you whether you get for any what you've been provided.

441
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:25,390
So make sure that you try these, which is right.

442
01:20:25,810 --> 01:20:38,220
So all you want to do is maximize really your advisor to make you feel good any higher again.

443
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:52,020
So you want to maximize this number, making sure that there is no difference and they can look at the they're making two days notice.

444
01:20:57,070 --> 01:21:01,510
And how how do you how do you get know envy you.

445
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:11,350
You need to make sure that the actual points that Lilly get are going to be greater than ten points each week.

446
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:17,860
And the actual point that Pfizer got are going to be greater than or equal to.

447
01:21:18,190 --> 01:21:22,840
My point is five. So sweet. That's it.

448
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:40,490
So you can. And they will have another exercise or homelessness.

449
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:47,100
Yes, but that's not my thing.

450
01:21:48,000 --> 01:22:07,470
So it's like, why do you wake up at five?

451
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:30,160
I don't wanted to get into it.

452
01:22:31,710 --> 01:22:41,730
It's just exactly what I think is going to happen.

453
01:22:44,610 --> 01:22:55,500
I know that I get everything that I need to know when I go for her.

454
01:22:56,380 --> 01:23:04,630
I was trying to find you.

455
01:23:05,010 --> 01:23:09,660
That's crazy. Wait, so she's not trying to kill people?

456
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:24,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

457
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:30,990
Are you trying to tell me that there is one?

458
01:23:31,870 --> 01:23:38,730
I'm sorry. I'm not. She seems like a hard worker.

459
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:43,100
Yeah, I got that right.

460
01:23:44,900 --> 01:24:01,260
You did? Because I really loved you. Obviously, you couldn't be better prepared to figure out who tried to bite one employee.

461
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:06,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

462
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:11,250
506 billion. No, I think it's stupid.

463
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:25,859
Yeah, I. I signed up for you to keep up with all the increased sales and whatever.

464
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:29,180
I feel like it will be a lot of money.

465
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:38,059
Yeah, it is. The thing is, I don't worry about it.

466
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:41,420
I think you got to know.

467
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:45,770
Okay. It is. And this is the second.

468
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:58,250
Yeah. So, you know, in my just I just like it's like, oh, my God.

469
01:24:58,270 --> 01:24:58,610
Yeah.
