1
00:00:05,816 --> 00:00:08,760
How is public health
different from health care?

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,250
How do governments play a role
in public health decisions?

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,200
Who's involved in the financial
management in health organizations, and

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,470
what's the best way to advocate for
public health policy?

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,210
I'm Michael Rubion from the Department
of Health Management and

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,800
Policy at the School of Public Health.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,889
And I'm excited for
you to join us for Pub Health 513.

8
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:33,889
This course is all about providing
you with the opportunity to think

9
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:38,239
about our public health system,
public health policy development, and

10
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,150
the fundamental concepts you'll need
to manage public health organizations.

11
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,740
By the end of this course, you'll be
able to compare the structure and

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,730
function of healthcare,
public health and regulatory systems.

13
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,950
You're also gonna learn about how each
of these is organized and finances,

14
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:02,210
as well as how the operate in national and
international contexts.

15
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,520
We're gonna explore the history and core
functions of public health, how the public

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,710
health policy making process works,
and the roles of ethics and evidence.

17
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,246
You'll also have a chance to think
about the importance of human resources

18
00:01:16,246 --> 00:01:20,998
in healthcare organizations, and
apply negotiation and mediation skills to

19
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:25,188
address both inter personal and
inter organizational challenges.

20
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:28,491
We're gonna look at strategies
to identify stakeholders,

21
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:32,386
how you build coalitions that help
influence public health outcomes.

22
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:38,212
And how you can develop the skills you'll
need to advocate for political social or

23
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:45,690
economic policies that you'll be working
to improve health in diverse populations.

24
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,070
As future public health professionals,

25
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:53,180
you're gonna be interfacing all
the time with administrators, managers,

26
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,240
policy makers and
stockholders all throughout your career.

27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,270
And each of you joined us
from a different department.

28
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:06,740
But health policy, it connects in
a significant way to all of your work.

29
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,150
In epidemiology, you may wanna know about
the key features of the populations and

30
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,780
subpopulations that you're monitoring.

31
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,826
This will provide you with a better
understand of the context of disease and

32
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:19,715
treatment.

33
00:02:19,715 --> 00:02:23,295
For those of you who
specialize in biostatistics,

34
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:26,633
big data is essential
to healthcare delivery.

35
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:31,310
And understanding how our healthcare and
public health systems are structured is

36
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:36,740
going to help you to contextualize
the nature of your statistical analyses.

37
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,388
For health behavior and health education
as well as nutritional sciences,

38
00:02:41,388 --> 00:02:46,252
you might be interested in understanding
what the structural components of our

39
00:02:46,252 --> 00:02:49,376
healthcare system and
public health system are and

40
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:52,586
how they influence
a population's health status.

41
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:56,743
Now these systems affect
the values of providing care.

42
00:02:56,743 --> 00:03:00,970
And you'll need to have an important
understanding of how care

43
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,430
coordination works inside of communities.

44
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,640
And for those of you who are pursuing
a career in environmental health sciences,

45
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,790
understanding health policy will help
you to frame the implementation of

46
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,630
risk based and
environmental interventions.

47
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,570
In this way,
you're gonna gain a deeper knowledge

48
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,920
of the role of organizational management
and healthcare system dynamics

49
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,750
that impact how the environment
affects a population's health status.

50
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,700
So as you move through this
course over the coming months,

51
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,540
we're excited to help bring our healthcare
and public health systems alive.

52
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:43,270
We're looking forward to helping you
uncover the wide range of opportunities

53
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:49,020
you'll have to influence the public health
system and the public health landscape.

54
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,597
So let's get started.
