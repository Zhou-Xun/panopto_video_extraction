00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,610
Even from a young age, kids know that when you have a question, who you ask can change your answer.

2
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:20,130
Can I have another cookie? Better ask Dad. Can I have a playdate with my best friend this weekend?

3
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,890
Better ask Mom. Well, these are intentional manipulations to get the answer that they want.

4
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,260
The same phenomenon occurs frequently and less nefarious, but no less impactful ways.

5
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,860
For example, imagine that we needed to find a good time for the class to meet in Zoom session.

6
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,060
Since we already have a conference call set for 10 a.m. m on Thursday.

7
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:49,230
I asked the class who's able to come to that time whether or not the time slot would work well for them in the future.

8
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,450
In spite of everyone in my sample, say half of the class saying that it's a good time for them.

9
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,960
It's highly unlikely that it's a good time for everyone in the class.

10
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:06,780
Why? Well, of course, those students who weren't free Thursday at ten M are not present on the call to object to the suggested time slot.

11
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,830
This difference in the answer that I might get from a sample sub population and

12
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,540
the whole population is a phenomenon in epidemiology that we call selection bias.

13
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:23,620
In this unit, we'll be focused on selection bias as an overarching goal.

14
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:31,250
We're going to learn how the recruitment or retention of people into a study can be biased observed associations between exposure and outcome,

15
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:37,400
jeopardizing your ability to make correct causal inferences about the relationships of interest.

16
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:44,150
Specifically in this unit, I will define selection bias and present some common examples of the phenomenon.

17
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,569
You'll also learn how selection bias impacts observed.

18
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:57,110
Associations illustrate when selection bias occurs using dogs and then discuss how to plan for and potentially adjust for selection bias in studies.
