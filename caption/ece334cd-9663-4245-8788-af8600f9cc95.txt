1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,130
What's the question? Okay.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:19,800
Sorry about that, guys. So today we are going to transition from indirect dietary assessment methods to direct.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,330
And the rest of the dietary assessment will be all about more direct methods.

4
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,190
You just make sure I actually hit record anyway?

5
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:49,680
Yeah, I did. Okay, so today we're going to talk about food records and 24 recalls.

6
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,400
I think many, if not everyone, is familiar with recalls and food records.

7
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,860
So I'm going to actually go through this fairly briskly, especially since I'm 10 minutes overdue,

8
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:12,660
because I want to set time for a breakout session where you guys can review the discussion and answer the discussion questions in small groups.

9
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:22,440
But today, the important point of this presentation is to be able to be able to describe the features of a 24 hour recall and a food record.

10
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,410
They're similar in some aspects, and they differ in others.

11
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,209
Explain how these methods might be administered, conducted to assess dietary intake,

12
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,760
as well as being able to articulate, be comfortable with their strengths and limitations.

13
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,360
And oftentimes when we're talking about strengths and limitations in this class, it may be in a context.

14
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:56,040
And so, you know, there's sort of yeah, there's sort of just overall strengths and weaknesses.

15
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,750
But if we start talking about them in various scenarios, then you want to think about the strengths and limitations in those contexts.

16
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,990
And then being able to recommend applications of 24 hour records and food records.

17
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:21,180
So again, this is the direct approach and that's indirect simply means that we're assessing at the individual level.

18
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:35,390
So. So I sort of launched last week partly because we had limited time, but we didn't get a chance to just talk about dietary assessment in general.

19
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,879
So what components of the diet are we interested in?

20
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,000
Dietary assessment? And it's important to think about that.

21
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:51,940
And we sort of intuitively know it's about the diet, but what components of the diet do we typically assess?

22
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,710
The total calories consumed. Yeah, total energy.

23
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:04,480
So that may be the purpose is just to assess total energy intake, micro and macro micronutrients.

24
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:11,250
Notes, fluids. Fluids. What else?

25
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:19,440
Yep. Looking at different food groups. Yes. So we may be interested in actually the foods consumed.

26
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,250
Or food groups. So it could be individual foods or we may be more interested in the actual group.

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,870
Food group? What else? Yeah.

28
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,040
Dietary patterns are important. Yes. So dietary patterns.

29
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,570
Yeah. Yeah. Overall diet quality.

30
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,220
Even with dietary assessment, we may be interested. I shouldn't say.

31
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:49,910
Even as a component of dietary assessment, we may be interested in dietary behavior.

32
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:59,480
Right. So at what time of the day might foods be consumed or are they consumed at home or at a different location?

33
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,510
So there may be behaviors about the diet that are of interest.

34
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,950
And assessed. So I think we hit them all.

35
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,580
Okay. So starting with a 24 hour recall.

36
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,690
This is an approach that captures a very detailed.

37
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,470
Characterization of someone's diet. Right.

38
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,360
So when I say detailed, what are we looking for? What are we interested in?

39
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,950
Well, what's captured with the 24 hour recall? The quantity and quality.

40
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,650
So the quantity of food. Right. And a great deal of time is spent.

41
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:54,190
Helping the individual. Estimate how much they actually consumed.

42
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,700
So quantity. And the quality.

43
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:04,280
And with that, we mean, how is that? Well, first of all, what food, how is it prepared?

44
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:13,280
Was anything else consumed with it? You know, it was adding aggregate, some sort of composite food or food item.

45
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:25,000
And so forth. So the other important point is this is a an assessment approach to assess current short term diet.

46
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:38,620
Okay. Now, 24 recalls can also be long term if they are collected a series of times over a number of months or even over the course of a year.

47
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:50,320
Okay. So it can capture long term, but it's much more time intensive, it's more expensive, and it's also a greater burden on the respondent.

48
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:57,880
What you might see in research is there may be in the fall, winter, spring, summer,

49
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:03,910
three, 24 hour recalls collected in those time frames, or maybe even more.

50
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:13,360
But generally speaking, we think of 24 hour recalls. It's assessing the current diet in the last 24 hours, and it tends to be short term.

51
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:23,560
It's a it's captured captured via an in-depth, structured interview process that's either conducted by a trained interviewer

52
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:29,530
or it's automated and self-administered through a Web based computer program.

53
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:43,390
Okay. And the respondents recall all food beverages and in some cases supplements if that's of interest over the previous 24 hours.

54
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,160
So this is considered it is a retrospective approach.

55
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:58,939
Okay. The other aspect, about 24 hour recalls, which is really helpful.

56
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,480
The food records are also open ended.

57
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,520
So this open ended format enables the detailed.

58
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,100
Information to be collected about the diet. What else would this open ended format be useful for?

59
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:23,380
This is an actual this is a strength of both 24 recalls and food recalls.

60
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:30,730
It's like things that might not be typically included or might be less commonly consumed.

61
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,209
So it might not appear on the frequency.

62
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:43,930
QUESTION Right. So population specific, culturally relevant foods can be captured in an open ended assessment approach.

63
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:52,420
So that's 24 recalls are food records. This is a really important aspect string of 24 recalls and food records.

64
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:05,480
And just, you know, just a reminder that not only do the respondents have to provide what foods were consumed, how they were prepared,

65
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:14,480
if they consumed any foods that are processed or have, you know, brand name, they need provide brand names in terms of supplements.

66
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,260
They may need to provide the brand name of the supplement.

67
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:25,160
And then obviously the portion and portion sizes are important.

68
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:35,740
So this is a quantitative. Because you're collecting detailed information about portion size quantity.

69
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,300
Retrospective approach. This going revert.

70
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,350
Circling back to how it's administered,

71
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:58,030
it can be interviewer's assistant on Thursday Sarah is going to go through that process of interviewer assisted Oregon.

72
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:04,710
It can be prompted by a computer program. So this is that automated, self-administered, interactive process.

73
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:14,750
So in the United States we have a web based tool for automated self-administered assay tool for some of you may already be familiar with it.

74
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,530
Other countries, UK has their own web based.

75
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,040
I think there's one that's a regional in Europe.

76
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,580
So a number of countries have their own web based.

77
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,200
Automated self-administered 24 hour recall.

78
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,230
If it's interviewer assisted, it can be conducted in person or over the phone.

79
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,580
And I think the only other thing I want to just highlight is the information that's collected.

80
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:57,160
The interview process again uses open ended interviewing questions, often called probing questions, and it uses standardized interview protocols.

81
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:05,620
And I when I was working in some indigenous communities, we were collecting 25 recalls.

82
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:11,799
And at that time there were we did not have a standardized interviewing protocol.

83
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:20,800
We developed one for our project. But at the time there was not a standardized protocol that was used sort of in the United States and globally.

84
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,380
So we can imagine. Room for error here.

85
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,370
Right. Depending on how well-trained the interview was, how well developed the interview protocol.

86
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:43,200
And it actually led to a fair amount of error, which led to standardized interviewing protocols.

87
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,940
Okay. So this was at one time a source of considerable error.

88
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:57,070
Especially if interview the study and the interview were not well trained and the protocols were not well developed.

89
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:07,630
But that has been basically negated now that we have standardized interviewing protocols and the protocols are called multi pass method.

90
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:18,790
And there's this is the multi method that was developed by the USDA to be use for our enhanced system.

91
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:27,370
So in within Haines, we collect. As part of our nutrition surveillance in this country, we collect 24 recalls.

92
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:38,860
So this was developed by the USDA to standardize the interview process and to improve the data that was collected.

93
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,780
The other issue was just improving the accuracy. So.

94
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:53,610
It generally starts with a quick list. Sometimes the path may or may not have forgotten foods.

95
00:11:53,630 --> 00:12:01,580
There's research has shown that there are some foods that people just sometimes forget, and so they might run through a forgotten food list.

96
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,030
So they initially go through and just kind of do a quick run through the 24 hour period.

97
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:15,980
And then they go back and they get more comprehensive information, the time, the occasion where the food maybe was consumed.

98
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,459
Much more details about. Okay.

99
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:24,470
So you said pasta. Let's. What was in the past was, you know, and so forth.

100
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,180
And then there's a final probe. And Sarah will be going through this in a little bit more detail.

101
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,590
Has anybody collected or been an interviewer for 24 recalls?

102
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,780
Yeah. Did you use multiple? No, no, no.

103
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,180
It was a really long time ago. Yeah. Yeah.

104
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:46,370
For a small project. Yeah. But I'm assuming they had an interview protocol.

105
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:52,800
Yes. Yeah. The group that I worked with, we had a script that we had to follow.

106
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,160
I didn't actually have to do it, but those that were interview and had to follow a script and in fact,

107
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:04,610
they recorded every interview so that they could go back and evaluate.

108
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,120
To ensure that there was consistency from interview to interview to interview.

109
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:21,810
But again, this has. Resolved a lot of the measurement error issues from previous approaches.

110
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:29,940
Question How do you deal with. Differences in their responses with the multiple paths.

111
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:38,850
So if you ask a certain question in different ways and you like different, Sarah is going to be a great person to ask that question.

112
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,890
So if you can remember to bring that up on Thursday, that's a great one.

113
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,940
I haven't actually had to conduct interviews and I think you have to kind of have done it to.

114
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:55,410
No, and she has done quite a few, so she'll be a great one to ask that question because that's a good one.

115
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:08,160
This is just something I lifted from NHANES and again, it's just information about each of the different steps of the multi paths.

116
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:19,730
Just more information. And I just wanted to point out that this is our Web based essay to.

117
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:25,620
So this is our Web based, automated, self administered 24 hour recall.

118
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,070
And this too follows a multi pass approach.

119
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:33,680
It's similar to the USDA, one that was developed for NHANES.

120
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:45,830
So you can see that it has a quick list and then they review if there's any gaps in meals to make sure that that's that it's actually a gap.

121
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:51,320
And then they go back and they go they review for more details this forgotten foods.

122
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:58,820
So the multi pass approach is very similar from administrative, you know, from system to system.

123
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:05,190
And so. It may not be exact, but it tends to be very similar.

124
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,229
So I've heard a lot about this in the context world reserve settings is the multiple

125
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:14,940
has also used in more clinical settings as well or is there more variability there?

126
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:20,490
Again, great question, because my understanding is in the clinical setting.

127
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,540
If it's not research based, it's going to be very different.

128
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:34,360
Yeah. And so that would be a great question to ask for right now, if it's a clinical setting that is a research study that's conducted in outpatient,

129
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:38,230
then they would want to follow this if they're using a 24 hour recall.

130
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:46,239
That makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. I just want to share as a clinician that there will definitely have more to say about this.

131
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:53,950
But typically you find a tool that really works for you and specific questions that fit the population that you're serving.

132
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,830
And that's how you go about.

133
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:05,720
Like, I had to figure out what the forgotten foods were for the people I was serving, and I wouldn't necessarily go step by step.

134
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:13,930
Yeah, but. Or support like a food facility where they have a research component to it.

135
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:21,489
Yeah. Yeah. Speaking for patients, it's also going to depend on what you what information you actually need.

136
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,060
So you I remember at one point, Sara, making the comment.

137
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:30,760
Sometimes you don't get into such in-depth query of somebody's diet.

138
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:37,080
Yeah. And these are just other applications.

139
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,629
These are the two applications we've talked about with Multi Path, again, USDA,

140
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:50,840
with NHANES, we have assay two for the the system that's often used for research for diet,

141
00:16:51,140 --> 00:17:02,600
24 hour collection, 24 hour recall collection as well as analysis is and ACR, which stands for Nutrition Data System for Research.

142
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,140
It's something that was developed out of University of Minnesota.

143
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:18,170
And I know later when this is I was leaving actually the University of Arizona finishing up my Ph.D. They had just acquired the you know,

144
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:24,319
it's basically you just have to buy the number of licenses or licenses or whatever.

145
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:29,840
But anyway, it was just starting to ramp up where most research.

146
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,790
Projects that utilize 24 hour recalls,

147
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:48,630
especially if it's a fairly established air a program will have in the S.R. two int to collect the data and then analyze.

148
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,240
Sara will be using an DSR for Thursday.

149
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:59,700
I'm not sure how much time she'll have to go through it, but she usually walked students through just to see what it's like to interview

150
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,680
a respondent or participant and to actually put the information in directly.

151
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:12,360
So it saves steps because you can enter the information as the interview is being conducted.

152
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,390
Okay. This is just a slide.

153
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:28,090
We already talked about this that 24 recalls, one of the key strengths about them is being open ended and again,

154
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:35,610
working in populations specific or where there's cultural specific foods.

155
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:44,199
This was from a community that I worked in and they this is an adobe oven where all the bread in the community was baked in here.

156
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:54,190
And so we had to basically create a recipe with the ingredients that they use so that every time an individual.

157
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,260
Responded The bread in their diet.

158
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,470
We had a little recipe for that bread.

159
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:16,540
And likewise there were stews and foods that we had to basically add to the database because they were unique to the community.

160
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,140
One of the areas for error.

161
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:33,340
One of the considerations for measurement error in 20 prior recalls is estimating portion sizes.

162
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:46,960
And if you just think about what you consumed yesterday and being able to estimate what you ate in cups, sizes, ounces, what have you, it's difficult.

163
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:58,990
And so in order to improve the quality of the data that's being collected, this is a very important aspect of 24 hour recalls,

164
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:07,960
being able to provide portion size estimate tools for the respondents or participants so that they can estimate to the best of their ability.

165
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:14,320
And so it can be actual containers, you know, household measuring containers.

166
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:27,999
It can be a booklet, it may be a combination, it may be measuring tools, rulers, wedges like pizza or so forth, so or even digital images.

167
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,530
So the AC two four uses digital images and we'll talk a little bit more about that when we talk about measurement error.

168
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:42,550
But digital images seem to be helpful for improving the accuracy of portion size estimates.

169
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,379
There's lots of good models and you don't see it as much.

170
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:57,180
But yes, in fact I have a I should bring it now. Maybe I can't do it on Thursday, but on Tuesday I have a whole bin of.

171
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:05,460
Food models that look just like food. And it used to be that's what was used was the food models now.

172
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:11,850
It may be that they still use it and for some studies and applications but.

173
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,760
Yeah. Yeah. And they're pretty realistic. They are?

174
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,430
Oh, sure. My patients were eating some of the peas with the plastic.

175
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:30,830
Oh, no. Yeah, I'll bring. I'll bring them on Tuesday cause they're they're they're pretty expensive because they're so realistic looking,

176
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:40,250
but they are very effective in terms of helping folks understand a particular size or estimating foods.

177
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,010
All right. Strengths, both strengths. The 24 hour recalls.

178
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:57,190
Without looking at the slide. AVI Yeah, so it's open ended.

179
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,870
So this is really important.

180
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:11,529
If you are assessing a population for the first time or if you're assessing a population that has literacy or numeracy concerns open ended,

181
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:17,559
especially a 24 hour recall where an interviewer can walk the person through their diet.

182
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,100
And it's the interviewer who has the burden of recording.

183
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,450
Yep. Okay. Like compared to the food frequency questionnaire,

184
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:33,700
you much easier to for the participant to remember what they had one day prior as opposed to like a year or a year.

185
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:37,030
Or even six months or even a month. Yeah.

186
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:45,610
Yeah. Yeah. But. The the second concerted effort we can see question there, for example.

187
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:51,400
Yes, I think the time it takes with the 24 hour recall.

188
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,360
Probably it depends. Some food frequency questionnaires are shorter, some are really long.

189
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,280
Yeah, and they take a long time and it's a bit much the burden is much greater, as you're saying,

190
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:09,130
with a food frequency questionnaire versus a 24 hour recall, because, again, the burden is on the interviewer.

191
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:17,500
Now, the exception to that is if it's automated, self-administered, then the burden is back on the respondent.

192
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,180
Because they're the ones I mean, they have to go through the computer system, know, prompting and so forth.

193
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:33,220
What are the strengths? Yeah, I have a question. Yeah. You know how long it takes to do the interview confidently or like, what's the time?

194
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:40,830
So when? So usually what they say is 30 to 45 minutes.

195
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:47,880
Sarah can give us a better idea. I'm sure it's probably somewhere in that timeframe, and it's possible that.

196
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:56,830
It's I'm sure it's got to be at least 25 to 30 minutes just going through.

197
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,010
I would be shocked if it's not. Yeah, but it's longer.

198
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:06,600
Yeah. Yeah. Limitations.

199
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:15,950
Yeah. Unless you repeat it multiple times, it doesn't capture much variation.

200
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:23,000
There is all kinds. People don't use the same thing every day and it can vary widely.

201
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:28,159
Yes. So. So infrequently.

202
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:34,220
Foods are not readily captured by either food records or 24 hour recalls.

203
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:41,600
Right. If we think about some just consumption of certain well, I know I can speak for myself when you're squash.

204
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,999
I don't eat two or three times a week. And so that's not going to be captured.

205
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,549
Well, in a 24 hour recall, especially if there's only two weekdays and a weekend.

206
00:24:52,550 --> 00:25:03,110
And that's oftentimes what we we recommend for 24 hour recalls is to use weekday recalls and then a weekend.

207
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:08,560
And we'll get to that as to why. What else?

208
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,610
Limitations. Yeah, we really have a trained interviewer.

209
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:18,940
Yeah. So it's more expensive because you have to train interviewers and they have to collect the data.

210
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:28,720
Now the cost is cheaper. Obviously, it's going to be less if it's automated, self-administered using assay two four.

211
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:36,610
Okay. So for larger studies, they might use 24 recalls and use assay two four as the means of collecting the data.

212
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:43,450
Yeah. Um, people are notorious for underestimating that portion of voices.

213
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:51,890
So if they doing a dietary, like a dietary intake on a diary where they're actually measuring the needed,

214
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,570
it could say, oh yeah, it's, it's a tablespoon that's like 3 to 3.

215
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:07,150
Right? So the difficulty of estimating portion sizes is actually a large source of random error in 24 hour records.

216
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:17,810
And with food records, we see improvement in estimating portion sizes, especially if it's weighed food records.

217
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,440
You don't see those as much. And because that is a bit more of a burden.

218
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:25,420
But okay, I think we covered quite a bit.

219
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:31,870
The other actually strength of the 24 hour recall is to remember this is a comprehensive, detailed.

220
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,910
Characterization of somebody's diet. Someone's diet? Anything else here?

221
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:44,810
One aspect of it. Element of surprise, if conducted by phone, decreases the potential for changes.

222
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:52,309
But we'll talk about that with measurement error. But one of the concerns is if some of these diet is modified,

223
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:57,670
if they know they're going to be interviewed, or if they're recording their own diet via food records.

224
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:06,440
So the element of surprise by a phone call saying, okay, let's read through your diet from yesterday.

225
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:16,160
Can to some degree lower or decrease that change in dietary behavior if they know their diet is being collected?

226
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:25,100
I think we covered everything else here. And the only other aspect is, again, it relies on memory.

227
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,360
So that is a limitation. Even though it's a shorter memory.

228
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:39,320
So if you had a research project and you had a very structured approach to how to conduct participants, we will contact you next day.

229
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:46,370
Yeah. Do you do sort of that element of surprise because there may be some adjustment that they won't be responding to?

230
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,600
There might be. But I know with with our project.

231
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:58,340
So days were ran. We just randomly picked and we just let them know that they were going to be receiving a phone call.

232
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,890
Now, in our case, we didn't always tell them what day.

233
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,390
But if you start to run into an issue where they're not home, then you actually have to schedule.

234
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:14,970
I know that. Because they're spaced out.

235
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,390
They may not remember. And then all of a sudden they get the phone call. Oh, yeah.

236
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:27,919
So there's always room for. For them to remember and maybe to make alterations.

237
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,610
But. It's just something that we.

238
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,770
The phone call does seem to reduce that to some degree. Yeah.

239
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:44,530
Yep. Something else interesting as upstream from the readings was that these two more generalizable than

240
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:50,259
food records because like more people are willing to participate in this because it's less burdensome.

241
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:55,620
So it could be like more generally. Yeah, because food records are more, much more.

242
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:01,660
Has anybody had to keep track? You know what, really keep track using food records you have.

243
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,770
Yeah. Burden. Yeah. Anybody else?

244
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:14,410
Yeah, I've done it just for myself personally, but it's a lot easier to just do the same thing every day because I think I just.

245
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I really like. Right, right.

246
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:26,380
Yeah. Yeah. And that's actually something to take into account if you're working with a population where the diet doesn't vary a lot,

247
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,430
that's actually a consideration in terms of the assessment method.

248
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:37,580
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And these are applications which I think are probably pretty intuitive and

249
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,280
may be used for dietary counseling to assess the diet of a patient or client.

250
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:52,540
And here you're interested in diet inadequacy or if you're concerned about excess nutrient exposure or so forth on baseline,

251
00:29:53,050 --> 00:30:00,160
just getting a baseline diet, maybe before a nutrition plan or so or meal planning.

252
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:09,790
Any. Any. Yep. Have any done any research that says like if somebody gets something out of their,

253
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:18,309
like doing a food report or a report for themselves that they would be more likely to like spend more time on it or whatever correctly.

254
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:22,480
Because if it's just for a research project, maybe that is what it says much.

255
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,290
So sometimes there's incentives given to respondents.

256
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:35,680
We had a researcher here at Michigan Medicine a number of years ago who had a study where he collected seven food records,

257
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:41,020
which I haven't gotten to food records, but just that's a lot. And we were laughing.

258
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,909
We were saying how? Ah.

259
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:52,270
And he was saying that actually his participants are very involved, but part of it had to do with the fact that it was a clinical study.

260
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:57,250
These were patients that had specific clinical diagnoses.

261
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:06,760
So they were more of more much more motivated. But he also said that there was a monetary stipend at the end if they completed all seven.

262
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:12,700
Yeah, yeah. There's ways around that too and I'll get to that adding.

263
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:19,959
Yeah. 24 hour recalls are used for national surveys.

264
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:31,330
So just globally as well as in the United States, 24 hour recalls are usually the most common approach for national surveillance approaches.

265
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:40,780
In some countries, they might use food records and so forth, and this is just to monitor intake as well as dietary patterns and diet quality.

266
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:45,610
This is the recommended approach for assessing nutritional adequacy of the population.

267
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:49,269
In other words, actually generating prevalence of inadequacy.

268
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:58,150
And we'll talk more about that in a couple of weeks. And 24 recalls may be used to evaluate effectiveness or compliance of an intervention.

269
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:05,890
It may be used to validate other major dietary assessment methods, such as a few or a few records.

270
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:12,820
So these are just sort of the low hanging applications of 24 hour recalls.

271
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:21,399
Okay. I'm going to kind of blitz through these so that we have time for our breakout sessions here.

272
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:27,220
But good records again captures current short term diet.

273
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:36,640
Longer term diet could be collected if there's multiple collection periods over six months, a year and so forth.

274
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:42,220
But generally, we consider this a short term current diet assessment.

275
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:47,440
And here respondents record all food beverages and supplements at the time they're consumed.

276
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,630
Another term they may be used is concurrently or real time.

277
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,760
And so this is considered a prospective assessment approach.

278
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,150
So in contrast to 24 hour recalls, which are retrospective food records are prospective.

279
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:11,350
So what's the advantage of a prospective assessment? Doesn't rely on memory.

280
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:16,210
Doesn't rely on memory. And that's key because memory is another source of error.

281
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:23,380
Yeah. So the individuals would measure actual intake.

282
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:32,380
The strength of food records is open ended, as we saw with the 24 hour recall records, very detailed food records, beverages and supplements consumed.

283
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:39,910
So they need to know the preparation methods, cooking methods, the brand names of any of the foods,

284
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:47,270
ingredients of mixed dishes, which is actually true for 24 hour recall and so forth, and then the same portion size.

285
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:58,120
Now, the nice thing about food records is portion sizes can be estimated much more readily, as if you're recording it concurrently.

286
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:03,570
You have, you know, now you have the measuring utensils and so forth.

287
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:08,980
Now the exception to this would be what if you're at a restaurant or someplace?

288
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:19,390
Then it might be trickier to estimate, but. Where this becomes a much more accurate estimate of portion sizes.

289
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:28,970
If is if it's a weighted food record where all food beverages and what have you are weighed and what they're recording is the actual grams.

290
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:38,710
Okay. So. When food records reduce portion size error considerably.

291
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:49,600
Food records are recorded either the days consecutively or non consecutively non consecutively is recommended.

292
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:56,950
Why would that be? What's the issue of consecutive versus Nonconsecutive order to represent divided by three?

293
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,950
For example, if that is something today, it doesn't mean that they always eat this type of food or this quantity of bread.

294
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:13,920
Yeah. So. Yeah. But the other. Like that, it would allow for just that greater variation because I guess I don't know.

295
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:20,340
I know for myself consecutively that I might make a big match or something one day, and then you do exactly the same thing the next day.

296
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,590
But then three days later, that's exactly it.

297
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,020
It's the leftover issue.

298
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:32,940
So if a person is eating leftovers for two or three days, then you're not going to get a good snapshot of the variability in the diet.

299
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,220
Yeah. So it's recommended that there nonconsecutive days. Three days is a common approach.

300
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:45,330
Or sometimes you'll see four days. Seven days leads to.

301
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:56,240
Well, actually, let me just take a step back. Anything over four days has been shown in research to result in progressively more participant fatigue.

302
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,420
And you'll have fallout as there's more days and I'm talking about in a given period.

303
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:11,430
So what is recommended is if you want an extended period of time, you have them collect three or four days.

304
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:17,400
Then there's sort of a brief rest period and then you have to collect another three or four days.

305
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,990
So you have separate intervals with a.

306
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:34,890
Rest period. The other issue is that clients of expense have to be trained to record appropriately.

307
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,450
So this again puts quite a bit of burden on the actual respond her client.

308
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:47,070
So not only are they having to record at the time, but they have to be trained on how to record.

309
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:57,120
And I just want to point out that most food records are open ended, but you will sometimes see in the literature food records that have food lists.

310
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:05,280
So that's considered a closed ended food record, and it just has a list similar to a f q.

311
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:12,510
But here they just check off which foods they consumed and then they estimate the portion size.

312
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:20,180
So. That's just one variation of a food record.

313
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:29,930
Our assay to force system can be used as a record or as a food record.

314
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:42,810
So we also have a web based food record system. Strengths and limitations.

315
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:47,320
Again, the strengths just detailed account of current short term diet.

316
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,600
This is a strong strength, its perspective and does not rely on memories.

317
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:56,730
So that reduces the error that can occur with memory.

318
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,790
Record completed concurrently with intake.

319
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:10,070
So potentially fewer beverage and food omissions. That's another important point with 24 hour recalls with the multi pass approach.

320
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:18,350
Omissions tend to be reduced considerably, but there still could be omissions, whereas with a food record that's less likely to happen.

321
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:24,050
Or it shouldn't if they're recording concurrently with consumption.

322
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:30,310
Potentially more accurate in terms of portion estimates, especially if it's a weight record.

323
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:41,930
The issue with the records here is it requires client, respondent, motivation, literacy and numeracy.

324
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:47,780
So this there's quite a bit of client burden that we train.

325
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:55,250
The longer the recording period, the less compliant respondents are and the less accurate your data will be.

326
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:05,690
So the key point here is that if you want to collect food records over a number of days, you need to break it up and give them some time in between.

327
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:14,870
Respondents may alter their diet because they are recording it, and we'll talk about that with measurement error.

328
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:25,340
But this is the is called reactivity bias and it's bias or reaction to actually the recording of somebodies diet.

329
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:29,720
And every activity bias is highest in food records.

330
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:35,280
Which I think makes sense. The concurrent recording.

331
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:46,209
More expensive to conduct because somebody has to enter all that information unless it's the automated assay to for it

332
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:54,730
may not be an option for certain groups because of literacy numeracy unless a proxy person is filling it out for them.

333
00:39:54,730 --> 00:40:07,990
And in some international settings, field workers, community workers may fill out a food record for an individuals in a community.

334
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:14,290
So I've seen papers where they've talked about food records that were filled out by a field worker and so forth.

335
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:25,060
So food records that might be collected for children or older adults that are in long term care again, may be filled out by proxy children.

336
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:33,490
That would be the parent or the caregiver. And in long term care, it may be some a staff or a family member.

337
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:41,450
So. And then this is just applications of food records, dietary counseling approach.

338
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:47,030
It's very common if dieticians or professionals are working with clients.

339
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,800
It's used for monitoring, compliance and dietary interventions.

340
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,299
As well as compliance and the nutrition plan.

341
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:07,240
A patient client assessing again, similar to what we see with 24 recalls, may be used to validate A of new F.

342
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,559
Q That was developed.

343
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:17,590
And I just want to point out, so food records are commonly used to validate an F Q and we'll talk about that when we get the validation.

344
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:27,250
But it has to do with the fact that the errors inherent in a food record differ from the errors inherent in a few.

345
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:34,360
And right from the get go, we have something different FFR a retrospective food records of prospective.

346
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,030
So already those two errors differ and that's what you want with a validation study.

347
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:48,820
So in some papers they will refer to food records as a gold standard in these validation studies.

348
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,159
I just caution you from you ever using the term gold standard with any dietary

349
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,980
assessment approach because they're not they all have issues and errors,

350
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:05,320
but food records are commonly used in validation studies.

351
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:11,409
So yeah, just a tiny comment that sometimes you can use food records for like as a,

352
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:15,820
as a starting method with a patient present to observe something like that.

353
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:20,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

354
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:28,540
And there's more applications for food because it's it's thought that food records can be used where 24 hour recalls are used.

355
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:35,199
The one exception is for assessing adequacy in a population because it's assumed that the

356
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,300
errors in food records are going to be similar to the errors in 24 hour for the most part.

357
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:44,890
And they have similar characteristics as an assessment method.

358
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:53,010
It's just they're not studied as much as 24 hour recalls and f cuz I think that's going to change though

359
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:59,980
over time because I'm seeing more papers that are evaluating food records now in terms of their ability,

360
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,700
their validity, shall I say, in applications.

361
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,590
And then the last thing I just wanted to point out is that 24 hour recalls and when food

362
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:16,209
records have been used to assess shared plate eating and I'm not going to get into this a lot,

363
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:26,560
except they have some resources here. For those of you, if you work with any populations where shared plate meals are prevalent, you know,

364
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:31,659
you can imagine that there's challenges in estimating an individual's intake with

365
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:39,130
shared plate consumption also if the use of bread is used for food consumption.

366
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:48,340
So these two papers are great resources for how to assess shared plate eating

367
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:53,800
patterns and recalls and weight food records have been used in those applications.

368
00:43:55,060 --> 00:44:04,690
Okay, resources after this class moving on professionally, it's important to I can't stress enough Thompson,

369
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:09,070
Fran Thompson and Amy Suber both I believe both are dietitians.

370
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:14,469
These two are both leaders in the US for dietary assessment methodology.

371
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:18,400
I mean, there's other research leaders in dietary assessment,

372
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:26,440
but they tend to be the ones to write really nice review or chapter readings on assessment and so forth.

373
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:31,510
Well, toilets, nutritional epidemiology for those of you interested in research,

374
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:40,510
the other one that I will talk more about is this dietary assessment primer from the National Cancer Institute has a really nice table that,

375
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:51,910
you know, if you're wondering what assessment method to use for a particular study design, they have a whole table that lays out recommendations.

376
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:01,690
And then again, those of you working internationally, this assessment resource from the field is really helpful.

377
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:08,930
So okay. We have about 20 minutes.

378
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:16,030
What I'd like to do well, first of all, are there any questions? Yeah.

379
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:30,550
Okay. What I'd like to do is break up into groups of three or four small groups and on the canvass web page, make sure each group has a laptop.

380
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:40,630
On canvas is a link to. You guys had a reading today and there are discussion questions that I would like you to go through in your group.

381
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:46,330
Pick one student to be a scribe to respond to those questions.

382
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:50,080
There is a second document on canvas where you can.

383
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:53,770
There's like six different pages. You can just pick a page.

384
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,300
You can be group one, two, three or four or five, six. And then you can just respond in that document.

385
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:02,230
And I'm going to leave those links up so that you can always revisit.

386
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:12,210
Those pages when we have group discussions so that you can go back and just remember what group you're in, right?

387
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:24,130
So again, break up into three or four, ideally is three, but I know some groups might be in four, move around to get those groups and risk,

388
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:44,070
you know, go through and respond to those discussion questions and then we'll report out that someone has no way you can join this group.

389
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:53,036
Yeah. Yeah. And so the link that has the document is right underneath the question document or the message.
