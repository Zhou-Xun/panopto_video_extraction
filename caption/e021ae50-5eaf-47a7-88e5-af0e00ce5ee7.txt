1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:08,309
Thing like this is sort of the child care week. And so, you know, everybody watch the raising of America and thank you for your comments.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:14,940
I'm kind of going through them. And there's there's just like so, so much going on in the space.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:22,410
I know we've talked a little bit about child care, but the next two sessions will kind of really dove into more about that.

4
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:29,010
And I think that the mini lectures, there's just like so much content that is,

5
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,339
I think, important to just like with like wash over you and figure out, you know,

6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,270
where and why and how to think about it and how that might make it better because there's a lot of potential in this space,

7
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,700
but we can discuss ways that that's kind of gone, you know, various different directions.

8
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,570
So today we'll talk about early childhood ed.

9
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,860
And I know that in the mini lecture, today's mini lecture, I talked about the kind of quality pieces and impacts.

10
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,179
So we'll talk a little bit more about that and that sort of sociopolitical context

11
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:10,320
piece like weaves throughout because child care is just contentious for some reason.

12
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,359
And the other thing we'll see if we get to this today or later,

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,929
but also wanted to talk a little bit more specifically as you guys are kind of thinking about the developmental context paper.

14
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:28,260
If anybody's thinking about this early childhood age range in their intervention paper or really,

15
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,260
you know, different kind of school based interventions,

16
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:41,340
we can talk about just sort of what those might look like in an early childhood context and then sort of review responses to Raising of America.

17
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,969
I'll, I'll also just so that you guys know, in case you want to get more info on all of that,

18
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,600
they're like five films in that series that are kind of all in this space.

19
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,930
So the one that you guys watch is really focused on the sort of history and background, which is, I think, important to know.

20
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:06,690
And the other thing I'll say is that just in like revising these slides between like last week and this week, last year at this time,

21
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:15,450
like this week, there was a lot going on in child care funding and space and pay for teachers and the build back better plan.

22
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,659
And if people were not tracking that,

23
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,420
a lot of that has got removed from the the build back better plan so kind of like

24
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,540
I did with some of the social policy slides right at the beginning I was like,

25
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,989
oh, these changes are actually not happening.

26
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,380
So we can we can talk some more about that.

27
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,190
Okay. But it just it's weird how this class timing for me lives here kind of aligns with these like in cycles.

28
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,230
So anyway, so this is kind of the big, you know, I talked about this in the mini lecture.

29
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,510
People have started talking about this Heckman equation now for like a decade at least.

30
00:02:51,960 --> 00:03:01,140
So it's this idea that, you know, investing early on will pay off big later and it is more bang for the buck.

31
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:10,050
And this is this non cognitive skills piece because what we know though cognitive skills are important for sure in early childhood.

32
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,870
But a lot of what happens here are things that we've talked about a lot in this class, like relational health and social emotional understanding.

33
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:24,239
And I would argue those are important in and of themselves, but they're also associated with later school and academic outcomes in a positive way.

34
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:32,459
So focusing on the sort of non-cognitive skills that people focus on in sort of these early year programs.

35
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,330
So this is like child age. Here's our 2 to 3 zone.

36
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,770
Here is 4 to 5 year olds, which is really the final year of preschool.

37
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:48,270
So sometimes preschool is two years and includes three year olds, but often it only includes one year and that's the 4 to 5 year olds.

38
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:58,800
So they're for whole entire years of a child's life, in a family's life where it's before they get that sort of last pre-K year,

39
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,919
I think we can all appreciate a lot happens in those 0 to 4 years and a lot of

40
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,510
preschool funded programs and like universal pre-K and people for that term,

41
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:17,849
that's really only talking about that final year. Some programs are certainly designed to serve like 3 to 5 year olds.

42
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,140
And when I talk about preschool age, I reference 3 to 5 year olds.

43
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:30,120
But in our education system, it's really that final year and that sort of moment that most kids can attend.

44
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,870
So, for example, Headstart, we'll talk more about kids can attend Headstart when they're 3 to 5 years old,

45
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,940
but because Headstart is not adequately funded to serve all the kids that it could possibly fund,

46
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,090
usually what happens is that kids only get like one year of that.

47
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,420
So just to kind of put that in perspective, the other thing I like to always say,

48
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:59,910
so Heckman is an economist and so kind of like with aces and heart disease when Heckman started talking.

49
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:05,510
About, Oh, early childhood education is important as a Nobel Prize winning economist.

50
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,010
People sort of started to pay more attention to early childhood education.

51
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:15,799
So that's sort of a point for like advocacy and who are you talking to and who you're engaging in.

52
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,780
Conversations around early childhood education and its potential is important because it

53
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:28,700
could draw more attention to this age group and what we can kind of do in this age group.

54
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,399
So this is a reading that was kind of floating on the next week that I said people wanted to look at it earlier.

55
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,230
We can this is sort of the upshot.

56
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:43,160
So first of all, as a developmental psychologist does a lot of early child care and early childhood development work.

57
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:50,450
And I think it's important to break apart these two things, which are the purpose of child care.

58
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,870
And I think this is what has become really, really well illustrated.

59
00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:01,579
Unfortunately, because of the pandemic, people were unable to get childcare and worked in their homes on Zoom.

60
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:08,660
If they were lucky and scrambled, if they were unlucky and had to go somewhere where they couldn't bring their child.

61
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:20,240
And we saw that when stable childcare went away, it really damaged the productivity of our workers right in our economy.

62
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,450
So they kind of like the economic spin on it.

63
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:33,500
And so I think this is really important, but this is kind of something that came up in the raising of the raising of America and comes up a lot.

64
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,670
Is that who should provide that right?

65
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:44,330
Who who provides this family need? I think this is an important point.

66
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:54,350
And making that workforce point is kind of where the build back better bill and maybe other bills in the future would have,

67
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,070
I guess I would say like traction in terms of funding,

68
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:08,750
devoting funding to child care because if people don't have it, it's really problematic and they can't work that sort of a purpose.

69
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,850
And then what we focus a lot on historically have focused a lot on in terms of the developmental process

70
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:25,620
is that high quality child care is really positive and promotes child outcomes in lots of domains.

71
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:30,360
So I think there's the both pieces and here she sort of, you know,

72
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,849
goes through these different processes, which lots of you could, you know, should make a lot of sense.

73
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:42,800
This is like a lot of what we've been talking about, but we want to focus on like what we can do for parents and what happens with kids.

74
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,840
And I think that if you have high quality child care like that military that they

75
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,800
had illustrated in the film or other other examples of high quality child care,

76
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,860
lots of these things can happen, but there's often less direct focus on this parent side.

77
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:05,329
And I think that's a missed opportunity because parents, you know,

78
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:11,210
when parents are involved in their own in their child's own child care and they actually get something from it,

79
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,400
as opposed to only a place where they drop off their kid so that they can go and work for the day.

80
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:22,250
That can be ultimately beneficial for children and the families.

81
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:34,030
But the thing that I worry about a little bit and sometimes a lot is like, did we over promise this pathway, right?

82
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:39,109
Did we say child care is going to fix everything and it's going to give parents jobs and

83
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:45,259
it's going to like make children be like less obese and have better nutrition and have,

84
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,770
you know, higher academic achievement. Like, is it going to do all of those things?

85
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:57,020
And I think that is the worry right now. And it's even the worry about like advocating for child care purely because of this.

86
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:03,090
Because if we say, like James Heckman has been saying, child care is really important because, you know,

87
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:09,110
if you invest in early childhood, you will, you know, have these long term, really important outcomes for the kids.

88
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:19,430
I think that's true, but I think that's not necessarily the only argument to make to promote provision of child care.

89
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,150
Does that make sense? So I think in the raising of America,

90
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:33,799
they are they do a nice job sort of illustrating all of the different dramas and politics and considerations around how to talk about child care,

91
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,280
who gets it, who pays for it, what, you know, do we think about the quality of it?

92
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:47,260
And if this is custodial care, you know, does it have that potential to go on these tracks and maybe they're not?

93
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:55,070
So I think that's my like obviously my bias is like, I think high quality child care is really essential.

94
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,690
But I think we. Lurie We, we, we run a risk of.

95
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:08,450
We're promising if we only focus on like it's going to make kids better in 20 years, that's not as compelling of an argument.

96
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,580
Sort of that advocacy perspective. Okay.

97
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:23,419
And I wanted to also dove into a little bit of that mess in terms of why I think we're all like we could get in the in the in the trap,

98
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:32,210
I guess, of overpromising. The impact of child care is that there have been some big studies like high profile studies, particularly Head Start,

99
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:41,690
which is often it's studied so much because it's heavily regulated and they collect a lot of data and they roll out big initiatives.

100
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,340
We'll talk more about Head Start in this time,

101
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:53,840
but Head Start does a lot with early childhood that is about is but has been evaluated and so does Head Start Impact study.

102
00:10:54,020 --> 00:11:01,310
I don't know if people have heard of the study sort of like will occasionally like make new headlines because they follow up the kids over time.

103
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,000
But one thing to know is that the head to head sort of impact study, it was not a perfectly designed study.

104
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,740
And what happened?

105
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:17,150
I remember I just mentioned that not all kids who can qualify for Head Start from from an income perspective actually receive Head Start.

106
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:25,580
And so families were like signing up to be in the Head Start impact study and kids and families in the control group.

107
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:32,150
So the ones who didn't get a head start were, you know, denied Headstart opportunity.

108
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:39,500
But so often they found other preschool opportunities that were like in the neighborhood or elsewhere through other sources.

109
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:44,720
Great Start Collaborative is another place where you can get lower cost preschool.

110
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:53,750
So this idea of like randomization didn't really, wasn't really implemented well in the Headstart impact study.

111
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,930
And so that's a problem.

112
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:05,090
And like our like research methods like, you know, alarm bells to be going off because while it's a very real world occurrence, but B,

113
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,440
we don't we can't really assess what's paralleled sort of the impact of Head Start

114
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,420
because the randomization from the get go wasn't perfect and was sort of violated.

115
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,870
So that's one thing. The other thing is that those of us who've, you know,

116
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:27,530
worked in any kind of intervention setting or school setting or any program know that, you know, dosage is really important.

117
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:31,669
So like child attendance, that is dosage typically.

118
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:36,290
And all these Head Start analyzes and you know, that varies and we can measure that.

119
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:43,730
But it also reflects kind of maybe some other things going on with families that families are not able to get their kids to.

120
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,900
Head Start, we've heard a lot recently about like bus drivers.

121
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:53,240
Busses are unreliable, bus drivers are rare. And so that wasn't as much.

122
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,480
The case in this era was sort of the nineties when they were doing the study.

123
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:02,450
But there's certainly lots of reasons underlying why families may not be able to get to Head Start every day.

124
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,590
And so it results in like less dosage of Head Start for the kid.

125
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,910
But then also it's kind of picking up on these other factors. And so we know that varies a lot.

126
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:20,060
And again, it's measured by it's sort of imperfectly measured. And then classroom level variables are something that are important to think about.

127
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,590
And so what's sort of one key classroom level variable that you guys might think is important?

128
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,059
How many kids are in the classroom? How many kids in the classroom? Absolutely.

129
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,300
Great point. One thing about Head Start is that there.

130
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,230
That's regulated. Yeah. Kind of. This is why Head Start is awesome.

131
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,620
I'll talk more about Headstart, but. So there's like seven. Well, but there are 17 kids in the classroom, two teachers,

132
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:51,970
a lead in a teacher at other preschools where kids might have found care, might have been smaller, but might have been larger.

133
00:13:52,750 --> 00:14:00,370
And so when we think about preschool quality, that's a huge variable in terms of how many what's the ratio really it's ratio and it's

134
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:05,650
like number of bodies in the classroom because I would argue like 17 plus it's 34,

135
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,770
34 little bodies in a classroom, even with four teachers,

136
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:18,010
is a whole lot of bodies in the classroom compared to 17 and 17 is still a lot like eight is like a much more manageable number.

137
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:25,630
Yes. And this is just everything is a matter of like the this thing is like.

138
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:36,060
How so? I'm trying to figure out if the same faces every day.

139
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,310
Yeah. So, like, how much? Almost like how much turnover of kids.

140
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,680
That's a good point. So yeah, like this idea of dosage, which is really attendance.

141
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,149
Who's showing up every day like that can sort of switch classroom dynamics for sure.

142
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:59,550
And so preschool and Head Start are sort of there is year round school, but they usually run on an academic calendar.

143
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:05,550
So it's like the start of your September, you know, if you're talking about a bunch of young, you know,

144
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:11,159
a bunch of sort of young three year olds that can look really different from a bunch of young four year olds.

145
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,690
They've just had an entire additional like quarter life development.

146
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:21,120
So their skills are really different. So if you have a mixed age classroom, that is where that can become really important.

147
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,979
Like what's the composition of the kids in your classroom? So absolutely.

148
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:31,350
And who's been there since the beginning. So someone coming in in the middle of the year, that can happen.

149
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,849
And then think about like all the classroom routines that have gotten established and like

150
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:40,680
how does that kid sort of adapt to being at like a newcomer in in the classroom for sure.

151
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:49,170
What's another like classroom level except turnover and turnover of the teaching staff or stuff like that?

152
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:57,450
Yeah, totally. So teacher factors are significant, like classroom level variables.

153
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,640
There's also, of course, school like sort of context level factors,

154
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,149
but teacher turnover is huge and teacher training and teacher education and teacher experience.

155
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:18,120
So I also mentioned that Head Start is like constantly kind of coming up with new and improved, sometimes improved,

156
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,910
sometimes not things to do in the classroom, you know, informed by science, but like new things.

157
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:29,010
And so teachers and Head Start need to go through a lot of training.

158
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:35,040
There's sort of always a new, you know, in August, there's always like two weeks where it's just like training,

159
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,239
training, training, which is great, but it's a high burden, right.

160
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,889
And so teacher turnover and we'll talk more about that in terms of just again,

161
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:50,670
recent news cycles have kind of focused on this, like how little people are paid for what they're asked to do.

162
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,059
Because I would argue like that is a really hard job anyway.

163
00:16:54,060 --> 00:17:02,250
It's a really hard job. And the people who are amazing preschool teachers are like beautiful to watch in action.

164
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,000
And it's you just realize like, wow, this is impressive.

165
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,350
It's really difficult to do so. Yeah, teacher factors for sure.

166
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:16,020
Um, also like do teachers kind of, you know, are teachers from the community where the kids are from?

167
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:22,560
The Head Start model says, yes, that is a value that we have and that's what we try to do.

168
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:32,009
But that also introduces some, you know, variation in terms of what people's educations are and where they've trained and all of that kind of stuff.

169
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:37,110
So the teacher level piece is there's a lot to do with teachers.

170
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:44,820
Yeah. Okay. Another one is probably like materials that they have, like book learning, you know,

171
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:50,520
online stuff, you know, all that material that a lot of times teachers have to pay for.

172
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:56,760
Yes, definitely. Very good point. And they talking about quality in all these different areas.

173
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:02,040
Here's how we can build quality. A lot of that is materials which, you know, this is not only materials,

174
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,930
but it makes sense because also, like kids can be hard on materials and they don't last forever.

175
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:16,530
Absolutely. And you use it up, right? Like you use up paper and paint and all the things that they all the lovely, messy stuff that they do at school,

176
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,170
which is wonderful, but not all parents kind of can have the opportunity to do that.

177
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:28,680
Um, let's see. Oh, in terms of I didn't put this on, but like, yeah, sort of contextual variables.

178
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:34,710
Like is it located in is your head start or your preschool located like in a church basement, which many of them are?

179
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,080
Is it located in an elementary school where, you know, you're with bigger kids in the hallways,

180
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,470
you're not, like roaming with them, but like you're sort of in this bigger school building.

181
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:49,530
And so those kinds of things can have implications for, you know, center based effects.

182
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:56,070
Schools typically have more resources. Teachers are paid a little more highly.

183
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,150
There's like a cafeteria where they can prepare food, etc.

184
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,899
So there's a lot of these variabilities that lead to design challenges.

185
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:11,250
And those were very again, they were measured as best they could be in the Head Start impact study, but not far from perfect.

186
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:19,920
The other thing with the head headstart impact study that like, you know, does this work, does Headstart work, does early childhood education work?

187
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,520
Is that they it's hard to measure.

188
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:32,160
It's a lot harder to measure where kids go after preschool like you can because basically they get into the K through 12 system in the U.S.

189
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:41,760
So they go into this bigger system that is also regulated in its own way and provides data that we'll talk about more.

190
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:48,650
But there's quite a bit of variability in terms of the school systems that kids are going into.

191
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,239
So they might be emerging from Head Start as a four year old or five year old

192
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,100
young five who like reading an emerging reader and really on a great track.

193
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,130
And then they get into a school system that's just really struggling.

194
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,400
The kindergarten teachers are overwhelmed.

195
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,500
They just had a turnover of teacher, you know, with lots of things can happen at that kind of inflection point.

196
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,610
And so that's something that the Headstart impact study really pointed out.

197
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:20,330
And some programs have done a better job at sort of identifying what the key factors are.

198
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:29,000
And a lot of it remember we were talking about like with early with early intervention like that family school connection,

199
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,520
that's certainly one factor that's really important. So families might feel really connected to like their preschool teacher,

200
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:39,280
but less connected to the school context, especially if it's like a big elementary school.

201
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,290
The kids bust parent doesn't ever enter the school.

202
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,920
That's very different from like a preschool where you might have been more connected.

203
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,040
Yeah, Jack, I fell for it because I was looking at high schools, but so like for Head Start,

204
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,230
is the funding all sourced from federal government or whatever?

205
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,920
All right. Does it differ? It's a good question, differs a little bit.

206
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:10,909
So if you're a Head Start administrator, you're like the grantee who's received a headstart grant from the federal government most if not all.

207
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:16,640
And I believe that's actually a requirement of the program or it used to be you have to seek additional funding.

208
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,879
So it's like a matching if you guys are familiar with matching programs.

209
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:26,950
So a Head Start grantees can be like a community action agency and they say, Great, we've got a head start grant.

210
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:34,580
That means we can serve low income preschoolers and give them preschool, but we need to provide some matching funds of our own.

211
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:41,900
And so they don't need to match the full amount that the Headstart grant would be, but they do have to like have some skin in the game.

212
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,860
And so that presents some challenges for like a smaller agency.

213
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:55,070
To get a head start grant is going to be harder because also when you get a head start grant,

214
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:02,630
there is a lot of regulation and paperwork and outcomes, assessment and training and requirements again,

215
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,520
all of which are great, but take a lot of effort and burden and some of that,

216
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,040
a lot of it is kind of unfunded and it has to be done by the people who are running the agency.

217
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:20,860
So. It's a great question. And I think that that funding piece, you know,

218
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:28,270
that adds to this within program heterogeneity and certainly across program heterogeneity in terms of saying like blanket.

219
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:32,400
Now Headstart works. Headstart doesn't work. Like none of us would say that.

220
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,210
But like, it's far from that simple. Right?

221
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:45,100
The the part about like the educator piece, which is like that little blog, we've just kind of illustrate some of the family and child factors,

222
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:53,680
you know, that we can imagine go into a child's experience in Headstart, child readiness for preschool, etc. like how do they have books in the home?

223
00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:01,230
What's their daily schedule like? Do they have a quiet place to sort of sit and do their work, even their preschool work?

224
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,870
So there was sort of an add on study called the Feces Study,

225
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:10,779
which is like family and child experiences to some of these Head Start Headstart evaluation studies.

226
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:16,269
And that was trying to kind of pull apart like for rich families, is Head Start working?

227
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:21,700
What are the characteristics of those families? Which families are more challenged and that kind of thing?

228
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:31,360
So there have been more like subtle analysis of Headstart impact study data and basically they're sort of showing up, you know,

229
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:39,759
families who are more, you know, in deeper poverty are not benefiting as much or they're benefiting to a point, but then they need more of a support.

230
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,270
And that's where,

231
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:47,260
like you think about parent support programs coming in kind of back to those first videos about like parent executive function being important.

232
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:58,389
That's kind of what the face of study has shown a few times. And then this piece about quality, you know, heterogeneity across programs, you know,

233
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:02,860
as also said, but like materials and things I've talked about staffing and training.

234
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:07,810
The money invested is kind of that staff is question like what you know agencies need

235
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:15,370
to provide and I think that this is you know kind of the upshot is that people say,

236
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,299
you know, when it worked well, you know, you saw impact of Head Start,

237
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:28,360
but there was just a lot going in administering this big program nationwide that that contributed to, you know, small effects.

238
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:35,590
So I think that is all like important to think about when we're thinking about,

239
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:40,330
you know, kind of over potentially overpromising early childhood education.

240
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,300
And the economists, some of them like to delve into this, but some of them like really don't.

241
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:51,940
And so they want a little much more clean design to look at these evaluations.

242
00:24:55,030 --> 00:25:01,780
Okay. So keeping that in mind, this reading, I like to know it's old.

243
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:10,930
It's sort of like from the original development of Head Start. But Ed Ziegler is the guy who is like telling his story in that.

244
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:19,790
And he was a, you know, professor and he was sort of called in to say, like, how would you advise this government program?

245
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:28,810
And we're going to start it. And so it was not the most like implementation, science informed planning process.

246
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,360
So how do we sort of think about maybe adding value to early childhood education?

247
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:38,080
And then I think what's really important is to think about, you know,

248
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:45,130
evaluating and both to evaluate like, ooh, what works well, what works well for which families?

249
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:53,680
And could we subtract, provide support to those families who for whom it's not working well, but then also, can we implement what's like not working?

250
00:25:54,340 --> 00:26:07,810
And so an example of the implementation a little bit was that it was like 99 or 2000 connected to the Bush administration and others.

251
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:14,200
They started really putting a big literacy push into Head Start, which I mean,

252
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,370
literacy is great, literacy is important, and literacy does start in early childhood.

253
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:25,540
So that was a really important thing to focus on, but they kind of didn't provide adequate supports for literacy.

254
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:30,279
Then they started sort of assessing literacy in these ways that are more challenging

255
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,080
for preschoolers to actually show that they knew things about reading and words.

256
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:40,930
And so Head Start kind of took a look at math. National Head Start took a look at those data,

257
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:49,210
and they kind of took they kind of backpedaled a little bit on some of these literacy focused initiatives back to sort of social emotional supports.

258
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:56,500
So it was just like one example of showing, you know, don't throw tons of effort after something that's not working so well.

259
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,709
Okay. So we want to have good design.

260
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:06,640
We want to measure those active ingredients about quality and dosage and implementation and also what happens at the follow up.

261
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:14,860
And then I think we also want to articulate what outcomes we're talking about, like are we talking about child?

262
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,760
Social competence emerging from preschool.

263
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:25,090
I was talking about like, you know, third grade reading level, which is a huge outcome assessment.

264
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:33,070
Are we talking about having parents complete their GED and get job training as an outcome of a Head Start program?

265
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:37,090
So again, like all of these things could be outcomes,

266
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:45,129
but sort of where is our lens and how do we promote those outcomes and then make the link back to,

267
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:49,690
as the agency say, like, well, we do a really great job on, you know, parent job training.

268
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:55,120
So therefore we should put that in, you know, to say fund us again, the federal government to keep this program going.

269
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:04,239
Okay. The other thing I like about this bike reading, it's just like very honest about Ziegler and it's sequel.

270
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,020
It was like a wonderful, kind old man. Right.

271
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,330
And he was sort of reflecting on his career as this, you know, person who helped to really develop Head Start.

272
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,820
But sort of thinking about, you know, yourselves and experts.

273
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,900
How do you advise policymakers and like, what do you tell them?

274
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:30,370
Right. And so, like, do you honestly reflect with policymakers about like the pros and cons of your program?

275
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:38,680
Do you oversell your program? You know, do you try to wedge new outcomes into your program so that they can say,

276
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,399
oh, not only can we get an impact on this outcome, but also this outcome.

277
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,690
So, like, not only, you know, physical health, but also mental health, for example.

278
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,340
So I think that this is an important thing for us to just sort of like muse and carry forward

279
00:28:51,340 --> 00:29:00,280
because we can see how tricky it can be to kind of try to get something through as a policy.

280
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:07,800
Right. And so raising of America is all very much about big picture federal policy, but even policy with a small P right,

281
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:16,840
like how do we kind of articulate honestly without overpromising what we think our program is going to do?

282
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:22,030
Okay. So I think this is important for public health for sure. Okay.

283
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:28,560
So thinking about raising America. We want to hear your thoughts.

284
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,180
These are just some quotes that I pulled out that I particularly liked from it,

285
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:39,599
because I think they highlighted some things and I particularly like the like the

286
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,290
military one and that concentrate on the mission because I think that speaks to

287
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:48,570
the workforce piece that are like the workforce argument that we all just saw

288
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:55,050
and are continuing to see because child care is urgently in a crisis right now.

289
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,220
It still is about concentrating on the mission.

290
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:06,569
And then the other thing again, Marian Wright Edelman is just sort of one of these, you know, famous figures.

291
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:10,530
But the other piece is this issue that children can't vote.

292
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,559
Right? And so children don't have this voice.

293
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:20,730
And so how do we kind of work as advocates knowing what works well for kids and advocating for those things?

294
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:26,790
So we have to be informed about what works well and, you know, child trends, other places.

295
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:31,530
I've given you guys as resources to figure out what does work well, because that's critically important.

296
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:44,280
But then to advocate for that. And so I think it's important to consider and I'll have some discussion questions in a minute,

297
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:51,660
but what is the relevance of these historical events that we saw like in the Dome and just kind of these

298
00:30:51,990 --> 00:31:00,390
reflections that people had in the film to the current moment in terms of child care coming out of COVID?

299
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:05,760
Child care cost. Child care access is very low currently.

300
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:11,999
I don't know if anybody has personal knowledge of people who are struggling to find child care,

301
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:21,030
but there are a lot of people who are just at their wits end and cannot find childcare, let alone quality child care.

302
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:25,770
Like they'd be happy for custodial child care for a few days a week to like, go to work.

303
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,020
And so thinking about, you know, how to how to link these up.

304
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:46,770
So I might just put these little questions up. So I think that we can do a little break out in our groups and reflect on these questions.

305
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:52,500
And then I think it would be great to have some group discussion thinking about this child,

306
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:58,110
all these child care considerations and particular legislation.

307
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:04,980
But I also wanted to ask if anybody had a particular just to like get us all in this space of think about the movie.

308
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:11,260
If anybody had a particular thought or reflection they wanted to share about the film, first you saw it all.

309
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:19,649
I don't know if people watched it a week ago or when they watched it, but anything that kind of sticks with you from it were learning something.

310
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:26,150
News. Had some. Shocks or surprises, which I think they were money in.

311
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,070
I mean, thoughts. From the group.

312
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,280
Yeah. Yeah. I think one thing that was a little bit shocking was the camera exactly.

313
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:47,150
Was saying. But that like childcare facilities are inspected or regulated less closely than like some tenants.

314
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,260
Yeah, that was a little bit shocking to me. Yeah.

315
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:56,780
And if you guys remember, like from one of those very first readings about social policy and history,

316
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:00,640
they like established the ASPCA before Child Protection Services.

317
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:07,070
So I always think about that point. It's like the same kind of, you know, like mismatch.

318
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:13,590
Right. Absolutely. Yeah, but yeah.

319
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:20,579
Well, I watched it like over a week ago, but I remember this big, you know, like how interesting,

320
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:26,790
like how the political divide though like created I feel like was also similar like the political divide that we see now.

321
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:39,720
And, um. Yeah, but right now it's a lot and it's, it's overwhelming to think about how to overcome that.

322
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:45,240
And I know elections are coming, and I know that's cause that's very stressful.

323
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:55,590
Yeah, but I think that all of these things kind of can be, you know,

324
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:01,280
flipped to today for sure, because we we have a lot of the similar really big challenges.

325
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:08,790
Yeah. I thought it interesting how like, concessions were made for women to work during the war and then like as soon as the war was over,

326
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,750
they're like, okay, that was more.

327
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:22,500
Yeah. But interesting how it can see something of working and then just stop it and then wonder like, why we're here right now.

328
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,490
Yeah. Yeah. It is really stunning.

329
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:30,680
I agree. And. Yeah, yeah.

330
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:37,350
Oh, I was also really annoyed because they're like, just do it.

331
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:43,530
Just care of your children at home, like, and you don't need any resources and like, oh well,

332
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:48,820
after the war, families just got like a floundering services, and now we don't have anyone else.

333
00:34:48,840 --> 00:35:00,260
I mean, I really like. I mean, I think, again, like I said, like last year, this week,

334
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:07,980
there was really a lot of discussion and awareness of like, oh, my gosh, people don't work effectively from home.

335
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:16,579
Oh, my gosh. We don't pay childcare workers that much, like. And like that momentum does not seem to be there.

336
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:21,680
But it has been like such a crisis state right now, child care.

337
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:28,510
And there's just this, like, disconnect. And I don't have the solution.

338
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:37,400
But it's really challenging because that film, I think, does a good job of like a,

339
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:46,520
I think introducing new knowledge because I think a lot of it is like not talked about, but b just sort of,

340
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:52,760
you know, highlighting some of the it's not the origins of all of the things that we're going through now,

341
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,440
but it's a lot of the immediate origins, I guess relatively immediate.

342
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:08,420
So okay, so pondering these kind of questions, just thinking about that film, like again, thinking about, okay,

343
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:16,250
how do we make these points to an audience that's not already kind of, you know, drunk and drunken, drank the Kool-Aid?

344
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:20,480
Early childhood education might be really important.

345
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,790
And then this is I do think is challenging.

346
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:28,820
And I think that there's some some change here.

347
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:35,830
There's some not change. And then I think this is an important piece like race, gender, class.

348
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:41,490
Like how does this play into childcare to be? Today.

349
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:50,219
So why don't we do like a little ten minute, small group discussion and then kind of come back?

350
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:57,650
And so I just like wanted you guys to reflect a few minutes broadly on the film and then we can kind of come back and have our have our discussion.

351
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:02,820
And I think last time we did Groups of three which.

352
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,490
This seems like it will work out well today, too.

353
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:13,270
This might be groups of. So why don't you guys group yourselves in three?

354
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,430
Does that sound reasonable?

355
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:23,020
And then I can kind of float around to different groups and we can reflect on these or any other things that come up in the film, for sure.

356
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,270
Okay. All right, let's do it.

357
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:35,320
You guys can group each other, I think three or four. Whenever it's convenient for seating.

358
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,090
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

359
00:37:46,390 --> 00:38:04,280
Yeah. I do this every week and I feel like I have a lot.

360
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:16,490
Is it true that. I just going things I know.

361
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:45,540
Yeah. Like I said, you're going to have a lot of flexibility knowing that he's in the right way.

362
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:56,480
And I think that a lot of people are.

363
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:16,700
Like when I was on, I'm like, I just don't think that and I would have to recalibrate for this year.

364
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:25,710
They military families like. I love that feeling.

365
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,980
And I just felt like it just didn't work out that.

366
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:42,560
When I got out there and, you know, I was like, has.

367
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,110
That. It is like that.

368
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:58,080
I have not. I don't feel like.

369
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,780
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

370
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:08,910
It's not like I was, like, ran in. Like, there was, like, a short time.

371
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:23,910
I would like to say, you know, it's a productive meeting.

372
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:28,680
So I have, you know, you.

373
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:35,950
I like to grow up. And I had heard that show.

374
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:49,480
I mean, she. Well, the other thing is, I think not enough right there.

375
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:02,340
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you very much.

376
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:10,620
Yeah. You know, I think your point being.

377
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:27,980
Yeah. That was my place.

378
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:55,520
But. And right now they are not even aware of it that but would have to have a that exactly what.

379
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:22,570
Workers under. But I know that it doesn't really feel like that.

380
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:38,940
You know, I just I have always felt like I was in front of you and I was like, yeah.

381
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:55,220
And I think that my whole life and it's a sort of that you're not going to understand your perception if you're to.

382
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:13,360
It's very difficult to get.

383
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:25,210
Just the right.

384
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:35,320
I don't know what's better while I.

385
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:54,580
There is nothing like that. After all, it was about this guy that he's going to try to.

386
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:09,410
Part of the problem is that they have implemented.

387
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:16,940
Yeah. I think that has been lost right now.

388
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:27,690
My. Just like that.

389
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:41,800
I felt like now much I was going to have to.

390
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:50,180
Yeah. I mean, has that been like a different athlete this year?

391
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:55,890
Like, he was kind of.

392
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:06,970
I don't know. Yeah. You know, I guess I didn't like the idea because I like a lot of things.

393
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:10,300
That's not what I like.

394
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:15,210
Well, you know, I think I like my style.

395
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:23,890
I. You heard.

396
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:37,160
I. But I did look like I do.

397
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:43,800
I don't like anything.

398
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:59,180
I'd like to label the chapter. Like one of the things that I kind of like the way they had to go.

399
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:08,740
I didn't know you were coming after.

400
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:21,470
Like. I feel like my age was running out there, like.

401
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,520
Yeah. Really?

402
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:44,620
That. You know, you just think about your.

403
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,480
I guess I.

404
00:46:56,550 --> 00:47:04,730
Yeah. So there was a lot of.

405
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:19,590
Anywhere like around the country, you know, like, you know, it's just.

406
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,100
It's still so much. Yeah.

407
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:28,960
Yeah, yeah. Right.

408
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:41,520
That's right. Yes. And that you just had like a certain luxury of like, I really like I was like, no, no, no.

409
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:48,090
I mean, like I listen to your for like not on this program.

410
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,290
And they were like, I'd like support you.

411
00:47:54,110 --> 00:48:08,780
Families would have to get ready for health care that allow parents like they don't want to be grounded so they could go.

412
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,440
I think that. Yadda, yadda, yadda, yadda.

413
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:27,960
What I. The. One, two, three.

414
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:36,390
That you're having a really thick. Okay, guys.

415
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:40,419
So we come back together as a group. It sounds like some good discussions.

416
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:50,530
I know. I got to chat with some people individually. Anything like bubble up to the top that people can comment on to the to the large group?

417
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,080
Yes, I can actually just have a quick question. Yeah.

418
00:48:54,550 --> 00:49:05,200
We like to share with you like if the one within the video with the political system didn't get what they want, it doesn't go through.

419
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,760
Oh, I see what you're saying. That is a fascinating question.

420
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:16,749
So in the military, I know people have experience, but what my knowledge of talking with, you know,

421
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:20,440
like behavioral scientists and psychologists who worked with the military is that

422
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:27,550
it's quite once it's decided like at the top that that something is a good idea.

423
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,450
Like, it's it's like how things go.

424
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:37,240
It's not, you know, people don't need to buy in because they're told, like, this is now what we're doing.

425
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:44,020
And so once that decision got made at the top and I don't you know, I don't know how that happened exactly,

426
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:48,640
but it sounded like they were talking about one particular like stakeholder who is a champion.

427
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:55,960
If we've talked, I think, early, early on about somebody being a champion for kids, it's another Bronfenbrenner term social ecological model.

428
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:01,659
But that person was a champion for child care in the military and high quality child care.

429
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:11,530
And so because of being that system where people are kind of used to like literally falling in line with the plan, that's how it got widespread.

430
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:24,469
It's a little interesting. We were talking about sort of military families as like a valid and valued, you know, section of society in the U.S.

431
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:30,140
Right. In some in some ways, although I actually have worked with a lot of Head Start families who are like in the Navy in Rhode Island.

432
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:34,040
And as I shot it, I'm like, where are you in Head Start?

433
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:37,580
Like, it's a poverty program and you're like working and you're in the Navy.

434
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:41,180
But like, those things coexisted commonly.

435
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:46,160
And so there's value of military families.

436
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,450
And I think that that's why it's interesting that they're highlighted in this video.

437
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:55,250
But then there's also system, the systemic undervaluing of the actual people.

438
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:00,820
There's like the value and then there's the actual people and those don't always connects.

439
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:06,889
I think that's those I like a little bit of musing, but but yeah,

440
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:15,290
that idea of kind of a top down decision and having it roll out was very much specific to that context, I think.

441
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:17,840
Yeah, I think that, you know, a little bit like what they're,

442
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:24,380
what the military has like across the ages, like their KP, their education is more like higher up.

443
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:29,839
And I only know this because I know they feel like they're kids like they have.

444
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,890
Yeah, there's benefits.

445
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:41,420
So it's interesting to see like if it's known that this happens when the types and what can happen the same way it to everybody else.

446
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:48,350
Yeah. Why do we think? I mean, there's, like, 10 million reasons.

447
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:53,990
I do like their value. I think you're going to give them what they want so that they can do what you want.

448
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:58,530
Mm hmm. Right. What?

449
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:00,500
My. Yeah, it's the same with, like, our parent.

450
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:08,370
We have a system like a socialized government run health care system for veterans, you know, but we don't have that right.

451
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:16,470
Okay. Other thoughts?

452
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:27,340
Observation. Why.

453
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:38,410
Sort of a that but a little bit on line. What might be a reason that like for example in Scandinavia people are maybe more receptive to.

454
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:45,760
Providing care for families on their federal level and national level.

455
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:53,090
Yeah. I'm in a policy class right now and we talk about this a lot.

456
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:58,520
But just in general, trust in the government is a lot higher,

457
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:05,420
and reliance on the government to like protect everyone's best interests is much better there.

458
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:14,930
And so this would probably seem a lot less scary to people who are maybe on the fence than it would in the US.

459
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:24,000
And yeah. Mika, what's the income gap? Oh, that's a good question.

460
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:31,349
You know, it's they have less income disparity on average than than we do here.

461
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:34,380
And there's a lot more spending on social welfare programs.

462
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:41,370
Although people have been following the news in Sweden, they're like, that is sort of a hard right turn right now, which is interesting.

463
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,900
And I want to stick with also that idea of like, who's the everybody?

464
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:49,200
Right. Who trust the system. Yeah.

465
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:58,950
I think that it's hard to compare like us to a place like Denmark because like they have racially are very homogenous and also just don't have like.

466
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:07,200
The history of structural racism that we do in this country and helping people at the

467
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:14,000
margins like there's an another plus telling a story about who needs government assistance,

468
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:18,810
loans like racialize like nothing. I think that makes.

469
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:29,399
That makes a huge difference. And I think it is not the only thing like by any means, but that is a big difference and I think that's another place.

470
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,809
Like I just want to push this a little bit.

471
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:37,650
Like that's like maybe another place where we kind of overpromise because we're really different society or like,

472
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:44,190
you know, lots of layered societies right among ourselves than than Scandinavian countries.

473
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:51,959
And I think also like just in recent years, as you know, there's not a ton of diversity there.

474
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:59,730
Like I'm speaking super broadly, but like and like I know that like Norway and Sweden have had like a thousand years of,

475
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,940
you know, history together, but like, you know, conflict and everything.

476
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:16,140
But the racial diversity is pretty low. And so as people get in those countries, even now, like more migrants coming in, the countries,

477
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:23,669
you're seeing sort of similar dynamics and similar kind of terms to the political right in terms of like giving,

478
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:28,560
you know, making funds available for sort of social care type programs.

479
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:35,100
And again, like you summed it up nicely with that kind of story and history that we have in this country.

480
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:42,150
But that's certainly important to keep in mind. And even when they talked about those programs in the forties, you know,

481
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:53,639
not all people like were invited to come back and like work in there, like GI Bill fifties era housing that was very racially driven.

482
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,710
So that's important to to keep in mind too.

483
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:02,190
Yeah, I would also say like collective responsibility is like a big theme here as much as like other countries and stuff like that.

484
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:11,790
And I remember in the movie they were talking about like how like the build up that could have got past when like hurt the family and it really hurt,

485
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:13,770
you know, at least traditional family.

486
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:18,090
But I think it would actually strength and having child care if you strengthen the families because you don't have them,

487
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:20,190
you couldn't care for other children.

488
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:27,210
You can go and get mothers particularly cause they're the ones who the majority of the burden is placed on in our society.

489
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:30,569
They can get jobs, they can, you know, provide for their children.

490
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:34,770
They can get other, you know, away time from their children so that when they are together,

491
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,979
they can be more strengthened and like actually enjoy that time together.

492
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,020
So you really strengthen the family.

493
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:45,930
And I feel like that often doesn't get brought up because we're always just like, Oh, they need to be together 24 seven.

494
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:50,879
It's like, no, you don't. Right, right, right, right. I think that's a really excellent point.

495
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:51,660
And that's, you know,

496
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:57,930
it's kind of it's a different angle on the like what can it do for families in terms of like job training and families who are really struggling,

497
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:06,509
families who need assistance? It's like how can it enrich, you know, not only child life with like core materials and learning,

498
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:09,360
you know, manipulative skills and social emotional or anything like that,

499
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:15,689
but family life in terms of being able to then go back and like invest in all these sort of strengthening families,

500
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:17,129
things that we've talked about previously.

501
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:23,580
And like I have, you know, maybe I don't because my job is stressful, but like maybe I have time to like at least think about,

502
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:29,070
you know, planning family life in a way that I don't if I'm like in the trenches with it all the time.

503
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:30,959
But to military man, of course, right now.

504
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:37,740
So yeah, you get like think of the women who are on the other side though they were probably stay at home moms.

505
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:44,170
I. Like how they don't see that benefit, if that makes sense.

506
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,590
So they're like stay at home moms and they're like, Mom, my husband.

507
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,799
Hmm. Yeah.

508
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:57,550
And so we were talking it's another interesting that just makes me think of the point we're talking about over here, which was around choice.

509
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:03,970
Right. And I think that one of the things one of these fears that if we talk about, you know,

510
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:10,960
and health care more broadly, but any kind of, you know, universal child care, then we take choice away.

511
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:15,790
And, you know, we love choice and but not to take your child.

512
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:21,490
And that's what I didn't understand was like, if you don't want to participate, go back to your partner.

513
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:30,190
Yeah, yeah. You don't have to wait for your family to participate.

514
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:34,240
Just you can do your own thing. Mm hmm.

515
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:38,650
Yeah, I think it's a really important observation.

516
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:42,069
Yeah, I think even pushing that family mindset of, like, oh, it messes up.

517
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:48,730
The family is taking away the choice of, like. But there are people who want to go where they can.

518
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:56,290
So I think the way that it is out on the planet and I think also being able to take let them go to school

519
00:58:56,530 --> 00:59:02,070
allows them to build like their own individual personality instead of being like under their hands.

520
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:06,310
They can know what they going through. Right.

521
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:12,730
And thinking about like again on that, like I'm referring to that like, you know, I think with the to pass the parent path and kind of the child path.

522
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,770
Like there's so many amazing things that come from early childhood education and talked

523
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:21,639
about a little bit in the mini lecture and I think we talk a lot about more now,

524
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:29,830
but like if we think sort of intergenerationally about building like tolerance and exposure to people who are not exactly like you,

525
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:37,719
that is really important to do in early childhood because of that back to like conceptual development and you know,

526
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:41,799
babies, you know, distinguish between people of different races.

527
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,920
They distinguish like lots of different baby distinctions,

528
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:58,420
greater exposure to diversity in all forms early in life just sort of lends itself to more acceptance of diversity across the span.

529
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:03,250
And so if you think about like these big, intractable social problems that we talk about a lot,

530
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:13,000
that's a very kind of concrete way to think about intergenerationally addressing them over time.

531
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:19,090
Yeah. So, Jackie, I think you had a comment probably digressed away from very well.

532
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:25,270
I think it was kind of the second one about like attitudes and like relevancy and immediately remind me of

533
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:33,219
like last semester and policy like how as a whole like class we had to determine like it was like universal,

534
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:40,210
like insurance and like everyone has different groups and you have to like pick how many points was allocated for children was like,

535
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:44,170
like for you it was like low on the totem pole.

536
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:52,060
But yeah, it was it was also true of like people I know like in higher tax brackets, like depending on like the funding though.

537
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:59,320
Like it's like, why would I want to pay more taxes out of my income when it's not relevant to me that can and I don't plan on having kids.

538
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:09,250
So it was reminding me of all these situations about, yeah, attitudes and relevancy and yeah, that plays a big role.

539
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:18,400
Yeah, totally, totally. And I think that this relevance in general like, you know, what is the collective response about like,

540
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,910
well, you chose to have that kid, maybe you did, maybe not.

541
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:25,810
And why am I responsible for that?

542
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:34,180
And I think, you know, I was just saying about like, you know, if if we're if we think intergenerationally, if we think about like, well,

543
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:44,440
we want to invest in these kids because when we all get old, which is, I know, closer for me than you guys like those kids are like the workforce.

544
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:49,740
They're they're like nursing, you know, the staff or whatever it is, you know what I mean?

545
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:53,979
Like it's really a societal issue.

546
01:01:53,980 --> 01:02:00,700
And we will talk more about, um, you know, this sort of more broadly, but, you know,

547
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:06,579
education and achievement stuff in, in sort of middle childhood when we talk about middle childhood.

548
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:10,719
But I mean like math and reading scores are like plummeting.

549
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,840
They were not very high to begin with, but they are really going down.

550
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:18,339
And so thinking about like, what do we do like as a society?

551
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:20,740
Like we really need to think about this stuff.

552
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:31,330
That is a societal question because even if we don't feel like we have collective responsibility, like future generations will be responsible for us.

553
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:36,760
And so that's, that's a like way to put it, really big picture.

554
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:43,180
And it relates to that Marian Wright Edelman quote about like kids don't have a voice and they don't vote.

555
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:46,680
And so what what can we help we make the point that it's important to vote for that.

556
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,720
I'm sorry. I mean, how do our scores compare to the rest of the world?

557
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:56,740
I was just curious in terms of in terms of math and reading, not so good.

558
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:09,820
And again, but like sticking with like sort of so Finland is like this example of sort of very high reading and math scores to just keep it simple.

559
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:16,720
But one thing to note is that they actually don't like bring literacy to preschool kids

560
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:21,280
read a little bit later and they spend more time in the sort of early childhood space.

561
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:25,839
And there's a lot of a lot I could talk about around that.

562
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:34,659
But it's also true that Scandinavian countries have tend to have pretty high reading and math and achievement scores in general.

563
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:42,250
And there is a lot of support and money for early education there and early grade education.

564
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:45,260
So now like up to, you know, three. Great.

565
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:53,999
And up so yeah we can we can get into achievements stuff and future sessions too but interesting

566
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:02,370
because it is so valued internationally but then our kids and like oh so how is that work.

567
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:11,490
You mean within? Yeah. Like when you other people come to the United States of America to grieve and then go back home.

568
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:17,130
But it's like, if our scores are so low, why are you doing that? It is a good question.

569
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:21,720
Yeah. Also because college is free elsewhere.

570
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:26,129
You know, it's not free here, as we all probably really are aware of.

571
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:36,180
But but like literally and you know, some European countries, college is free and or very inexpensive.

572
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:40,800
It's like this sort of value on education.

573
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:48,990
Um, I find it interesting to think about people coming here to get education and then people here not being able to get education,

574
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:53,390
maybe not seeking higher education.

575
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:59,040
So it's it's a conundrum. Absolutely.

576
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:07,770
Yeah. I'm just looking at. Let me let me switch gears a tiny bit.

577
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:11,700
Does anybody have more comments on the movie?

578
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:14,880
We'll talk about some more next week about childcare. Next time about childcare.

579
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:22,170
But I wanted to just switch gears a little and just sort of illustrate these like a classroom things kind of back to what I was talking about earlier,

580
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:33,299
Head Start Impact. Just some examples of what things look like again in these early childhood settings and how we might this strategy about like,

581
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:36,860
can we have value added, can we like add to that sort of child path?

582
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:40,260
Like what else can we do in early childhood settings that can be beneficial?

583
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:47,520
And it's really true also that early childhood settings are a common site for intervention efforts.

584
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:52,830
But as with everything, we kind of have to think through, like, what do we do?

585
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:59,550
How do we intervene in these kinds of settings? So I just wanted to click through a few examples to kind of illustrate those.

586
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:06,719
So like in the mini lecture I was talking about like all these different areas of preschool classrooms, really super fun.

587
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:15,930
If anybody has an opportunity to go and hang out in the early childhood classroom setting now that you're adults, it's just really fascinating.

588
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:21,059
And you really see illustrated like, I don't know if you remember that little conversation we had about like preschool

589
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:26,580
language and talking about like Rainbow Brite and Horsey and like that is so on display.

590
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:35,510
And you see the importance of kind of arranging space and materials to just sort of promote those pieces of development.

591
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:42,060
It's very thoughtfully done if you see, you know, like really nice set up preschool classrooms.

592
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:51,329
And so this is just sort of an illustration of like there's environment, how learning happens, what's the family's role, what's the teacher's role?

593
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:58,340
And sort of one of the content that they're doing. So these are things like and I was talking about like sand and water tables.

594
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:02,190
If you guys think about what a preschool classroom looks like, there's often like a low table.

595
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:07,320
It's got sand in it to play with. It's like very, you know, tactile, sensory.

596
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:13,560
There's a water table. And again, no family is going to have a sand and water table in their house.

597
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:16,980
It's just it's limited time of use.

598
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:21,300
It's a mess. It's expensive, it's heavy. Can you imagine having a sand water table in your house?

599
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:22,740
So nobody really has that.

600
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:31,170
But that's like a central kind of area in the preschool setting where kids go and they like pour and do things and manipulate it.

601
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:39,330
And it's just an example of a way that like a preschool classroom setting is totally different from a house, even a lovely house.

602
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:48,150
So this is just an example of like a sleep intervention that we talked about and also just to like again, promote the importance of sleep.

603
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:56,280
So this was really just to work with parents, teachers, kids directly around,

604
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:00,929
you know, the importance of sleep, why we would want to promote sleep habits.

605
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:09,419
And one of the reasons is that sleep habits and routines around sleep are really important in those first years.

606
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:18,360
And we also know that getting good sleep, adequate sleep and sleeping on a regular schedule is important for weight management eating.

607
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,040
It's also associated with achievement and emotional and mental health outcomes.

608
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:29,910
Headstart All the different things that Headstart focuses on. It does not usually focus focus explicitly on sleep.

609
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:36,479
But if you talk to teachers, they're like, Oh yeah, we want these kids to sleep more and to get sleep.

610
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:41,370
And I can tell Johnny's tired. It's like a very basic, obvious teacher noticing thing.

611
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:45,600
And so when we said, Hey, what could we work with you guys around sleep, they were like, Yeah, that sounds great.

612
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:54,990
And so we did this intervention with Head Start Agency to look at sleep and to promote sleep and sort of this is just again,

613
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:59,520
like this very practically, like this is what the intervention looked like. It was very straightforward and simple.

614
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:04,950
We had like a parent info session talking about sleep and implications and some strategies

615
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:09,779
around bedtime and like made a little sticker chart for home that people are saying,

616
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:12,700
okay, like I'm going to do my bedtime routine this many days a week.

617
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:18,300
We did some teacher training and just sort of did a little lesson plans around sleep.

618
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:24,120
And then we got I appreciate the materials comment because then we had sort of materials that we gave to the classrooms.

619
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:29,909
They had a little bear, they put them to bed and you can see it was just like a little kind of cheap teddy bear.

620
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:31,290
We made like a little tiny blanket.

621
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:37,499
And this is like a little it's like quite a copy paper box, you know, it was like very basic, but it was special, you know.

622
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,889
And so they focused on the bear. They put them to bed, they put them to bed.

623
01:09:40,890 --> 01:09:48,450
At the time, you know, it was like also integrating, like learn how to tell time, which they think is going to be a lost art is like giant success.

624
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:55,019
But they you knew the hands on the clock and when they pointed to 8 p.m., that was bedtime.

625
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,700
And then we had these sort of activities that we.

626
01:09:57,590 --> 01:10:02,749
You know, went went through and, you know, had a little acronym that the kids were talking about in class.

627
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:07,610
We had a poster up in the class. It was again like all these sort of things that you can do in a preschool setting.

628
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:15,690
And then you get that peer motivation and all the kids, you know, point to the poster and say, Look, oh, we did this tonight in my house.

629
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:21,349
So these were all the sort of elements of the intervention.

630
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:25,100
Again, pretty, pretty straightforward. And I think.

631
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:32,810
Did I include I might not include that. So basically what we did is we evaluated parents, recorded the child's time in bed.

632
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:38,450
We had to mark the times they went to bed across a week. We actually did see some impact on sleep, which was exciting.

633
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:44,420
And then this intervention was sort of taken and someone else took it and ran with it, which was great.

634
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:48,790
I was like, Go! And she's actually found good effects looking at like that.

635
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:56,209
You measure sleep little after graph, like a Fitbit. And so she's found that this approach to intervention which again very basic but I

636
01:10:56,210 --> 01:11:02,060
think it builds on the power of the preschool context had impact on child's sleep.

637
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:08,360
Another example we've talked about the incredible years before I was talking about as parenting.

638
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:15,560
So this is a very different kind of intervention, but also building on this preschool classroom kind of context.

639
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:23,060
So I mentioned that there is like the parent arm, the teacher training arm and the child behavior arm of incredible yours.

640
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:32,060
These are these like life sized child life sized, not like adult sized, but like child sized puppets that come to the classroom.

641
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:36,860
And the basic premise is that I know they're a little they're really goofy.

642
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:41,900
There's they're named Wally and Marley. Like people have like renamed them and all this stuff.

643
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:50,180
But basically they come to the classroom and they like report during circle time about like something that happened on the playground or,

644
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:54,560
you know, I was, you know, fighting with my brother or something like that.

645
01:11:54,560 --> 01:12:02,000
And they have to report on like this problem that they had and then the kids based on the many, many, many lessons.

646
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,910
So this is a much heavier lift than the short sleep intervention.

647
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:11,360
The kids, based on these many lessons about like, oh, well, did you tell him how you felt or did you use your words or, you know,

648
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:18,050
these strategies that are sort of basic preschool behavior strategies for like not hitting your neighbor and understanding what they feel.

649
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:22,970
They sort of go through all these different like draw plays with the puppets.

650
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:30,979
You can see that this is, again, like requires much more teacher training, much more investment.

651
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:34,790
I've mentioned incredible years. It's expensive. These puppets alone are like $300.

652
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:39,380
So there's a big amount of investment in this program.

653
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:45,170
But if you infuse it across like your preschool year in your entire, you know,

654
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:51,110
preschool kind of curriculum is like integrating this program, then it shows positive impact.

655
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:58,580
And I will say, just thinking about back to that discussion of like the Head Start impact study and differences in program,

656
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:02,989
some teachers loved this, you know, like puppet.

657
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:06,440
Incredible. Your study, some teachers really didn't love it at all.

658
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:11,030
And so that's the teacher factor that's really important in thinking about like what kind of an

659
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:15,710
intervention are we going to ask these teachers who are already doing a lot to additionally do?

660
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:22,130
And so like the teacher who loved the puppets like went to Target that close for her puppets,

661
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:25,399
took her puppets to church with her, took the puppets on field trips.

662
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,500
Like we got photos of the puppets riding the bus.

663
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:33,950
There was like a lot around the puppets and the other teachers because you have to like, you know, act out the puppet voice.

664
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:37,940
And so other teachers were like, Yeah, no, I can't do this. Puppets.

665
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:42,130
There is also like a DVD with videos.

666
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:48,560
You show a little scenario what happens next, blah, the role playing, having a DVD player again.

667
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,560
Now it's, you know, sort of irrelevant.

668
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:55,250
But at the time it was like some classes have on the order of some classes. So it was a big pain.

669
01:13:55,250 --> 01:14:01,130
And so it was like that lack of implementation of the intervention varied by like classroom setups and everything.

670
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,290
So that's another example.

671
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:11,780
And then the third example is actually nutrition from the nutrition people, but this was sort of like an in-between level of effort.

672
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:17,780
So what we did here is that we, you know, had activity books,

673
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:22,669
like we had books that sort of focused on each like of the kind of eating lessons or that

674
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:28,880
the teacher could like make a link to the eating nutrition intervention part for that day.

675
01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:32,420
And there were not 50, but there were eight lessons.

676
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:39,680
So more than the sleep intervention, which was pretty short, but way less than the incredible years and again more focused than the incredible years,

677
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:44,420
which is like all social emotional behavior but broader than sleep.

678
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:51,470
So again, like, what's your intervention target? What's your outcome? So these were just sort of examples of lessons.

679
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:56,390
And we had a recipe. We had a little book with this gift. So again, back to materials.

680
01:14:56,790 --> 01:15:02,460
And if you're doing interventions with teachers, it's so important to think about your materials and make them good.

681
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:10,260
And these were just sort of, you know, the range of of kind of topics we covered.

682
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:18,029
And then there's an example of the lesson plan. So like we did end up providing lesson plans.

683
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:22,439
Like we did some, you know, structured a lot of structuring of kind of the lesson.

684
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:26,850
So it was like, here, teacher, here are the things that you're going to need.

685
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:32,520
And, you know, we talked with teachers about how you do lesson planning and what's helpful, you know,

686
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:36,749
as opposed to sort of say, which happens in some interventions like here's an awesome intervention.

687
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:40,649
Like, you know, hopefully you could do it, which would be horrible.

688
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:52,200
Don't do that. And so I was going to talk about perhaps the cautionary tale there is that, for example, it's again, an implementation kind of point,

689
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:56,609
like we were meeting with the nutritionist and the Head Start program and this I

690
01:15:56,610 --> 01:16:01,320
think it was this session about like making a milkshake and we use low fat dairy.

691
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:08,040
And that was the whole thing is that you can like use, you know, skim milk, you can use other milks and do this and it still tastes good.

692
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:14,910
And then one of the nutritionist said, well, I think the kids like it better when I put vanilla yogurt because it just tastes better.

693
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:21,989
And we're like, but that's the whole point, is to like, consume less like sugar and calories and vanilla yogurt.

694
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:25,220
We're like, yeah, totally taste better. Like ice cream. It's awesome.

695
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:30,360
But like so kind of understanding and making sure that the people who are doing the

696
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:34,680
intervention are really understanding the fundamental underlying pieces of what it was.

697
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:40,679
Other examples that came up with this, as you can imagine, back to like the classroom context.

698
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:45,569
Like some people had access to a kitchen like in elementary schools, some people did not and they had a hot plate.

699
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:51,360
And I was like a electric water heater thing, you know? And so some of these things could happen in the classroom.

700
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:56,920
It's like the food demonstration and kids prepare the food and then they eat it and try new things and some couldn't.

701
01:16:56,940 --> 01:17:01,620
So again, like I just present those examples quickly to just sort of say like,

702
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:07,049
here's some range of what you can do in the preschool classroom setting and things to think about.

703
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:13,380
But I think that a way to consider adding value to the idea of early childhood education is like,

704
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:18,090
what else can we kind of like wedged in there in terms of health outcomes?

705
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:24,090
We don't have to get into those because we're just about out of time.

706
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:38,040
But those are things to consider. And I think next time I'll look through, do some policy review, not policy, but history, history of policy.

707
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:46,800
And then I think next time we'll talk about more access, teacher pay,

708
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:58,079
a little bit of history and kind of where we stand now to sort of keep those like policy resources going, you know, and your papers to do so.

709
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:11,260
Let me know if any questions I think are. And then she realized that, oh, I should say devotions.

710
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:15,639
Oh, sure. If I was to say some, like lecture materials.

711
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:19,350
What? I like the lecture or. I know sometimes you put some slides.

712
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:26,530
I mean, years though. Yeah. I would say to take from a specific source or like a reading, you could track that down.

713
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:30,820
That would probably be the best. But if it's just from something you can say, it's like the lecture.

714
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:33,930
Okay. That sounds good. Okay. Thank you.

715
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:50,550
That has nothing to do with the fact that you're not telling.

716
01:18:54,900 --> 01:19:08,680
I'm very concerned about. So they started to go more.

717
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:34,500
I was like, Right. Yeah. I think I should be honest when I would have been like, You have to be great if I got out of the middle.

718
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:44,130
Okay. I think I collected everything.
