1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,280
We're talking about the I know I have lots of questions about the elite.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:11,250
Good questions. So I'm excited that you guys are into the thick of it and asking questions.

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,660
You just saw. She ran out, but she's going to come back.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:22,650
She's actually going to be our like go to person to get more information about what you should be doing for your Aly.

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,060
And if you don't have a mentor yet, we're going to work on getting you a mentor as well.

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:34,440
And then we're going to have some Q&A a little bit later on, too. So that's today's plan.

7
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:41,280
I'll introduce Brie. Elvira and Karolina will be here too, but they will be on Zoom, so I'll pull them up a little bit later.

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,480
We'll find out who still needs and I'll mentor.

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:56,940
We'll talk about your learning objectives, some best practices, some fake news, and then some Q&A and your upcoming assignment reminders.

10
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,050
So feel free to talk among yourselves until Brie comes back.

11
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:33,669
Pfizer is going to excise 80% of it and you're going to take that 20% that's left and you're going to turn it back into something else.

12
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,560
Right? And you're going to iterate, iterate, iterate. I encourage you to accept feedback.

13
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:44,770
I also encourage you to give constructive feedback, especially for those of you who your mentor has got multiple Illy mentees at the same time.

14
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,340
The way I run my group is that we have our folks give feedback to each other.

15
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:56,130
Be curious, ask questions. Don't assume that everybody that you're the only one who doesn't know what's going on with X, Y, or Z.

16
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,660
Just ask questions and to seek collaborations for, you know, the kind of help you make your project even better.

17
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:09,610
Again, you're going to get the slide deck. So all of these are hyperlinked out, the first to relate to resources on writing.

18
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,300
So there's, of course, the speech writing lab that I highly encourage you to use.

19
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,920
There's also Coursera courses on scientific writing and editing that I would encourage you to check out.

20
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,389
How many of you are familiar with Seastar? Okay.

21
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,680
So for these, the whole point of CCAR is to help you with your biotech.

22
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:33,010
That's their whole purpose is to help you so you can bring your broken SAS code to them and they will help you.

23
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,820
Okay, so go do that. How many of you have heard of ICP?

24
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,130
Sorry. The entire university consortium on social mean.

25
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,900
It's hard to change your life. Okay, so this is an archive that's run here at the University of Michigan.

26
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:51,030
It's Google for data. If you go to ICP artists, Google, ICP, Art, go to that website and type depression.

27
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,279
It will give you like thousands of data sets that have the contract of depression.

28
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,790
So you're like, I don't have any data for my thing. Yes, you do. It's right there. And it's free.

29
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:06,190
All of it's free. All of it's probably available. Okay. There's also some resources about paper sprints that are run here at Michigan.

30
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:12,669
We are all as members of the University of Michigan, participants in the National Center for Faculty Development Diversity,

31
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,320
which has some fantastic resources that are targeted a little bit more for like people writing their dissertation.

32
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,490
But you can think about this is like a baby dissertation in some ways it's certainly going to feel like a baby.

33
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,240
So, you know, like the idea that there's advice there.

34
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:34,720
This UCLA data, this UCLA link links out to annotated data, that is NSA data analysis, examples of exploratory analysis,

35
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:41,900
linear regression, logistic regression, generalized estimating equations, growth curve models, etc. in SAS.

36
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,129
So data are all of it annotated right there for you?

37
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:52,420
I don't know how to make my code work right there. There it is. Go. Okay. There's also this fantastic course on improving your statistical inference.

38
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,650
Like what is a p value? Nope, not that. Try again. Okay.

39
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,060
So it's like the point of like the fact is, like,

40
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:02,710
we have these ideas of like our initial guests of like things that are not necessarily, you know, they're in there.

41
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,920
They're in there. I know you know what a p value is, but I can tell you,

42
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,420
it took me a long time to actually be able to articulate to another human being what a P value is accurately.

43
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,709
And then I just want to encourage you that Dr. Ella August through the epics, this is actually not just Epitaph.

44
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,850
So for for many students you're also going to be added to this site if you aren't already.

45
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,440
There are some optional assignments through that canvas site that help you on your writing.

46
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:33,330
Okay. So what you should do right now, you should review the Ali handbook.

47
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:39,930
You should check out the Ali canvas site. And if you are not on that canvas, I need to know that so we can make that fixed.

48
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:46,170
If you are a guy or a student, you need to register for epic sexual for again.

49
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,460
You must have a faculty advisor in order to do that registration.

50
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:55,460
So one of the things I want to know from folks today is how many of you don't necessarily don't have a faculty advisor yet,

51
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,330
so I can help close that loop. Okay. Don't worry if you don't have one yet.

52
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,320
Do not worry. That's why I'm here, to help solve that problem.

53
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:11,130
And just as a reminder, you need to register for four total credits over the whole academic year.

54
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,020
My recommendation is two and two, but you can also do one in three.

55
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:21,989
I don't recommend, but it is possible if your schedule is just impossible of three and one or zero and four students,

56
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,720
make sure you register for one credit. F it's five, six, five.

57
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:30,690
And set up a meeting with Elvira if you have any questions about how to register for this course.

58
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:37,460
This epic at 604569. Okay.

59
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,660
Questions about this before I show you just a couple of examples, would you excited about what you're going to do?

60
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,010
Yeah. I cannot hear you.

61
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,580
But if you yell at me, I can do anything. Yes, ma'am.

62
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:18,110
So great question. So it is two credits of 604 and you we in the past students split those credits between their research advisor and Ella.

63
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,660
That is no longer happening. You take all your credits with your research advisor.

64
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,960
There are no credits taken with Ella August anymore. So she manages the canvas site, but you take no credits with her.

65
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,290
That is a change from last year. That is a change. Thank you.

66
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:41,460
That. And I will make sure that that gets articulated clearly. Yes. Could you just yell at me?

67
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:52,750
Sorry. Yeah, I hear some great stories, and I'm wondering, is it always is it always going to be for credits?

68
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:59,320
Or, for example, if you have a project that takes longer for someone like me because I do have more time can end up being more than four credits.

69
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,300
You won't get any more credit for taking more personally. So I would.

70
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,740
But it might take me more times to do different things. Okay.

71
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,549
I don't think so. But I can think about it a little bit more.

72
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,600
Is there is there a poor quality of HP?

73
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,820
And so they must have a course kind of like this, like an independent study.

74
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,260
Yeah, they have a capstone, but it's like a one semester kind of deal.

75
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,980
So it so we we can talk about that.

76
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:34,930
But the short answer is no, you don't need to do more credits of it.

77
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:45,980
But the kind of. Actually central answer, I guess, is like given everything that's happened in parts of Asia and the poor parts of central Florida,

78
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,850
your expectations are no different that you take.

79
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:58,420
Okay. The topic should be one that sort of reflects your interest in policy.

80
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:07,330
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I already have a project and it's literally just happened, but right now it has several goals.

81
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,410
First off, where are these slides? They're not on campus. You just didn't pay for them.

82
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:26,620
Okay. Wasn't paying attention. Sorry. Also, it says, each of my students make sure you are registered for one credit.

83
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:31,330
I'm assuming it's this fall, right? So each time you take one credit.

84
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:38,690
Okay. Because like in in one of the previous, I just said register for two credits in the winter, you know.

85
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:47,950
Oh yeah. And also where would agree I think we've been told in our five, six, five class to not register four, five, six, five in the fall.

86
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,920
So yeah. So I don't know if that's, you know.

87
00:19:54,070 --> 00:20:00,880
Okay. So Myra will be here. We're being told one thing and then we're being told the exact opposite.

88
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:05,920
Just kind of confusion. Cognitive dissonance.

89
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,900
You can register for a five, six, five, however.

90
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,650
Emily and Alex have told you to register for that.

91
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:23,080
Okay. Plan is that you need to take four credits total of this course over your time in the program.

92
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:31,959
Mm hmm. So it is true that historically, because this class only recently became four credits instead of five credits.

93
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:38,140
So each of these students used to take five credits of this one, one one, two across the four terms.

94
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:44,350
And then this year you are doing one one, apparently zero two instead of 1111.

95
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,040
Okay. So. Now we have one more bucket.

96
00:20:54,050 --> 00:21:03,850
Okay, got it. I was just wondering if we could take four credits in the fall and then, like, none in the winter.

97
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,640
I highly recommend against that. Okay. Unless there was some reason, cause there is no way.

98
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,950
Unless you're graduating this term. No, no, I just.

99
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,440
I started it over the summer, so I was like, I might be able to. I was just wondering.

100
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,950
Okay. As long as you're still going to be registered for courses in the winter,

101
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,970
I would recommend a31 if that's if you feel like you're going to do a lot of the work for sure.

102
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:30,970
Okay. I would not recommend a40. Okay. Any other questions?

103
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,560
Yes, go ahead. Can you just talk really loud?

104
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:45,970
You don't have to sign at this point to sign. Yeah.

105
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:57,570
So appendicitis. So he was registered for this course or that's a separate process for this exciting internal couple.

106
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:03,930
So it's against if you're an HBCU, you should be listening to Emily and Alice.

107
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,130
Those are those are the people that need to be looking for about registration.

108
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:14,500
But other than looking over Nash, if you you should also be all be honest.

109
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:21,290
I mean, besides that, tell an honest man so that I can show you in a second what that looks like,

110
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:26,950
what you're trying to attract at the beginning of the page.

111
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:35,330
And if you're not the only people who are on that class or should be on the campus who have completed their registration four, five, six,

112
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:43,930
five or 604 Now that I'm hearing that I'm incentivized to not redshirt in the fall, I will correct that to make sure you are also added to that.

113
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,590
Even if you're not, but you're five, six, five, which I will fix that.

114
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,390
That's right. It just wasn't clear.

115
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:01,940
Yes. Auto were not auto registered in 30 seconds.

116
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,840
They're on the same side. There's no threat.

117
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:16,450
So there's no debate. There's no threat to either.

118
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,590
She knows how to answer the question. Is it correct?

119
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:26,210
So you work out your schedule this entire week with your music.

120
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:33,880
There's no telling that's an option for. There is nothing on the island.

121
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,659
With the exception of your final. I will drop everything.

122
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,560
That's all there is. The scaffolding that helped to make this happen.

123
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:49,650
But there is no there are no signs other than we monitor market research, rely upon that assessment.

124
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,820
So you say I won't be here on October ten. That's one figure one.

125
00:23:54,630 --> 00:24:00,020
Okay, so there's that. But that has to be part of an example.

126
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,630
The same. Questions.

127
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,360
Okay. Yep.

128
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:24,770
All right. So the last thing I want to say, just as a actually before I do this, how many of you do not have an IRA in mind?

129
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:37,450
Oh, I see. 700. Okay.

130
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:43,580
I'm going to ask now. Okay. So, listen, I'm going to leave this sheet of paper here for you.

131
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,560
Right here. You need one here for me. Okay.

132
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,010
And so I can make sure to fix this part next week or something. I'm going to.

133
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,110
What I'm working on is getting all of the faculty.

134
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,440
We're still accepting students. Okay.

135
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:04,930
The other thing I want to encourage you is that if you have a project that is not within the interest of, you know, what you're interested in.

136
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:13,430
I just. And there's nobody in the forefront of preeclampsia.

137
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:23,389
You can go to go and find somebody there who's got that research interest and has the to supervise that project and then come back to effort and say,

138
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:27,200
I need somebody who's going to, like, be my person that I can register prescription for,

139
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,300
but they're not really going to be involved in the project because you need somebody in order to run for.

140
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:38,320
So just because there's not somebody here who's got like this exact area that you're interested in doesn't mean you can't do that.

141
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,899
You can always have somebody that you're working with, obviously, outside of the box.

142
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,670
So you do have to have an EP and faculty member to register for these courses.

143
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:54,709
Okay. All right. Last thing I want to say. I just want to give you some examples of projects.

144
00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:01,190
And again, you will get all these slides. So these are all students who did their MPH with me either here or at my prior institution.

145
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:08,179
And just examples. This is one using the Health and Retirement Study, which is a longitudinal study of older adults conducted here at the University

146
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:12,680
of Michigan that was looking at different measurement scales of depression.

147
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,819
This is one that was using the national final death reporting system.

148
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,799
This is kind of a data science approach.

149
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:24,590
We were interested in trying to understand how driving cessation or when older adults stop driving, how that relates to suicide risk.

150
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:32,720
This is one using the collaborative psychiatric epidemiologic services is another large set of surveys of mental health in the population,

151
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,209
which is obviously an area that we get is collected here at the University of Michigan.

152
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:44,300
These data are all publicly available. That was looking at unintended pregnancy and internalizing disorders.

153
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:53,570
This is one using NHANES, which I'm sure many of you are familiar with. This is this large kind of survey of health behaviors and health conditions.

154
00:26:53,780 --> 00:27:02,780
And we were interested in how it relates to depression and food insecurity is another one using the collaborative psychiatric epidemiologic surveys.

155
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:10,820
Again, using that, just again, it is and is examples of the wide range of kind of projects that people can do and topics that people can do.

156
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:22,370
Okay. So I'm pretty much out of time, but I want to put up again my email address so you know how to get a hold of me.

157
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:26,850
I get any questions about registration. Those have to go to Elvira.

158
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,819
I cannot help you with those.

159
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:35,390
But questions about the process or about helping you find an adviser or things like that, you can absolutely come and send those questions to me.

160
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:40,110
Okay. So I'm going to leave this here and I'm going to get this from nominees later. But I need you.

161
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,140
If you do not have an adviser, you are not registered with somebody.

162
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:48,050
I need your name here so I can help fix this problem. Okay.

163
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:59,650
Anything else? Questions? Thank you.

164
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,830
All right. Thank you. So the nine of you did raise your hand.

165
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:08,020
You guys can come put your name on this paper while we're waiting, then to switch back and forth.

166
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:22,020
I'll get those soon. Thank you. Or you can do it now.

167
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:33,049
Yeah. So I just have just a few more things to go through with you guys, and then I'll pull up Elvira and Carolina.

168
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:40,310
They'll be on the screen, and you guys can just fire some questions at them about registration and all that stuff.

169
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,680
Just write your name and your for anything.

170
00:28:46,730 --> 00:29:08,820
If you don't have an Illy advisor, just take a couple of seconds to come write your name up here for, like, 530.

171
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:23,850
Yep. You can just write your unique name. Oh, even more creepy.

172
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,540
All right, so I'm just going to run through this stuff so that we can do the question and answer, and that can be the last thing here.

173
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:36,299
So these are just some best practices from and advice from previous students on what

174
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,890
they did or what they found was important when they were working on their island.

175
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:50,940
You have access to these, so I won't go through them all. And then here are some frequently asked questions about the ILI process.

176
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:57,389
All of this stuff can be found in your handbook. You can even use your control.

177
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:02,340
Find to just find specific things if you don't want to go through the handbook and look at everything.

178
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,450
But the handbook is literally your best friend when it comes to the ILI process.

179
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:11,400
So I won't go take all your time to go through these. Like I said, they're in your handbook.

180
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:17,640
Before we do the Q&A, I want to go through what's come, what's to come.

181
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:22,800
So that survey that we sent out last week, we need that in today is really important,

182
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:29,759
especially for those of you who are still trying to find potential potential practice partners to do your apex with.

183
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:36,150
We are partnering with the Ginsburg Center and another entity who is going to bring somebody here.

184
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,820
Their specific job is to help students find apex products or practice partners.

185
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,189
And if we don't know how many students need help,

186
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:49,740
we won't really have the right data to give that person to tell them, you know, who still needs help.

187
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:53,490
So please make sure you do that survey and get it in today if you haven't done it.

188
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:59,340
And then your individual development plan assignment is also due next week.

189
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,150
There's an example there. All of this is still on the canvas page.

190
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:12,330
And I just said all of this, remember to reach out to your peer group members who weren't here last week or here today,

191
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,100
just so that we can make sure they're on track and doing what they need to be doing.

192
00:31:17,730 --> 00:32:04,520
And I'm going to pull up Carolina native. I was just going to say. So.

193
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:19,550
Read. Then.

194
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,940
Okay. They can hear you. Just so you know.

195
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,350
So we have two mikes here. Shot. Who has the other one?

196
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,370
No. So for the.

197
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:47,110
Everybody should know who Obama and Caroline are. But in case you don't.

198
00:33:54,850 --> 00:34:02,920
Can you say something so we can make sure we hear you? 1/2.

199
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:24,520
No, no, it's not working. Okay.

200
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:30,670
Try it now. Here we go. I say okay.

201
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:34,360
Happy Monday. I mean Tuesday. It feels like Monday.

202
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:42,129
Monday. All right. So Karolina and Elvira are here to answer any questions that Brie didn't have time to answer or couldn't answer.

203
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:46,930
And they have all the registration answers for you. So who has questions?

204
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:59,740
There's a mic behind you. I'm going to walk you out.

205
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:05,260
They can't see you. So say your name so she knows who it is. Hi, this is Katie Wondolowski.

206
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:14,440
I was just wondering. So after our advertiser approves, like the form we submit to register,

207
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:22,090
do we get information then to actually register and actually like how many credits we're doing?

208
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:29,440
Yeah. I will be approving as well.

209
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,290
I'll be entering permissions and issuing them, I should say.

210
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:41,820
I'm sorry. It's very Monday and my head is showing permissions as I see the approvals come in from your advisor.

211
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:47,370
And correct me if I'm wrong, Elvira, I think now we're not really doing a number.

212
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:52,529
Credit action. I think it's just too right or not will be on your end.

213
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:57,720
So all we can do is issue the permission. I'll be your responsibility to put in the number.

214
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,390
Okay. Thank you. The other questions.

215
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:18,600
I did get a teacher from Sweden. I don't know if it was related to the penny.

216
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:27,370
It is related to I don't know if this conversation triggered the student to check me for that.

217
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,690
And I want to put the student out. You don't have to say their name. You can just read the question.

218
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:40,560
So the question was if the student was asking if they have taken all the necessary steps to register for a604.

219
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:47,320
I am going to I'm looking in the house to see if they fill out the form.

220
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:53,290
All right. Then I'm looking at the name.

221
00:36:55,570 --> 00:37:00,070
I guess I have a question for you guys. Is there anybody who's just like, I'm stuck?

222
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:03,160
I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know where to go. I don't know what's next.

223
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,250
Or is everybody okay with what's going on with their elite right now?

224
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:21,330
Because we can't help if we don't know what's going on. Everybody has their projects ready to go.

225
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:25,110
You just need the few people that just need still need advisors, right?

226
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,520
Okay. Do you have any other questions for Elvira and Karolina?

227
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:40,360
Here we go. This is Abbey Hutton.

228
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:46,729
My question is, do you have to work with a faculty member that's within your department, you know?

229
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:52,059
No. So that was what Brie was saying. I know she was talking pretty fast, but basically, like she said,

230
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:56,950
if there's somebody outside of the department that you want to work with, you can work with that person.

231
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:01,299
You just need a faculty advisor in effort to, like, be your go to person.

232
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,190
But you can still work with that person. Okay.

233
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,570
And then that was going to be my other question to you is like, if you're in the process of getting this now,

234
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:10,870
I know that there is like kind of a deadline with class registration for this.

235
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:17,290
Like, if you put someone down, can that change later in the semester like your advisor?

236
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:22,510
So if you just put someone down like your track leader or something like that, and then you find who you're going to work with.

237
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:28,030
Is it possible to change that after the deadline? It's possible.

238
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:35,290
It might be a bit of a headache on the central side of things that I'm thinking.

239
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:47,350
Because another thing we could do, although I don't really recommend, is like switching like save for the fall.

240
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:50,500
You register on the phone. So and then in the winter you register somebody else.

241
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:56,590
Um, I mean, it can be done. It might be a bit of a headache when the final grades come in.

242
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:00,100
They make sure that both people turn in grades. But it's not.

243
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:13,100
I would say if you're struggling to find an early mentor as long I mean, keep us in the loop.

244
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:19,550
We can issue commissions pretty late into the semester.

245
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:26,899
It doesn't give you an additional I mean, most of you have to be all of you should be registered for like, you know, full time.

246
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:34,400
So it's not like your tuition is going to go up, but you have to keep us in the loop so that we know what is going on.

247
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,070
But I think right now you're kind of still figuring out who that your mentor is going to be.

248
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:50,809
Um, I mean, it's best to have that support away and by the end of this month so that we can at least we know where everybody that and who's with who.

249
00:39:50,810 --> 00:40:01,219
And we can reach out to faculty who, you know, don't have as many that seem, you know, current numbers so we can make sure all is squared away.

250
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:09,320
But we do have some time, so don't feel pressured to find the person by tomorrow if that helps.

251
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,940
Still have those conversations. I mean, we can switch add mentors.

252
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,709
It just might be a little bit of a headache on our side.

253
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:22,010
Like, Hey, aren't you like, we can work it out?

254
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:25,040
It just might be a little bit of a process. Okay. Sounds good.

255
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:34,019
Thank you. Any more questions? All right.

256
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:39,240
Well, thank you. Carolina and Elvira, if they think of questions, I'll make sure they reach you or email you.

257
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:44,040
Don't forget to fill out the form on the highlights that I'm sure it's been mentioned already.

258
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:50,189
But that's our way of knowing that we're going to work with.

259
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:55,170
And then don't forget, your mentor has to approve it before we can issue the override.

260
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:58,500
Right. So just a reminder.

261
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:03,600
All right. Thank you. Thank. Right.

262
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:13,500
Okay. So we just have a few more minutes. You guys can leave early, if that's what you want to do.

263
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:20,890
But I do have a few more questions about Apex. Is there anybody who's just like, I don't know what to do with Apex?

264
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:26,350
I'm struggling. I don't know where I'm at. So we've got Apex questions.

265
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:30,340
Great. So I'm going to start here and then go that way.

266
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:41,800
Do you want to make quick. Do you have a specific question or are you just like you don't know what to do with it?

267
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:49,160
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. They figured out that.

268
00:41:52,940 --> 00:42:01,970
So in 530? That's a good question. So the question was, in taking up at 530, you will come out with an Apex product one.

269
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:07,850
So the question was, is that something that keeps you up with or is that something you have to come in with?

270
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:13,280
She gives you all the tools that you need to complete one Apex product in her class.

271
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:18,319
So you'll definitely have one product if you choose to use that to turn it.

272
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,650
And that's up to you. Yes.

273
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:31,830
Does that make sense? I think you were next or whoever the next person with the apex question in this area here.

274
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,970
I guess one question for me is that like I think that I have two products.

275
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,650
I don't know if they count. So who should I talk to about me now?

276
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,010
So we will have one. This is our next class.

277
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:55,290
Don't quote me, but we will have, what do we call it, like a workshop type class where you bring that stuff with you and we'll troubleshoot.

278
00:42:55,290 --> 00:43:00,720
We'll look at it together, you will look at it with your opinions or groups, and you'll kind of say, Does this count as an apex?

279
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:06,690
Okay, as an apex product? Because the actual apex is the experience.

280
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:15,980
What you come out with is the product. So well, what are we going to have that talk about what counts and what doesn't?

281
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:31,590
I'm almost positive it's next class, but I'll just make sure. Whoever has the next question can ask.

282
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:38,490
And this question I'm looking is, oh, so for I'm using like my internship as my partner.

283
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:44,060
And so for that, for them, I was writing like a manuscript and I'm still writing it.

284
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:55,460
But when I asked Dr. August, she said that these products have to be tailored to an audience that is not like a public health audience.

285
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,490
So she said, My whole manuscript I'm writing can't be included as an apex product.

286
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:06,320
Is that do you have any insight into that? Say that one more time.

287
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:14,209
So I am writing a whole. I'm writing a scoping review with my internship partners.

288
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:18,050
And I'm going to use I was planning to use that as an apex product.

289
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:26,110
But Dr. August said that our products had to be tailored to an audience that was not like public health professionals.

290
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:31,940
They have to be like a general audience. And so she said, I probably couldn't use that.

291
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:38,360
So I wanted to ask what you thought. What I think you should do is bring that to class next week.

292
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:45,410
So it next week isn't the actual workshop you want, but we will have some time where we can kind of look through what you guys have.

293
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:52,130
Bring it with you. And Dr. Power and I will look over it because I can't really say that without seeing it.

294
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,810
Yeah, that makes sense. Thank you. Next question.

295
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,610
Any more obvious question. So everybody else is good.

296
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,409
Anybody else has products or are working on their products or have a practice partner

297
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:15,220
that they're working with or have already done the survey and we know where they're at.

298
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:26,170
Okay. I see lobbyists. Okay. Are there any more questions for me or that I can relay that I can find the answers to?

299
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:40,030
Yes, they were provided for by the canvas page.

300
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:45,610
So you're send I will send an email to Dr. Ella August and let her know, like I've registered,

301
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:48,700
I've done everything I supposed to do to get into this before I have an allergy advisor.

302
00:45:48,700 --> 00:46:00,800
I just need to be added to the campus page. Great. Thank you. Anybody else you've done, you know, like my department or.

303
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,370
Yeah, there's no viral question. Yeah, I just thought.

304
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:09,950
It's okay. Just. She's at our computer right now. I'm just at her.

305
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:18,490
Is there a deadline for the credit cards? It would be so.

306
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:22,840
I'm the person who approves your credit reduction. Like when it first comes in, it comes to me first.

307
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:32,020
I've seen a bunch of credit reductions. So this is this is a general statement for everybody who's done their internship and needs a credit reduction.

308
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,380
So can you just listen to this for 2 seconds in the back?

309
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,790
I'm the first person who approves your credit reduction request.

310
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:48,040
If you have not registered your internship with Michigan Public Health Clinic, also known as Simplicity,

311
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:52,600
I will send you an email saying I cannot approve this until you register an internship.

312
00:46:53,230 --> 00:47:00,370
Once you registered your internship, if you haven't already done it, you need to email me back so that I can go and improve your credit retention.

313
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:03,580
I don't know that you've done it if you haven't said anything, and then I have to go back and check.

314
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:12,879
Second, use your credits from your credit reduction, go on your this is your life document.

315
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,460
They don't really show up on your transcript until you're about to graduate.

316
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:23,020
So when we do your credit, when we do your audit, it's important for us to know that information so that we're not trying to find it later.

317
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:26,970
So the earlier the better. But there is no deadline that answers your questions.

318
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:33,670
And it's not like a thing that you need to worry about right now that, you know, if it's not important, don't worry about it right now.

319
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:39,580
I would personally say do it before Christmas break, but it's not like the end all be all.

320
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:48,390
Yes. Uh huh. Uh huh.

321
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:56,340
Uh huh. Uh. And right now, we're kind of stuck.

322
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:05,030
Like, uh. Even though go to the other section.

323
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:15,900
As long as you don't go over. Let me do the math.

324
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:27,280
I know. 8 hours plus six and it's liable for as long as you don't go over 504 hours.

325
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,240
You can do your internship as long as you want to.

326
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:38,560
Like even after that 504 hours, if you continue to do your internship that's on you, you just won't get more credit for it.

327
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:49,090
Does that make sense? For some, that's like no longer if you're still doing the same work is still you can still commit.

328
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:54,520
Yep. Yes.

329
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,900
No, we're good. If you got to go, you guys can go. If you have questions, you can stay to ask our questions.

330
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,959
Know, I applied for the creditor deduction, but I said I.

331
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,290
Only an hour is gone. So I chose our designer today.

332
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:18,909
We talked about your title. Reduction of your only is not the same with the advisor that we choose and we are talking tracking.

333
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:23,979
So I don't know who is the new one. Oh, so you don't have an eye on you?

334
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:28,440
That's what you're saying. So I thought I just saw the right one.

335
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:34,660
Is the person who's the person that you're working with no matter who that person should not let go of.

336
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,430
Advisors was only asking too much. I don't know.

337
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:43,180
I'm assuming all your guys. So who killed you?

338
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,630
But I don't know. Because that was who we hear everything.

339
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:51,339
So I'm going to prove it and I'm going to make him quote if he does not approve it.

340
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:57,550
I have I have I message great to see it. She has other but you're incredibly busy and it's not the biggest thing.

341
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:58,350
I'm not really.
