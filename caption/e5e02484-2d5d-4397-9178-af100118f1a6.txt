1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,230
Okay. So, so today we're finally going to get into our first macronutrient, which is carbohydrates.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,360
Like I said, yes. Your date Monday. That was it's give me a bit of a stop and start because we're going to start with carbohydrates.

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:19,410
Then we're going to go into digestion, which is going to lead us into fiber, the microbiome, and then finally, finally the revivalism.

4
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:27,089
So today, we're mainly just going to focus on what carbohydrates are. A lot of this was already in the notes and it's kind of just really fact based.

5
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,830
So what I'm going to do today, in addition to kind of covering some of the stuff that was in the notes,

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,219
I'm actually going to spend a little bit of time to focus on two pretty important

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,730
concepts that you're going to need to know kind of throughout your nutrition education.

8
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,090
One is thinking about the difference between recipes and observational studies.

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,150
So we're going to go through a couple examples of each of those and how to think about them.

10
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,089
And then at the end, how to think about meta analysis, which are really common ways that I think about scientific data,

11
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,970
especially very data like nutrition and then as well on soda.

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:06,389
Okay. So carbohydrates are sometimes redefined here is that for most people their major fuel source in terms of energy.

13
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,799
So most people get most of their energy using more than half their energy from carbohydrates.

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:19,140
The EMG are the acceptable macronutrient distribution range for carbohydrates set by the USDA is 45 to 65% of your food calories.

15
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,219
So obviously, as we learn, that can be much higher than both protein and fat.

16
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,920
And then there's tons and tons and tons of sources that we'll go through and you can sort of see what vegetables

17
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:35,310
and fruits comprise a large portion of the of the likely so carbohydrates because they're our major energy source.

18
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,590
That's the primary thing you're doing for most people.

19
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,490
Obviously not if you're on a carbohydrate diet, but for most people it's providing you a lot of energy.

20
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:49,110
Now, certain tissues, brain, kidney, red blood cells are almost entirely reliant on carbohydrates for their function.

21
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,710
Right. And it turns out, as we talk about the metabolism can be really, really important.

22
00:01:52,950 --> 00:02:00,070
So when things go awry with non-hybrid metabolism and I notice that in brain kidneys and in the red blood cells can only use proteins,

23
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,480
you can only use proteins, all of these for energy.

24
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,690
So having a constant flow of glucose to those is really important.

25
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,310
Of course we can store them for later in the form, like a movie to block the function.

26
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:19,170
It's important for intestinal health, especially fermentable fibers stressed and talked about in our unit and during pregnancy.

27
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:24,540
It's the main energy source for both placenta and the fetus and not as exclusive as for the brain,

28
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,409
but it is a major energy source for the consumption. Okay.

29
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,240
So for each of the three macronutrients we're going to talk about in this particular class,

30
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,719
I'm almost always going to start off thinking about the food in the context of the pack size.

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:44,700
And for you to by now I think of a carbohydrate as like a chemical structure in the context of of chemistry.

32
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,350
Right. But that's not true. Potatoes got lots of other things. A piece of bread has lots of other things.

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:57,160
Butter on it, avocados, maybe. So thinking about all the other things that are associated with carbohydrate is important.

34
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,540
And when I think of the package of a carbohydrate, I think of sort of two things.

35
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,629
One is what are the other things that are present in that food, right?

36
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,660
So if you're eating a potato, what are the other things that are in the potato?

37
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,049
Right. It could be things that are intrinsic to the potato, like, for example, potatoes,

38
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,540
very high in potassium or could be things that are ancillary to the potato,

39
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,010
like the cream cheese or the bacon that you put on the potato when you eat it.

40
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,530
That's all part of the potato package.

41
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:25,109
So if you're really talking about potato ness, you have to think about the entire package of what's in them, right?

42
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,040
So if you're like avocado toast, you might like avocado, you might think it's mostly avocado,

43
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,730
but it's also the olive oil or the hot spices or the salt, pepper, bread, whatever else that you that you put on it.

44
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,040
So what I want you to do is go to this link here and just pick the first carbohydrate rich thing that you can think of.

45
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,470
I probably use potato five you and I want you to just in your head think of what are the

46
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,040
other things that might be present in that food that might comprise of the package?

47
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:58,109
And how would you roughly rate it in terms of what do you think this is a high quality carbohydrate or a relatively low quality carbohydrate,

48
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,920
again, depending on what your definition of a body is.

49
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:09,220
So kind of about 5 minutes I'm going to everybody should go to edit this Google doc if you can see this link should take you to a Google.

50
00:04:18,470 --> 00:05:24,930
People. And make sure you put your initials because there's nothing to submit for this.

51
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:35,280
So you put your initials on here. So we to go in and we hope look at this movement, if you like, some of the students in the class don't.

52
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:47,070
Okay. So these look really good. So couple through reflections.

53
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,670
I have been looking at the block over here.

54
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:55,709
Many of you know that many of these carbohydrates are incredibly highly available through staples and a lot of our foods.

55
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:01,020
That's why we get most of our calories from them. This is also why carbohydrates tend to be the base for a lot of food fortification.

56
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,420
So we'll talk about food fortification, I think in four or five, four or five lectures now.

57
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:11,459
But for example, if society are going to supplement people's foods with iron and it's a society that eats a lot of rice,

58
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,530
it might be useful to put iron in the rice because then, you know, people are going to eat it, therefore they're going to get get a lot of iron.

59
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,700
So that's one big thing about it.

60
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:24,419
And that in general, many people are sort of commenting that their carbohydrate that they think is a staple is in general pretty low quality.

61
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,770
And that's probably mostly because of of refinement, which is the thing that we're going to talk about.

62
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,290
So there's really two ways to sort of think about carbohydrates. One is, is it bioavailable versus is it not viable?

63
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:42,030
Right. So one aspect of it is, is this a kind of sugar that we can digest and absorb?

64
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,150
Remember back to Monday, I said for us to be able to absorb something,

65
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:50,400
we have to be able to break it down into an abnormal unit and we have to be able to absorb that particular thing.

66
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,610
Right. And so that's one big part of thinking about what if carbohydrate is part of that might be related to whether it's refined or not.

67
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:02,759
So the advantage of refining is it can improve both the shelf life, usability and taste of a particular carbohydrate.

68
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,800
So if you think the canonical example here would be brown rice, it is easier to work with.

69
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,850
It is if the sort of shell in a bread removes.

70
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,220
That comes at a cost. Of course though, because as you refine a carbohydrate, generally you're taking stuff away.

71
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:23,010
And in general, when you're taking something, not always, but in general when you're taking stuff away from some sort of natural, unprocessed food,

72
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:29,460
you're taking away something that we've evolved in what we eat, especially if it's some sort of full, large scale refining process.

73
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:34,800
As an example, I call up the Internet a whole grain content bran endosperm germ.

74
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,179
The germ is sort of a liberty fatty core. It contains a lot of fat soluble vitamins.

75
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:48,299
And what we found was the brand generally contains the fiber and some of the antioxidants, whereas the endosperm contains mainly just the starch.

76
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:54,780
So the maybe carbohydrates, the refined grain is going to be mostly just the start, but it now comes at a loss of those other nutrients.

77
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,970
So for example, if you do the like mania, media reflection activity, you can eat, sleep.

78
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,160
They'll talk a lot about how beriberi, which is a disease we'll talk about in a few weeks,

79
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,840
didn't really exist until people started refining rice and then they started removing the vitamins for rice.

80
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,629
And then it turned out people were deficient in that particular vitamin,

81
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,390
which eventually we figured out what it was and how to make it put back into a

82
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,710
meal by accidentally removing something that people were used to consuming. It was an essential nutrient.

83
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,160
It sort of created a disease that we then had solved by adding it that right.

84
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,410
And you'll see this is very common in the history of food production that you take something you refining,

85
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,930
you take all this stuff out and then you realize like,

86
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,739
oops, now this stuff is missing, let's put a bunch of stuff back in so that people aren't getting sick, right?

87
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,740
And that's a lot of how food processing occurs.

88
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,710
Food processing has become much more popular from a scientific perspective in the last five years,

89
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,929
and that's because of a parameter ization of food processing, largely the most common one.

90
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,470
There's a few other ones, but the most common one is called the Nova classification.

91
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,060
And what it does is it takes all foods and it classify them into four different types of foods.

92
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:02,219
So one would be entirely unprocessed foods. So like an apple, the Somali unprocessed.

93
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,340
If I take a steak and I cook it, that's entirely unprocessed.

94
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,919
I take a fish that's entirely unprocessed. Group two are ingredients, processed ingredients.

95
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,770
These are usually ingredients extracted from a whole foods.

96
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,379
So things like sugars, honey, butter salts, things that are you would think of as ingredients.

97
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,340
You might think of, well, I'm making a food. I need to make sure that I've got garlic powder, unsalted butter or beverage.

98
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:31,230
That's group two. Three is where you take an unprocessed food and you add a substantial amount of group to it.

99
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,060
So if I take that same steak and I add a bunch of salt and butter to it, now it is a good three food,

100
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,220
not a good one because I've added primer, I've added these processed ingredients to a group one.

101
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:47,280
It's still mostly a steak, but it has a bunch of these other group, two ingredients and then group four.

102
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,959
And I apologize that it's kind of cut off here. Group four is now it's like mostly the processed ingredients.

103
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,200
So it's mostly butter, flour, sugar, salt, a cake, for example.

104
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,570
It doesn't really look like there's no cake trees out in the wild. It doesn't really look like anything that's naturally occurring any more.

105
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,990
It's mainly the ingredients. Now, I want to make a distinction here.

106
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:09,960
I'm not saying number one is good, and number four is that different purposes for different people and ambivalent about these sorts of things.

107
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:15,750
But this is one way that you can look at somebody's diet is how much of your diet is processed versus unprocessed.

108
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:21,330
And this has become a really popular way to look at how diets relate to chronic diseases in a generalized way.

109
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:29,100
So a couple of examples, maybe three examples of how we've learned some stuff from this novel classification.

110
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:38,400
Okay. So, so for example, if you calculate people take in this class and said what percent of your calories come from class four,

111
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:43,180
it's, you know, in America, it's usually around 40. Or 50% or higher for most people.

112
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,480
You can then break us into. In this case, it's in two quintiles.

113
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:51,639
So five equally sized groups of say no events. This group is most like processed groups.

114
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,810
The second most it's groups in the middle of these groups at least. And this groups, it's the least process group.

115
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,360
And then we could just look at correlations between what is going on with the entirety of their diet.

116
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,110
Right. So what else is going on in their diet based on that separation of of people?

117
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:11,350
And so as one quick example, this is looking across a variety of different countries,

118
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,060
looking at the amount of sugar is both free and added across ultra processed diets.

119
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:21,400
And maybe unsurprisingly, people who largely consume mostly ultra processed foods,

120
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:28,440
which is this is the highest quintile of ultra processed food consumption, are also consuming many, many more sugars than this group here.

121
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,480
So somewhere between two and three times more sugar. Right.

122
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,470
So by consuming a higher processed food diet, they're also consuming more sugar.

123
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:40,770
Right. So that's a correlation within their diet, right? We hadn't done anything as people were observed.

124
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,080
You can look at this other more broadly.

125
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:50,439
So this is not looking at a bunch of different nutritional parameters across quintiles of processed food consumption.

126
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,010
This is data from Brazil, exclusively from Brazil.

127
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,130
And there's a few things you can sort of see here.

128
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,780
So what is the density of the foods that are calories per gram is quite a bit higher as you go from left to right.

129
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:10,060
Another is the amount of protein decreases pretty substantially as you go from left to right.

130
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,560
The amount of free sugar, as I showed in the previous slide, increases pretty dramatically.

131
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,680
In this case about two fold the amount of saturated fat increases and the amount of fiber decreases.

132
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:26,169
So these are characteristics of ultra processed diet. Now, this is not necessarily true for every ultra processed food.

133
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:31,510
There could be ultra processed foods that are very high in protein, like whey protein, for example, would be processed,

134
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:37,690
but is also extremely high in protein, not only protein, but in general people who consume those diets.

135
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:42,999
This is what their dietary habits are. So more saturated fats, more sugars, less protein and less fiber.

136
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,750
And I think most of us probably agree that's suboptimal in terms of of the human.

137
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:58,350
So that's something about the global diet. And then yeah, okay.

138
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,440
We know that although that processed foods high in salt,

139
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:13,210
but why is the sodium that's interesting so in this particular example in Brazil, ultra processed foods are associated with lower salt.

140
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,260
And that might probably have to do with manufacturers being concerned about

141
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,680
their sodium levels because of the associations with salt and hypertension.

142
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,149
This is not true in America. This is just in Brazil. A good that's a good point.

143
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:30,960
I had that I look forward to a lot because I think I realized that last year when I was looking, I was like, wait, salt goes down that we.

144
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,479
I have to stay negative. Yeah. Yeah. So, like I said, this is only looking in Brazil.

145
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,100
I couldn't find this kind of nutritional data for America across U.S., but it may exist,

146
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,930
and it actually would be not that hard to assess where you could take an indicator for America,

147
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:51,000
and then you could do this calculation of the people in the process and categorizing.

148
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:58,140
And I've seen this, you know, kind of people out of me feel more against this.

149
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:05,150
Also in Brazil, since we're talking about Brazil, you may be interested in ultra processed foods in relationship with various chronic diseases.

150
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,549
Right. Doesn't really matter. Could affect your diet. It doesn't also associate with some some chronic disease.

151
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:15,050
And what you can see is if now you're going across quartiles, this is the amount of the ultra processed food in the diet.

152
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,790
So the high is 35 to 55%. The lowest group is 1 to 3%.

153
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:26,080
And you can see the prevalence of obesity increases as the amount of ultra processed food in their diet increases.

154
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,440
So looking at this and I can't hear what they actually concluded in 2014 when they wrote this paper.

155
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,580
But you might argue, well, this might suggest that ultra processed food consumption causes obesity.

156
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,540
Right. Because you've got this group here, does a lot of this thing and they also tend to be obvious.

157
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,240
So it's reasonable that they might become obese. Maybe.

158
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:51,010
But this is an observational study, right? As the cross-sectional observational study, we don't know what these people look like before.

159
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:55,240
We don't know what they were eating before. We don't know what they're going to be like in ten years, what they're going to be eating ten years.

160
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,260
We're just taking a snapshot of them at one particular point.

161
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,660
And so in general, we would consider that sort of the lowest quality of data.

162
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,190
Right. Because, for example, people who are obese tend to consume more diet soda.

163
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,020
That's not necessarily because the diet is what's causing obesity. It's because the obesity is causing that.

164
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:16,200
So we call for its causality. So what do you guys think?

165
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:23,830
Are there any alternative explanations that might connect obesity to processed food consumption that doesn't include obesity causes,

166
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:33,940
sort of processed food insecurity. So having to get put in by convenience stores or desserts versus being able to shop, produce.

167
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:38,110
So you're saying so, though, I just want to be clear. So we're undergraduates people here.

168
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,260
You're saying something about like lower income might be associated with ultra processed foods,

169
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,680
but then independently associate with obesity, but not because of those two things, right?

170
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,620
Yeah. Now that probably makes some sense also of genetics because we took in the previous

171
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:55,240
chapter that certain people react differently to the same environment due to their genes.

172
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:00,760
So your genes also can be ultra processed, right?

173
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,219
Right. So you can have a genetic predisposition towards obesity.

174
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:08,740
And then independently, that predisposition also makes you like ultra processed foods, but those things are not actually connected to each other.

175
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,230
Right. So that's two of the six examples like those think physical activity.

176
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,200
So someone who doesn't work out, they also just consuming more processed food.

177
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,919
What the time constraints are. Right, right.

178
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,469
So it could be sort of broadly other lifestyle factors, including physical activity.

179
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,730
It could be it's a connection between sort of free time or stress.

180
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,980
It can be education level, for example, mostly educated people.

181
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,330
Usually they tend to choose healthier choices instead of ultra processed.

182
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,270
This also might play right? Right. So could it be are you informed about these things?

183
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:50,680
But you're not informed of the risks of obesity and you're not informed about problematic, neutral, processed foods?

184
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:56,469
I think that might be all the ones I have. So. So we had us.

185
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:01,510
Yes. I'll come back to that last one. Genetics and you mentioned and then socioeconomic status.

186
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,630
The difference, I would say, between this group and this group would be it's kind of a mixture of both.

187
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,090
The other one you can think of is maybe the actual existence of obesity because you consume consuming ultra processed foods.

188
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:19,239
Or it could be something about as you accrue more adiposity, maybe there's something connected with collecting and that makes you more inclined.

189
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,139
So this would be like the diet soda example I just gave could be some sort of reverse psychology, right?

190
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:29,469
But we don't know from that particular study I showed you because that's just, like I said, a cross-sectional observational study.

191
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,750
And I'm not against observational studies yet.

192
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,219
The really important one of the challenges with nutrition is that for many of the diseases we're interested in,

193
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,780
they take years and years and years to correct.

194
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:43,660
And nobody's going to agree to do a randomized clinical trial where they say only eat oatmeal for like ten years,

195
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,719
and then they come back and follow up and we see what happened to them. Right. So we're always limited in nutrition between the trade offs.

196
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:55,070
So do we want the long time frame that it takes for the actual attribution of a chronic disease versus are we sure,

197
00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:04,120
a this is what they're doing and B there's not confounding, but we always have to be worried in the context of observational studies.

198
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:08,590
This is not both cross-sectional and longitudinal, is that is the association we're looking at.

199
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,919
True or is there some confounding mediator and you guys named a bunch?

200
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:19,240
Right. So is the confounder here socioeconomic status or physical activity that is connecting ultra processed foods to a particular disease?

201
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,990
The advantage of a randomized clinical trial, which is a much stronger piece of evidence, is that if you randomize people,

202
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,940
if I just said this class here is going to eat all the process, who in this class here is part of the class?

203
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,950
It's not presumably all the confounding factors and even. We distribute it between the two, right?

204
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,830
Because I presume not a lot of people sit on my left and not active on the right.

205
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:43,399
Right. So by randomizing those confounders that you don't have to worry about those confounders as much because they exist in both groups.

206
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:49,070
So that's a much stronger piece of data. But convincing people to do something in a randomized nature for a long time is quite difficult.

207
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,909
Frankly, those studies tend to be shorter. They tend to have softer end points.

208
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:57,500
So maybe instead of looking at heart attacks, they look at changes in cholesterol levels or something like that.

209
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,700
And maybe instead of looking at obesity, they look at transient weight change, things like that.

210
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:08,450
So they tend to have not as clear endpoints, lot of biological important endpoints, but they're much, much, much more rigorous.

211
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:14,570
So for many years, people thought that ultra processed foods probably had something to do with obesity,

212
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,160
but many people maybe agreed with some of the comments. You well, maybe this is just about poverty.

213
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,790
Maybe this is just about food access. Maybe it's just about other behaviors.

214
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,870
So to assess this, there was a randomized clinical study that came out a few years ago, only three years ago.

215
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,380
So this kind of design is called a randomized crossover site.

216
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:38,059
So that means every single participant either went through a four group B, right?

217
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:42,440
So the either unprocessed, then ultra processed or ultra processed than unprocessed.

218
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,310
The advantage of that is each person is their own control, right?

219
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,740
So each person exists in these two different diets.

220
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,150
And because they exist in these two different diets, each person you can look with people that they change.

221
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:59,000
Even though at a group level, if this was just a randomized clinical trial where you had people go from here to here,

222
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,990
you wouldn't be able to control for the individual variance. And they measured a bunch of stuff in here.

223
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,640
Arrows and stuff are looking calorimetry and blood, rosin and things like that.

224
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,270
Turns out that's important, but not super duper important for their main outcome,

225
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,760
which was that if all they did was randomize people into either an ultra processed diet or an unprocessed diet,

226
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,840
when the people were on ultra processed, they just naturally consumed quite a lot more calories.

227
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:26,060
So about 800 calories more per person.

228
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:32,030
This was an inpatient puppy style period. So they were inpatient, so they knew exactly what they were eating.

229
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:37,610
It was not self-reported. They could measure it correctly and they were given about two times as much food as they thought they would need.

230
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:43,610
So they were given an excess of food. They were just will eat aside into satiety, eat whatever you want.

231
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:48,979
And then they followed what they eat, right? So this is a very, very strong study design, but it's also very short.

232
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:56,340
You'll notice the X-axis is 40 days, right. So there is a big difference is 800 calories more, but it only existed for a little while.

233
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,370
So would this be true if we randomized them to do this for six months or ten years or 50 years?

234
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,330
Maybe. Maybe not. I don't know. I guess it sort of depends on your interpretation.

235
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:12,169
Somewhat unsurprisingly, as a more food, they gain more weight, and then when they on the unprocessed diet, they tend to lose weight.

236
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:20,160
All right. So this is good evidence that just the presence of either unprocessed or ultra processed diet can affect your conciliatory behaviors.

237
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:25,280
Right. Which may again seem sort of obvious. But this is good data to support the observational evidence that people who

238
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,920
consume more ultra processed foods tend to also have higher risk of obesity.

239
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,590
And again, these changes here are pretty modest.

240
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:39,740
They look better because they're higher, but we're talking less than a kilogram, which for Americans is about £4.

241
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:45,450
And we're loss about a kilogram. Right. So we're not talking about really, really dramatic increase.

242
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,700
Okay. So this is so it's been about 15, 20 minutes talking about the study.

243
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,150
So what I want you guys to do is try to call up and get into groups,

244
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,720
and I want you to try to call up this study on your own and then look at this study.

245
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:00,200
And I want you to try to answer some of these questions here in the next 10 minutes.

246
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:04,340
Right. So I want you to look at the study. I'm giving you a little bit of a bare bones explanation,

247
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,470
but there's a few questions here about what nutrients differed naturally in a particular table and then

248
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:15,380
why there's an explanation they provide in some other data of why it is that the ultra processed foods.

249
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,130
What do you do with hunger? Want to be clear.

250
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:28,100
So if you guys can do that in groups and because again, this is a group activity, if you could submit your group so we can do it first and then go on.

251
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:47,840
And so we spend about 10 minutes for you trying to search through the table. And this link hopefully is actually going to show you.

252
00:23:49,040 --> 00:24:01,450
So you choose to select this time.

253
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:21,750
You really are trying to find it. They were all going very well, just like I just hope it was a really great link to somewhere else.

254
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:29,060
You know, I was thinking.

255
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:43,990
Yes. You know, I wasn't reading this to be.

256
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:48,430
Really? Oh, yeah.

257
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,980
Yeah, it's another reading. Yeah, it's true, too, but.

258
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,590
Oh, but you guys have, for example.

259
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,360
Know what do we have to get to know this?

260
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:12,219
And obviously, I don't want you to write this.

261
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,129
Like, I don't want you to panic, but you don't know. Oh, is that what it says?

262
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:20,960
Another time? Yeah. I mean, this is.

263
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:27,790
This is something I want to do.

264
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,940
Process statements. Yes. Yeah.

265
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:38,500
And then that person's, like, the same size as if you want to actually take it all.

266
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:53,710
Eventually on there, you just as a grows three months, it's a little easier to start writing links.

267
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,470
Is there a direct link to the. Yeah. That links should were recording once that.

268
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:05,800
Yes. If you like. I think you personally want us to submit the answers as a group of individuals.

269
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,410
As a group. As a group. Yeah.

270
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:15,180
Yeah, I'm not.

271
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:24,220
It's not included. So I got to go. Before I was doing this assignment, it was like, this is a plan to start investing.

272
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:31,989
This the. Yeah.

273
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,270
I mean, just like call attention.

274
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:50,680
I got clarity about beyond this. Yeah. So when you start discussing the highlights of all those randomized trials.

275
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,530
Yeah, I'm pretty happy with that. I just want to get better now.

276
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:01,270
Yes, yes, yes. Yeah. Properties in the first month or so if you're like.

277
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,190
Yeah. My University of Missouri study.

278
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:11,440
So I don't think this is a random I'm going to talk about.

279
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:20,030
You're like, oh, you sound like artists already.

280
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:31,430
Okay. Yes. You are not going to talk about his policies or should be too, when you're putting anything you'd like an extra couple also.

281
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:46,900
Yeah. If you just search process, I will update this thing.

282
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:52,630
Okay. Yeah, you.

283
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:57,310
It's up there and you don't look forward to it.

284
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:02,010
You know, you go.

285
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:30,510
Do you share it with me? Yeah. Oh, my God. Is famous for all kinds of things, so everything's gonna be like.

286
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:41,690
Yes. He's doing great work.

287
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:55,090
He didn't do it at the time. I guess the supply side ramps wasn't something they were trying to go to.

288
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:06,710
Okay. Yeah, he started that.

289
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:26,490
You just got three times. I think you might get citations from your findings between 30 and 33 with the nine names in Texas.

290
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,290
No, hasn't come on. It's just until you find anything else.

291
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:44,480
I want to have more of, you know, in that sense of the population.

292
00:29:45,700 --> 00:30:00,590
So I don't think that was the this person I think everyone says there is hoping for 2020 which you know,

293
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,240
really I guess it should be here all the same.

294
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:12,920
I was trying to avoid saying the population study sample stuff.

295
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:45,830
Yeah. Yeah. So you just think about that because it certainly is not good enough reporting on the studies.

296
00:30:50,900 --> 00:31:11,629
You must be sure that you can see with weight loss diet associated with all this.

297
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:35,160
You know, just one thing I was always another option was to go swimming and he says that if

298
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:57,950
can see 311 turn out during the spring to go on Saturdays and just so much time.

299
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,450
And then also, I mean,

300
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:23,480
we also discussed this is the only one that I know right from the cross section of the study that was always supposed to be about this study,

301
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:34,590
how Elizabeth decided to find it.

302
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:45,440
But just like so many other sections. But she's not at all, as you guys are probably not done yet sometimes.

303
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,330
But we're gonna have to move on because we have a few other things to cover. Just a couple clarifying things.

304
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,720
If you're looking at a slide deck that doesn't have that link right now, refresh your browser and it shouldn't exist.

305
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:00,370
Now you had like we link to last year's slides about this, your slides which are mostly but not exactly.

306
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:09,020
And then if you're looking for the reporting on studies, what I mean by the three centric there's an assignment in grade draft called reporting on

307
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:14,900
studies that has like what I think is a useful sort of pre sentence summary of any study.

308
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:19,440
Some of you have done this because it's a prerequisite for something that's the case with many of these.

309
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:24,400
So if you're not sure what that means, just go on the grade craft. This might work for looking over pretty good studies.

310
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:27,500
Right. And that should explain what I mean by that.

311
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,760
Okay. I guess I was too happy about having the.

312
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,250
We're working that to get all the technology working on it.

313
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:41,600
So, okay, we're gonna move on to, like, acidic bonds that are going to double back to monosaccharides in a minute.

314
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:48,350
So like, acidic bonds are what forms of di oligo and polysaccharides.

315
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:55,760
And it's going to turn out to be really, really important that we can look at a sugar and identify based on any kind of plaques and bonds,

316
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:04,960
what that connection, what that name is. And so in this case, you name the bond by the direction of the hydroxyl group on the animal carbon.

317
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:13,070
So that's right here. And the analogy I use here is that if it's pointing up, it's like a balloon.

318
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,900
So it's a data linkage if it's pointing down, which this one is not.

319
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,290
If you like an anchor. Right, it's not going to be in an alpha.

320
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:28,730
All right. So this one here is on eight up and then it goes through the carbon one and kind of around this carbon or on that sugar.

321
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:37,610
Right. So this will be a beta one for you know, the reason I'm kind of being particular about this is as we talk about all the various carbohydrates,

322
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:43,969
there's like an enormous possible number of carbohydrate connections we can have, both in the alpha and the beta orientation.

323
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:49,910
Right? There's maybe almost unlimited number of potential sugars that can be connected by different connections,

324
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:56,600
but only a few of them are actually digestible. And in fact, only three types of bonds are digestible for us and for some of us.

325
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,749
For those, a very limited number that we can actually digest.

326
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:05,059
And that is the key distinction between a digestible carbohydrate and a non-negligible carbohydrate,

327
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,120
which effectively, as we'll learn, is going to be more like a fire.

328
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:14,510
Right. So that's why that's I guess the main takeaway might be a figure that's like I say, we're going to go through a few examples here.

329
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:23,810
So this is known by surprise because they're the easiest ones to start. So maltose is two glucose units, glucose and glucose, and it's a one.

330
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,730
So 01123414.

331
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:35,370
And then because this carbon here, the animal carbon is pointing down, it is an anchor, alpha anchor, right?

332
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:42,010
Alpha one fourth. And if it was alcohol one six, it would be something called ISO,

333
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:47,270
which turns out it doesn't exist that much in that occurring three foods but is going to be really important for digestion

334
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:54,800
as we'll talk about in the digestion when you get lactose on the other hand is beta one four between galactose and glucose.

335
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,980
So the other one is the beta one for fruit.

336
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:06,170
I now get a lot of glucose, so not lactose and glucose again carbon one carbon four beta will pointing out I so this is lactose,

337
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:13,129
right, which has the digestion less than half people on the planet can actually digest because most people do not have the enzyme.

338
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,310
Lactase Which brings us down now.

339
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:20,030
One convenient thing when you think about the enzymes that we're going to talk about the sugars and a bunch of enzymes,

340
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:27,380
these ones are actually pretty straightforward. So maltose broken down by muscle, takes lactose broken down by multiple lectins.

341
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,360
And then I'm sure you can guess sucrose is broken down by sucrose, right?

342
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:36,110
ISO maltose by isometrics, right? So this is not going to happen all the time this semester.

343
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:40,340
But in this particular context, A's is the enzyme that breaks down to workers.

344
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:44,870
Now most of us get the majority of our disaccharides sugars in the form of sucrose.

345
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,530
Now sucrose has a bit of a funky looking linkage. It's an alpha one, beta two, one.

346
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:53,280
Now the reason it's about an alpha and beta in its name is because it's both animal carbons,

347
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:56,800
it's the editor and carbon from this glucose and the animal carbon from that.

348
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:01,919
So you can't just rely on a one animal carbon like we did with the first two, there is two.

349
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:09,889
And so it's the alpha one from the, from the, from the glucose and then the beta two from the right.

350
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:14,690
And so again, that bond orientation, these three different bonds, even though they may all look pretty similar,

351
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:23,150
are different enough that an enzyme such as sucrose has no activity on lactose and the enzyme lactase has absolutely no activity on maltose.

352
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,890
Even though these look different, these subtle differences in these bond architectures actually really,

353
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:31,310
really distinguish whether or not we can break them down and if we can break it down,

354
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,680
that we can get an energy from it and it can cause all sorts of gastrointestinal issues.

355
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:43,970
So those are the dye. SUMMERS So you may ask, are these sugars or what is the sugar and why do you keep saying carbohydrate?

356
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,240
Well, there is the distinction here between sugars and added sugars.

357
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:54,320
So added sugars are defined. This is by the USDA. So results may vary depending on if you're not talking about America has to

358
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,910
be a Sirup or Claude sweetener used as a sweetener in another food product,

359
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:03,260
right? So the fact that milk has lactose, that lactose is not considered an added sugar, right.

360
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:09,799
Because it was already in there. However, and I know this. So talking to dairy, if you buy Lactaid, they add sugars to it to make it taste better.

361
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:17,209
So they digested galactose and they added sucrose to make it sugar. That now would be an added sugar as of I don't know the date,

362
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:24,710
but I think as of 2015 it became mandatory to label added sugars on the food facts label here, the nutrition facts label.

363
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:30,740
So what you might see is you might look at carbohydrates. This is a little bit deceptive because in this case, carbohydrates includes fiber.

364
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:36,010
I don't know why fiber. It's a line, but whatever they include fiber in carbohydrates.

365
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,490
But if you take that out, then you can see this one has 25 grams of sugar.

366
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,930
So 25 of the 27 grams are sugars, which means two grams are something else.

367
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,580
So not it's not most monosaccharides and all that.

368
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:50,680
25 grams, 23 of them are added sugars. Right.

369
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:57,760
And added sugars are a nutrient of concern for the USDA in terms of limiting sort of consumption.

370
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,220
Now, there's lots of added sugars, there's lots of specific.

371
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:07,270
So like related to that, like because like honey, if you add honey to something, it's an added sugar.

372
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:11,469
Like when you're looking at like a bottle of honey itself. Is that all?

373
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:15,520
Ed It should be. It should be labeled as 100%, but it shouldn't.

374
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:22,690
Even though you're saying like added to what? We're going to ask the question, I think lodgers.

375
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:33,250
So yes, it's not true. So there's maple sirup. So if you buy like maple sirup and brown sugar daddy sirup to it, if it gets the flavor,

376
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,689
I should know the answer to that, but that would be considered not a sugar.

377
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:45,970
So any sweetener that is added to a food that is not endogenous to that food is considered an added sweetener and we consume a lot of additive.

378
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,330
So there's just some examples. So cane sugar, beet sugar, bowl sucrose.

379
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:54,040
So you might be surprised to learn that sucrose that's at the top here.

380
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:05,290
Then if you look at some things like high fructose corn sirup, that's how 55 HFCS 55 is 55% fructose, 45% glucose, effectively no sucrose.

381
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:11,000
Agave is mostly fructose. So for those of you who think fruit doesn't matter, maybe avoid agave.

382
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:14,829
We'll talk a lot about fructose. Here's honey here. And then, of course, here is the greatest sweeteners.

383
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:21,489
Maple sirup, which you may be surprised, looks exactly like table sugar in terms of its sucrose consumption, molasses.

384
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:24,520
This is the last version now, people. But for a long time.

385
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,940
Well, maybe the reason because so many people get so many of the calorie sweeteners.

386
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,280
That is the reason for the obesity epidemic.

387
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,470
So you may be surprised to learn that actually the consumption of sweeteners per capita in the United States has declined pretty,

388
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:40,300
pretty precipitously since about the year 2000 when it peaked.

389
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:47,080
Right. So this was the cause of continued obesity and we've decreased it by, oh, I don't know, 35% in the last 20 years.

390
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,820
You would expect obesity rates have declined by 20% in the last 15 years.

391
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:55,630
But that's like that, right? So there has been a reduction of added sweeteners in our food supply,

392
00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:01,870
but that has not been intended with reductions in obesity rates, which may suggest that this isn't the main reason.

393
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:09,879
Instead of just thinking about added sugars, one area where people spend a lot of time thinking is specifically sugar sweetened beverages.

394
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,500
There's a whole group of people that just think, Well, if you're consuming liquids, why not just consume water?

395
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,850
You don't need anything else in it.

396
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:22,320
And in a lot of people, especially people of low s, yes, there's a large proportion of their added sugars come from sugar sweetened beverages.

397
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:28,630
That's why issues like soda, taxes and the like, they're focusing in on trying to reduce that 50% of the added sugars in adolescents.

398
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,520
And of course, if you have to juice that, it's mostly added sugar. It's very little other nutrients.

399
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:40,510
So if we calculated the ratio of nutrition to energy, it would have a very low ratio and again associated with obesity problems.

400
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:48,909
So similar to the participation analysis I talked about with ultra processed foods, if you just looked at people,

401
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:53,680
categorize them based on their sugar sweetened beverage intake, you might see that they are more likely to be obese.

402
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,300
So this particular kind of visualization is something called a meta analysis.

403
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,729
So what this means is it's combining a bunch of states.

404
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:07,660
So each dotted line is an individual study with the mean effect of that study, plus it's 95% confidence interval.

405
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:11,319
So that's what Dhingra, 27, found.

406
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:20,560
Was this big an impact now? BOGGS 2013, they didn't see quite as big of an effect compared to Dhingra.

407
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:30,489
And then you can see PEREIRA had not even a significant effect where you can see their 95% confidence interval was one.

408
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:36,309
And there could be a lot of reasons, maybe. PEREIRA Pego came from a different population that they were looking at.

409
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:40,630
Maybe they just did a study. Maybe they only had like five people. And there could be a lot of reasons why they're different.

410
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:45,309
But one of the advantages of the meta analysis is you've combined all these studies mathematically,

411
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:49,930
and they get an aggregate estimate of all of these studies together. So this aggregate estimate right here,

412
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:59,290
which says that there is a 20% increased risk of obesity with increased sugar sweetened beverage consumption with a confidence interval of 10 to 31%.

413
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:01,089
Right. So by combining these effectively,

414
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:08,170
they're arguing maybe we have instead of each study out 100 people negative five studies negative like one study like 500 people.

415
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,920
And that has more statistical power. Yeah.

416
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,660
Okay, so that's measurements. So I'll go through another one more.

417
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,280
So the last thing I have before we switch over to the food of the day here in

418
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,580
a minute is what are the record current recommendations around added sugars?

419
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,820
So total sugars, which I obviously think are more important than added sugars.

420
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:33,829
There is no recommendation. So there's no upper limit to total sugars.

421
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:37,730
So if you're eating naturally occurring total sugars, the USDA does not set an upper limit on that.

422
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,559
They do set an upper limit on added sugars. Now, right now, it's 10%.

423
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,990
And there was a very strong recommendation at the last dietary guidelines for Americans, which came out in 2000,

424
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,219
that they should recommend less than 6% of energy, which, if you do the math,

425
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:58,220
is about 120 calories or about 30 grams of total added sugars per day per person.

426
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:04,220
That recommendation was, I wouldn't say explicitly rejected, but it was not included in the dietary guidelines.

427
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,680
So if you look at the dietary guidelines for Americans right now, it still says 10%.

428
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:14,630
So you should cap your added sugars at 10% of your calories, which to me is pretty high.

429
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:22,130
Even though the scientific recommendation is 6%. Simple question why do they not put it in the dietary guidelines?

430
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,230
So the last presidency was a little chaotic and so a lot of stuff was happening.

431
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:30,660
So it's unclear. There wasn't real policy. For example, I'll give you a different example.

432
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:35,780
There was in the 2015 dietary guidelines income of every five years,

433
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:39,290
there was a recommendation to include sustainability as an aspect of the guidance.

434
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,900
And the USDA had a panel discussion about this. The scientific report said, yes, you should say a lot of things.

435
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:48,590
And the USDA discussed it and they said, no, the guidelines are about health of Americans.

436
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:51,140
They have nothing to do with sustainability. So they took all the sustainability stuff out.

437
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,580
It was very clear people disagreed, but there was actual like the be publications and things like that.

438
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:59,120
This was just here's the recommendation and then the guidelines throughout the department.

439
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:04,660
So there wasn't really an explanation for why not. It wasn't like there was a lobby group that was arguing against it.

440
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:05,999
It just wasn't included.

441
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:15,530
And it will almost certainly be included in the 2025 guidelines because there is very strong consensus among scientists that five or 6% is possible.

442
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:19,700
So different steps from the same result. Sort of.

443
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:25,760
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the way the guidelines work, the DGA is work is they convene a large committee of experts,

444
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:32,340
they make recommendations to the scientific experts and give that to the USDA, who then usually takes those recommendations and makes policy.

445
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:41,130
So between those two or both, in both cases, sustainability, 12, 15 and sugars and also saturated fats, reductions were not put forward.

446
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:45,090
But again, it was like a little less transparent this time. But why? I don't even know if that was actually a decision.

447
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:49,350
I might have been like, we just get this on the way. Okay, so that's added sugars.

448
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:53,820
And speaking of added sugars, which, you know, is going to tell us about Coca-Cola.

449
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:03,270
And thank you for joining us again.

450
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,380
Oh, no. We have a whole new set of headphones.

451
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:20,080
Just this whichever smartphone is, you're going to be endlessly for a surprising number of years this year.

452
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,470
This one is a turn off, is a green light for the sun.

453
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:34,470
There is no way that I can get.

454
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:41,700
Can you hear me? Yes. All right. Here is what we're going to be discussing.

455
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,380
My very favorite sugar sweetened beverage and my own personal taste.

456
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:49,590
First, Coca Cola. Don't have a lot of our soap and Coca Cola.

457
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:54,430
There we go. So a little bit about the background and history of Coca Cola.

458
00:46:54,450 --> 00:47:02,940
It was invented in 1886 by an Atlanta pharmacist named John s Pemberton, which is a very time period appropriate name.

459
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:10,620
I think it was actually originally intended for medicinal purposes as a general tonic for basically everything.

460
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:16,139
You got a sore foot, do coca cola about it. It was you know, it's famous worldwide.

461
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:23,350
It's enjoyed by many, including me. And, you know, a lot of variety exists within COLAs and other Coca Cola products.

462
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:30,840
We have diet sodas that have no sugar. We have different flavors that have different additives, and we also have different brands.

463
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:35,100
No, we're not going to go into that. So exactly what's in COLA.

464
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:43,200
So in order to find that, I went to the USDA website and we searched it up and because how COLAs and Coca Cola specifically is a kind of,

465
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:52,109
you know, is from 1886 it's very old. We do have some legacy data for what a canonical generic the platonic cola really is.

466
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:56,340
And we also have some branded information from direct from the corporation.

467
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:00,090
So I decided to take a look at both and try to see and compare.

468
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:03,180
Is there anything different? Is there anything you know? Is it the same?

469
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:12,310
So the first thing I looked at was the general branding information from the Coca-Cola Company.

470
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:17,020
This is the serving size of one can. I should have brought a cannon with me, but I didn't.

471
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:24,429
Very unfortunate. And what we can really see is I'm going to highlight this here for I'm pretty sure most, you know, that's very small.

472
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:28,000
But what we noticed is that there is no.

473
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:34,170
Fossett. That's not in the right spot. It's very high in sugar.

474
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:44,100
Right? It's, uh, it's 140 something calories, and it contains 39 grams of sugars.

475
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:50,280
It also contains 39 grams of total carbohydrates, which means all those carbs are all sugar.

476
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:58,080
There's no lipids, there's no protein. There is no minerals or vitamins to speak of other than a little bit of sodium.

477
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:05,340
So something really interesting to keep in mind because there's no limits, there's no protein, there's no anything here.

478
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:11,300
We can kind of tell that all the calories of this Coca-Cola bottle can bottle.

479
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:14,400
It's a cat because it's called fluid. Ounces is all sugar.

480
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:19,829
So one can is clearly about over half of the recommended intake,

481
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:28,410
although based on what we just learned in lecture at 140 something calories, it is 110 is just over your daily recommended intake.

482
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,950
And of course the content of the sugar and whatever would probably differ between other brands.

483
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:39,480
And it also doesn't tell us this brand information doesn't really tell us about other additives.

484
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,890
So it doesn't tell us what natural flavors mean. What is caramel color?

485
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:47,310
It says caffeine, but it doesn't actually tell us the caffeine content.

486
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:55,530
So we can now move on to this legacy, this generic platonic cola again, once again with a serving size.

487
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:58,620
But can. And what we perceive here is.

488
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,160
Those things are broken and that's not fun.

489
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:10,729
But what we can sort of see is that there apparently is about slightly less than a gram of total lipid contained in this generic cola,

490
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:16,910
which is strange but as different. We also get some information about caffeine 33 milligrams.

491
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:22,220
That may be a lot for some of you. It might not be a lot for most of us, you know.

492
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:31,280
Another thing that we can see here is that there is, unlike the branded information,

493
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,979
there does seem to be some minerals, very small amounts other other than magnesium.

494
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:42,990
We also see sodium still there because some potassium is probably you know, it's a very small amount.

495
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:52,610
So we haven't learned about that yet. And finally, we can also see the composition of sugars in the drink, which is high fructose corn sirup.

496
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:58,460
So we have a lot of fructose. We have a lot of glucose in kind of boxes, not in the right spot.

497
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:08,120
But what this this extra detailed information really tells us is it confirms what we already know is that soda is fizzy sugar water.

498
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:11,990
There isn't really much else to at present. Much helps inside of it.

499
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:17,180
And it really doesn't change its narrative that it's a bunch of sugar and it's probably not good for you.

500
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:20,570
So how how bad is it for you really?

501
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:26,950
So in terms of health claims, despite its noble origins as a medicinal tonic for your sore,

502
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,870
whatever it is, unfortunately it seems that sugar sweetened, sugar sweetened beverage consumption,

503
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,879
but apparently not diet soda consumption,

504
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:42,050
is positively associated with the progression of insulin resistance and free diabetes and sugar sweetened beverages.

505
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:45,280
Coca-Cola certainly is. Yeah.

506
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:53,240
So we have this table from this study. Okay.

507
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:02,540
Okay. So what we can see here is that everything just shifted down.

508
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:08,040
Okay. So what's originally supposed to be circle for us is the median intake that is measuring is

509
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:12,859
being are people in that are being observed in this study because it's an observational study,

510
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:16,100
are they having zero servings of sugar sweetened beverages per week?

511
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:19,400
Are they having one serving two servings or six servings per week?

512
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:30,830
And then right below that, we can see from model one. Model one is where they're accounting for differences in like starting insulin resistance.

513
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:35,210
They're accounting for BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption and etc.

514
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:42,140
And we can sort of see that in the model one at zero consumption at zero servings per week.

515
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:46,969
The home air score, which is how they measure insulin resistance, is 2.9.

516
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:53,540
But once we move on to six servings per week, the home air score is 3.15, which is higher.

517
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:58,520
And they tested the significance of this finding and they found that it was highly significant.

518
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:04,310
And then if we actually checked the diet soda, which they have different servings for some reason,

519
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:12,830
but if we check out model one once again, we actually see that, you know, 2.96, 2.93, 3.1 to 3.04.

520
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:15,649
There's no real pattern of increasing over time.

521
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:22,879
And they checked the statistical significance and they found that it wasn't statistically significant as you consume more diet soda.

522
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:31,940
So it seems that while sugar sweetened beverages like Coca-Cola or other sodas can contribute to insulin resistance, it seems that diet soda,

523
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:42,380
which lacks the added sugar, does not, which seems to suggest that the added sugar of soda really contributes to a lot of the health effects of soda.

524
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:47,390
I suppose there's not really much else in there that could contribute to help you think about it.

525
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:52,430
So I guess some major takeaways would be that Coca Cola is a common sugar sweetened beverage.

526
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:56,000
We all know it. It's everywhere. You can't escape from the Coca-Cola Company.

527
00:53:56,540 --> 00:54:02,120
Coca Cola provides little nutritional value other than being a source of added sugars and maybe water.

528
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:08,780
And, you know, Coca-Cola's health effects might be attributed to its high levels of sugar,

529
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:14,450
as we can see in the comparison for insulin resistance and how sugar sweetened beverages and diet soda compare.

530
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:19,040
And it's probably not the best idea to drink Coca Cola regularly.

531
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:30,500
I'm Coca Cola. Any questions?

532
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:39,080
Mr. BATES Do you know the differences between Diet Coke and Coke Zero?

533
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:44,870
Diet Coke and Coke Zero? I'm not entirely sure, am I?

534
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:52,220
My instinct would be that it's a difference in sweetener and some slight difference in flavorings.

535
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:58,400
But I think that is and I'm not a Coca-Cola expert on what's refreshing.

536
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:03,140
Did you find any conflicting results in other studies? Conflicting results?

537
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:10,759
I did. Look, there were a lot of results, so I didn't look too deeply into other studies.

538
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,919
But I did find that generally there is a lot of talk about sugar sweetened beverage consumption and prediabetes and type two diabetes.

539
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:24,110
So it generally seems that the field is very conclusive on the fact that.

540
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:31,579
So there was this study where they observed sugar sweetened beverage consumption in Hispanic women, if I recall correctly.

541
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:41,120
And they pretty much their findings are that they develop diabetes and prediabetes when consuming sugar sweetened beverages,

542
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:45,829
but that it wasn't necessarily a special increase compared to other groups,

543
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:53,870
which at least if I were to kind of extrapolate it a bit, seems to say that sugar sweetened beverages is generally associated with diabetes.

544
00:55:54,500 --> 00:56:00,170
I was asking more about the more controversial part of what you presented, which has to do with diet soda.

545
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:05,090
And I was wondering if you found any conflicting information there about if you did not.

546
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:10,450
I didn't. I there's a lot of papers I skimmed through to try and find stuff.

547
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:18,080
So I, I feel like there was some mention about appetite and diet soda that was mentioned, but I'm not.

548
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:23,490
I'll have to get back to you on that. How many cooks are you drinking?

549
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:33,600
I plead the fifth. You prefer a cup with high fructose corn sirup or cup with a cane sugar?

550
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:41,040
The thing yes, I do prefer the cane sugar version, but honestly, I don't know if there's an actual tangible difference.

551
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:46,139
Like I prefer it because it's a little longer. It's an auto and it feels different.

552
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:50,840
But is it really different? Right. I feel like that could be done by experiment.

553
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:52,559
So my son, he swears it's better.

554
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:57,660
But then I did this in an airport in a cup park, and he thought that he thought the high fructose corn sirup was the best.

555
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:05,070
So anyone does that. He's also interested in Oak Creek's.

556
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:42,590
Yeah. So I think it's, you know, it's it's sort of like seven.

557
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:46,209
It's like it brings the five things, you know,

558
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:53,470
you talk about what's going on and I didn't realize what I was like are sitting there with carbohydrates.

559
00:57:53,890 --> 00:58:00,430
They have multiple hydroxyl groups lending them the name of Polyols, which represents the in fodmap.

560
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:04,750
They are derived from reduction of the monosaccharides.

561
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:09,220
So the anti height bond is reduced to form a hydroxyl bond.

562
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,960
The structure makes them as Nigerians in their natural state.

563
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:22,330
The different polyols have varying levels of energy and to them in general, what's in your then most carbohydrate?

564
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:30,040
An average of 214 calories per gram. This makes them popular in low calorie foods and some are absorbed completely.

565
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:35,170
Eliminate it unchanged and make your vegetable, whereas others can be metabolized for energy.

566
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:46,760
There are many foods that contain all sorts of added sweetness.

567
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:50,330
Some are naturally found in very small amounts.

568
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:55,400
They are using diet foods because they have similar scenes where one disappears,

569
00:58:55,700 --> 00:59:05,929
usually 75 to 90% as weak and strong, but have much less energy in low amounts.

570
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:10,520
They're thought to less than carbohydrate rich food, postprandial glucose, funk.

571
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,240
They are largely used as sweeteners on thickeners.

572
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:19,600
Some participants in the study listed here consumed more than ten grams of audios, adding.

573
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:30,660
An example of sugar alcohols is sorbitol and is found naturally in stone fruit,

574
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:39,450
which is why you can't have certain foods on the elimination phase of Low-Fodmap diet intervention often added to many things.

575
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:48,480
You can see the list in the previous slide. After being absorbed, it is metabolized by sorbitol dehydrogenase into fructose.

576
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:54,450
It requires including agonists in adenosine nucleotide.

577
00:59:55,320 --> 01:00:04,440
This can be metabolized how food is. This is the nutrition facts label.

578
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:11,030
And you can see that the sugar alcohol is listed here, but it's voluntary.

579
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:14,410
Manufacturers can specify these are the economic.

580
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:21,890
This is not meant to need to list this. She?

581
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:41,930
So. So, for example, xylitol has almost no metabolized energy and that's because there's no xylitol dehydrogenase, right?

582
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:47,150
So Sorbitol can be converted to fructose. It behaves like fructose. And you can imagine if you took 2.4 divided by four,

583
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:54,920
that suggests that the efficiency of serotonin hydrogenase is like somewhere between two one 4/4 is 60% reduction.

584
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:00,740
Is that why I like because so much like digestive distress is not absorbed at all.

585
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:09,350
So I was going to ask questions. So Sorbitol the problem with sorbitol compared to say lactose or fodmap is not that it is not.

586
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:13,870
They just need for that are by a single unit, but it is not been absorbed.

587
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:20,650
Right. So as I recall is not absorbable, right. So even though it has a structure of sugar can't get through the transport.

588
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:27,879
Not, it's not that it. Okay.

589
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,520
Cool. All right. So last couple of things I want to talk about are polysaccharides.

590
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,880
And I'm going to go to a bit of attention about ketogenic diet in a minute.

591
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:39,459
So polysaccharides, we define polysaccharides somewhat arbitrarily as having more than 11 monosaccharides subunits.

592
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:44,380
So between two and 11, it would be a little saccharin, too, would be a nice decorative cause.

593
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:50,679
You can define polysaccharides in two different ways. A common polysaccharide means it all has all the same thing, right?

594
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:54,110
So for example, starch is all sorts of polysaccharides.

595
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:57,670
Glucose I heard of a polysaccharide contains multiple different groups.

596
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:06,270
So for example happened not a whole effective but regular pectin is a hetero number because it's got to fructose and glucose, sometimes some cell gas.

597
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:09,010
And so that's one way you can think about a polysaccharide.

598
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:17,500
The other way you can think of it is sort of its chemical structure, which is like all the storage forms are carbohydrates and plants and humans.

599
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:22,080
The major forms are all human polysaccharides, so they're probably glucose, right?

600
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:27,400
So even though there's all these different possible sugars out there, it turns out there is no poly fructose.

601
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:34,900
That is a major sort of holly galactose. There could be we could have all that probably glucose, but we don't we just evolved to have policies.

602
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:42,700
And among the poly glucose is there's really three that are relevant or four that are relevant to us in this class.

603
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:45,969
So sample of pectin, cellulose and glycogen.

604
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:50,770
So this is kind of a highlight here, what they look like. We'll start with the easy one, which is either embolism of silence.

605
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:59,620
So embolism cellulose are linear chain rates, let me say, contain only one kind of one and I'll go one for this is AMLO's data one or two titles now

606
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:03,939
to highlight the difference between the two animals is almost 100% digestible multiple,

607
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:08,410
right? So if you eat a reasonable portion of Pablo's, you'll be able to convert almost 100% of that into glucose.

608
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:09,999
It'll absorb you, get a glucose, fine,

609
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:19,959
etc. cellulose which looks very similar but has a beetle make it be feeble and is completely indigestible unless you're account right.

610
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,910
So even though they look maybe kind of the same,

611
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:26,889
that one little difference completely separate something that is got a ton of energy into it compared to cellulose,

612
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:33,120
which if you calculate the add water factor for cellulose again presume you're not a cow would be exactly zero because we can all break down

613
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:39,880
cycles and that's why I was going to press and I cutting grass we're not going to get any energy from so those are the two linear chains,

614
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:45,760
cellulose and analogs and of course we consume quite a bit of both. Emil Pectin and glycogen look pretty similar.

615
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:51,670
So now what they are is primarily Alpha one for bonds, but every once in a while you'll get an apple 165, right?

616
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:56,080
So if you look at this particular sugar here, that particular glucose, it's called an apple one,

617
01:03:56,860 --> 01:04:01,149
which is represented by that bond and another one six which is represented by that.

618
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:05,530
And the same sugar can have a one off before another six. So that creates a branch form.

619
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:10,150
So every time you have an Alpha 161, you have you have a bridge point.

620
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:17,530
The distinction between the two is that apple pectin is extremely branched and glycogen is less,

621
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:20,979
but they both have branches, so functionally they look about the same.

622
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:27,380
They're branch polysaccharides again, still hold glucose, but they just have different rates of branch different amounts.

623
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:32,530
So if we consider a starch, which you may think of when you think about food starch,

624
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:37,450
most starches are about three parts Emilio Pectin two one part anyway.

625
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:41,920
So mostly the branch structure with a little bit of the straight chain.

626
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:48,190
And again, all poly glucose is all starches digestible in principle, as long as there's no enzymatic deficiencies.

627
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:51,440
But it's more effective than embolism.

628
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:57,280
But people start to bioengineer foods both chemically and sort of like producing foods and genetically engineering,

629
01:04:57,580 --> 01:05:01,990
saying we can have rice and we have more analogs and less amyloid pectin.

630
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:11,630
There's anybody want to hazard a guess of why you can kind of more you can pack more those into the same space so you can pack and blow back them.

631
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:15,280
So why would that be? Because it's linear. It's like a nice line.

632
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,909
So you can stack up while amla pecans like a cotton ball.

633
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:23,980
So you kind of, you know what I'm getting at. Like, would that make it taste good or would that make it like more?

634
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:28,110
It would make it more nutritionally dense, more nutritionally.

635
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:33,309
If you're tracking from packing glucose and what makes sense, it would also affect texture, weight, right?

636
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:37,850
So it would make the texture much more smooth. Right.

637
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:45,190
So it's actually as you have more analysis, the point is actually that is actually going to be less rapidly digestible.

638
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:47,620
It's still digestible, but it's going be digested slowly.

639
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:54,370
So if you imagine you imagine if you're trying to digest amla pectin, there's a lot of places you can start, right?

640
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:56,049
There's all these ends that you can cut from, right?

641
01:05:56,050 --> 01:06:01,150
So that means you can digest Emilio Pectin very, very quickly, which is great if you're trying to get lots of sugar into your body.

642
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:04,110
But it's not great if you're trying to avoid glucose spikes, right?

643
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:10,240
You might want to have your starch absorbed and produce glucose slower, in which case you want more linear because now there's less fruits.

644
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:14,980
So because of that, does that have a longer shelf life in question?

645
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,870
I don't know. But my guess is probably. But I don't for sure know it's stop. Starch has a pretty long shelf life.

646
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,799
I drive past very close to my shop that's been in for a while.

647
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:30,750
So I presume it's the. It could, but I think it's mostly people engineering because the idea is that it will have less of a glycemic load.

648
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:39,100
That's the. Is that sort of like why athletes want like readily available glucose?

649
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:42,520
It's more analog. Right. So that's a good example.

650
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:46,840
I remember mixing like a long time ago, but we talked about this difference in the efficiency and inefficiency.

651
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:47,020
Right.

652
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:52,960
So if you're a runner, you might walk out Samuel Beckett because the idea is you want something the consume is going to release reasonably quickly,

653
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:59,120
whereas if you're, for example, trying to consume something that has calories but doesn't give a high glucose response, you might want more apples.

654
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:06,280
So like lose certain products would be bioengineered to have more animals and animal pectin for the glycogen.

655
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,190
I forget what kind of products I didn't get to lose or not.

656
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:16,520
Like, like the diabetes friendly, like treating sort of like the shakes that they have instead of ensure something possible.

657
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:20,950
I don't know exactly what's in those, but you can imagine mostly this is what I see.

658
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:27,940
It's mostly in terms of prepared foods like pastas. And also I know there's a lot of work on bioengineered rice that has high and timeless risk.

659
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:33,219
And we can I guess I want to lose point. They won't be digested.

660
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:37,290
They will produce a lot of glucose and they are major form of the matter probably.

661
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:43,730
Okay. So in the last 10 minutes, I'm going to talk a little bit about low carbohydrate diet, right?

662
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:47,379
So I don't know, I forgot to check if anybody put this on word cloud.

663
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:53,350
But quite often that's what people think of first when they think of carbohydrate is they think like bad slash restrict slash low carb diets.

664
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:56,590
And so low carb diets are actually incredibly popular in the public.

665
01:07:56,650 --> 01:08:04,180
So the most recent survey I have said that 18% of Americans currently like this incident are on some sort of carbohydrate restriction.

666
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:09,400
Now, that could vary, of course, depending on what they mean. And so I gave a few examples of what that might mean.

667
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:14,350
The survey didn't go to that much detail beyond that, but 20% of the population on any kind of dietary pattern is, you know,

668
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:21,820
it might just be people are trying to follow the USDA guidelines and just trying to limit added sugars, and that's their form of comfort restriction.

669
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:27,710
Usually in studies, we operationalize a low carbohydrate diet as eating less than 230 grams per day.

670
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:32,410
134 would be doing this myself, 520 calories.

671
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:38,259
It's a 520 calories per day, so about a quarter of your total carbs. So that's low, right?

672
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:43,209
That MDR is about 45%. So it's about half as many carbs as the average person that would be considered low

673
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:48,190
carbohydrate ketogenic diet would generally be considered less than 50 calories,

674
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:57,849
sorry, 50 grams of carbohydrates. So it's very, very low. So that's like what like barely over one of of a Coca-Cola that is called ketogenic.

675
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:01,360
We'll talk more about what Ketogenic six means when we get to live in public and lecture.

676
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,610
But that's called ketogenic because of the presence of key to life.

677
01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:09,550
So when you restrict to that level, there's a biomarker and metabolite called ketone body, which has nothing to do with the aquifer.

678
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:14,260
And that increases as you get down to to low and in most cases, but not all.

679
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:17,650
When people restrict carbohydrates, they replace that with fat.

680
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:21,459
We'll talk about this with protein, but that's because people, whether they know it or not,

681
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:24,700
generally have a very narrow range, which they're comfortable with consuming protein.

682
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:27,850
Very few people eat less than 10%, or a few people eat more than 40%.

683
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:33,340
Or if people will tolerate a very wide range of carbohydrates and fat and metal that will work with them.

684
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:39,910
There's some data that low carbohydrate diets and especially ketogenic diet can be helpful with glycemic control,

685
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:44,830
so they can alleviate in some sense carbohydrate levels in the blood.

686
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:53,620
So fasting blood glucose be able to see. There are also concerns about elevations in blood cholesterol probably because of the increase of fat intake.

687
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:59,110
And so there is a tradeoff here. So just as an example here, people quite often ask, are they a factor?

688
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:03,849
Do they work so they don't want ketogenic diet for weight loss generally are pretty promising.

689
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:14,590
So this an analysis here salt shows RC teas where they compared ketogenic diet so under 50 grams of carbohydrates to a fat restricted.

690
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:19,489
Right. So that's what the control is about. And in that context, you can see some variation.

691
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:23,980
It's a pretty substantial variation, but the average here favors just barely significantly.

692
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:31,000
The the the benefit of of a ketogenic diet is right here.

693
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:34,600
Right. So there's some slight effect for weight loss for a ketogenic diet.

694
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:43,210
Now, whether it's sustainable long term and whether or not the cholesterol levels are a problem is is sort of TBD and depends on the person.

695
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:48,159
One thing that is very clear about this is these are studies where you're pulled

696
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:52,360
specifically to reduce your lipids or your carbohydrates to below a certain level.

697
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:55,450
Right. So that's the dietary advice they give. They give on these studies.

698
01:10:55,750 --> 01:11:01,299
There's a lot there used to be a question in the field of is there something going on beyond just appetite control?

699
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:04,450
And the answer to that is pretty conclusively no. Right?

700
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:11,079
So if you feed somebody a low carb diet or a low fat diet and you make sure they eat the same amount of calories, they lose the same amount of weight.

701
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,580
And there've been lots of studies that have shown that.

702
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:20,470
So if ketogenic diet or low carb diet or an official for some people they're beneficial to the extent that people are reducing their added calories.

703
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:27,009
And because 45% of your calories on average are coming from carbohydrates, if you can eliminate those, you've eliminated like 45% of your calories.

704
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:30,580
Right. So it's if it works, it's to the way that it reduces your carbohydrate.

705
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:36,260
And I would say probably. Any diet that works to the extent that it works, works by that same way.

706
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:43,040
So any diet, even if you don't think of it as a diet, is generally working by telling you not eat a certain day and not even think at a certain time.

707
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:47,150
And if it's causing weight loss in almost all cases, it's because it's reducing calories.

708
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:53,260
Now, some of these diets, like ketogenic diet people propose this. They said, well, it's because I don't eat, because I don't feel well, whatever.

709
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:57,680
I don't care how you feel, you're eating less calories. That's why it works, because you're eating gets more intense.

710
01:11:57,740 --> 01:12:01,850
Now I'm on a diet. Yeah, that's what I'm doing, too.

711
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:10,700
To your body. We don't have, like, long, long global studies to know on the long term how these diets affect our health, our cholesterol, everything.

712
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:14,839
So it's more like a trend that people are following. Well, there is a good amount of data.

713
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:19,540
Right. So there have been studies that have been asked are going out for two years on a ketogenic diet, which is pretty well.

714
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:23,250
Right. Like, I don't know of any sort of a vegan diet that's gone out for two years.

715
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:26,390
But you're right, it is popular.

716
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:32,329
And as you can see with many of these diets, you may not even think some of these are actual diets, but like a lot of these diets are,

717
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:37,670
I have a community around me that supports me and allows me to do these things or I just don't have these things in my pantry anymore.

718
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:43,880
So therefore I can ignore this. Like I have a friend who went on a low carb diet and he, like, made this motion like throwing away half of the stuff.

719
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:48,560
And it was easy not eat that stuff because I never eat out. And now all the stuff on the left hand side of my entry is gone.

720
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:52,610
But all I'm getting at is that there is no special magic to any of this,

721
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:57,829
that if somebody loses weight on one of these diets is because whether they know it or not, they're reducing their calorie intake.

722
01:12:57,830 --> 01:13:00,170
Right. And just happens to be in a low carb diet.

723
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:06,530
They're reducing their carbohydrate intake to 3 to 4 kilograms, which it doesn't work in, isn't always sustainable.

724
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:11,720
It varies towards from person to person. Okay. So that is all I have for this.

725
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:16,440
This is just sort of some summary slides for today. So we are going to reconvene on Monday.

726
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:20,110
We're going to continue working on it.

727
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:29,390
So those are three that you should think about if you want to talk about.

728
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:35,700
So how many students?
