1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:01:06,040
I do not know. Sorry I'm late.

2
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,880
One of those days, you know, one minute and acceptable.

3
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,990
This will be a mark on your criminal record, so.

4
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,210
Yeah, no doubt. It's going in the course.

5
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:27,240
Oh, yeah. We're very much going to be the first time.

6
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:59,090
And this would be the first time. I was watching the Your Ideas intro.

7
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,940
Oh, yeah. I thought it was so funny that moment. Wasn't there any kind of just walked out like that?

8
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,030
Somebody has. We had talked about it before we started.

9
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,430
Well, he and I had talked about before, like how we're going to hand it off.

10
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,770
There's no eyes making eye contact with the with the other leaders.

11
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,850
So they would come up. And then he walked in right at that moment.

12
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,400
So, you know, traumatic injury, good times.

13
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:38,830
All right. That's Panopto.

14
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,610
I don't know. Some of these classrooms, they made it. So it starts recording automatically and others not.

15
00:02:46,450 --> 00:03:05,320
So I'll keep doing that anyway. Do we see any indicator that's recording currently?

16
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,670
Although it says it's recording right now. Should I take its word for it?

17
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:27,110
That we're also saying means they're getting all of our free class banter on the recording and nobody wants.

18
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:37,639
Let's see, because yeah, last time it had a six minute recording I think was automatic start.

19
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,710
And then I started it. So I guess we let it ride.

20
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,200
Yeah, I think we're good. Yeah. Yeah.

21
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,020
And of course. There. All right.

22
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,630
We'll see how it goes. All right, so today, where are we?

23
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:03,870
This poor mind they were at.

24
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,250
I was able to contact my brother his birthday on a Tuesday.

25
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,520
So it's all good. Today is the 15th.

26
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,660
We're continuing with the risk assessment. So we started that last time and we finished up our routes and pathways.

27
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,569
Looking ahead next Tuesday,

28
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:27,390
we'll have Professor DeBarge come and talk about environmental regulations and then I'll talk about occupational on Thursday.

29
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:34,170
Then we'll move into some general measurement strategies and KPIs review the

30
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:40,570
following week is that Thursday and we'll talk about that more as we get closer.

31
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,660
Any questions or concerns thus far? I know I haven't been making you do that.

32
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:57,400
You guys do a lot in the class. Enjoy that time and remember that when it comes to the next unit where you start having problems and stuff,

33
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:03,580
but we'll get through it together and it'll be fine. Let's see here.

34
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:14,770
Okay. So you call last time we talked about risk assessment and the four main steps.

35
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:23,350
Right. And we do a little exercise, you know, how do you rank, risk and prioritize?

36
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,520
And it can be messy. Okay.

37
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,170
And then we started talking about two of those hazard identification and dose response,

38
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,580
which led me to have to talk a little bit about first toxicology.

39
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:43,840
And we talked about toxicology, the different types approaches to toxicity testing, the three tiers,

40
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:54,670
the concepts of acute chronic, um, threshold effects versus non threshold effects which are used for carcinogens.

41
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,540
Right. LC 5050.

42
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:06,730
And then differences by species, life stage, things like that.

43
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,380
And that's where we ended up and types of studies.

44
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,650
Okay. And that's where we are. So toxicology, you got the basics.

45
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,840
Most of you are currently in an toxicology class or.

46
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:27,040
I've taken a toxicology class before, but I thought it was worth just a quick reminder as it relates to risk assessment.

47
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,870
No, again, to plus, I don't think that was a sneeze before.

48
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,960
I always get pick up in this class. I'm not sure why. I don't know.

49
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,219
We'll see. Due study. Okay. All right.

50
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:50,570
So that leads us leads us to the other way in which you might get some hazard identification information, and that's epidemiology.

51
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:58,480
So here we're talking about humans primarily, and we look at disease frequency, disease distribution,

52
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:07,749
and then further determinants of disease is what we use epidemiology for, and we want to do that in a causal way.

53
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:13,360
So that's always a big debate in epidemiology is whether something is causal,

54
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,630
but that's what we're working toward always when we're studying these things.

55
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:25,090
In toxicology, it's usually pretty easy, right? You dose something with something and you dose an animal or something and you see what happens.

56
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,799
One comes after the other and you have a control group that you say it didn't happen.

57
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,450
So it's probably related to what we dosed it with. In epidemiology.

58
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:42,130
We don't always have that luxury. So that brings us to different types of epidemiology.

59
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:51,130
So there's many types. And one of the first ones, how we categorize this is whether or not it's experimental or observational.

60
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:57,040
So are we able to manipulate the exposure as the researchers?

61
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,850
Yes or no? And then are we able to randomize groups?

62
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,070
Yes or no? If we are on both of those, we can.

63
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:13,870
Then we have ourselves an experimental study. Obviously, if we can't, then we're left with observation.

64
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:23,170
So, yeah, you know, pharmaceuticals, randomized controlled trials for drugs, they can manipulate the dose, right.

65
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,080
And they can randomize people at positive placebo groups in terms of switching around it.

66
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:34,060
Really nice study design. You know exactly what your dose levels are and who in a control group.

67
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,580
So that's, you know, clinical trials. RC TS.

68
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:44,400
There's other intervention type studies that you can do this for community interventions and field trials.

69
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,950
So that's experimental. What if we're left with non experimental methods?

70
00:08:50,820 --> 00:09:01,950
Then we call those observational studies and we focus on environmental occupational epidemiology and it's pretty

71
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:09,090
much agreed upon that it's not ethical for us to knowingly dose people with a chemical is potentially harmful,

72
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,910
right? So we cannot control the dose and we typically cannot randomize on our own.

73
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:24,420
So we're left with observing populations for observational studies is our usual mode.

74
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:36,809
So within that we can further break that down into descriptive or analytic studies, star descriptive studies or things like a medical case study.

75
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:45,430
You know, physicians might see some unusual cases or a lot of a certain rare disease among a group of people,

76
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:50,160
and they might report on what they have in common. Your sample size is small.

77
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:58,770
It's it's usually what we consider anecdotal, but it can be very useful for sort of sounding the alarm on the potential association.

78
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,470
There's a lot of historical examples that I want one being.

79
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:17,810
Final chloride and liver cancer is one historically that started with a case study past that you might do what's called mortality,

80
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,640
proportionate mortality studies.

81
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:28,940
So this is where you're using records, medical records and maybe employment records, other sources of data to look at among people who have died.

82
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,720
Can we trace back whether they were exposed to something or not?

83
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,010
And a lot of times this is done occupationally. You know, certain job titles,

84
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:49,640
industries might be tied to an increased rate of loss of mortality overall or some sort of outcome specific cancer sites, things like that.

85
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:57,590
So that's usually, you know, relatively quick and inexpensive to do as long as you have access to records.

86
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,050
Then the question is, how good are these records?

87
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:06,320
And there's a lot of different potential for bias that you have to think about with with doing a study like that.

88
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:15,110
But it can be, again, useful, especially for furthering a hypothesis that the exposure might be related to a certain type of disease.

89
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,010
Is everyone heard of ecologic studies?

90
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:28,670
Yeah. What's an example? Can you think of an example of a logic study they've read about or know about?

91
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:38,310
One that comes to mind for me is called the Harvard Six City Study.

92
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:50,000
If you. You'd be shocked to know it involves six cities and it's an air pollution study where they have a place like Topeka, Kansas.

93
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:56,100
And compare it to or is it someplace in Ohio, Steubenville, Ohio.

94
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:02,100
You know, very industrial, less industrial places among the six cities.

95
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:08,670
And they'll look at air pollution by city, which means they use a monitor,

96
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:16,140
monitors in the city and the mortality rates for the whole population density and the poor relationships.

97
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,580
So you're not looking at associations on the individual level.

98
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,650
It's on that population level and they call it the ecologic study. So there's, you know, some pros and cons to that.

99
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,210
We dig deep into the nitty gritty of epidemiologic methods.

100
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:36,870
But again, it's it's got to be more descriptive but can be useful, you know, hypothesis,

101
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:43,420
charge, you know, a lot of cancer cluster studies, things like that start off in that manner.

102
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,040
Next one is cross-sectional survey. So I have cross-sectional in here twice.

103
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,480
I kind of differentiate a survey where you're just collecting kind of vague information at one point in time.

104
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:06,510
And I kind of separate that from something like in Heinz, where they get very detailed data on participants, even biomarker data and health data.

105
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:15,650
So I kind of split that up into something that's a little bit more general and basic versus something that's very detailed and analytical.

106
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:25,090
And the two most commonly probably referred to types of studies are your cohort study, which is a lot of times you want to do it prospectively,

107
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,970
so you're collecting data and then following a population to see if disease develops.

108
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:38,139
So at the beginning, so you can decide what your exposure or interest is and measure it very well with technological

109
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:47,340
means and see disease incidence which is very desirable and it's not the incidence of disease,

110
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,770
but being able to observe that person's prevalence, right? So that's a prospective cohort study.

111
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:58,840
There's also case control where you start with a group of people who have the disease, select a control group that does not have the disease,

112
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:07,090
and then you go back and try to determine exposure levels for individuals within each group in a systematic and unbiased manner.

113
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,850
Those are very common, and you can have different types of case control studies.

114
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,439
You know, based on the disease of interest you can test them within a cohort.

115
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,190
Study is also very common. So again, just give me a sense of not all epidemiology studies are the same.

116
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,490
There's all different types. And even within a type, there's very.

117
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,070
Levels of quality and reliability within that.

118
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:37,760
Based on all of the studies done. You may hear her.

119
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:46,230
The term health criteria. Yeah. What type of class you are not happy with?

120
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,709
They say about us. Still. Still a good soldier. Not hard enough.

121
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:57,680
Hard and fast rules. Yeah. So Hill was famous epidemiologist was part of the group that sort of.

122
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:07,810
Shine the spotlight on smoking and lung cancer, which hadn't been done in home animal studies for various reasons, right?

123
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,540
So epidemiology was really at the forefront of uncovering that relationship.

124
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:18,520
And there's other examples as well because first I suppose it's but Hill was involved in the

125
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:26,320
Cigaret Smoking and has a series of publications talking about these little criteria for causality.

126
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,890
And they're kind of just uses general guidelines. They're not kind of black and white part fest rules, but temporality.

127
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,760
You want to you want your exposure to occur before your outcome.

128
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:42,819
The strength of the association is this is getting at biologic gradients,

129
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:48,340
getting at a dose response that we've talked about consistency between studies which,

130
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:56,410
you know, is extremely common and there might be a lot of reasons for that plausibility biologically.

131
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:01,210
So that's where toxicology can support this kind of thing.

132
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:05,979
Analogy Is there another similar type of exposure where you might expect a similar type of

133
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:12,400
outcome that you can draw upon back to college again for experimental evidence to support it?

134
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:20,170
Specificity. That's where a lot of these ecologic studies kind of fails may not be specific exposure.

135
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,490
Know the study I mentioned the six city study.

136
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,650
You know it could be a lot of other things that are different between those studies that could also be explained,

137
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,090
the differences in mortality and then coherence.

138
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,400
So generally does the story make sense, all these pieces of evidence.

139
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:49,450
So these are just general guidelines that would come back to either specifically or just, you know, in our minds as we look at the association.

140
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:59,479
But another issue with observational studies is there's just huge amounts of possibility for bias,

141
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,510
error and other things that might impact your precision and overall validity of the study.

142
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:14,900
So we want to minimize this as much as we can and eliminate it where possible, which can be done with designing a good study,

143
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:21,020
knowing what kind of information we need to be collecting, looking at the right type of population for your question.

144
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:27,350
And some of it can be accounted for in the analysis phase and the confounder,

145
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,350
something that's associated with both the exposure and the outcome of interest.

146
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:38,000
So things like smoking is a lot of times that confounder between two other variables, age, things like that.

147
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,809
The population you're studying in occupational epidemiologist.

148
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:46,680
There's something called the healthy effect. Anybody? I'll stop there.

149
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:56,329
I know what that means. I feel like there's more learning before I just say the people who are willing to

150
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:00,260
get tested and talk to you about the sort of things that people feel about it,

151
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,250
or is it like that possibly? I mean, I think it can manifest in a number of ways.

152
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,290
So that might be more selection bias. So one prime example of healthy worker effect.

153
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,750
I mentioned those of mortality studies, right?

154
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:19,070
Where they have like they can look at an industry or a job title and they usually compare it with an external conflict, the general population.

155
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:25,040
And more times than not, what you'll see is a reduced risk of mortality.

156
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,360
But what that's reflecting is that people who are in the workforce are generally healthier than the

157
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:34,040
underlying general population because that includes people who can't work for various reasons.

158
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:39,740
So a well-designed study will actually, instead of using the general population for the comparison group,

159
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,540
will use a group maybe working in the same industry with a different exposure or

160
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,590
a similar industry that doesn't have the same exposure of interest to try to.

161
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:56,210
Get rid of that. That that affected isn't really what they're looking for.

162
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,820
That information by itself, it's just doing everything consistently between groups.

163
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:11,930
How you collect data, things like that. Error is also something we have to deal with, and it can be either systematic or random.

164
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,060
And those have different implications in how we're.

165
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:24,520
Estimates are interpreted, and this comes in for environmental epidemiology exposure assessments where much of this error comes into play.

166
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:30,040
You know, if you're doing a mortality study, you can generally figure out if somebody is alive or not.

167
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:36,430
But this exposure assessment component is many times where the weakest link was.

168
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,880
And it's complex, as we've been talking about. So we do our best to.

169
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,090
Maximize the quality. So again, this is just very brief overview.

170
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:56,469
This is just a from a textbook. You know, if you're charged with reviewing and assessing an occupational environmental epidemiology study,

171
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:02,710
these are the types of questions you might ask as you're analyzing that and interpreting it.

172
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:10,360
But we won't we won't get into this. But it just kind of talks about a lot of the the points I was trying to touch on here.

173
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,799
And again, that's a little more detail than we have time to get into in this course.

174
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:26,290
But just again, wanted to bring it up. So, you know, epidemiologist very important and very useful for our risk assessment makeup,

175
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:32,409
but we need to recognize that all states have their strengths and weaknesses and even within our study design.

176
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:38,840
So a prospective cohort, for example, is often considered the gold standard of environmental epidemiology.

177
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:43,480
But even to prospective cohort, studies aren't going to be of equal quality.

178
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,969
Most likely they're all different, but within that study type have their pros and cons.

179
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:57,130
So you need to critically assess all aspects like I saw in the last slide when interpreting the the value of the information you're getting.

180
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:07,160
Exposure assessment. A lot of things we're learning throughout this course are going to be very important to information epidemiology.

181
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:19,079
So coming back to risk assessment. So some contemporary challenges that we're wrestling with these days is exposure to mixtures.

182
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:27,750
So and historically they looked at one chemical at a time, decided to test it in animals one at a time and try to study of humans one at a time.

183
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,129
But we know that people aren't exposed to just one thing, usually at a time.

184
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:36,870
So, you know, trying to figure out are there interaction effects going on?

185
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:43,110
But there are some challenges to studying for sure, both in toxicology and a few different challenges.

186
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,379
But they both have a lot of those. Dose response relationship.

187
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:56,360
So I do some work and endocrine disruption and the endocrine system doesn't always operate on the, you know, a linear dose response.

188
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:04,820
So you might see some funky stuff where, you know, certain mechanisms are being triggered at certain doses but maybe maxed out or saturated.

189
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,230
So you get some different types of dose response curves potentially.

190
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:18,169
Some things are. We talked about manganese, you know, that's beneficial to a certain point and then it it's it's toxic after after a certain point.

191
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,260
So those are some other things to consider.

192
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:30,730
And then, you know, risk assessment is based on what's the most sensitive or the most health fact of most interests.

193
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:38,350
Sometimes it might be not known for during this debate process of what's being used.

194
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:44,020
One group might be able to get studies thrown out that might actually reflect a more sensitive endpoint,

195
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,340
but then won't be able to be used throughout that to set those levels.

196
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:56,800
All right. So a little discussion here. So hopefully I conveyed some of the important points of toxicology.

197
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,090
So what are some of the advantages of toxicology?

198
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:11,570
Two Risk assessment. You get more at the heart and you get more intense to determine cause for sure.

199
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:27,670
In others. You can potentially administer a dose of something and then test the results rather than epidemiology, which is more reactive.

200
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:32,860
Mm hmm. Yep. So you can modulate how much you want to know.

201
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,610
Low dose effects. You can go and use an experiment to look at a little spectrum.

202
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:41,200
I know exactly how much, you know, 100 milligrams per kilogram is going to do.

203
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:46,600
You can test that. Yeah, absolutely. You know, there's.

204
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:58,100
I know it was a long time ago. We talked about toxicology. Two days.

205
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:09,410
We'll see. You can do things on maybe a shorter time frame, you know, especially for acute studies or if you're using that tier one approach.

206
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:17,280
Be able to do things quickly. What about disadvantages of the toxicology?

207
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:25,690
Worse limitations, respect and risk. It's not human that usually you have different species so you don't know.

208
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:30,990
It doesn't necessarily reflect what's going on in people. But.

209
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,570
It doesn't really address like the exposure aspect of it. It's just.

210
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:52,270
Yeah. Sometimes they don't even really, you know, if they're dosing it with 500 milligrams per kilogram, is that an environmentally relevant dose?

211
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:55,510
Probably not. A lot of times they use doses that are much, much higher.

212
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:00,190
And there's reasons for that because I mentioned briefly last time statistical significance.

213
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:07,260
If they only have five animals per group and they only see a very small response, it's not going to be significant.

214
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,840
So they need to up that dose. So there's a tradeoff there.

215
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,850
So a lot of times if you go especially with historical toxicology literature.

216
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,719
Yeah. You're going to see doses that yeah, yeah, you see that effect.

217
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,010
But it's so much higher than somebody might encounter that it's hard to interpret that.

218
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:33,110
The other concern, this disadvantage. Yeah.

219
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:39,500
Maybe there's just more red tape because you're trying to give something rather than just study something,

220
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:45,350
if that makes sense, that there's more resources that are involved. Could be just taking a survey could be painful.

221
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:50,209
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And you know, with that so on the last slide mentioned,

222
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:55,510
mixtures actually are very difficult to study in toxicology because then you multiply each group through testing.

223
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:04,850
So that's how it happens. You know, you can see how that exponential increase in animals is.

224
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:12,919
So that brings me to my next point of that Tier three, when you're using animals and more and more animals, what's the ethical implications of that?

225
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,390
Right. So that becomes a bit sticky as well.

226
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,710
So some good thoughts and talks. What about epidemiology?

227
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:32,340
Freshwater. Some advantages of epidemiology. Sometimes you're studying relationships between exposure to the disease.

228
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:38,130
You might not have the biological knowledge yet about the mechanisms.

229
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:45,700
But that still kind of gives you some information about your public so that they can reduce exposure.

230
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:51,250
Absolutely. And epidemiology historically has kind of been left out of that hazard identification stuff.

231
00:26:51,760 --> 00:27:00,490
But I gave the example of cigarets or asbestos work, toxicology studies, one, looking at it or looking at the right thing and.

232
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:11,750
I'm on board with this. Any others to kind of flip side of talks where we said it's not we don't know if it's happening and people are right.

233
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:22,050
So this is the target species. And then depending on the study type of different levels in.

234
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:32,550
Time scale cost, some of those descriptive studies might be able to be done relatively quickly and cheaply.

235
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:39,440
At the cost of maybe. That's okay sometimes.

236
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:46,580
What are the disadvantages of epidemiology then as it relates to environmental risk assessment?

237
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,920
Could just take a minute, depending on what type of study could take really long time to have the data.

238
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,530
Right. So I mentioned a prospective cohort.

239
00:27:55,530 --> 00:28:03,060
So you say you're looking at a rare cancer that only occurs in one every 10,000 people and it might take decades to develop.

240
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,460
You're not gonna get funding to do a 50 year study of a million people, usually.

241
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:12,750
So, yeah, you have to kind of do the study within the confines of what's feasible.

242
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:20,810
Especially good studies. Negatives without talks to back in.

243
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:30,380
Hard to establish. Causality is always a tricky one, especially environmental or limited on that randomization and.

244
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:36,360
Exposure. Good. There's probably more.

245
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,550
I'm an epidemiologist. Let's see.

246
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,890
Can be really expensive and time consuming. I think that was our connection.

247
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:50,060
What else? Causality. Yeah.

248
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:58,430
Just the, the limitation of observational studies and a lot of opportunity for bias and also the things we.

249
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,310
So hopefully you guys took a few notes on that and we can move on.

250
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:11,740
It's just good to know those because that's the type of information that's used in our risk assessment process.

251
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,350
So risk assessment, a walk through the process in our backyard.

252
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,600
So first class period, I mentioned one 4000 aftershow hands.

253
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,680
Nobody really knows anything. How about now, anyway? I mean, think about it.

254
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,820
All right. So it's an organic solvent one for dioxane.

255
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:35,620
Dioxane. You may have heard of it is sometimes found in consumer products.

256
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:40,930
And there was a big deal a few years ago. It was in. It was a Johnson baby shampoo or something.

257
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:49,720
And some environmental groups got a lot of press about it, and they said they were going to change the processes to take it out.

258
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:55,240
But this was detected first in Ann Arbor in the mid 1980s.

259
00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:03,070
Turns out it was being used for 20 years prior to that at Gilman Industries facility on the west side of town.

260
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,160
They just tore down. There used to be a water tower over there.

261
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:16,780
It's called Servi. If you're familiar with the West Side, all those car dealerships, whoever until that come here, not seeing a lot of them.

262
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,910
All right. You guys might get out sometime to that side of town, but that's where it is.

263
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:29,230
Also some maps. But anyway, they're using this product or this chemical to make air filters for air sample.

264
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:34,970
That were being used all over the place, which is, of course, ironic, right,

265
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:40,840
that an environmental application of something turned into an environmental disaster here locally.

266
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:45,570
Well, so they're disclosing this and it turns out online lagoons on the property,

267
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,760
even using that lagoon as a sprinkler for a sprinkler system on the grounds.

268
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:58,440
So just kind of spreading it everywhere. Discharge off and permit amounts.

269
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:05,610
So, you know, a lot of things a lot of things went wrong with how they were using and disposing of their their chemicals.

270
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:12,030
And then after in the early eighties, they're just charging it be an injection wall,

271
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,360
which just shooting it into the ground is not always the best way to do it,

272
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,330
especially if you know the chemical properties of what you're dealing with.

273
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:27,180
So what that resulted in is the termination of in our aquifers that was discovered in the mid eighties.

274
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:34,570
There's a whole history of this, so many news articles that there's a couple of weeks, if anybody's interested.

275
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:39,339
But I mean, I see articles almost probably at least on a weekly basis.

276
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,330
If you read like I'm live in Detroit News, it's in the news a lot.

277
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:48,040
So let's see. Let's get ourselves oriented here.

278
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:59,030
This is in Arbor. And so this is giving us the map of this yellow line is a 1.4 billion.

279
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:06,500
And you have other pockets that are much higher up to above and below 85 parts per billion.

280
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,470
And. M this.

281
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:17,890
Where are we? We're probably over here somewhere right now.

282
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,370
That's the West. Yeah. This is where 94 beats.

283
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,200
Okay. Campus would be. I don't know.

284
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,329
Brother map. Yeah, we're over here somewhere. Okay, so we're safe right now.

285
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:34,990
For now. But we're talking four miles long, one mile wide.

286
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:39,850
So township and architecture banks. Yeah. What is the like?

287
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,620
See, they're all this is the maximum is above 85.

288
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:53,050
But is that just a limitation of the sampling method or 70 miles of plume's overlap in their each individual exposures that contributed to each other?

289
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:57,730
Yeah, there's they have lots of maps. This particular one, I don't know why they chose 85.

290
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:02,230
It might be because at the time that was the regulation.

291
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:07,390
Well, it's compared to that. Gotcha. You know, the questions right now.

292
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,960
Okay. So we have this groundwater contamination.

293
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,050
We need to know a little bit more about this chemical.

294
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:24,879
So this is a simple synthetic industrial chemical, completely soluble in water and highly soluble in oils and rapidly migrates in groundwater.

295
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:32,020
So it's got certain properties that make it, you know, even more of a concern as a groundwater contaminant, slow degradation.

296
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,670
So it's persistent in an environment, semi volatile.

297
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,750
So, you know, if it is on the surface, it might be evaporating and becoming a different problem.

298
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,840
But it's underground not being exposed to air.

299
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,230
So it's not vaporizing either. But if people are exposed, it's really absorbed through wells and GI tract.

300
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:56,350
So people worry about trying to absorb it. If it's in the drinking water, it gets absorbed as well.

301
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:04,180
Luckily it does not by a magnify of the food chain. So that's how it differs from, say, PCBs or similar things.

302
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:11,680
So what implications of this have for exposure? I kind argue that we're talking groundwater contaminant.

303
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,070
Maybe not so much airborne at this point.

304
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:20,930
So that's important to know as you go on to your risk assessment.

305
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,770
Specter of risk assessment components. And back to that first step, hazard identification, what health effects are caused?

306
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,950
And this is what we've already cover. You know, we're talking about what are the adverse health effects from agent of interest,

307
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:44,410
what mechanisms or mode of action are related to that adverse effect and everything you

308
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:51,730
to know about dose exposure and duration and timing associated with those effects.

309
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:56,260
So if it's acute versus chronic, that's important with how you might address the risk.

310
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:03,430
All those things that we've been talking about at this stage, we're not being super quantitative.

311
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:10,490
It's more of a descriptive analysis of. Harmful is its chemical and what harm does it cause?

312
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:18,079
And this you're going to review the data from toxicology and human health through epidemiology studies that you can get your hands on.

313
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:26,750
Sometimes you'll find that something is very poorly studied and that becomes an issue as well, like one for toxins, very example, epidemiology.

314
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,959
So it's more based. We're having to base this mostly on toxicology studies mode of action within the

315
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,200
body of possible exposure under which those adverse health effects might arise.

316
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:45,560
And then using all that information to come up with some sort of have evidence, like how likely is this to be a problem?

317
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:53,120
Again, talking about different types of toxicology or human data sources, we've already covered this.

318
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:01,290
Do that again. So step one in our hazard identification is review the data.

319
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:06,030
And with respect to how risk assessment is done here in the U.S.,

320
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:15,270
we really they really differentiate between oral versus inhalation exposure to cancer versus non cancer.

321
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:19,650
That's how we kind of separate things. For better or for worse.

322
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,330
And then, you know, so you don't see dermatology here.

323
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:28,200
Right. But what if something is primarily a dermal concern?

324
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,540
You have to work with in this framework, do the best you can, unfortunately.

325
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:44,520
Correct. So then when you collect all the data that will inform this identification process mode of action.

326
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:53,670
So. You know, what kinds of species were used to tell the animal studies and how similar the humans

327
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:59,730
with regard to the health effect and exposure and interest that dose response,

328
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:04,200
you know, not quantity of it, this stuff, we're still just kind of like that.

329
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:14,290
Do we likely see increased adverse health with increased exposure and susceptible populations?

330
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:20,740
And. General conditions. In this case, we think about Ann Arbor groundwater.

331
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:28,200
Not here. And tell you usually about cellular level versus molecular level.

332
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,970
Mode versus mechanism of action. This third step has right now application.

333
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,700
What media is most likely to accumulate? And so that's where those chemical properties come into play.

334
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:44,460
A description of how it moves in soil and groundwater is important, whether it's volatile or not.

335
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:54,360
Longevity wave for this chemical. We identify that it's persistent in the in the ground and then our role in relative exposure.

336
00:37:54,990 --> 00:38:00,650
For this case, we decided upon ingestion right of that.

337
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:09,330
Indicators of concern, persistence, bioaccumulation, and particularly high toxicity experimental.

338
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:21,420
All right. The last step for our as an indication summarize all this together as well as the cancer non-cancer potential.

339
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:26,580
Well, I guess it depends on the organization that's doing. It might be a likely more than likely.

340
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,280
Not likely. They have their own terminology.

341
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:41,270
And they'll tell you what it's based upon and hopefully what the strengths limitations are to the current information that went into that it's.

342
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:50,040
So one example is something most people operator of that air the International Agency for Research on cancer.

343
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:54,660
They have their own scheme. They're using groups one through four.

344
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,979
And then at some point they have to split off your two two.

345
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:04,470
It's confusing, but group one means that it's known to be carcinogenic, carcinogenic to humans,

346
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:13,530
to a probably carcinogenic to be possibly carcinogenic to humans, not classifiable and then probably not.

347
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:22,859
So there is no definitely not. Right. And what's funny is group four has only one chemical in it because there just has to

348
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:28,290
be tons of testing done on something that repeatedly shows no carcinogenic effects.

349
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:34,290
So nobody probably wants to invest in that. Right. So it's kind of interesting to know that there's only one thing there.

350
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:41,460
And you see there's a lot of individual chemicals, but this particular graphic shows a lot of just kind of general stuff.

351
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:48,179
I think I include some of this and one of the problems that's later the whole field interact with this data.

352
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:54,240
But, you know, smoking, solar radiation, alcohol and processed meats.

353
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,600
Oops. Yeah, other stuff here.

354
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:03,780
Different types of occupations, gasoline fumes, exhaust stuff.

355
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:09,030
So that's just one way in which a certain organization does this and they have

356
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:13,950
their own documentation of what they use and how they come to these conclusions.

357
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:19,079
And that's going to be different from EPA, different from some of the other agencies.

358
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:26,690
We'll talk about this. Just know they all have their own intricacies and that's just the U.S., I guess IIRC isn't.

359
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,360
But then if you go to Europe, they do things much differently and so on and so forth.

360
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,650
All right, so back to our one four dioxane.

361
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:42,600
So here, if we're talking about environmental contamination involving, you know, air or groundwater, we're going to check with the EPA.

362
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,750
And they have something called the Integrated Risk Information System or IRIS.

363
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:51,720
And they'll have a summary, a weight of evidence, characterization.

364
00:40:52,290 --> 00:41:01,380
So their weight of evidence narrative says likely to be carcinogenic to humans, and they'll tell us what it's based on,

365
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:06,480
based on the following findings Inadequate evidence for person injured in the city of humans.

366
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:12,660
Like I said, there's I don't recall the company had much human data for this particular

367
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:21,600
chemical and then sufficient evidence in animals and that's based on groups,

368
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:29,550
period. The fine print here, hepatic tumors in multiple species, three strains of rats, two strains of mouse and guinea pigs.

369
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,530
So that's pretty consistent across the across species. So that's why they seem likely.

370
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:42,410
In humans and sufficient in animals. There's other types there as well.

371
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:44,719
Okay.

372
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:56,060
So that's that's a modification for our purposes to give you the background and then apply that to this particular payment and exposure assessment.

373
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:06,709
That's what this class is really focused on. So we know it's identification and evaluation of exposure in this context for risk assessment,

374
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:10,190
a lot of times we're talking about at this stage, we're looking at population wide.

375
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:18,170
What's the distribution of exposures? We know we can tie that to the dose response to look at what the risk might be to a population.

376
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,030
So here for exposure, you're looking at the composition and size of that population of interest.

377
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:30,320
So this might be, in our case, the West Side, but not really people's magnitude, frequency and duration of exposure.

378
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:37,820
All the stuff we've been talking about and you talk about Thrustmaster and we use that information to estimate population dose.

379
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:46,850
So to our one four dioxane example, how many people will be exposed to them for dioxin, high priority, get most of away.

380
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:57,380
What do we think there's more drinking water. You know, their concerns show swimming, swimming, showering, going out to the water sources.

381
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,810
Anything else that hasn't been mentioned?

382
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:10,340
If it gets to the roots of plants and you have a home garden threat, if you're using that water to water plants, that could be a concern.

383
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:15,620
Think back to last week's what we talked about earlier. Well, the flooding.

384
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:22,610
Flooding, would you would you definitely be concerned about kids playing in the dirt?

385
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:28,280
We don't know. Right. We haven't really addressed it. So that might be something to keep in the back of our minds.

386
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:32,830
And there's other detailed scenarios that we can talk.

387
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:43,969
So yeah, we're talking about particularly ingestion of of that water and potentially the soil or other contact for showering,

388
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:48,730
bathing and but the primary pathway people need water to live.

389
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:52,370
So we're talking about ingestion of to contaminate water.

390
00:43:53,300 --> 00:44:01,640
Risk assessment historically has been based on the 70 kilogram male if you see this guy walking around high five.

391
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:07,880
But you know, to estimate a two liters per day of water ingestion so that can be useful.

392
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:14,270
But as we've talked about, there's a distribution with that even among the 70 kilogram male children,

393
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:18,980
other other factors that may result in higher or lower intake.

394
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:28,549
Is it easy for the city to clean drinking water or welcome?

395
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:41,680
Then we'll touch on that at the end. Good question. Stay tuned, stay tuned and beware if you're buying a house on the west side of.

396
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:48,730
So this is just returning some of the stuff you talk about sort of estimating dose like.

397
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:58,080
Describe before. So concentration and take rate, exposure, duration and bioavailability.

398
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:04,530
So, you know, we've done examples with there. I'm not going to spend a lot more time on that.

399
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,520
Just know for risk assessment.

400
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:17,280
You know, we talk about there's usually a body weight component to that and then they might calculate differently for non carcinogens and carcinogens.

401
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,690
So non carcinogens is the average daily dose that we talked about last week.

402
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:32,670
We might also have a. Filtration and then for carcinogens, you're just using that because it's a chronic health effect that takes time to develop.

403
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:38,580
They do it over a 70 year lifespan. So here we're talking about the 70 kilogram.

404
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:43,110
Now he's been exposed for 70 years and that's how they come up with this calculation.

405
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:54,559
All right. So that moves us to our dose response assessment. And we talked about this a little bit last time.

406
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:04,160
We talked about the noise, the elbow, ADL. EPA uses something sometimes called the benchmark dose, which is a similar concept.

407
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:09,930
In this graphic, they're using a benchmark dose of 10% above background.

408
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:16,680
Whenever that dose response curve, instead of relying on maybe statistical significance, they're saying that.

409
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:23,770
Observable effects above 10% response is considering it to be significant.

410
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:31,180
So that's what we're going to consider. And that's maybe I'm going to defer for now.

411
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:36,740
Carcinogens versus non carcinogens. How that's treated.

412
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:40,550
So non carcinogens again usually a threshold assumption.

413
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:50,970
For us, carcinogens is the non threshold which then they use the data to come up with a smoke factor.

414
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:55,889
So non carcinogens you're going, you know you're fine, you're fine.

415
00:46:55,890 --> 00:47:01,860
You find it as exposure increases until you're not fine. That's when you have that threshold for non carcinogens.

416
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:09,510
It's that probability goes up linear linearly with the increased exposure.

417
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:13,409
So the probability of individual getting cancer or the amount of cancer in a

418
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:18,210
population is going to go up incrementally with increases with no threshold.

419
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:25,970
And that's where the slope vectors. So think of a graph and a slope that is used to calculate things.

420
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:31,080
So back to the dioxin here. So we already talked about likely carcinogenic.

421
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:38,330
And then we look down here and they come up and we're interested in world exposure and inhalation, right?

422
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:50,020
That we determined from our exposure assessment step and our slope factor here is listed as one times ten to the negative one three mg kg day grade.

423
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,280
Right there. All set. What's that mean?

424
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:59,400
Well, that means you have to read. Hopefully, I'll tell you what that means.

425
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:08,970
And here it says, that's a log logistic model with linear extrapolation from the point of departure associated with 50% extra cancer risk.

426
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:13,560
So it gives you something to work with. Then you can play with these numbers with some fancy math.

427
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:21,170
To to come up with. And then they have something called drinking water users.

428
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:27,790
But anyway, so this is a slope factor is a certain percentage increase in cancer risk with additional

429
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:33,070
exposure in this case of point one milligram per kilogram data over a seven year lifetime.

430
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:37,840
So that's then useful for future calculations.

431
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:43,830
And those calculations are the risk characterization step.

432
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,930
So for risk characterization, you're combining that as our identification because that stuff,

433
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:58,110
you decided it was hazardous enough to warrant doing an exposure and a dose response.

434
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:03,380
So now you're going to take those and combine it to come up with your.

435
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:12,990
Your risk estimates. And this could be due to individuals and or populations of individuals is always difficult to do.

436
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:21,090
And that's what litigation is always trying to get at. And it's it's it's tricky, but in population wide, it makes more sense.

437
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:28,850
We can say for a given increase in exposure. You can expect from this much more business based on this information.

438
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:34,940
And that information is then given to decision makers who may decide to do something,

439
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:38,750
or a lot of times they say it's too expensive, talk about it later.

440
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:48,470
We've got bigger problems. So in general, our approach to risk characterization is, is approach to prioritization stuff.

441
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:52,430
So again, this kind of leading to stuff we've talked about.

442
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:56,090
So on the Y axis here, we have health estimates.

443
00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:04,810
So, you know, basically figuring out how toxic of a chemical is, is that we're talking about is it highly toxic or kind of toxic?

444
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:11,810
And then left to right, we're talking about how much of the population is exposed or how highly exposed are they?

445
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:19,820
And if it's you know, if it's something that's fairly low toxicity and not very many people are very highly exposed, it's going to be low priority.

446
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:28,280
Right. But hopefully, if you have something that's highly exposure is very widespread and has been shown to be highly toxic,

447
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:38,720
that's that's where you really want to take action quickly. And that's this is a fancy way of saying that.

448
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:52,110
With some. You know, speaking more generally, this threshold effect or injuries that you're talking about or financial risk even or cancer risk,

449
00:50:52,740 --> 00:51:00,030
a lot of times in environmental settings, they'll use cancer risk of one in a million as sort of the the goal.

450
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,959
Anything above that might be deemed acceptable.

451
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:11,100
And that's where they would want to get the regulation set to where that is at one in a million for once.

452
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:17,400
Occupationally, as we'll see next week.

453
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,570
It's much, much higher risk acceptance.

454
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:25,890
Talk about one in $10,000 worth.

455
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:34,709
You said there are three levels. Hopefully instilled in you guys so far that there's a lot of variability with all this,

456
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:41,400
right, between people, even within people over time, between people, between populations.

457
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:48,630
Motive, route of exposure, pathways, exposure, lots of variability, other stuff.

458
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:54,480
And hopefully the risk assessment or at least account for that in some of their calculations.

459
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:07,320
Same with uncertainty. Sometimes we don't know what we don't know, and that is very detrimental to a risk assessment or any sort of research.

460
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,910
But you want to think about things like how well measured are the exposures?

461
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:22,110
How well-defined are the models? And this is from the reading that I posted, if you are curious to learn more about some of these details,

462
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:27,450
but, you know, some sources of uncertainty and exposure assessment stuff, that's great nonfiction stuff.

463
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:35,480
And so sometimes you might be surprised at what kind of information they're relying on in these various steps and how much uncertainty that.

464
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:43,410
Well, yes, sometimes they'll build in uncertainty factors in some of these calculations of this that the standards that we'll talk about next week,

465
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:49,860
but maybe not appropriately based on. I expect more conservative.

466
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:07,159
Just some more. Her comments on uncertainty and different steps in the risk assessment process and different approaches to it,

467
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,720
and how much data is needed to to really improve search.

468
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:19,340
Okay. We we'll come back to that. So risk assessment, back yard risk.

469
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:32,800
His characterizations, too. So we've revealed all this so far, and we went to a slope factor, but that doesn't really give us something usable.

470
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:40,330
So with some more fancy calculation, they're able to put it into real terms here based on a lot of assumptions,

471
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:44,470
right, on how much people, how much water people drain, etc., etc.

472
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:52,230
But here they're saying, you know, for a one in 10,000 increase risk of cancer,

473
00:53:52,990 --> 00:54:01,150
35 micrograms per liter, parts per billion, one in 100,000, 3.5 and one in 1,000,000.35.

474
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:07,090
So we said environmentally, we really usually shoot for one in a million.

475
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:13,990
And that plume we showed earlier, which you may remember, what kind of level we're talking about.

476
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,899
85. Yeah, we had a circle at one part 4000000001 to 85.

477
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:23,170
So that's that's a bit one through five.

478
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:27,400
Right. So that's that's concerning.

479
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:38,030
Okay. So that was our risk evaluation where we did these four steps on the left hand side identification dose response,

480
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:45,980
exposure assessment, leading to the risk characterization. But we do then once that carry risk is characterized, you go into risk management.

481
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,720
This is where leadership counts. You know, what kind of institution are you dealing with?

482
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:56,040
The city level, county level state. Country world.

483
00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:06,630
This is where it gets very political, has a lot to do with money and prioritization and can be pretty frustrating, to be honest with you.

484
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:12,060
And we'll talk about that more next week. Also want to talk about risk communication.

485
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:12,660
So.

486
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:25,660
This is very important, too, because public opinion, public sentiment can really motivate the people who may be elected that can make these decisions.

487
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,780
And just knowing what the hazards and this obviously bleeds into.

488
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:39,230
Environmental justice. And some of those issues were certain. Ann Arbor, you know, highly educated population for the most part.

489
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:43,850
That's why I see it in the news every week, is they want to go right there on top of it.

490
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:51,950
They have people talking at every city council meeting, really pushing this issue, writing letters to people, politicians all the time.

491
00:55:52,130 --> 00:56:00,590
So, you know, keep that in mind as well. So risk management.

492
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:04,940
So what are some of the ways we can manage the risk associated with that dioxane?

493
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:15,250
The question of, you know, can we clean the water has come up. And we'll touch on controls throughout later in the semester as well.

494
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:22,659
But usually there's a hierarchy and in this case, you know, a politics and policy level stuff would be probably the most effective.

495
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:30,940
Right? Beyond that, you have engineering controls to either prevent the the contamination from happening or from spreading.

496
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:36,050
In this case. It's too late to prevent it from happening.

497
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:41,549
So can you clean the water with all the technological means, administrative controls?

498
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:48,450
That an example here and we'll get more examples when you get to occupation would be just moving everybody out of the area.

499
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:59,100
As we'll see, they have shut off a lot of wells, stuff like that to kind of make decisions administratively to prevent exposure.

500
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:04,660
And then the last line of defense is personal protective equipment, which in this case is probably not feasible.

501
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:10,950
Right. You don't want people on one side of an arbor walking around in these hazmat suits or anything like that.

502
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:18,160
So not really feasible in this scenario. So let's talk about what's been done.

503
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:23,080
And like I said, there's new information coming out all the time, so it's kind of hard to keep up with.

504
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:25,060
So some of this might be a little bit dated.

505
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:35,020
But since 1997, they have been trying to clean the groundwater, and Gelman had to pay a lot of money, incidentally.

506
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:41,110
Charles Cullen There's also a lot of you about School of Public Health for this department.

507
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:44,470
Like I said, he made air filters for sampling equipment.

508
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:50,320
But anyway, that's not really, I guess, relevant, but not cool.

509
00:57:51,640 --> 00:58:00,640
So you have to pay a bunch of money and recover about £110,000 of this chemical.

510
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:08,080
However, you know, that's only one eighth of what was discharged and there's a certain rate at which they can treat it.

511
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:16,239
And it's not getting all the way clean. They're getting it, you know, down from 85 or 100 per year or whatever the peaks were.

512
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:20,500
But it's still discharging at eight, which is still higher than probably what we want.

513
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:31,750
So what else we have here? The other concern, as we should, all these maps is that surface water was also used for a lot of people.

514
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:36,100
Barton Pond, where they have a dam from the shore on the river from Barton Pond.

515
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:41,440
And they're saying, you know, once it reaches there, it's going to be a much more widespread problem.

516
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:46,120
So that's why they're really monitoring the kind of this plume through the through the ground.

517
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:49,950
And then there are some technical feasibility concerns.

518
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:56,890
Like if you look at the history for a while, like the states method only had a limited detection of one per billion.

519
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:01,520
They couldn't even if you believe that they were going to detect. Which limits the mapping.

520
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:06,360
So that's probably where that first map had one PPV ring on it.

521
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:09,330
But in any event, it's very expensive.

522
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:18,870
So costs for water treatment, we're talking $30 million plus some additional infrastructure to make it more effective at cleaning.

523
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:32,400
Like I said, here's a link to some more recent maps that they do this as they get more well testing, they'll map it on there with these rings.

524
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:37,710
What kind of PPV they're looking at? You see some, you know, in the hundreds.

525
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:43,890
Again, problematic. This is a bigger map. So, you know, we're here. So here's.

526
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:51,070
Barton Pines and that form. They don't want it to reach this this water body.

527
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:03,980
So the west side of town, a lot of people were operating on private wells also in addition to city water.

528
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:09,360
So they had to go through and test them all and shut down the ones that were

529
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,240
contaminated because they didn't have the means to clean it for those people.

530
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:17,250
So then there's a lot of cost in bring those people on to municipal water, right?

531
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:22,440
So there's cost 134 of those to date.

532
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:27,720
220 are regularly monitored because it is mobile, it's moving.

533
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:40,890
And even I was just looking yesterday and just this year they've detected on the north side saw previously undetected Wells Fargo tested for it.

534
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,530
Part of that might be more sensitive methods, but also probably reflects movement of this pool.

535
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:51,870
So with that, with this mapping,

536
01:00:51,870 --> 01:01:00,360
they've made it illegal to extract groundwater from certain zones through private wells or other things that people want.

537
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:10,640
So that can result in inconvenience. You know, any new construction, the real estate market all has to acknowledge this and work around it.

538
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:19,060
Things like that continues to spread. And they're saying, you know, based on injury estimates, this is where the environmental engineers are involved.

539
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:25,820
Possible travel time. Barton Pond could be, you know, you work from 5 to 400 years.

540
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:30,680
Pretty precise. Like I said, there's a lot of estimates in here.

541
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:35,780
Once you compound that uncertainty and variability, you get some pretty wide bounce around it.

542
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:42,300
So, you know. It's it's a problem and it's trying to move.

543
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:50,260
It's just, you know, you have to have very models in a complex geology like this.

544
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:56,960
You know, that's where some of this uncertainty comes around. Yeah, it's underground so we can't see it.

545
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,750
The sensing equipment and stuff to get their best guess.

546
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,770
Geologists started geology.

547
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:08,890
Yeah. I have not.

548
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:14,780
So I know it's complicated to to model what's moving if you don't know exactly what's done.

549
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:21,520
So we thought that we said, you know, ingestions are our main concern.

550
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:24,740
However, there is something called vapor intrusion.

551
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:30,350
So here in Michigan, a lot of people have basements. I'm not from here originally.

552
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:35,000
I never heard the term Michigan basement before. And we heard that term.

553
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:40,349
People use it a lot. I think it's kind of a in between a crawlspace in the basement.

554
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:44,090
It's a very shallow basement, but you can do stuff down there.

555
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:52,250
You know, I know people have a bedroom or anything. But anyway, what this is, is you have a contamination plume like we're talking about.

556
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:58,040
And if it comes into contact with the building envelope, we talked about it as semi volatile.

557
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:06,350
So if it's pushing up against this and you have cracks or other things in your in your foundation,

558
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:12,740
you might get some politicization of that into the home because you have different pressure differences and things like that.

559
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:19,670
So that's another concern. So inhalation can't fully be ruled out.

560
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:26,360
So they did do some testing fairly recently and and found that, you know, it was being detected in certain locations,

561
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:33,350
but it didn't based on the inhalation risk assessment for this chemical, it didn't trigger those things.

562
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:40,580
Now we'd have to look into how well defined the inhalation toxicology is from this chemical versus ingestion.

563
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:46,900
A lot of times inhalation is not as well done for animals because it's not easy to get animals to breathe.

564
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:50,430
A specific amount of you have to do it in a chamber, all the stuff.

565
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:55,250
So just know again below the surface you might have some issues there.

566
01:03:55,730 --> 01:04:00,330
So that's not still not thought to be a major threat of exposure.

567
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:07,920
Okay. So. We mentioned that 85.

568
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:18,150
That's where this comes from. So. Sort of a weird, convoluted history of what the state thought was an acceptable level of warning for dioxin.

569
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:25,650
So pretty 1995, it was three and then somehow magically up to 77.

570
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:30,990
And then when they start making some of these maps, maybe went to 85.

571
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:38,790
So it's like which threat was driving? Is it actually the toxic? Toxic our hazard identification risk assessment process or kind of what we can?

572
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:45,979
Process and deal with and many others. 85. So that might be relevant to that.

573
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:50,540
Now, we saw the floor if it was made in that time period, which it probably was.

574
01:04:50,870 --> 01:05:00,200
But luckily in 2016, um, GQ, which is now called Eglee, did reduce that to 7.2.

575
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:04,549
We could look into the documentation of where that number comes from,

576
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:13,400
but I'm assuming it also includes some technological feasibility considerations, not just purely health based.

577
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:19,460
And it is noted that many other states have a standard for this at one point.

578
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:22,880
So there's a lot of politics going on, it seems.

579
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:30,600
After some of this, they have up their activity on on other temples.

580
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:33,959
So they they've come out with the recent stuff on fast in the last couple of years

581
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:40,500
as well given the huge number of contaminated water ways that have been detected.

582
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:48,720
All right. So, you know, continue to talk about this risk management and how do we deal with this.

583
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:53,310
An example argument is good. The Ann Arbor Water Treatment plant, just remove it.

584
01:05:54,750 --> 01:06:01,290
There was a plant upgrade for 90 million that was, you know, not fully for this.

585
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:04,920
But they did make some inclusions there for treatment.

586
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:17,100
It could remove about 40 to 70%. Again, if you're at hundreds of PPV and EPS and 0.35 is where you want to be, that's maybe not not what we want,

587
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:23,939
but you also need to add additional technologies for that to be more effective,

588
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:29,580
which would cost 30 million plus several million a year in the U.S. So you balance that with,

589
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:34,320
you know, what they're talking about in Flint, just connecting to Detroit's water.

590
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:40,110
What's the tradeoff there? That's going to be a huge infrastructure investment as well.

591
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:50,990
So they're trying to weigh all these different options. Among all this arguing and politics, it's it's pretty messy.

592
01:06:54,540 --> 01:07:00,660
So this is an ongoing debate over, you know, what's a manageable risk, what are we willing to accept, who's responsible?

593
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:10,350
And like I said, there's updates all the time. So now they're trying to get it to be a national cleanup effort.

594
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:17,639
So that's where Superfund is a law that we'll be talked about on Tuesday where it's supposed to be polluter

595
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:24,950
pays for these big environmental disaster type things don't always look that way because we're bankrupt.

596
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:38,460
So but what that does, there is a fund, you know, through a combination of corporate and national public funds to do so.

597
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:42,380
Yeah, there was never a lawsuit I think I missed.

598
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:45,630
Yeah, there is. There is many lawsuits against. Against Gelman. Yeah.

599
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:49,710
Okay. And they're still they are still managing the terms of their.

600
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:53,220
Oh, I see. You know what's acceptable. Okay.

601
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:57,730
Things like that. I guess we still have to look at how those. That company no longer exist.

602
01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:01,410
He passed away a couple of years ago. So, you know, it gets tricky.

603
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:06,570
Sure. But how feasible is adding this to the Superfund list?

604
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:10,670
Right. So that's one thing that's going to happen is that's what they're trying to do. So it's called the national priority list.

605
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:14,490
So they've made the request, the states made the request. It takes three years to just assess it.

606
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:19,110
They're in the process of that. They've given they'll give it a score once they measure how much is there?

607
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:26,340
Do some of the first assessment process and then decide whether or not it makes that national priority list and whether to list the Superfund site,

608
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:33,610
which then they come up with a plan to remediate. So yeah, one process was a process.

609
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:42,690
Great question. Well, if you can imagine, there's a lot of contaminated sites in the country.

610
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:49,680
So they have a whole series of engineers come on site and do a bunch of testing.

611
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:54,960
They do a lot of the calculations we add against other sites.

612
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:59,790
To see what makes it on a party. What's three years?

613
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:07,480
Yeah. Why three years? I don't know. That'll be interesting for us to dig into.

614
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:10,910
I'm just wondering, like,

615
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:22,300
I don't even know how many of the same story I heard over and over and this and seems to Gelman did they say did they think that.

616
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:29,260
I'm just I always wonder what the motivation is like. Do they think that it's okay to just pump the body chemicals into the ground?

617
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:35,140
Yeah. I mean, that was before any toxicity studies and whatnot and they just didn't know, like, you know, our first lecture.

618
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:39,280
There's thousands of chemicals out there that just haven't been tested yet, but people are allowed to use them.

619
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:47,330
And, you know. I'm guessing it's because it was the cheapest way to get rid of it and they had no idea it was harmful.

620
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:56,210
I know it's just a solid we use in our processes and back then that's probably the industry standard for a lot of places, unfortunately.

621
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:01,180
Let's just. Do whatever they could to get off their hands.

622
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:06,999
It's like government doesn't exist anymore. It was born out by Paul.

623
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,150
Paul, and now it's something else. And I saw a recent article last week.

624
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:14,420
They tore down the water tower, I think, to be out there.

625
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:18,820
It's on Wagner Road right there by Jackson.

626
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:23,500
Yeah. I don't know what it's called now. So there's like a new church right there now.

627
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:27,340
I mean, that happens. Would they just follow the money to the land?

628
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:29,859
Yeah. I mean, there's so many lawyers involved in that point.

629
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:35,439
I'm not exactly sure how that works, but yeah, I would think, you know, like I said, bankruptcy.

630
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:39,240
And how does that carry over to liability? That's beyond my.

631
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:48,069
It's beyond my knowledge. So just, you know, with some of these links have been posted, you can get a fuller picture of this.

632
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:53,390
But yeah, it's it's been going on a long time and probably it looks like we'll continue to have to go on.

633
01:10:53,440 --> 01:11:00,970
But, you know, fortunately, they were able to close up all those private wells that bring in city water that's that's cleaner.

634
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:05,460
So that immediate risk hopefully is lower. But it's it's not.

635
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:14,950
Where you want to be. I know a lot of people live over there and, you know, they know once they're there, they follow along.

636
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:21,170
You know, they're told their water's fine. Yeah. It's not ideal.

637
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:31,400
Okay. Future directions in risk assessment. So kind of like I was trained with toxic toxicology and epidemiology, you know, so talking out,

638
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,660
you know, just studying one endpoint, make sure you're finding that whole sense of the endpoint.

639
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:41,240
Multiple sources, pathways of exposure and multiple routes of exposure.

640
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:46,100
Involving communities in the decision making process.

641
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:55,530
Specific responses, not a one size fits all, and then a holistic reduction of risk.

642
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:04,820
That's going to have to come next year. And prioritization. So we've been talking a lot about us.

643
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:11,930
Europe. Does it different the past 15 years or so they've been launching this reach.

644
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:16,370
Was it legislation? Nobody here from Europe is there.

645
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:22,319
But it's kind of a different way.

646
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:27,870
Instead of, you know, innocent until proven guilty for a chemical, they're supposed to be up front before it's approved.

647
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:37,980
Do all the testing beforehand. So there's a lot more testing, a lot more responsibility on the manufacturers and users of the chemicals.

648
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,580
And we'll touch on this again later in the semester, folks, when we bring up.

649
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:47,170
U.S. versus versus other countries can be quicker.

650
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:52,150
And I just want to end once again with the precautionary principle. So.

651
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:56,170
Again. Don't wait until you have perfect information.

652
01:12:56,170 --> 01:13:05,920
If you think something may be harmful, do what you can now because there's been way too many examples where hazards linger on too long,

653
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,500
when something could have been done earlier and the individual lives they impacted.

654
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:13,810
So you just have to learn more for that where possible.

655
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:20,190
Any other questions for today? That's more resources there.

656
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:26,040
All right. So, again. See you guys on Tuesday.

657
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:29,490
And let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

658
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:46,030
Okay. And my second question today, I'm going to go back to that thing since I want to be high and low at the same age.

659
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:50,710
I think he's going to go backwards. Yeah.

660
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:54,510
Yeah. Get to the ram. Utilize.

661
01:13:56,980 --> 01:14:00,110
You know you're out of practice.

662
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:05,000
Yeah. Is it a resume? Yeah. Okay. It's harsh.

663
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:11,930
Oh, I get it. I know. If you like. Yeah.

664
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:17,270
What do you got, a. You know, I have, like, one dedicated monitor.

665
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:22,790
That's great. Yeah. Yeah, I like.

666
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:26,090
I don't know. I just. Yeah.

667
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:30,590
I can't play a baseball game. Got to see that.

668
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:34,100
You got to see it as a very defensive practice.

669
01:14:37,730 --> 01:14:42,410
Okay. I tried it very closely with you.

670
01:14:42,450 --> 01:14:50,540
Yeah. I mean, again, thank you for taking such a pessimistic stance.

671
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:55,880
That's far enough. Yeah, it's. It's tough. Yeah, for sure.

672
01:14:57,260 --> 01:15:00,410
Yeah. Saying environmental science, undergrad and continuing on.

673
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:09,800
It's never ending. If only there's more money and certainly greater people from the accommodation.

674
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:17,740
Do you want us to spend? More or less? Why can't you serve time?

675
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,550
I read when you just.

676
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:25,120
Yeah. And I'm going to get everything the see.

677
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:30,680
But it's, it's hard because like just a classroom.

678
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:33,889
Like I was saying,

679
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:40,790
you know what you're thinking sometimes and against like crazy having to like hopefully that got it done

680
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:48,580
and I said sure is that is that is that what I'm like in all my recordings and everything like that?

681
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:56,190
Like I was, I was like I might have them turn off the lights for this is not if you see upstairs,

682
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:02,030
you know what's happening, maybe it goes all the way so you can talk in the hallway or something if you don't.

683
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:18,470
Yeah, firmly. Everybody listens to serious business from eye contact, you know?

684
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:35,730
Yeah. Know, a snow tire for that when it snows.

685
01:16:35,760 --> 01:17:07,570
Oh, yeah. It's an off road, all terrain obstacle. Yeah.

686
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:25,100
Yeah. Um, just. All.

687
01:17:56,910 --> 01:18:06,280
And I said, you know. Okay.

688
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:10,940
Keep that in mind. No. Thanks for letting me know.

689
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:17,820
I don't know if that's still. So just be aware.

690
01:18:18,480 --> 01:19:15,070
Okay. Thanks. Yeah.

691
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:25,110

694
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:41,580

695
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:57,760
Oh, my goodness. Um, nothing.

696
01:19:57,910 --> 01:20:00,790
Honestly, nothing removed Tanner for this summer, and that's about it.
