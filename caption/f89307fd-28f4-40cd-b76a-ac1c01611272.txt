00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, everybody. And our last video, we introduced the concept of selection bias in epidemiologic studies.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Today, we're going to see how our modern definition,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
structural definition of selection bias helps us resolve a historical paradox called the birthweight paradox.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The consensus that smoking caused lung cancer is by far the most well-known example of drawing causal inference from observational data.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Which is what epidemiologists do.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The issue was hotly contested in the late 1950s and early 60s, but following the surgeon general's report in 1963, the debate was largely settled.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
One holdout critic was a researcher named Jacob Yerushalmy. In 1971,

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Jacob Yerushalmy published a paper comparing infant mortality rates of low birth weight babies born to mothers who smoked

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
during pregnancy to infant mortality rates of low birth weight babies whose mothers did not smoke during pregnancy.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
A number of studies up to that point had found that mothers who smoke during pregnancy were more likely to give birth to low birth weight babies.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
However, the results in Yerushalmy paper presented a paradox.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
He found that low birth weight babies born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy actually had lower infant

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
mortality rates when compared to low birth weight babies who are born to mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
How could this be? The smoking somehow protect the most vulnerable babies from dying?

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It doesn't make sense based on what we know about smoking, both back then and now.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yerushalmy presented his analysis as a cautionary tale when drawing causal inference from observational data.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
How can we reconcile these findings, given our knowledge about bias ib epidemiologic studies?

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's start by drawing a DAG representing our study question.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We're trying to determine whether or not smoking during pregnancy causes infant mortality. So let's draw those.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
An important third variable to draw is low birthweight.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Recall that index when we condition on a variable, we draw a box around it.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And indeed, Yerushalmy conditioned on low birth weight. In his analysis, because he restricted only to low birth weight babies.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So let's draw a box around low birthweight. We also know that smoking during pregnancy causes low birth weight.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So let's draw an arrow from mom smokes during pregnancy to low birth weight.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now, one explanation of the results in Yerushalmy's paper is that smoking has a protective effect on infant mortality,

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
but based on our DAG, why would conditioning on low birth weight make a difference?

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It doesn't make sense, both from a causal inference point of view and based on what we know about smoking.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So let's try something else. We know that smoking is certainly not the only cause of low birth weight.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let's consider poor prenatal nutrition as a cause of low birth weight.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Let's also consider poor prenatal nutrition as a cause for mortality.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Does this DAG shed light on a paradox presented in Yerushalmy's paper?

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's remember that when two variables share a common effect called a collider.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
In this case, low birth weight, we open up a non causal statistical association between those two variables.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
In this case, mom smokes during pregnancy and infant mortality.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Restriction, to low birth weight babies, as Yerushalmy did effectively conditions on a collider.

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Between smoking and poor prenatal nutrition.

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This opens up a non causal pathway between smoking through low birth weight and poor prenatal nutrition to infant mortality.

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But in the opposite direction, as we would expect.

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's remember the structural definition of selection bias as bias due to conditioning on a collider.

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And that's exactly what's happening here. Logically, if we know an infant is a low birth weight and that infant's mom did not smoke during pregnancy,

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
then something had to cause the low birth weight other than smoking.

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:21,000
In this case, those infants would be more likely to have had poor prenatal nutrition and thus would be more likely to die in infancy,

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
inducing a negative association between smoking and infant mortality.

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Now, we can never know that this is the true structure of the bias present in  Yerushalmy's study.

45
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Because there are many causes of low birth weight that we don't have information on.

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But this example makes sense given what we know about selection bias.

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And it is a relatively straightforward historical example of the perils of selection, bias and arbitrary restriction of subjects in a study.

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If we wanted to know the effects of mothers smoking during pregnancy on infant mortality,

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
why would we want to restrict our analysis only to low birth weight babies?

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Unfortunately, this type of arbitrary subgroup analysis is still common today,

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and it is often a sign that investigators are playing around with the data until they find something interesting.

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Given your new knowledge of selection bias, you're better equipped to read studies with a critical eye.

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If you see inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in the study,

54
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
look for specific reasons why and what's being done about it and how that restriction or lost a follow up could have effects on the results.

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If you want to know more about this example, I encourage you to read two papers on this topic posted on canvas.

56
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
One is the original study published by Yerushalmy. And another is a causal explanation of the bias in that study by Tyler Vanderweele.

57
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This example was highly adapted from a book called The Book of Why by Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie.

58
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I highly recommend this book for anybody taking this course.

59
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's very readable and provides many interesting examples and explanations of modern day causal inference.

60
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Before we end the video. I want to bring your attention to two additional resources that I put on canvas.

61
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
One is the selection bias Cheat Sheet, which gives an overview of the general definitions of selection bias and a bunch of examples.

62
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I think this cheat sheet would be really helpful to review before a lecture and even after lecture.

63
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Another thing I want to alert you to is this hypothetical dataset that I put together to show

64
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the utility of using inverse probability weighting to adjust for selection bias

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The hypothetical dataset shown here essentially depicts a study of the exposure to PFAS on birth defects.

66
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
When you do a study like this, you're essentially conditioning on all the babies that would have come to term inducing type of selection bias.

67
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That's similar to the birthweight paradox.

68
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Before lecture, try to familiarize yourself with this dataset and try to calculate the risk ratio, comparing the risk ratio of birth defects,

69
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
comparing those infants exposed to PFAS  and those who aren't exposed to PFAS

70
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
in both the entire study population shown here and then just babies who made it to term.

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:26,486
So a value of value of zero for prenatal mortality.
