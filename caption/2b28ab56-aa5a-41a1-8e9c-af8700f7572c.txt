1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:11,100
Okay, everyone, let's get started. Thanks, everyone.

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:20,170
Welcome back. So today what we're going to do is continue to talk about preconception and we'll talk about it in a couple of different ways.

3
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,290
First, we're going to relate it to undernutrition.

4
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:32,310
We'll talk about two specific conditions a female athlete triad and another condition called relative energy deficiency in sports.

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,820
Then we'll go on the flip side of that and talk about overnutrition,

6
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,820
really in the context of having excess adipose tissue and how that can affect fertility levels.

7
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,900
And then we'll end by talking actually before we jump into folate,

8
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:53,430
we're going to pause and just have like a 5 to 8 minute activity where we reflect on some of the main concepts that we go over.

9
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,709
And then we'll end by talking about folate. All right.

10
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,150
So I threw up these hormones last time just as a resource.

11
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:07,280
Again, just being familiar with the names and just thinking about some of the functions that they might have.

12
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:14,870
But I also just want to point out that adipose tissue itself is considered to be what we call an endocrine organ.

13
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,400
So when we hear endocrine, we relate that to hormones, basically.

14
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:25,010
So it can be involved in not only the release of certain hormones,

15
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:30,260
but it can synthesize certain hormones as well and it can affect reproductive hormone status.

16
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,670
This is another reference slide.

17
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:42,190
So I realize I've been talking about BMI, but not everyone may be familiar with just sort of the general concept of it or how it's calculated.

18
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:51,160
So BMI is calculated by taking someone's weight and height and just plugging it in into here.

19
00:01:52,030 --> 00:02:02,290
And what you get is the body the body mass index, and you get a number and then you can put whatever the index is into one of these weight categories.

20
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:13,900
Okay. So this the BMI is it's useful for the studies, right, to really be an indication of someone's weight.

21
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:23,200
It's generally useful for individual status and figuring out for an individual and figuring out so their weight status and relating it to health.

22
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:30,819
There can be some caveats with BMI, just so everyone is aware, thinking about someone who might be really tall,

23
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:38,350
for example, that can sort of offset the BMI as well as someone who might have a lot of muscle mass.

24
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,790
Muscle weighs more than adipose tissue. Muscle holds more water.

25
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,760
So that's just another another sort of caveat.

26
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:55,900
But in general, BMI is used quite a lot in terms of research as an indicator of someone's weight and how we can relate it to health.

27
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:05,470
So again, just a reference slide, thinking about these different categories related to the BMI index, the index.

28
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:12,420
And so what we're first going to focus on today is undernutrition and there is well

29
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:20,010
documented associations with low body fat and having alterations with reproductive hormones.

30
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,590
All right. So this slide we're first starting really a focus on females here.

31
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:36,120
And this slide has some classic reference points, really from a study done quite a while ago in the 1980s.

32
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:44,370
But these are some reference points that health professionals often will go to in terms of thinking about reproductive health.

33
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,760
So first of all, the first thing I want to talk about is the term menarche.

34
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,760
So in a female, that is the first menstruation.

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,230
So it's thought that a female has to have a minimum of 17% body fat to sort of trigger that first menstruation.

36
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:14,250
Thinking in terms of BMI in an adult female or a female of reproductive age, a BMI lower than 20 starts, resulting in abnormal cycles.

37
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,480
So we refer to this as amenorrhea.

38
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:25,560
Okay. So that's another term to be familiar with, and that would be the absence of menstruation for three months or longer.

39
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,460
And then going back to body fat again. I'm an adult female.

40
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:37,220
About 22%, give or take, is related to stable menstrual cycle.

41
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,249
Think, think and just some reference points.

42
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:50,250
These aren't spot on, but just sort of reference points to think about when we start seeing sort of abnormal hormone levels in females.

43
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:56,640
So a condition that I want to talk about and focus on for a little bit is called female athlete triad.

44
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,680
It's a condition we see in young female who are in athletics.

45
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,920
And really what it is, is the state of chronic energy deficiency.

46
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:17,470
And it's really represented by these three. We call them at least three clinical manifestations of disordered eating.

47
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,100
Amenorrhea and premature bone loss or osteoporosis.

48
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:33,940
All right. And so this is significant. We talk about it in pre-conception years because when you think about athletes, whether male or female,

49
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:41,340
they're really in their peak performance years in their most healthy reproductive years as an individual.

50
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:51,160
So the most common athletes we will find this condition in are those athletes that are

51
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,100
in a sport that require a really lean body type or really high cardiovascular output.

52
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:07,740
So I just have some examples on the slide here. And so, unfortunately, the pressures of sort of maintaining that peak performance,

53
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,840
having that leaner body type that lead to that peak performance can lead to underwriting.

54
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:22,740
And so if underwriting goes on long enough and there's a loss of body fat, that's where we start to see this effect on some key reproductive hormones.

55
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:33,120
As reproductive hormones get altered, this then can result in that loss of menstruation leading to amenorrhea.

56
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:44,760
And then that premature bone loss. And so I'm going to hang on to talking about the bone loss for just a couple of slides.

57
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:56,130
And this is important to really think about because this is a time period in individuals where they should be really building up their bone mass.

58
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:05,490
So, for example, in females, females actually don't reach their peak bone mass until they're about age 30.

59
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:15,550
So it happens that estrogen does play a role in just normal bone health in general.

60
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:24,550
So what we what our bodies do is we are constantly turning over our bone just to keep it this healthy, to keep it healthy, basically.

61
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:36,970
And so normally we have these cells called osteoblasts, which play a role in breaking down wall, breaking down bone, and then we rebuild the bone.

62
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,950
So estrogen, what it normally under normal conditions is what what it does is that it inhibits these osteoblasts.

63
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:52,740
So there is not too much bone breakdown. Now, if there is a decreased estrogen with a loss of body fat,

64
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:59,790
what happens then is there's a loss of this inhibition and osteo class activity increases.

65
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:09,780
So with this increased loss of bone mass, with the addition of vigorous exercise,

66
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:15,540
this can also lead to an increased risk for bone fractions as well in this population.

67
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:28,520
And then I just want to show one study just to show the impact of hormone imbalance on bone mass.

68
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:35,479
And so what we have here, this was a study done with younger adults.

69
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:45,470
So 18 to 36. And what they did was they put these females into a group one through nine.

70
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:51,830
Okay. So group one represented those that had very regular menstrual cycle.

71
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,200
Versus Group nine, very irregular. They are considered to have amenorrhea.

72
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:07,460
And then what they did was they tested for bone density in a specific part of the vertebrae using an x ray machine called DEXA, a DEXA scan.

73
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:16,520
A scan is used typically to measure bone, bone mineral density, usually in the hip area and along the spinal cord.

74
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:25,680
And so what they did, what they found was a positive association with bone mineral density.

75
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,889
And being in group number one. So having that regular cycle. Right.

76
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:40,040
And so we can see as the groups, the groups that are more of the irregular cycle, we see a decrease in that bone mineral density.

77
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:48,220
So just a nice representation of what we're talking about in terms of a hormone imbalance and how it can affect bone mass.

78
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:58,050
Okay. Any questions? All right.

79
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,430
So in terms of intervention here.

80
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:12,350
It's really important to have those who are close to an individual that might be experiencing female athlete tried to

81
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:21,560
have awareness or education around what some of these signs or symptoms might be in terms of chronic energy deficiency.

82
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:25,550
Right. And in terms of like disordered eating and things like that.

83
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:34,760
So these are just some examples here. So thinking about the caretakers of that individual, the coaches, the peers, you know, fellow athletes.

84
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:48,960
And in terms of further professional intervention, you know, this is something that really affects mental health, right?

85
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:57,330
So including a mental health professional or a behavioral specialist is really key in terms of intervention.

86
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:05,210
And then, of course, physicians and a dietician who would be the the food, the diet professional.

87
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,120
It's really important to get those hormones back on track.

88
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:15,560
Right. And so a sign of that would be the restoration of menstruation.

89
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:26,960
And then also because this is the underlying cause here is really that chronic energy deficiency of real focus on the diet.

90
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:36,250
And then because of that bone loss that's really affected, a diet would usually focus on bone related nutrients like calcium and vitamin D.

91
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,430
Okay. I'm going to. That's all I'm talking about for a female athlete triad.

92
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:56,709
Are there any questions? Yeah. No.

93
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:02,530
No, it shouldn't. Yeah. Once it's restored, it should sort of come back to normal.

94
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:11,380
So let's just be. And I was.

95
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,250
Yeah. I think, you know, that's just a general reference.

96
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:31,240
It's not really specific. And again, remember, these BMI categories are not perfect in terms of, you know,

97
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,860
really identifying who is underweight or overweight or things like that.

98
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:43,510
There's, you know, individual differences across everything. Any other questions?

99
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:58,939
Okay. So we've been focusing on females, but this is something that, of course, can affect males as well in some of these similar types of sports.

100
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:06,829
And awareness was really brought to this around 2005 that these complications due to undernutrition and

101
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:16,280
those in really vigorous athletics not only affects bone mass like we've been talking about or menstruation,

102
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:22,309
it can affect really almost every sort of process in the body.

103
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:34,940
Right. It has, really. Can have really detrimental effects to other things like cardiovascular health, mental health, right, immune function.

104
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,140
And so this can all this can be happening in both females and males.

105
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:47,480
And I like this figure. It just sort of encompasses where, you know, the focus of the triad is.

106
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:54,680
But then with relative sorry, we they referred to this as relative energy deficiency in sports to sort of,

107
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,480
you know, encompass males, females and all these other health issues.

108
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:05,480
And this is what, you know, the rest of this figure is short, is encompassing here,

109
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,740
is just really pointing out how it can affect a lot of other systems in the body.

110
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,800
All right. I'm going to switch gears and start talking about excess body fat.

111
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:29,330
Does anyone have questions before I do? Okay.

112
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,819
All right. So similar to undernutrition.

113
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:47,260
Once someone is sort of going in the other direction, we see we again see alterations in reproductive hormones in females.

114
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:52,630
Some of the signs is some fertility and ovulation.

115
00:14:53,260 --> 00:15:00,400
So remember, ovulation is when that egg is released in the female, that short period of time where conception could occur.

116
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:12,420
And then in males, you know, saying things like altered sperm production, altered integrity of the sperm, altered testosterone levels.

117
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,730
So we'll talk about touch upon. These things.

118
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,080
First, I just want to touch base on different types of fats we find in our body.

119
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:31,990
Subcutaneous fat is that type of fat we find right under our skin versus visceral fats can surround vital organs.

120
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:41,200
So this is the type of fat we sort of worry about when we start thinking about metabolic functioning or chronic disease.

121
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:50,140
You can imagine if there's excess fat surrounding vital organs that can interrupt the normal functioning of these organs.

122
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,950
Okay. So you can start to result in certain chronic conditions.

123
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:05,010
One I want to talk a little bit about now is insulin resistance and a proposed mechanism of having excess fat.

124
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:13,649
And this is important to talk about because if insulin levels in the blood remain high for too long,

125
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:21,810
this can lead to a condition called type two diabetes. Which we'll talk mostly about in the adults life stage.

126
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:29,230
Uh, but this slide again, I want to talk about a proposed mechanism of insulin resistance.

127
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:37,000
And this slide is just showing what would be happening under normal circumstances.

128
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,490
So say we have a lot of glucose in our blood.

129
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,820
We just ate a meal. So we now have circulating glucose.

130
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:58,210
So what happens is the pancreas, the pancreas detects this and produces insulin and releases insulin into the blood.

131
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,530
This is because there are certain organs of certain certain cells and organs that require insulin.

132
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,130
It to enable glucose to be taken up by it by that.

133
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:17,930
Right so. So the muscle cell is an example of this.

134
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:26,780
So what happens is insulin needs to bind to a receptor on the muscle cell.

135
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:33,170
And what happens is there's sort of a cascade of pathways that occurs until eventually

136
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,000
this glucose channel will then be opened and glucose can get into this muscle cell,

137
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,810
and then that muscle cell can use that glucose for its own energy needs.

138
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:49,280
Right. So insulin sort of acts like a key that unlocks this glucose channel to be able.

139
00:17:52,360 --> 00:18:04,390
Okay. So in terms of excess fat, what happens is fat could start, you know, surrounding these these organs.

140
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,260
Another thing can happen is that fat can actually also start to infiltrate into these muscles, muscle cells themselves.

141
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,090
We call this lipo toxicity. It can damage the cell.

142
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:24,370
It can interrupt this pathway that insulin sort of stimulates in terms of opening this glucose channel.

143
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:31,140
And so then that can block this glucose channel from ever opening.

144
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:42,500
And what happens is glucose stays in the blood. And because of that, the body actually thinks, oh, my gosh, my muscle cells are depleted of glucose.

145
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,210
And this this body is not eating enough glucose. So I'm going to make my own glucose.

146
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,660
So that adds additional glucose into the blood.

147
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:59,830
And then because of that, the pancreas thinks, oh, I need to produce more insulin to get this glucose into the into these cells.

148
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,750
So there's both an increase in blood insulin and an increase in blood glucose.

149
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,390
Any clarifications on this? So a lot of information.

150
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,020
Okay. All right.

151
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,050
This slide is just riding out what I just talked through.

152
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,860
So it's sort of the same thing.

153
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:38,360
And then I just want to hang on to thinking about, you know, excess adipose tissue resulting in increased insulin levels in the blood.

154
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,580
In terms of females,

155
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:50,270
what's been seen to happen is that increased insulin production can actually decrease this hormone here called sex hormone binding globulin,

156
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,180
and that actually stimulates production of testosterone in the ovaries.

157
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,860
And that's what is related to the development of an obviously.

158
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:15,210
Yeah. Um.

159
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,440
I'm honestly not sure how it affects fertility.

160
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:30,010
That's a great question. But hopefully, you know that individuals are managing that type two diabetes with insulin in proper amounts.

161
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:35,770
But initially. In terms of low insulin levels, I'm not sure how it would affect.

162
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,160
Affect fertility. I can take a browse through the literature and see if there's anything.

163
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:59,280
Great question. Yeah. So that's when.

164
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:06,540
Yes. So the insulin, once it starts to increase, increase, that's the signal to get glucose into the cell.

165
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:15,120
So the glucose would be cleared. And so that's when we start to see increased insulin and blood.

166
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:21,540
For a prolonged period of time that can actually start to do damage to our blood vessels and things like that.

167
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:27,720
And that's what can lead to a diagnosis of type two diabetes and leading to other chronic conditions as well.

168
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:36,380
The other questions. Okay.

169
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,700
I welcome questions at any time. I really love this figure.

170
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:51,329
It summarizes what we've talked about in terms of females related to BMI and hormone balance or hormonal imbalance.

171
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:58,770
And so the x axis here is showing BMI and then the Y axis is probability of irregular cycles.

172
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:05,790
So as we're on the lower end of BMI, we see a higher probability of irregular cycles.

173
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:13,050
As we get into the more normal BMI categories, the probability decreases.

174
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:21,270
And then again, as we increase the BMI irregular, the irregular cycle probability goes up again.

175
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:34,889
Okay. So I want to focus now on males for a little bit in terms of access, but in fact,

176
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:45,360
there's been associations and we'll see some data in the next couple of slides with things such as decreased sperm counts,

177
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:56,010
altered altered integrity, and things like due to like oxidative stress and things like that and then alterations in hormones.

178
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:04,830
So thinking about males and in terms of reproduction, testosterone, you know, plays an important role in the male body.

179
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:16,320
And what we see here is with excess adipose tissue, we have in adipose tissue, this enzyme called aromatase.

180
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:23,790
The purpose, the the function of aromatase is actually to convert testosterone to estrogen.

181
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:30,030
So with excess adipose tissue, we have higher levels and activity of aromatase.

182
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:37,170
So there's a higher conversion of testosterone to estrogen, leading to increased levels of estrogen in the male body.

183
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:44,220
This is just some data to look at some of these parameters.

184
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,210
And this is actually done by a research group here at the School of Public Health.

185
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:55,170
And it's just showing different sperm or hormone characteristics in relation to BMI.

186
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:01,380
Okay. So this row here is just showing increase and increase in BMI.

187
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:14,320
So I'm just pointing out a couple of things here. Like total sperm count as BMI increases, we see a decrease, a significant decrease in sperm count.

188
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:21,030
Cells with DNA damage. It's just sort of representing what I always say.

189
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,570
Sperm integrity, just a representation of that.

190
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:30,270
But we see DNA damage starts to increase as BMI increases.

191
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:35,280
This is not significant, but marginally significant. But you can see this trend.

192
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,880
And then estrogen. Are we going to think that estrogen is going to go up or is it going to go down?

193
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:50,960
Yeah, I see some up. Yes. And so what we see here, I'm thinking about that aromatase enzyme converting testosterone to estrogen.

194
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:57,650
We see increasing levels of estrogen and decreasing levels of testosterone.

195
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:09,719
Yup. Yeah.

196
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,780
I don't think the effects would be the same. I think it's more the sort of endocrine effects of adipose tissue.

197
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,100
Yeah. Great question.

198
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:30,110
Anything else? Yeah. There.

199
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:35,110
There is. It's more complicated and more expensive.

200
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:40,120
So PMI is, you know, is the typical sort of reference.

201
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:46,880
There are also like. At an individual level, there's ways to measure it.

202
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:55,130
You know, when we're talking about like big populations and sort of assessing in terms of that, you know, BMI as much.

203
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:03,310
Anything else? Okay.

204
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:17,240
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

205
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:23,780
I think more so in terms of fertilizing the egg. Yeah. So just the initial conception.

206
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,180
Awesome questions. Okay, I forgot. I have one more slide here.

207
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:41,180
So in terms of intervention and thinking in terms of weight loss, they're sort of like this magic percent weight loss,

208
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:51,650
thinking about someone's initial weight and losing about 5 to 10% of that weight, which can show improvements in fertility status.

209
00:26:52,490 --> 00:27:02,060
The other thing just to point out is that an individual with a weight loss in 5 to 10% body weight also reap other health benefits as well.

210
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:08,749
So showing improvements in things like cholesterol or insulin circulating insulin levels.

211
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,860
Right. That's also directly related to fertility.

212
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:22,510
Okay. So what I want to do now, I want to give you guys like 5 to 8, 5 to 10 minutes.

213
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:34,390
Just to reflect on some of the key terms that we've gone over and thinking about some of the concepts we talked about in relation to them as well.

214
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:42,400
And what, what, what I want you to do is work with a partner or with a couple people around you

215
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:49,690
and try to define maybe in the time that we have about three of these terms,

216
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,130
this is just going to help. One, it will help in the weekly participation.

217
00:27:54,790 --> 00:28:05,500
If you haven't done it yet or it's just a good time to stop, reflect, help in terms of reinforcement of some of these terms.

218
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:13,180
And to fill in any gaps. Right. When you're working with a peer, you'll be able to fill in some gaps if you're not getting something.

219
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,370
So I have you can use the slide on the canvas site.

220
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:23,860
I also linked a Google doc where you can make your own copy and just fill it out that way.

221
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:29,200
And if you fill out the Google doc and you want to send me like whatever you fill out, feel, feel free to no need.

222
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,560
But sometimes I just like to see what students are discussing.

223
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:42,430
But I'm going to turn it over to you guys, okay? I'm just give you like 5 to 10 minutes and try to work with what some people around you.

224
00:28:50,390 --> 00:29:20,690
Yeah. The first.

225
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:16,710
Yeah. Yeah.

226
00:30:53,920 --> 00:31:15,130
It would. Were.

227
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:38,430
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

228
00:31:39,820 --> 00:32:28,710
Oh, yeah. It was.

229
00:32:36,710 --> 00:33:10,120
Yeah. I see.

230
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:23,150
All right, everyone. I think I think we're going to keep moving forward.

231
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:29,060
I think the conversation is slowing and conversation is starting to drift.

232
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:35,480
So I'm thank you for engaging in this and just talking through some of these concepts together.

233
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:42,230
It's always nice to just pause, reflect, helps with, you know, just some reinforcement.

234
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:50,270
All right. So we're going to lastly talk about folate in relation to preconception.

235
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:56,690
And before getting into it, I just want to talk through the difference between two types of folate we find in food.

236
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:02,870
First is food folate. Okay, so this is the folate we find in.

237
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,490
Then it's natural for some resources on the slide here.

238
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:12,799
And so I want to just point out in terms of this,

239
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:24,770
is that the the structure that we find it in is called a poly glutamate structure, which basically means poly means money.

240
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:32,480
So what it means is that there's a lot of these glutamate molecules on this structure.

241
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:38,300
Okay. And so once we consume food folate,

242
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:49,100
what happens in our digestive tract is that we have to actually break off each one of these glutamate molecules until there's only one left,

243
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:53,240
and then we can absorb it from our digestive tract into our blood.

244
00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:00,519
Okay. So you can imagine that actually takes a lot of time and a lot of energy because of that.

245
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:08,410
That actually makes it less efficiently absorbed than the next type of flight that I'm going to talk about.

246
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,640
Okay. So folic acid, this is the synthetic form of it.

247
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,860
So we'll see it fortified in different types of wheat products.

248
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:31,360
And the difference here is that folic acid in its form in food is already is in a mono glutamate form,

249
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,550
which means it already exists with one glutamate structure on there.

250
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:41,540
So once it's in our digestive tract, it's actually already ready to be absorbed, right?

251
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,950
So because of that, that makes it much more efficient at being absorbed.

252
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:56,020
Okay. So then when we hear the word folate, that's a term that actually technically covers both folic acid and.

253
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:11,180
All right. So for late itself, it is a B, vitamin B nine, to be exact.

254
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:15,800
And it plays some key roles in DNA and cell division.

255
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:25,070
And so when we're thinking of the first couple of weeks of development, meaning development in the womb,

256
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:33,830
it's really important in terms of this rapid cell division that's occurring, in terms of development of the central nervous system in the heart.

257
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:42,840
So in terms of proper development of the spinal cord, it includes that what the spinal cord does is it sort of closes on itself.

258
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:47,220
Okay. And so we need proper closure of this.

259
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:52,890
And having adequate levels of folate plays a really important role in making this happen.

260
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:08,120
So if there is improper closure of the spinal cord, it can result in a slew of of a type of condition called a neural tube defect.

261
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,370
One of the most common ones we hear about is spinal bifida. So I'm just giving that one as an example.

262
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:20,030
This can really range in severity. Some people can live a normal life with spinal bifida.

263
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:24,380
Some it's it's much more severe. It can result in like learning impairment.

264
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,100
I'm really affect daily living activities.

265
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:42,490
Her. And so in the 1980s, we started to see a number of studies that started to relate fully to these in Europe,

266
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:46,450
a lack of folate and these neural tube defects in offspring.

267
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,429
And so there was enough studies that eventually that really isolated folate intake and neural tube

268
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:59,980
defects that we started to think about making some changes in terms of recommendations for folate intake.

269
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:03,219
So first, there was actually an increase of folate intake.

270
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,200
I'm actually not sure where it was before this,

271
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:14,020
but there was an increased recommendation to take 400 micrograms per day for females of childbearing age.

272
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:23,180
And then there was also this option for manufacturers, manufacturers to fortify their products with bullets.

273
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,680
There wasn't a lot of adherence to the optional fortification,

274
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:36,200
so they decided to mandate this fortification for wheat flour, cereal, grains and wheat flour.

275
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:43,610
Okay. An important note here which we'll get back to is that cornflour there was

276
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:50,390
no option to fortify or mandate for cornflour to be fortified at this point.

277
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,730
Okay. So after this fortification and increase in recommendation,

278
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:08,250
what we saw across populations was a decline by about 13 of about 1300 births per year and neural tube defects.

279
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:15,280
What I want to point out here is that there is some disparities between race and ethnicity.

280
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,860
Specifically, the Hispanic population has always been higher,

281
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:25,840
even though it did have a drop off of neural tube defects just like the other, the others.

282
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:31,120
There's still always a little bit higher in terms of the prevalence of neural tube defects.

283
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,440
So we're going to come back to that thinking.

284
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:41,070
I actually I think on the next slide, thinking about some are looking at some of the research that's been done to try to answer that.

285
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:54,660
And so this is just sort of repeating what I said about 1300 I know this is only 1000, but about 1300 cases less per year are reported.

286
00:39:55,810 --> 00:40:04,540
And so when we look at these disparities and in the Hispanic population looking at that, the prevalence is always a little bit higher.

287
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:13,300
Research has shown is that in this population there may be a lower awareness of dietary sources of folate in general.

288
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:19,190
These females are less apt to practice supplementation.

289
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:27,740
So whether it's a prenatal vitamin which will have, you know, you would expect to have folate in it or even just adults,

290
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:33,860
women vitamins also contain folate as well as a common vitamin C in their.

291
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:43,250
They're more prone to this higher rate of a poly polymorphism in this empty h f r gene.

292
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:47,060
This is a gene that plays a role in normal folate metabolism.

293
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:59,450
And then thinking about dietary choices so their diets may have more cornflour versus wheat flour in them so that lots of that that fortification.

294
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,280
Exposure to that fortification.

295
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:18,390
And so what I want to just point out is a few years ago, in 2016, the FDA did approve optional fortification of corn flour with folic acid.

296
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,570
So manufacturers did have the option to start fortifying it with it.

297
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,880
You would think this one could be a really great public health opportunity.

298
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:33,640
There's even studies that show the projections of these different Hispanic populations of,

299
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:40,000
you know, an increase in their daily folate intake if cornflour was fortified.

300
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:48,070
And every year I try to go back and take a look at the literature to see, you know, what, what has come of this.

301
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:51,700
And still to date, there's only a couple of studies out there.

302
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:55,870
And basically what these studies have done is just gone to grocery stores.

303
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:01,870
Researchers have gone to grocery stores and just looked at the corn cornflour products.

304
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,140
And unfortunately, the majority of them you can see here are still not fortified.

305
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,060
Okay.

306
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:18,210
So just thinking about, you know, a public health intervention sort of on top of this intervention that could continue to help with these neural tube.

307
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,580
Any questions? Yeah.

308
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:39,870
I think they are just I just want you guys to know that there is a difference.

309
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:47,190
Folic acid and folate could be used interchangeably. But just to note, there's a difference in food, folate versus folic acid.

310
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:55,010
Yeah. How? Yeah.

311
00:42:55,020 --> 00:43:05,670
In terms I mean, in this case, it almost seemed better to consume folic acid if you're thinking about the absorption rate is just more efficient.

312
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:10,890
But then also thinking about the products that you might find folic acid in would be more processed.

313
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:14,450
So you have to sort of think about that and like the other, you know,

314
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:21,090
get more added sugar in those products versus food folate, you would find in more like whole food sources.

315
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:27,200
So it's just, you know, it's, you know, whatever whatever you're worried about at that time or the needs you're trying to.

316
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:39,079
Yeah. Oh, definitely.

317
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:46,150
You mean fully on a daily basis. It's important for other just normal metabolism, other processes in our body pressure.

318
00:43:47,400 --> 00:44:03,170
Yeah. That's a really good question.

319
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:10,170
Do either of you want to talk about if you could find anything?

320
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:20,339
Yeah, I don't I don't know if there's a set on that that that would I would assume perhaps because they're not exposing themselves to those products.

321
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:25,870
And I don't I don't know. If, like, gluten free products would be.

322
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,670
Oh, yeah, yeah. Right. I'm not a wheat. Yeah.

323
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:35,649
I don't know. That's a great question. There are like Syria, the cereal grain.

324
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:38,710
So thinking about like something like Cheerios, right.

325
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,800
Which is wheat free that's fortified with folic acid.

326
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:48,100
Sorry, I'm just kind of like thinking through my process right now. My answer is I'm not sure.

327
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:51,820
Oh. See if we can find any stats on that.

328
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:04,710
Yep. Yeah.

329
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:11,840
Government. Yeah. Absolutely, yeah.

330
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:21,880
So those who have celiac and are actively like taking care of it would probably be a little bit more prone to taking a multivitamin as well.

331
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:26,570
That's a great point. Okay.

332
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,020
Just a couple of minutes left. This is a really important slide.

333
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:38,629
I talk because I talk about the significance of folate intake in preconception rather than in pregnancy,

334
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:42,770
which is, you know, early pregnancy is where we're talking about these effects are occurring.

335
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:55,400
But I talk about it because locally intake is associated with these adverse outcomes that arise really early in pregnancy.

336
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:00,680
This is a time in pregnancy where females won't even know that they're pregnant.

337
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:13,490
So it's really of great importance that women of childbearing age are taking in adequate levels of full weight and are aware of the sources of it.

338
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,010
There's another stat that I just want to share is that in the United States.

339
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:29,060
Pregnancies. The majority of pregnancies that occur are, in fact, unintended or mistimed.

340
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:39,410
So just another point that sort of further validates that women of childbearing age really be aware of fully and their full weight status.

341
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:46,020
Right. Even if they're not planning on having a child. Okay.

342
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:52,170
That's that's all I have. Do you guys have any other questions?

343
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:03,270
All right. Thanks, guys. I'll stick around for a couple of minutes if you do. Hi.

344
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:10,740
Nice to meet you. And then I have a confession. Yeah.

345
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:16,230
So first I just want to clarify. I don't feel like they're getting.

346
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:23,370
Yes. I just kind of.
