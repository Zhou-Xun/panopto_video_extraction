1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,710
Record. So we are now recording. And I'll make sure to to not forget that the rest of the semester.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,670
How are you all doing? You having a good week?

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,660
I know some of you had exams, and we're starting starting to get to that part of the year where things get kind of crazy and a lot of work.

4
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:32,050
Well, great. Today, this class is hopefully a little bit of a laid back kind of end of the week for today's class.

5
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:45,639
You can go to our point view. I want to talk about a couple of minor syllabus updates and then we'll talk about the Journal article go through.

6
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,810
We have a little mini journal club of the parent journal article.

7
00:00:51,700 --> 00:01:00,130
And then I want to talk about the abstract assignment. And if we get to it, I'd like to touch on a TED talk at the end of class.

8
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,930
We may have to watch it. We may have you watch it like on your own time.

9
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:11,230
It's like only 9 minutes long or something. And then we can talk about it in class at one of the upcoming classes.

10
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,070
So we'll see, like timewise, if we have time for today.

11
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:24,490
With regard to the syllabus, I will post the the updated version of the syllabus on canvas later today.

12
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,620
Literally, there are only two minor little changes and I'll highlight them in the syllabus.

13
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,880
One of them is the abstract. I realize I never put a due date for that.

14
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,480
So the abstract due date will be November 11th.

15
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:49,909
And the reason for that is that I would like we're going to do a peer review analysis, a peer review process using this tool called critic.

16
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,230
Has anybody use critic? Okay, so cool.

17
00:01:53,620 --> 00:02:02,529
Yeah. So it's a new, new tool for student to student peer review and it's a new to me.

18
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,000
I've never used it. New. Several faculty are starting to implement it in their classrooms.

19
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:14,090
So we just I just want to try it this semester with just with the abstract and see how it goes.

20
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:24,670
And we can just kind of have fun with it. And, and yeah, and I have a little video that talks about critic and what it what it's all about.

21
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,680
So we'll get into that in a little more detail.

22
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:38,170
So abstract due November 11th and then it'll go through a round of peer review and you'll get feedback from your peers on the on the abstract,

23
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:44,080
on your writing. You'll also get feedback on your ability as a peer reviewer.

24
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:56,680
And then the other thing that was different that I changed on the on the syllabus was so with regard to the abstract,

25
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,460
I mentioned that there would be two rounds of peer review using critic.

26
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:08,900
I'm just going to do one round of peer review because I think just the timing and everything, it's going to just be vast if we do one round.

27
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:18,400
So you'll submit your abstract. On November 11th, you'll be assigned a couple, 2 to 3 abstracts from your peers to review,

28
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:26,320
and then you'll do a peer review of those abstracts and you'll submit your comments and and then we'll just do that one round.

29
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:33,040
Does anybody any questions about that? And again, I'll give a little more detail on critic and how that's going to all work.

30
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:41,770
Great. Cool. So we can go into the Journal article.

31
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:49,779
So I thought this paper was kind of fun just because it's something that probably does anybody in here,

32
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,550
an evolutionary biologist in training, by training and I mean background.

33
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,670
So it's an it's an article that's not something that any of us probably has any background in.

34
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:07,780
And I think sometimes it's nice to review a paper that's outside of your area of expertize because

35
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:13,150
you can really get a feel for whether the writing is good enough that you're able to follow it,

36
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,160
even if it's not an area that you are very familiar with.

37
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,300
And it's just kind of fun because it's about animals and helping each other.

38
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:30,100
So I'm going to share this video really quick because so this paper was picked up.

39
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:40,420
The reason I chose this is, as I mentioned before, it's one of the papers that was most highly rated on ALTMETRIC in the year 2020.

40
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:51,970
And I tried to like instead I was going to update the paper for this year in that like I was looking back at what was most highly rated for 2021,

41
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,280
but they were all COVID related and I just didn't want to talk about COVID, so I just thought this one would be better.

42
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:07,330
I'll stick with the one from 2020. So I just want to play this video because I think it's a nice it provides a nice background on the study.

43
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:15,580
And this paper again, was picked up by all these different scientific outlets, news outlets.

44
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:22,000
So go ahead. This gives. Get it to go skinny.

45
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,180
I don't know why it won't let me do full screen, but maybe because they need to run it.

46
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,930
Okay, good. I had to get the stupid ass first.

47
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:46,450
I've seen this. I don't know. I'm sorry.

48
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:51,070
I'm not trying to indoctrinate anybody. All right.

49
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,480
We found that African great parents went to therapy and spontaneously help others to obtain food and that without obvious benefits to themselves,

50
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,640
in a situation in which the parents have access to tokens,

51
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:24,840
they spontaneously transfer them to their neighbor who had none but who could exchange them for food with an experiment.

52
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:32,100
We found evidence that they did so, seemingly without expecting any reciprocation in return from their partner.

53
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:39,659
Importantly, the parents did not transfer tokens by default, but understood when it would actually help them.

54
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:45,239
Over the time they protested. What would happen if there was no neighbor to neighbor,

55
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,670
couldn't exchange tokens because they blocked this exchange so that tokens would not be useful.

56
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,960
In both cases, the partners transfer significantly less tokens.

57
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:38,280
What? And it's pretty cute that they like that.

58
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,860
The one like sharing the tokens didn't expect to have a share.

59
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,740
The nuts too. Yeah.

60
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:54,690
So the first question that you always wanted to ask when you read a paper is why did the authors do this study?

61
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:04,560
And was it clearly stated in the paper? And for any of you who had the chance to look at it before you come to class, what are your thoughts?

62
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,850
Did anybody. Did anybody have a chance to look at it? And it's okay if you did it.

63
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:17,630
I know it's been a long week. You kind of touched him in the video.

64
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,920
Yeah, I guess they're trying to look at, like, the evolutionary origins of altruism.

65
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:33,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And did you feel like it was pretty clearly stated in the paper and also it's in the first paragraph or two.

66
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,950
Yeah. Yeah. I thought so too. I thought it was pretty.

67
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,780
And that the the this paper is structured a little bit differently as you probably notice,

68
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,800
they have a summary and then they have a results in discussion that are kind of lumped together.

69
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:56,120
That's less common. Most papers have like an abstract, and then the intro and the results and discussion and methods fall in there somewhere.

70
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,370
But. Yeah, I thought, I thought it was pretty clearly stated in the summary.

71
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:09,230
Um, so the motivation for the study as, as we pointed out,

72
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:17,720
what is the evolutionary basis for altruism and is that unique to mammals and then evidence for both pro-social helping.

73
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:23,810
So providing voluntary assistance in achieving a goal which is what these birds were doing,

74
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,920
the one that was sharing the tokens and then also reciprocity.

75
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,610
So exchanging something with others for mutual benefit has been reported in a few mammals, but no avian species.

76
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:49,649
So the methods involved this instrumental helping paradigm involving a token transfer and to help gain a better understanding the parents motivation.

77
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:55,889
Investigators systematically varied the presence of a partner as well as the possibility for exchange.

78
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:01,890
And I'll show you they have a nice figure in there, which I think illustrates the different control conditions that they used.

79
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,450
So this is just the picture that they had in the paper, which was also in the video.

80
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,750
So they had they had the they had four different conditions.

81
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:23,399
They had a test condition, which is what they showed originally in the video,

82
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,080
where the parent can share with its friend and then its friend can get a reward.

83
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,959
There's also a social control and this that they that's how they describe it,

84
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:39,330
where the parent can share with its friend, but his friend can't get any sort of reward.

85
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:45,030
And they found that in this condition that the parents were far less likely to share tokens with their neighbors.

86
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:55,440
Similarly, in this condition, where there is tokens but nobody to share with, the burden is far less likely to draw tokens into the other area.

87
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:10,049
And then in this control, again, where there was there was they could receive a they're able to receive a reward and could share.

88
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:16,980
But then their partner was not able to receive a reward. I didn't feel like this one was as well described in the paper.

89
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,520
It was only described in a couple of places and I didn't really fully understand.

90
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,040
These two, I think, make a lot of sense.

91
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:32,910
Like an understanding, like you want to see does this bird just throw tokens at its friend because it's playing with him or,

92
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:41,290
you know, is it some sort of like, are they truly sharing the tokens because this bird is going to get some food?

93
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:48,180
Like, they have to understand that somehow. And then here, obviously, there's nobody to share with.

94
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:53,350
You know, again, is this bird just kind of throwing tokens around because it's kind of having fun?

95
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,520
Oh, thank you. You know, apologetic is going to know that they're.

96
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:05,420
Anyway, I thought that this figure was nicely laid out in terms of the different, different conditions.

97
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,640
And so I'll go through some of the results.

98
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:19,340
They found that seven out of eight of the birds transferred at least one token during their first trial in the actor rule.

99
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,440
So this would be the bird that had the tokens and got to share it with its friend.

100
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:31,060
And when they say the first trial, it means that the bird has not been a recipient of tokens yet.

101
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:36,200
So they they went through and actually like put the each bird got to serve in both roles.

102
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,840
And the fact that the majority of the birds transferred at least one token during their

103
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:48,340
first trial in the actor role means that they weren't expecting a reciprocal response,

104
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:53,120
if that makes sense, because they haven't gone through like getting food rewards yet.

105
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,950
Most of the transfers occurred through direct giving,

106
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:05,450
but sometimes they also just dropped them into their neighbors compartment and they were net suggests

107
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:10,430
that they were motivated to transfer tokens even when the neighbor was not there to receive them.

108
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,580
Significantly fewer tokens were transferred.

109
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:22,730
As we as I mentioned and as was talked about in the video, when the partner had no opportunity to exchange them for food.

110
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,810
And so what was the purpose of this experiment? I kind of just mentioned it already, but.

111
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:41,900
I think that in the in the video, they find out that there was this raid on pirates in Africa.

112
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:48,150
They they can share their they have that confirmed that behavior.

113
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:54,269
And they compared to the blue pirated or remember that they they don't do that.

114
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:58,800
They don't have that sort of behavior. Yeah, I suppose.

115
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,750
Well, I think that that was the main purpose of the study.

116
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:09,180
To know what species do these and the other way.

117
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,300
Why they don't do or they don't really.

118
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:20,999
Yeah. Yeah. I think that, that it this experiment does tell you having this social control condition in

119
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,020
which the bird isn't sharing tokens when its friend isn't going to get a reward,

120
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:34,649
tells you something about the birds, how the birds potentially interact in their natural environment,

121
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:39,240
and that they're more likely they have a more a social structure in which it's beneficial

122
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,520
to them to to be altruistic and to be helpful in that they're able to understand that,

123
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:54,299
that there's situations in which they can offer help, which I think is really interesting, for one thing.

124
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:00,930
But I don't, uh, I, I think you did you put this video in the syllabus or something.

125
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,110
I don't know where I saw it before. Oh, you don't see it already?

126
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,870
Yes.

127
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:17,610
But what I did understand at the beginning, I thought that the one pirate was giving the tokens to the other show, the other could ask for 14 minutes.

128
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,940
He said yes. For handouts or something. Yeah.

129
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:31,650
And after that I saw that that the parrot that has two tokens, he he was not, he wasn't able to receive the the seeds.

130
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:37,510
Mm hmm. So I thought that he that part was giving the token to the other one.

131
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:45,780
The other one received the seeds. And in rhetorician gave the first part one seed, at least one.

132
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,970
But I didn't see that. No they don't.

133
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:56,540
They were saying that they they didn't the parrot receiving the not like didn't share with its friends years ago.

134
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,629
Thanks. Thanks for your help. Yeah.

135
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:08,580
Which is, which is really funny and interesting. But, but yeah, they were still, you know, when that role was switched,

136
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:17,270
they were always willing to hand over the tokens and like understood that the token meant a reward for their for their money.

137
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,270
Yeah. Yeah.

138
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,950
And then significantly fewer tokens were transferred when nobody was there to receive them.

139
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:35,880
The majority of instances in which the the African gray parrots directly gave tokens to their neighbor

140
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:42,780
occurred in the test condition and in far fewer occurred when in one of the control conditions.

141
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:50,319
And the results of the two control conditions confirm that the motivation

142
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,190
underlying the token transfers was most likely to help the neighbor obtain food.

143
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:03,550
What was another thing that was probably it was a little interesting for birds but probably not surprising know as as humans.

144
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:10,389
More closely affiliated pairs so they call it a composite sociality index so they're

145
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:17,170
closer friends I guess they transferred more tokens than less closely affiliated ones,

146
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,759
which which makes sense in the context of, well, how we understand human behavior.

147
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,910
But birds are apparently capable of this as well.

148
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:31,180
And then so the interest in helping is impacted by social affiliation.

149
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,090
The recipients behavior did not differ between the experimental conditions.

150
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:51,370
So like attention getting behavior. So if the if the bird that was receiving the tokens to get the food like started acting was like trying to get it,

151
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,740
you know, act up or get attention from the from the, the bird that was doing the transferring of the tokens.

152
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:09,309
It didn't really affect the the transfer rate, but the attention getting behavior did positively,

153
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,280
positively affect the occurrence of transfers overall.

154
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:25,390
And then this just they provided a figure that shows the between the blue headed macaws and the African gray parrots.

155
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,590
And they found that when they did this study with these blue headed macaws.

156
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,900
So this is the motivational control, the non social control, the social control and the test condition.

157
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:44,920
You can see that pretty wide range for the test condition, but nevertheless,

158
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:52,150
far more the African gray parents were willing to transfer tokens compared to the blue headed macaws.

159
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:59,049
And again, this suggests that the that parents are capable of this behavior.

160
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:05,320
But it's not a not something that is, you know, uniform across different species.

161
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:13,510
And they have some speculation about the different social structures of the two species of birds that may underlie this discrepancy.

162
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:21,100
So their interpretation, this is right out of the paper, given their fusion vision,

163
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,410
fusion society in which they interact with varying partners in a constantly changing group composition,

164
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,740
though there's an onus on them to build up a good reputation.

165
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:41,380
Apologies for that missing space there in terms of pro-social behavior that it may be beneficial for becoming a coalition partner in the future.

166
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:50,229
On the contrary, with the latter because their composition remains more constant in their choice of interaction,

167
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:57,400
partners is restricted, and so they don't have as much of an impetus for building up a prosocial reputation.

168
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:10,690
So I think the one of the reasons this got picked up by the media so heavily is that it was the first study to demonstrate voluntary behavior,

169
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,020
pro-social behavior in non mammalian species,

170
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:26,320
and the parrots had to understand their partner's motivation, which is really interesting that they needed these tokens in order to get food.

171
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:34,180
And the capacity for helping behavior and reciprocity is is present in parrots, which is which is interesting.

172
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:43,329
And then whether the helping behavior was caused by an intrinsic motivation to provide help to a familiar partner or friend or

173
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:53,050
by their anticipation that they might get a reciprocal favor later on in the future is something that they want to study next.

174
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:01,270
So I just had a few discussion questions about the paper.

175
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:07,300
We kind of talked about some of the important takeaways, but were there any additional ones that any of you thought of?

176
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,480
Any any thoughts that you had that that haven't been talked about yet?

177
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:20,610
Yeah,

178
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:29,070
something that I just can't stop thinking about is I wish they would have done like an example where both of them had the opportunity to receive them,

179
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:36,240
but only one had tokens to see if the parent would prefer to help the other one or just get it done right.

180
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,660
And I was like waiting for them to do that. And we didn't see that.

181
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:46,350
Yeah. Yeah. No, I thought that was I thought that was interesting, too.

182
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:51,660
Yeah. And then I wonder why they didn't ever share.

183
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,790
Yeah. Any other. Any other comments?

184
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:07,670
What were your thoughts on the writing? Did you find it to be clear and easy to follow, or were there areas that could have been improved?

185
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:18,520
Any comments on that? Yeah, I think it was a lot of information, which is normally a lot for me regardless.

186
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,420
But it was helpful that there was a highlight that there was an in brief and then there was a summary.

187
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:25,720
So I kind of yeah, what I was looking for and what was going to be in the paper.

188
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:33,300
Yeah. No, I like that. A lot of journals are going to that now where they have it have this like brief kind of bulleted section.

189
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:40,900
A lot of you, a lot of them will make you submit a, a graphical abstract, which is basically, you know, like a,

190
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:51,040
a diagram of your your study and what you, you know, the experimental conditions and what you expected to see and what you actually found.

191
00:22:51,370 --> 00:23:00,819
I do find that that really helps. Like some of these papers can be really dense and the journals like Current Biology,

192
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:06,880
which is a really high impact journal, a lot of them are very nature, in particular science.

193
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:14,020
These journalists have ridiculously small word limits, like really tight word limits.

194
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,180
And you have to cram all of this information into this very tiny word limit.

195
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,980
And so you'll find that this one was the study was a little bit different in terms of,

196
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,899
you know, it's more of like a a social psychology, evolutionary biology type study.

197
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:35,410
But if you're talking about a like a a basic science biology paper,

198
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:41,890
if you look at a science or nature paper, they'll have, you know, 35 supplemental figures.

199
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:49,510
And the reason for that is because they can't they have such a tight word limit, and you can only have three or four figures in the entire paper.

200
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:53,950
And so you have you pick like your key things that you want to include in the main body of the paper,

201
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,990
and then the rest of it all gets crammed in the supplement.

202
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:04,060
And this is still like some graduate student who has spent, you know, six years of their life like 60 hours a week cramming,

203
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:10,060
you know, like all of this gets relegated to the supplemental data in the paper.

204
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:16,540
So I always find that when I when I go through one of those papers, I'm like, yep, there's three years of work right there.

205
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:24,670
Yeah. So did you think the figures were easy to read and interpret?

206
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:37,820
There weren't a ton of figures. So I generally I could look at it and kind of follow like I thought that the figure legends were pretty clear.

207
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:45,620
You'll find that some papers, the figures like I like when they have.

208
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:59,000
Whereas if you go back here, I like when it's clearly labeled sometimes sometimes on the figures they won't put it.

209
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:04,459
It'll just be really confusing what the conditions are. And you have to go down to the figure legend to look at it and you're like going back

210
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,020
and forth between the figure legend and the figure that can be like mentally draining.

211
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:18,290
But I thought this one was pretty easy. And again, it's the figure figures for this paper were relatively simple compared to some of the,

212
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:26,930
you know, basic science or epidemiology or papers and industrial hygiene that you'll probably encounter.

213
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:35,569
Yeah. So any other thoughts outside of what we've already talked about already?

214
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,900
Why do you think this paper was so popular among the press?

215
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,510
It's cute. Yeah. The cuteness aspect. Yeah.

216
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:50,160
It was what caught my eye. I'm like, Oh, animals. There's like a, you know, they're like ten different papers on this list.

217
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:55,920
And one of them is about, you know, one was about cancer and something else.

218
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,450
And I was like, oh, parents. Like, I check this one out. Yeah.

219
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,710
And certainly, you know, lay press.

220
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:08,370
They, they get money based on clicks, right.

221
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:12,270
And so they want to get as many eyeballs on an article as they possibly can.

222
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:18,120
And so they have, you know, cute titles like what was the one they use?

223
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,900
What do they use for this one, Polly? A cracker.

224
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,210
Parents are good Samaritans. Yeah. I mean, like, I would read that.

225
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:36,960
So do you think that the attention this paper received was valid and justifiable, or do you think it was excessive?

226
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:48,240
Any thoughts? He's valid and justifiable because it's a big deal to find a whole other species for this.

227
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,570
Being a vegetarian like so different from mammals. Yea, yea.

228
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:00,040
Yea yea. I thought it was really I thought it was cool too in that regard.

229
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:09,870
And that was, that was the reason that, that there's been you know a lot of research into corvids right.

230
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:24,900
The like crows and ravens and they called corvids though that those birds are surprisingly intelligent and parents are also similar in terms of that

231
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:33,850
they have a lot of data showing that they're actually really quite intelligent and can anticipate humans like facial expressions and things like that.

232
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:40,750
And now we know that, I guess that when they in the paper they mentioned that the corvids actually weren't

233
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:49,270
super helpful in terms of and they weren't as altruistic as this species of parrot.

234
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:55,270
But. What other experiments would you like to see the group to do in the future?

235
00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:01,180
I know you mentioned the one about seeing if they have they can both have the opportunity to have food.

236
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,750
What would happen? And are there any other. Yeah.

237
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,830
Um. Right. You tell all the words came from the same facility.

238
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,930
Mm hmm. Another like if this is going to happen, like, completely strange, for instance.

239
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:19,630
Yeah. So, like, if there is no familiarity and it is still important to share.

240
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:24,280
Yeah. Yeah. They did mention that these birds were they all knew each other,

241
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:29,319
they were all friends already and that the ones that were the closer friends were more likely to help each other.

242
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:35,230
So yeah, you wonder like how much do they have to know each other before they'll actually start helping each other out?

243
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:48,729
So I know I saw some other videos that for example, but I don't know if those videos were without an experiment behind the videos or just word videos.

244
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:55,330
Bingo. But one of the beauties that I saw is, for example, with a Crow Raven.

245
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:08,080
Oh, yeah. That was like, yeah, that one was putting all the trash into the garbage can after the jurors, when when all the plays and all,

246
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:17,380
all the all the bird that was doing was picking up the trash and put it into the garbage can and say, well, the Ravens can do that.

247
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:26,010
And another one that day. So it was like a bird that was walking in the road.

248
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:33,010
And in that role, there were those signs that you don't have to pass through that those cones.

249
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:40,510
Oh, yeah. And one of the cones was was fell down and the bird came and.

250
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:45,330
And took the corn and put it in the in the exact place that it was.

251
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:52,110
It's one degree of it, but I don't know if those beatings were with the research behind that.

252
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:59,580
Yeah, I don't know. Can animals be neat freaks or have a little OCD like I can't stand this can't be knocked over.

253
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:03,299
You have to put it back in line. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

254
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:08,490
It's funny. I always of course, I'm like a big cat and dog person.

255
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:13,290
And dogs, of course, will, like, I have to feel like dogs would help each other out.

256
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:18,080
But I just wonder about cats. Like in cats, would they? No, no, no.

257
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:23,610
Yeah, I help the dog, like not another cat. Yeah, no, I think.

258
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:28,920
I mean, I think they'd help the dog, maybe offer themselves for sure.

259
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:41,069
Yeah. I wanted to touch, talk about the abstract assignment before we wrap up today and and discuss,

260
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:51,220
I have a little video on critic and kind of a little background on that, but for the abstract and of course, these slides are on canvas.

261
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:56,010
You'll have this information on there. But the abstract I pulled these guidelines.

262
00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:05,430
They're loosely a mash up of the society toxicology and the experimental biology abstract guidelines, but they're very similar.

263
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:11,880
No matter what conference you are planning to go to, you'll see something very similar to this.

264
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:21,569
So greater than or sorry, less than 2300 characters, that should be at least 500 characters.

265
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:28,500
You know, hopefully you have a couple of sentences there and the word count will include the title The Body,

266
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:36,000
the author, the author Last Name and the institutions and the spaces are not included in the character count.

267
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:41,430
And so I have like an example of an abstract that I'll show next.

268
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:47,340
No tables, figures or chemical structures are typically allowed in.

269
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,350
In an abstract, nonstandard acronyms should be defined.

270
00:31:53,820 --> 00:32:03,420
And that's one thing that you'll find like in papers is the number of acronyms you come across is really draining to do,

271
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,690
especially if they're nonstandard. And you have to keep going back to the beginning of the paper and finding out with what they're talking about.

272
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:15,510
So you want to be careful with that, write in paragraphs without headers.

273
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:26,639
So you'll see some abstracts are just like a full flowing paragraph and other ones are broken up into intro results,

274
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,800
methods, discussion, and they kind of have these subheadings for this one.

275
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:41,820
Let's just write it in a full paragraph without headers and then it should be single spaced arial 11 point font.

276
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:46,349
And again, this doesn't make a huge difference to me,

277
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:54,420
but we want to have just kind of in keeping with some guidelines that you will have to follow for an abstract for a conference.

278
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:03,120
We'll have guidelines on that as well. So the abstract should answer a couple of important questions.

279
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,630
What was done and what did you find?

280
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,730
So I know some of you have not yet gotten into your research projects yet.

281
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:18,900
And if that's the case or if you're planning to do an internship or if you have some research interest,

282
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,980
if you're describing something you're planning to do,

283
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:30,000
describe what you plan to do, what will you do and what do you expect to find and how would you do it?

284
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,770
And so an abstract typically has a statement of the background.

285
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:39,120
So what is the gap in knowledge that you're trying to fill with this study?

286
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,930
A statement of the rationale and then the scope of the study.

287
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:48,810
Why are you doing it? Exactly what's your hypothesis?

288
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:54,270
A brief description of the experimental procedures, the data that resulted from the study,

289
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:58,500
and the conclusions based on the interpretation of the results.

290
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:05,940
And I know you guys can look at this, you know, later if you want to.

291
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:12,060
But basically the reason I put this in here is just to show you structurally how it's typically laid out.

292
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:18,629
So you have you have your title and then your authors and your their affiliations.

293
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:26,640
The University of Michigan, this one I noticed this is a paper or an abstract that a grad student in our group,

294
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:33,560
Rachel Morgan, many of you, I'm sure many of you know her that we submitted to the society toxicology meeting.

295
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:40,860
She presented this work at the meeting in March in San Diego, and I noticed looking at the Desert Guide.

296
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:46,600
There was one thing that we missed here, which was, you know, she has a nice introduction.

297
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,510
Introductory sentence of early life.

298
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:59,440
Toxic exposures can have long lasting implications for cognitive health, and that could be due to epigenetic mechanisms, underlying neurodevelopment.

299
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:13,900
So this is kind of some background and the wallpaper and they were long thought to be exclusively expressed in the germline.

300
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:22,420
We've recently shown that pioneers are expressed in other cells in the body, in both mice and humans.

301
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:27,309
But one of the things I noticed here was that we didn't actually describe the methods

302
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:33,250
that we use to get the expression of these different genes that we were looking at.

303
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:40,780
And so, you know, there's always like room for improvement when you're writing an abstract.

304
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:49,510
But this one, I felt like in general, aside from missing some information on the methods, which is also a good learning point,

305
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:56,140
I was pretty I kind of followed those abstract guidelines that I mentioned previously,

306
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:05,290
and I'll be able to give you some additional examples of abstracts as well.

307
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:15,040
And part of the critique part of the critique exercise, you'll get three abstracts that I'll I'll pick three abstracts.

308
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,910
I'll pick one that I think is excellent and fits all of those guidelines.

309
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:25,690
A second one that's, you know, so, so and a third one that definitely needs a lot of work.

310
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:34,750
And you'll get the chance to review those abstracts and see like how closely your reviews align with my reviews.

311
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,410
That's part of the critique, part of the critique exercise.

312
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,420
And then in addition to reviewing your peers abstracts.

313
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:51,010
So I just want to briefly bring up this video because I think it gives a nice description.

314
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:57,549
They offer either a video or a slide deck, and they're better at describing this than Grammarly makes communication.

315
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:05,230
All right. For all of these ads, whether you're looking for an activity and interacting with them as your coaching guide,

316
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,020
you are learning to become a peer evaluator.

317
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:18,420
Critic is here to help you learn skills that will allow you to be successful in your future careers and even your personal relationships.

318
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:26,040
Critical thinking is the ability to ask good questions, come up with information in front of you to analyze it and draw appropriate

319
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:31,080
conclusions as you evaluate your peers using the rubric your professor provides.

320
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:36,720
Ask yourself if they are meeting the learning objectives outlined in the assignment and where they can improve.

321
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:45,300
Communication skills are essential both in relation to how you communicate to others and how you interpret communication and credit.

322
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,360
You'll communicate with your peers by providing them feedback and learning to accept feedback from others as well.

323
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:59,340
You will learn how to become an effective communicator by providing fair and accurate written evaluations to your peers.

324
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:05,280
Reinforcing the first concepts is enabled when your professor creates assignments based on a concept

325
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,010
taught in class with credit for submitting your own assignments and evaluating those from your peers.

326
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:16,110
You'll be exposed to course concepts multiple times, resulting in a deeper learning experience.

327
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:26,860
Critic has three stages. Stage one create based on the instructions your professors laid out.

328
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:33,970
You will create assignments anonymously online for your peers to evaluate, stage to evaluate.

329
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:39,700
In this state, you will be assigned a set of creations from your peers to evaluate.

330
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:48,760
Put yourself in the shoes of your professor and try to evaluate your peers fairly and accurately while also motivating them to improve.

331
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:58,890
Stage three feedback. In this stage, you give feedback based on the evaluations you receive on your own creation.

332
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:14,500
This is the activities page in critic. Here you can see your current activities and what stage they're currently in.

333
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:18,550
As you scroll down, you're also able to see past activities.

334
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:28,460
To get started on submitting your creation, you first want to review the activity details laid out by Professor.

335
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:35,400
Then you also want to look at your perfect to understand how your work will be assessed, depending on your professors instructions.

336
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,920
You are able to take your creation in a text box below or attach a file of your work.

337
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:49,220
Once your activity has finished the creation stage, it's time to submit your anonymous evaluations of your previous work.

338
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:55,880
Here you can see if the number of evaluations you were assigned to evaluate by navigating through the evaluation tabs.

339
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:04,150
To begin review the work description and be sure to see if the creation meets the requirements set per criteria.

340
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:10,030
Select the appropriate amount of stars you believe your peer deserves for their work.

341
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:21,340
It is very important to provide accurate and fair scores for your peers work based on the rubric, to be honest, fair and accurate.

342
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:25,390
But don't go to extremes by being too harsh or too generous.

343
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Your score is based on how accurately you grade your peers.

344
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:38,350
You don't want to just give everyone a 100% because that's not an accurate grade and then your own evaluation score will be negatively impacted.

345
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,950
Once you filled out the score section, you must submit an evaluation as well.

346
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:53,900
In the comments section, refer to the criteria done well within the rubric and include important things that your peers could do to improve.

347
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,660
I just wanted to pause for a second and say that this classes satisfactory, unsatisfactory.

348
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:05,390
So in some classes where people are using faculty are using this tool,

349
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:14,420
you would actually receive a score as part of your final grade for how you do evaluations and also a separate score for your work that you created.

350
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:27,530
But here, since we're just basing your basing your final grade in the class on whether you are here participating and trying and doing your best,

351
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,379
you don't have to worry about that necessarily.

352
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:36,230
But this is a nice way, I think, to get some practice and learning not only how to give constructive feedback,

353
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:40,040
but also how to how to improve your own writing.

354
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:51,860
One of the things that we that I'm always inclined to do as a peer reviewer is I just want to be like really, really positive and not be discouraging.

355
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:58,690
And sometimes you find that students are they get to where they just say, Yeah, great job,

356
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:05,060
that was excellent, you know, and they don't really kind of give constructive feedback.

357
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,899
It's nice if if you have done an excellent job, that's great.

358
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:15,080
But it providing some evidence for why you think that it's that you did an excellent job is

359
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,970
what's going to be more helpful or providing some specific areas where you can improve.

360
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:27,440
And this is just how this is a tool for improving that process of giving feedback.

361
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:44,090
And I'll note that the the there's a the they have like a set of people at critic who help faculty set up their assignments and everything.

362
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:51,469
And I was planning to set that up this week. But the woman at critics, she had to cancel and reschedule.

363
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,540
So I'm going to see her next week to set this up.

364
00:42:53,540 --> 00:43:02,119
So I'll be setting up that abstract assignment formally and critic, and you'll get an invitation to join and you'll be able to open the assignment in.

365
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:06,679
Critic But I wanted to present the guidelines so that in the meantime,

366
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:11,419
if you wanted to get a head start working on it, you can just start working on it, you know, on your own.

367
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:17,120
And then once we're ready with an actual critic link, you can upload it through critic.

368
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:24,920
Does anybody any questions so far? Any concerns? I may have missed it in I of this, but I kind of know my words do.

369
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,780
Yeah, that was November.

370
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:37,550
I realized when I was going through the syllabus yesterday that I didn't have a due date in there and I set the date for November 11th.

371
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:44,390
And that's just to give you as much time as possible to work on it throughout the semester,

372
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:52,250
but also get give you enough time to be able to review your peers abstracts before we end this semester.

373
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:59,800
Three questions. This is just a couple more minutes and then we'll be done for the day.

374
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:07,600
Do be constructive and use a positive tone, but don't use demotivating words or be too negative.

375
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:15,250
Remember, the peer you are evaluating will break your evaluation according to how motivational and critical you are.

376
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:22,060
The goal of your written evaluation is to give your peers a sense of what they are doing right and where they can improve.

377
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:30,700
This is done by being an accurate grader. During the feedback stage.

378
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:36,220
If you feel you did not receive a fair score on your evaluation, you can use the dispute button.

379
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,720
When you dispute your score, your teacher or to the courts will be notified.

380
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:49,320
They will review your work and resolve the dispute by either increasing or decreasing or keeping your grade.

381
00:44:55,070 --> 00:45:00,020
Finally, the feedback stage is where you'll see the written evaluations you receive from your peers.

382
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:05,560
Read them carefully and then give them feedback on how critical yet motivational they were.

383
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:09,010
Learning to receive feedback from others is an important life skill.

384
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:16,750
Remember, it's not about what you did right or wrong, but how you can learn to apply learning to future activities.

385

391
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:55,200
That's great because I love it. So yeah,

392
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:03,959
I'm excited to try this because there have been times where I've given a talk or something and had some peer reviews and I

393
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:09,360
felt like the reviews weren't very helpful and I would have liked to been able to give some feedback to people and like,

394
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:13,110
Here's where I could have used a little more help.

395
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:20,580
So I think this will be a nice way for us to be able to do a feedback in both directions.

396
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:35,700
That is all. So this last this last element, I'm just going to keep it for now and set it aside because next week we have a busy week ever,

397
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:40,229
like a busy agenda and I don't think we'll have time to get to this.

398
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:46,470
So I'll stick it on the table of maybe in a couple of weeks and we'll see if we can get to it.

399
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,550
But for now, I think that that's all I had for today.

400
00:46:51,450 --> 00:47:01,770
