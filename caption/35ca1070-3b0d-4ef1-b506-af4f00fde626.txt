1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,280
Is it going to be a most of us? Because I can't stand still.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:11,570
But I mean, I have to remember, I always tell people, remind collectively, never remember my fault.

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,629
This is why I have the note in all of my presentation notes.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,740
Hit the record. But now you think I get that? That's okay.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,090
So cow is what I didn't have in the slide. Is there length of lactation?

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,580
That's the other big advantage that they have over the other ruminants that we milk for dairy.

7
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:39,299
The average lactation cycle post calving and where you can milk is between 12 and 14 months for a cow.

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,380
So that's an entire year cycle that you're still getting milk.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,670
Now, the quality of the milk and the composition of the milk is going to change over

10
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,990
that one year period based on the age of the calf and what the cows are eating.

11
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,070
But you're still getting milk for that entire time period. Goats.

12
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,060
They're only about ten months long, so they're a smaller animal.

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:07,020
The lactation cycle is also shorter, which for us as a cheesemonger who is selling cheese,

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:15,000
means that the milk is also more expensive because you have a shorter season and a lower production per animal.

15
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,990
You have a sort of supply and demand that that comes into place there.

16
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,760
You can force goats out of season on their breeding cycle.

17
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,420
So you have what's called a fall freshening, which is happening right now.

18
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,820
Those goats will give birth in the fall and then spring fresh in our goats

19
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,440
that you're actually breeding in the spring for a full lactation cycle start.

20
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,180
That's how you get goat's milk year round in a dairy situation.

21
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,880
The alternative is if you have places that are warmer and climate, especially Mexico,

22
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,330
produces milk further into the winter than we do up here in the northern parts of North America.

23
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,590
And so there's a lot of the really big goat's milk producers.

24
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:09,240
I'm blanking on even some of the brand names because I have a bottom and so on, but like the kind of farm so I know for goat's milk.

25
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:17,070
Well yeah, the, the horse logs that you get a bit like Kroger and Aldi and things like that.

26
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:24,930
Not saying they're bad, but a lot of them occurred in the off season actually comes from dairies that are down in the south,

27
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:33,300
in the in the Mexico and they make the curd and freeze it and then ship it up north where the finishing happens for those cheeses.

28
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:41,650
Does that baby goat milk is a white chocolate, is that correct?

29
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,280
Yeah. So goats don't process beta carotene.

30
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,510
I have totally lost. Oh, okay.

31
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,069
There you go. You got it? I think so. Oh, yeah.

32
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,880
That's the wrong one. There.

33
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,690
That's yeah, that's right. There we go. There we go.

34
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:08,920
All right. And also, Casey. We talked about Casey in waiting the two proteins that are in milk.

35
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,570
Yeah. And the Casey's is also responsible for inserting some of the white color, you know.

36
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,370
True. So the question is where the white comes from.

37
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,280
Primarily, it's the reflection from those proteins.

38
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:29,010
Goats don't process beta carotene, so the fat is also white, whereas in cows that fat is almost a golden color.

39
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:37,360
What we think of as butter yellow is actually the color that grass imparts into the fat for cows and a little bit for sheep.

40
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:45,060
And you also know that milk also has a sometimes like a greenish bluish you can feel.

41
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,190
And that's a reflection of the riboflavin, too.

42
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:56,580
So like the proteins, the vitamins and minerals all kind of have an impact on taste and color, etc.

43
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,810
So getting the animal to right. Right. So it's very unique.

44
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,900
So sheep are the last of the big three. They give the least amount of milk per animal per day.

45
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:13,230
The fat content is a little bit higher in sheep than it is in the other two, which is why for cheese makers,

46
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:19,770
it's a particularly prized milk because it gives a really rich mouthfeel and a really great flavor to the finished cheese.

47
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,760
The other issue with sheep is they have the shortest lactation cycle.

48
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:32,010
It's only about 6 to 7 months after the lambs are born that you can milk a sheep for dairying purposes and you cannot force them on.

49
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:41,560
Sheep are just stubborn like that. They're like, Nope, this is not the time that I'm having a baby or just not doing it for that matter.

50
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:47,240
Yeah. Oh, they are good on pasture and forage.

51
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,190
It's one of the reasons why go in sheep predominantly through the Mediterranean, especially in that landscape.

52
00:04:53,190 --> 00:05:00,330
You lose a lot of the open pastureland. You get more of that rocky scrubland as you get down towards the Mediterranean itself.

53
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:12,000
And so you see more goats and sheep cheeses from those regions, things like a pack of rhinos from Spain and chagos and tortoises, that sort of thing.

54
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,890
In the U.S., sheep are also one of those political pawns.

55
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:25,290
So in the 1980s, when the rest of the world stopped importing U.S. beef because of fears around mad cow disease,

56
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,640
the U.S. was like, Well, fine, if you don't want our beef, we don't want your sheep.

57
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,240
I don't pretend to understand what politicians do in these meetings sometimes.

58
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:44,240
But it means that the genetic breeding lines that we have for dairy sheep specifically here in the US are very limited.

59
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,350
You can't bring sheep genetics in or out of the country and that's all for.

60
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,510
So you can't bring a live sheep in or out of the country. You can bring in that one.

61
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,330
Thank you. New Zealand lamb lobby.

62
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:04,040
But you also can't bring in other genetic material, so you can't use IVF to improve your dairy lines in the sheep breeds.

63
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,590
That has changed in the last three years.

64
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:17,510
So 2020, right before everything's shut down, we got ten new lines of sheep, three from France, I believe it was.

65
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:24,230
And so the sheep dairy folks in the U.S. were really excited because they were starting to run into

66
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:31,010
interbreeding and inbreeding issues with the very limited dairy lines that we had available to us.

67
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:42,049
And milk yields go down as a result. So here in the US, the average yield is a court to two ports per animal, per day in Spain and Italy,

68
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,550
and even into Greece, where sheep are really large part of that dairy landscape.

69
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:54,040
They've actually bumped those yields through selective breeding and managed breeding programs almost to the levels of a goat,

70
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,800
so almost to that full gallon mark per animal per day,

71
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,710
which is also one of the reasons why you see things like Pecorino Romano for ten,

72
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:10,160
$11 a pound and an equivalent cheese that's made here domestically for 30 to $50 a pound.

73
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:20,150
So that kind of scarcity of supply and quality of supply makes a huge difference in what's available at your your local cheese counter.

74
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:31,429
Just reflecting on these comments about the fat content industry, so when you have a chance, I have dairy that I supplement in in canvasing.

75
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,870
I have a composition of milk from various different mammals and things like fascinating

76
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:44,269
everything from human around for this is that definition for 4% human and 3.6% cow like you said,

77
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,030
sheep at seven and a half percent higher, etc.

78
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:55,670
But the two that I find incredibly fascinating are reindeer are at 17% say I think about where they live, what they inhabit.

79
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,419
More importantly,

80
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:10,740
fin whales have 42% sell a water buffalo on that might have water but I have I have nine below and horses where they're really low content.

81
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:23,300
Yeah I would like to bring this point up to look like mammals wean their babies at some point, just like humans who choose to feed their babies.

82
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:30,400
But. Mammals never drink milk again, right?

83
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:38,710
That's right. And you just think about that. It's like it serves its purpose for a very short period of time of their life to grow exponentially.

84
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,770
You know, like babies who grow three times, they're earthquake in their first year.

85
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:50,670
But like we are the only mammals on earth that continue to consume any type of dairy after we've been eaten.

86
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:56,860
And obviously that leads to interesting discussion about geographically where we have lactase deficiency,

87
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,170
you know, how that impacts where genetics play a role in that.

88
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,079
So we talk more about that in the precision nutrition class,

89
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:13,090
but just I make sure you throw that out there that not all mammals are created equal and their milk reflects what their what their offspring.

90
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,030
Exactly. So the cow gauci, those are the big three.

91
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,050
Those are what you're going to find most often at the cheese counter.

92
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,629
Of notable mention is water buffalo,

93
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:29,530
which is why I asked which actually comes in right around range between 17 and 20% butter fat straight out of the animal.

94
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:35,229
It's huge. It's why when you if you have the opportunity to travel to Italy and have mozzarella,

95
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:42,400
the buffalo that is buffalo milk and the richness difference between that same cheese, same process, same technique,

96
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,070
it could even be the same maker made with cow's milk,

97
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:54,250
which is referred to as pure dilatory or flower of the milk in Italian versus a mozzarella to buffalo is huge because of that fat content difference.

98
00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:04,330
It's also worth noting that water buffalo is actually one of the most milked by a number of animals in the entire world for dairy production.

99
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:09,310
But because of where it's produced, we don't see that as a dairy product here in the US.

100
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:16,629
So as you get into the northern parts of Africa through into the Indian subcontinent,

101
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:22,450
over into Southeast Asia, you see water buffalo being used and consumed as a dairy source,

102
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:31,240
mostly in things like paneer or yogurts, things of that nature where that high fat content is really going to be a boon.

103
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,100
But because also the climate plays a factor in cheese making,

104
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:42,669
that's also where you're not going to age something out for four or five years because it's an average of like 90 degrees.

105
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:49,360
And so the cheese making process doesn't really line up with those higher temperatures in those regions.

106
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:55,060
But it's worth noting that, especially if you're working with people from those areas of the world,

107
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:05,350
they may be more familiar with something like a water buffalo than they will be with our cow goat sheep sort of triumvirate here in the US.

108
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:15,010
All right. So once we have our milk, we've got an animal chosen, but we've pasteurized it or left it raw.

109
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,220
We have to coagulate. This is where sort of the magic of cheese making comes in run.

110
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,760
It is still the traditional and most common way of coagulation.

111
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:32,170
This is an enzyme that's harvested from the fourth stomach or the abomasum of young ruminant animals that have not yet read.

112
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,400
For better or worse, the veal industry is still alive and kicking here in the United States,

113
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:42,130
and the cheese makers are never going to outstrip that unless that industry shrinks significantly.

114
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,260
So the cheese makers are not out there harvesting baby animals just to get rennet.

115
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,639
That's a misconception that a lot of people like what the baby is,

116
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,950
and it's actually that we're using parts of the animal that the meat processing industry doesn't.

117
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:02,170
And so it would otherwise be a part of the waste system of meat production.

118
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,630
Those are soaked and then scraped in order to extract the enzyme.

119
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:15,580
So if you're working with populations where vegans or vegetarians are involved, that traditional rennet is considered an animal product.

120
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:25,960
It is also not kosher or halal. So one thing to note on that, microbial enzymes are sort of the modern scientific answer to traditional rennet.

121
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:35,499
It's the same tri motion enzyme. It does not have the pepsin in there as well, but that enzyme is grown in a lab facility.

122
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,700
It's a genetically modified bacteria that secretes that enzyme.

123
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:47,650
So depending on where you come down on the balance of animal products versus genetically modified organisms, cheesemakers just don't win.

124
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,730
So it's but it is considered both kosher and whole as well as vegetarian friendly

125
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,170
because there is not an animal process involved in those microbial enzymes.

126
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:07,870
On the labeling front, more and more cheese makers and more and more cheese mongers who label in a cut to order fashion are

127
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:13,899
making that differentiation between traditional rennet and microbial enzymes on their labeling.

128
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:21,670
So we're making it easier for people to make those decisions. But there's still a lot of wariness within the cheesemaking community that it's going

129
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,530
to limit who's going to eat their cheese and if they do more education around what.

130
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,430
Is rent it and where it comes from. They're going to potentially lose customers.

131
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,510
Honestly, as a cheesemonger who works with the end user customer.

132
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:40,990
We see more people who are making better informed decisions and making and buying more cheese as a result of that informed decision.

133
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,860
So I would say those fears are unfounded, but they're out there.

134
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,630
Any questions about that? That's really important.

135
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:56,200
If there's an enzyme where it comes from, how it was manufactured, how you can inform clients who can have it.

136
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:02,910
Well, sometimes it doesn't know. Sometimes, like, you know, a lot of people don't know when they're buying in high.

137
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:09,280
That's going to have lager. Right. We do our best to communicate that, as does the retailer.

138
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:17,270
But exactly. I think, you know, opening up people's minds, you will always tell somebody something new that they didn't know about the process.

139
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,420
Now, the last one on here is vegetable based coagulant.

140
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:31,440
So these are well, rennet is the most consistently used as far as historic vegetable coagulant have been around just as long, if not longer.

141
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:37,270
So this is producing fissile plants and plants that are related.

142
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:41,440
You can actually juice the plant and add that juice directly into the milk.

143
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,940
It's a softer set.

144
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:50,830
So for cheesemakers, it's a harder cheese to work with and it produces a very different texture in the final product of cheese making as well.

145
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,240
But they do exist.

146
00:14:52,450 --> 00:15:00,760
They're also sort of considered universally acceptable as far as vegetarians, vegans pretty much aren't eating cheese from any animal source anyway.

147
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:08,799
So we we talk mostly about vegetarians, but then it does have a flavor to it.

148
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,860
So because you're adding the juice from the plant to the milk, it's a very vegetal undertone to the cheese.

149
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:21,430
And a lot of times people describe a spicy sensation along the side of your tongue because it is a thistle.

150
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,540
It's in the same family as like stinging nettles and things like that.

151
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:32,790
So yeah, there is some question and then I never heard this presentation eight times.

152
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:42,520
I still think it changes a little bit every year to like last year I was I was off my game asking, I know it's all good.

153
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:49,270
We're doing the best we can. Yeah. You also have to sort of excuse the cheesy jokes that are contained to this presentation.

154
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:53,200
It sort of comes with the job. So culture, not just for the theater.

155
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,010
So this is the other really important part of cheese making.

156
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:05,590
So these cultures are the backbone for the fermentation process that turns milk into cheese as well as producing flavor.

157
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,810
When we talked about that whole cheese making process, there aren't many ingredients that go into that.

158
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:16,660
So everyone, you sort of have to dig in and find what's really important to the process.

159
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:21,100
So starter cultures are added to almost universally every cheese.

160
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:29,770
There are some cheeses that work without starter cultures, paneer, ricotta, things like that, where it's just acid coagulated.

161
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:36,159
But other than that, starter cultures are added to everything, whether they're intentionally or not.

162
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,340
So there are cheesemakers in France who say, Well, we don't use starter cultures, we're a traditional French dairy.

163
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:48,459
What they don't tell you is that they're using the same buckets that they've been using for the last 20 years.

164
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:56,980
And so the bacterial community that's infused within that word and has developed within that word is the same as using a salad or starter.

165
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:03,520
The starter bacteria still exist, whether they're being added intentionally or they're coming from the environment.

166
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,150
It's like you reusing oak and winemaking.

167
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:11,920
It's like, as we talked about with yogurt making or fermentation, like it's back slapping,

168
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:17,590
but you're not actually adding the previous ingredients just embedded in it in the vessel.

169
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:24,069
So yep. Reinventing the wheel by personal and personal is really interesting.

170
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:32,170
Look at some of those that work around sort of the the sour note method of cheese making, especially in France.

171
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,069
So adjunct culture.

172
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,510
So we're seeing more and more of these as cheesemakers try to differentiate themselves.

173
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:48,129
Helvetica is the one that's out there right now that gives you a really sweet character that's being used in a lot

174
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:56,470
of cheddars as people are pushing for more of that sort of sweet and sharp flavor profile out of cheddar makers.

175
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:03,430
But these are all added at all of these, I will say starter cultures, adjunct and the molds,

176
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,780
vectors and use are all added when the milk is still liquid in this cheese making process.

177
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,030
So adjunct cultures are there for flavor primarily. Sometimes you'll get them that are for texture.

178
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,710
They drive the cheese out or keep moisture in, depending on what they are.

179
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,770
But then the molds, bacteria and these these are where you're talking rain development.

180
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,519
You're talking things like blue cheese,

181
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:35,399
where you're intentionally growing a mold strain inside of a cheese to develop flavor and texture and other sort of rind elements.

182
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:46,650
So things like Penicillium candida, which is the white fluffy rind that you find on a brie pellet, penicillium g or Tricom is sort of a wet gold.

183
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,420
It's slightly sticky rind.

184
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:58,530
You're developing flavors from Ravi bacteria linens that develop those wet or dry ends that are super funky and what people refer to as stinky cheese.

185
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,610
All of those cultures go in at the beginning of the process.

186
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,070
Those white rhinos are all edible, right? Yeah.

187
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:15,059
So for the most part, if it's a natural rind, if it's not a plastic over a wax, all natural rind are edible.

188
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:19,000
Whether or not they add to your enjoyment of the cheese is a totally different conversation.

189
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,820
That's where you get out of the sort of technical side of cheese making and into the

190
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:29,390
enjoyment side of cheese consumption where personal preference really comes into play.

191
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:38,820
But things like Brie that have that white fluffy rind or other soft cheeses that have a rind that's relatively thin and well integrated,

192
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:45,210
is really intended to be eaten with the cheese. You're welcome to leave it behind personal preferences or thing.

193
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:55,440
As a cheesemonger, I am not a food police. So. So you've got this on the handout as well up at the top and a much nicer full color version.

194
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:01,950
But this is the sort of when we talk about how cheese making happens, this is the spectrum that we're on.

195
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:09,569
So on the lactic side of cheese making, cheeses are relying on the production of lactic acid in the cheese making

196
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,980
process and then the fermentation process in order to help coagulate the curd.

197
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:23,370
So you'll see things like fresh cheeses and yogurt. These are things that don't add those starter cultures, ricotta, some of the pioneers, yogurts,

198
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:31,230
all of those that are basically relying on the acidity to create a solid and the liquid out of the milk.

199
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:36,120
Read the other side, run it. That's where all of those coagulant.

200
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:44,460
So rennet microbial enzymes or vegetable or vegetable juices are being added to the milk to perform the act of coagulation.

201
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:55,860
So all cheeses sort of fall somewhere on that spectrum and you've got some of the very technical terms for those cheeses and their styles on that.

202
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:00,899
This is a class that I teach with eight different samples to the public.

203
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:06,870
So there's some cheeses that were today we've got a fresh cheese,

204
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:13,050
a milk cheese and a cooked curd cheese that we're going to taste as part of our tasting at the end here.

205
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:21,490
So this sort of demonstrates what's actually happening in those coagulation methods.

206
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,790
So you'll see the top one.

207
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:33,740
There's still some of those slightly hairy sort of micelles on the outside, and you'll notice that they aren't really close together.

208
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:45,130
There's still some good space in between those those micelles of the the casein proteins in the bottom, which is using rennet.

209
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,770
So this is why things like ricotta have that really fluffy texture.

210
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:55,549
It's because the proteins haven't bound as closely together because of the method of coagulation down.

211
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:59,030
On the bottom diagram, there are rented cheeses.

212
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:06,200
These are things like cheddars dudas grinders and you can see the aggregate is a lot tighter.

213
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,629
This is where texture comes into place.

214
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:17,450
So by using rennet, you're going to get a firmer set to the initial curd and a harder expression to the cheese overall.

215
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:31,090
Salt. So now that we've got milk, we've coagulated it using our preferred method of coagulation and we've added our cultures.

216
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,430
Salt is the last main ingredient, and where it comes into the process depends on what kind of cheese.

217
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:43,930
So direct salting is added to the cheese after occurred as formed out of that liquid starting milk.

218
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:50,980
And this is things like cheddar. The cream cheese that we're going to taste this morning is a direct salted cheese.

219
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:59,500
Anything that you're just mixing the salt directly into the cheese is a direct salt brine we most often see with things like mozzarella,

220
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:05,110
but you also use in hard cheeses like DUDAS and Parmigiano-reggiano,

221
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:10,959
those cheeses are brined and in fact that's the only way that they're getting salt in.

222
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,810
So they're soaking in that salt solution and relying on osmosis to pull the salt deeper into the cheese.

223
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:25,569
It's one of the reasons, too, why things like Parmesan and some Gouda and especially Swiss cheeses are

224
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:30,940
considered low sodium cheeses because they're only being brined in that process.

225
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:36,280
And so there's less salt that's absorbed, whereas like a cheddar, which is considered a very high salt cheese,

226
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:42,940
it's because they're literally taking a bucket and flinging salt into the curd and then pressing it into the cheese itself.

227
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,630
Does that change the water contents when they do the grinding later?

228
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:56,060
It can. The water content. So for a fresh cheese like mozzarella, it's going to keep the water content really high.

229
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:02,360
For an age cheese like a parmigiano or a gouda, it's initially going to keep the water content very high.

230
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:12,139
But then in the aging process, you're losing that water. So if you compare a cheese at about a year that's been direct salted versus brine salted,

231
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:17,780
they usually end up around the same as far as the water content of water activity.

232
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,470
It's just a matter of how you're getting the salt in the cheese.

233
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:27,750
Another question. I notice some cheese sold in the store, but also at room temperature.

234
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:33,530
They say because it's less water or something, so it's less water activity.

235
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:42,950
So they're lower moisture cheeses overall, and yet hard cheeses in general are the ones that are safe to display at room temperature.

236
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:50,690
And that's because in order to develop the pathogens and things like listeria, they need water and moisture to survive.

237
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,200
So that's why when we talk about those raw milk cheeses,

238
00:24:54,410 --> 00:25:03,080
something that long age no longer has the water content or the water activity and movement of water in the cheese to support those bacterial colonies,

239
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,190
the drying fruit using the water. So it has a longer shelf life.

240
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,280
It's not exactly what are we getting close to the cheese.

241
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,180
We are getting close to the cheese. So I want to see just two things.

242
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:21,590
One, can you just back up? I just want to make sure that everybody is clear on that slide that had the acid, the it.

243
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,930
Yep. And that. Casey Yep.

244
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:32,059
So I just wanted to Kathi earlier and jump into that because you're the expert I'm just earlier had said that there are two proteins,

245
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:37,280
remember in milk and that's casein and whey wave the liquid portion.

246
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:47,150
Remember, casein is the portion that's responsible for this black and there are subunits of casein or for different types of casein.

247
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:52,069
Alpha Beta Kappa. Oh, that's another green letter.

248
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:55,890
Yeah, but what for? But for our purposes, what's important to know?

249
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:06,410
Do think that like scientifically, these different casein components, primarily that alpha and beta, they are hydrophobic male like water.

250
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:12,889
So they kind of in those within those clusters, they cluster on the inside to protect themselves in a lot of water.

251
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:18,860
Let's just cluster together. Yeah, but the Catholics in into my understanding is actually hydrophilic.

252
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:26,239
So it's on the outside of those micelles. It's groovy, it's fine with the inner self and it's also negatively charged.

253
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,959
So they're not so they're bound to one off of each other.

254
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:37,190
So it's really this addition of acid and the environment in the page going to around 4.6.

255
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,479
Until you see this transformation of clustering.

256
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,210
It's like like we described, it is like those Kappa casein can get a haircut and right.

257
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:50,569
And they get cleaved. When they get a haircut, then they start the clustering.

258
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:56,809
So I think that's just that's important to know. You obviously know that like the back of your hand.

259
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:02,050
You know, I've learned that over the years. And I think it's important to you to understand.

260
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,680
I mean, yes, I would think back to like the old with us. What is the old nasty nursery, right.

261
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:12,550
You know, eating her eggs in ways, you know, she'd been drinking her way for the most part is eating her.

262
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:19,729
Right, because the way protein is also that's mostly contained in the water and the runoff from the cheese.

263
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:26,180
But when you open it with the open in the container before you stick your spoon at it, it's pretty solidified.

264
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:33,850
So, you know, once you start mixing it around or disturbing that matrix and then the liquid that will open at the second time is the way.

265
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:39,680
Yeah. And you can we didn't mention this but like sometimes when people during like sauerkraut we made sauerkraut.

266
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:46,370
When they're making sauerkraut they'll still take a little bit of that liquid from a yogurt containing that.

267
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,510
And you had it in like a rapid fire starter going.

268
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:54,290
You can you can forget that so much bath salts is out to make sure.

269
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:57,709
And there is more details in the other slide on that.

270
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:03,920
And then the other thing I want to say was just like, maybe we would take a break and then do the cheese perfect in that half hour.

271
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,610
If you're at the cheese point, I think I'm almost there.

272
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:16,250
Let me remind myself, because I don't know, we can take a ten minute break and then we can have the next 20 minutes up tasting perfect.

273
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:22,790
So we're going to touch on the last method of salting real quick, and then we'll take a break and we'll come back and get into our samples.

274
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:28,339
So the last method is dry salting and this is sort of the nerdiest weight of salt.

275
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:36,860
It usually is. It's also called surface salting. You're rubbing dry salt on the outside of a young cheese because salt is high risk topic.

276
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:43,850
It's pulling the water out of the cheese itself. It mixes creating a self brine on the outside and then osmosis.

277
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:51,150
Those polls that bring you back into the cheese by adding dry sold on the outside that are getting us salted cheese all the way through.

278
00:28:51,480 --> 00:29:00,270
This is done mostly with soft cheeses like Limburger and a question to Leggio, but you can also do it with older cheeses as well.

279
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,989
You occasionally see a salt rub on something like a carrier.

280
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:13,350
If they find that it's too moist and the water activity is too high, dry salting is one of those ways to pull excess water out of a cheese.

281
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,180
I mean, I think everybody was wondering like why we have to see so much science people.

282
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:27,360
But, you know, perfect example, like, okay, how do you practically apply the principle of ourselves as we talked about?

283
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:31,560
I suppose it's infused work. I'm not making applesauce if you add the sugar, right?

284
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,680
So basically different properties that do different end result.

285
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:42,150
So cheese is so much about like the chemistry of proteins of coagulation, you know, all the different components out.

286
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,060
All right. I think they're all probably too young to remember the Alton Brown episode on bread making.

287
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:56,320
Oh, I've got a yes. Okay. So in that episode and I need to find a clip because it would be perfect for this it.

288
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,120
So bread making and cheese making are not wholly dissimilar in bread making.

289
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,019
You're working with gluten proteins and she is making you're working with casein protein.

290
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,110
Right. But they form basically a giant grip.

291
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:13,740
And he used bungee cords in the example to show you that proteins have some amount of malleability.

292
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:22,440
And so as you make cheese, that matrix of proteins, if you use rennet, it's really close together and it's really tight.

293
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:32,550
So you're trapping some moisture in some of the minerals, etc., from the cheese, but not nearly as much as that softer set for an acidic coagulation.

294
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:40,229
But as you manipulate the cheese and we'll talk about the actual process as we taste through our samples,

295
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,500
because we're going to use that as an example of how we go through the process.

296
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,210
But cutting curd and manipulating curd, you're breaking more of those protein bonds.

297
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:55,530
So the more you manipulate the curd, once it's formed, the harder and drier a cheese you're going to end up with as a cheesemaker.

298
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,270
So you start out with less manipulation for a nice, fluffy, fresh,

299
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:05,040
something like a ricotta or cream cheese, and then something like a parmigiano reggiano.

300
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:10,830
You're constantly manipulating that to be able to get more of that moisture out of.

301
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:19,470
What is one of the fascinating things I remember about our first trips to the to the creamery were that because

302
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:25,799
you're precipitating so much liquid in these like kind of draining containers that go out onto the floor,

303
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,400
a floor with cement obviously cemented pretty sturdy.

304
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:39,510
And the acidity of the cheese making process had completely etched the cement into large chunks that had been worn away over just a few years.

305
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,889
Right. Yeah. It's just really interesting. So very toxic on the new floor and the build out.

306
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,940
Yeah. So that's less and less. So we break through that.

307
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:54,090
Okay. All right. So this is great timing. It's 1056.

308
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:59,870
Let's come back at 1105 and then we'll spend like 20, 25 minutes, takes this tasting up.

309
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:08,070
Okay. And I think there were pretzels. Oh, yeah. Oh, Jackie, Jackie, tell us what you brought that out there.

310
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:15,240
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Did you guys trying to come to a true.

311
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:22,200
Yeah, that's pretty good. Really good. Very mild, slightly sweet, a little fizzy.

312
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:27,510
Yeah. So this is your urine, is that.

313
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,900
Yeah. So, I mean, pretzels. And so I try to challenge myself.

314
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:40,710
So there's like perfect. But I have a weak one on the right and then on the left I try to make a gluten free one.

315
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:46,170
Sargento flour. So yes. Thank you for sharing that.

316
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:54,660
That's great. Yeah. Come up and help yourself. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

317
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,070
Oh, yeah.

318
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:12,660
I want to to friends. I want to make sure I feel like it's going to be a challenge.

319
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:19,430
And so we have our Yeah.

320
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:40,810
All week separate. I suppose a chocolate can tell you that is another like chocolate that you go with them.

321
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:50,070
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You know what it was like.

322
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,980
This is not working. No, no.

323
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:13,830
There's nothing worse than just like anything else.

324
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:23,760
Cause I just. I just. I don't know. I did actually know that it was.

325
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:43,200
But I'm really not going to let you know, because that's what I was doing, literally.

326
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,120
The next question. A question.

327
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:55,170
Yeah. Oh, how come I'm actually honest now?

328
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:04,079
I told myself, how come that is always like the lowest possible vein of Hastings?

329
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,540
But I want to know. So all of these things, all things out there rented for you,

330
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:18,569
specifically for vegetarians and other special diets that are that are avoiding the intestinal or animal products,

331
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:24,920
specifically because it's not for stomach, it's not considered kosher at all for a traditional run.

332
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,670
So they're just making sure that people know that it's on the mills.

333
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,240
Okay. Mm. Yeah. Interesting.

334
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:38,819
I mean there are kosher certified cheeses if you want to get really specific.

335
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:46,740
But most of the people that I work with at the deli are not that observant on the kosher side of things.

336
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,020
So they're looking for making sure it's microbial enzymes.

337
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,179
Often times they're more concerned about a kind of small family operation as

338
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:58,220
opposed to a large conglomerate because of animal health and animal husbandry.

339
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:12,180
They want to small. Yeah, well, you know, yeah, I think it has to be clean and there's rules around what you can mix it with so milk and can be mixed,

340
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:18,270
which is my traditional animal. And so that makes me.

341
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:30,500
Oh, really? Yeah.

342
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:47,760
Yeah. Oh, I don't know. Okay. I think there's a walk around, you know, that you listen, you might recognize, like, I'm,

343
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:59,579
I'm not sure what's happened in my life, but in my age group, I was 19, had a 61 really good idea for the half.

344
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:12,510
I'll take it. So yeah, I've done the study, so I'm just going to pull out a PowerPoint.

345
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:24,239
So the next time I was with my contraption in my mouth, I was like, Oh, I think my C, which I'm not prepared to do to take my back to the office.

346
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:38,330
So lots of things like we never have enough time to just give it our complete like I do.

347
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:54,270
I, I met this guy up the driveway at the farmer's market and he was a, he was an organic commercial business that was just getting off the ground.

348
00:37:54,450 --> 00:38:00,059
And he said, Can I see? You're like, sure.

349
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,170
And so he got like a $20 fermenter.

350
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:07,379
And it was really, really it was really a fire.

351
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:17,580
So the idea of making them back home now, right, you guys are gonna get your life.

352
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:22,430
And you did not have to find anybody. Oh, really?

353
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,390
Yeah. And they do. They can do that.

354
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:36,310
But this is what I like.

355
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:43,620
Technology. Yeah, it drives me crazy right after we've actually.

356
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:56,620
From our point of view, exactly as I did I a taste of what am I doing now?

357
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:01,960
I have to get my email. You should be able to access it.

358
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,870
I don't. I don't think I put it out.

359
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:12,310
Oh, you have to sign into your drive. No, I. Because I shared it with them.

360
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:31,300
You should go. I was like, I know that we're not.

361
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:47,450
All right. I got it. My I was going to say, if you don't mind, I just want to say a little bit easier for you.

362
00:39:49,630 --> 00:40:10,150
No worries. So let's go through the fact that you're not here for use of the one.

363
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:14,790
Yeah. Okay. Maybe that was too easy. I'm going to do something else.

364
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,510
You this area.

365
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:24,340
I can just do that. Okay.

366
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:29,030
Here is the first one. Oh, that's what I was.

367
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:34,090
I was a reshare, that one.

368
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:43,100
And now I think they're not much different.

369
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:50,620
I want to read a little bit more like that's the only way.

370
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:55,670
Yeah, you're right.

371
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:02,250
Okay, let's give you a little time to take a look at this.

372
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:07,840
It's awesome. All right.

373
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:12,100
I was excited about cheese. Okay.

374
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:22,060
All right. So the last page of the printout that I brought today is our sort of methodology for tasting at Zingerman's.

375
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,770
So when we talk about tasting,

376
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:30,819
we're approaching it from a professional standpoint of making sure that we're not just popping it in our mouth and going.

377
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:35,170
It's it's that difference between food as fuel and food as enjoyment.

378
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:40,420
And we're walking that fine line and finding food as a profession.

379
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,330
Yeah. So for this one, no, it is the first step on that chart.

380
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,740
We talk about where it's from, who makes it, what goes into it.

381
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:55,600
All of the questions that people are asking us at the counter of what do I need to know about this

382
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:02,290
cheese to understand what makes it special or what I should be kind of tasting for in this cheese?

383
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:07,270
Look at it. We tell a lot about food just from looking at it.

384
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:12,910
You know, if you pulled that box of salad greens out of your fridge that you bought a week and a half ago,

385
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:18,460
you can tell just by looking at it that it's a little slimy and maybe not what you want to put your smoothie that morning?

386
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,660
We don't even have to put it in our mouth to know that it's probably not great.

387
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:29,890
So visually, we can tell a lot about cheese, about texture, about the moisture content, things like that.

388
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:36,730
We're gonna smell it same way it's looking at it. About a 60 to 70% of what we taste is how we smell.

389
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:40,930
And so that's both in front of our faces using our nose.

390
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:47,920
It's also the post nasal olfactory processing that happens to the back of your sinuses at the back of your throat.

391
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:54,370
Fun fact our brain interprets those two sources the same exact aromatic compounds,

392
00:42:54,370 --> 00:43:00,280
depending on where they're coming in and being contacted by you, sort of smelling them.

393
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,250
Our brain can process those completely differently.

394
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:09,040
It's why a lot of times if you smell something like a limburger with your nose in front of your face,

395
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,999
you're like, Oh man, this smells like good locker room feet or, you know,

396
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,889
something that's less appetizing when you put it in your mouth and you're chewing that those same aromatic

397
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:23,230
compounds go up through the back of your nose and they're interpreted by the brain as meaty flavors.

398
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:26,770
So bacon or beefy, those sorts of things.

399
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:32,260
So the way you taste and the way you process those aromatic compounds definitely matters.

400
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:39,549
We're going to taste it. Think about where it hits your palate. What you know, is it right up front on the tip of your tongue?

401
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:43,390
Is it further back? Does it have a long finish? Does it have a short finish?

402
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:48,990
Those sorts of things. And then we score a Zingerman's, we score on zero through ten.

403
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:53,070
Anything that we score seven or below, we don't sell.

404
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:59,240
So it helps us establish a good benchmark for our product quality.

405
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:02,250
That doesn't necessarily mean that it's an unsafe product.

406
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:07,290
It's worth noting just because something is still safe doesn't mean it tastes good.

407
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:12,990
So that's where sort of we draw that line is it has to both be safe and taste good.

408
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,810
And you've got that sheet to refer to on that last page if you want it.

409
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:24,090
So we're going to start with the Zingerman's Creamery Cream Cheese.

410
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,739
There's a little spoon in your bag as well.

411
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:35,440
If I manage to miss getting a spoon while I was trying to both attend a meeting and pick up your bags this morning, let me know I've got more spoons.

412
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:42,580
So in general. So we're going to talk through the process of cheese making, using the cream cheese to start.

413
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:47,440
So cream cheese in general, you can use cow go for sheep or a blend of those.

414
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,340
In order to make this type of cheese, we're using whole cow's milk.

415
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:55,180
We get all of our cow's milk from Calder Dairy down in Carleton, Michigan.

416
00:44:55,690 --> 00:45:03,969
We really like using them because they have a really good ethos around their animal husbandry, but also they grow all of their own feed.

417
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:11,110
So in addition to the fresh grasses that they harvest and approach with grain during the summer season,

418
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:21,669
they also grow about 250 acres of hay and pasture that they mow and bale as their feed for the winter so they

419
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:27,390
know what their cows are eating for the entirety of the year and they're not doing any fermentation of that peat,

420
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,400
so they're not feeding silage in their process.

421
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:35,170
We get that direct from the farm in bulk taker,

422
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:41,620
we get raw milk in because we're allowed as a part as a processor to buy raw milk directly from the farm.

423
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:50,020
We use long time low temperature pasteurization, those big vats that we talked about for a minimum of 30 minutes.

424
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:56,800
And then once that milk comes out of the pasteurize, it's put into big vats and that's enriched with heavy cream.

425
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:02,740
That's where the name cream cheese comes from. It's because we're adding cream to the process.

426
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:10,430
So in this photo, you can see some of those that's in process.

427
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:14,850
This is where we're adding all of those certain cultures and the coagulant.

428
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:17,510
This does use some traditional animal based run it.

429
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:24,050
We make cheeses at Zingerman's Creamery that also use microbial enzymes, but it's not our entire lineup.

430
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:28,460
We also tailor the rennet that we use to the type of milk that we're using.

431
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,240
So we use a calf or a fuel rennet for all of our cow's milk cheeses,

432
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,340
and we import a kid, run it from Quebec that we use for all of our goat milk sets.

433
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:44,000
TAYLOR In that run, it is not necessary in the cheese making process, but we find that it gives a better set of the milk.

434
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,390
And it's because the goat's milk rennet is designed to break down goat's milk and vice versa with the veal.

435
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:54,920
So we tailor that it's not something that a lot of cheesemakers do, though.

436
00:46:55,610 --> 00:47:00,290
We're also adding the bacterial cultures at this point, mostly lactobacillus cultures.

437
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:10,580
So similar to yogurt making, we're using those of the starter cultures to break down the lactose into lactic acid in the warm milk and cream mixture.

438
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:19,550
These are all set out in the processing facility for about 12 to 18 hours until that separation of curd and whey starts to happen.

439
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,800
It's sort of hard to see in these pictures,

440
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:28,250
but there's a couple places where you can see a little sort of yellow green pools along the edges of the vat.

441
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:33,080
That's actually where that wave comes in. And we talked about the different colors.

442
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:43,130
So as the curd separates, that white sort of buttery character comes in the process for the way it's for the solids,

443
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:50,090
the way tends to be that sort of yellow, green as other minerals are pulled off in that process.

444
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,790
So the next step in cheesemaking is cutting or drainage.

445
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:04,470
And so this is where you're starting to remove the water from the curd in starting the cheese making process.

446
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:12,180
The picture here are cheesecloth bags. They're a nice, tight weave and they hold about five gallons of curd each.

447
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:16,230
For cream cheese, we're not cutting because as I mentioned right before, we broke.

448
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,700
The more that you cut or manipulate the curd, the more of that moisture you're pulling out.

449
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:24,690
Cream cheese is a really fresh cheese. It's meant to be a moister cheese.

450
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:29,340
So we don't want to cut the cheese at this point, but we do want to start draining it.

451
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,380
So we use them. They look like big pitchers and oftentimes they are big picture.

452
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:41,360
You take those that you fill the cheesecloth bag with that curd and we make sure the bag looks the way out.

453
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:45,450
It keeps the curd in there and slowly drains over time.

454
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:56,160
On the table. So these are tables about about the size of these tables in here, a little bit bigger,

455
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,900
a little bit wider, and they're gently sloped with a drain on one end.

456
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:08,490
So the cheesecloth bags are twisted at the top to keep the curd in and then lined up on the two sides of that table.

457
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:13,319
And you can see we've used a spare cheese mold down the middle to facilitate pulling

458
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:19,049
that moisture down off of the bags and out of the table during that drainage period.

459
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:25,640
This is going to happen over 8 to 10 hours of draining and those bags about halfway through are untwist.

460
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:32,340
Did we sort of jiggle them around sort of like you would settle something that you like for a flower bag?

461
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:37,170
I'm thinking if you want to settle everything down, what that does is twofold.

462
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:44,610
One, it makes sure that the curd has lots of room to spread out, but it also means that what's right on the outside of that curd,

463
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:51,450
right up against the cheesecloth bag, is it over drying and keeping the moisture from escaping on the inside of the process?

464
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:56,490
We're looking for about half the volume from that initial.

465
00:49:56,490 --> 00:50:00,690
So removing about half of the volume, that's almost all water and way.

466
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:08,500
Cooking and texturing happens in cheddars and other hard cheeses because this is a fresh cheese.

467
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:13,040
We don't do any cooking or texturing stuff. We're going to jump right to.

468
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:19,450
This is sort of what the curd looks like. It's a little bit like wet Play-Doh when it comes out of those draining bags.

469
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:23,500
And if you pick up a handful, it's got texture to it.

470
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:30,010
It's got that nice sort of clumpy texture and that visual and that touch element.

471
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:36,700
These are also ways that we evaluate, so we don't weigh all of the curd at the very beginning.

472
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:42,370
A lot of that is, again, that X factor in that cheese making recipe that we talked about at the very beginning.

473
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:46,060
This is where the skill of the cheese maker themselves comes in.

474
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:57,999
This is direct salted. So we are I don't have a slide for salting, but in that after it comes out of the cheesecloth bags,

475
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,810
we make salt by weight to the curd directly into the cheese.

476
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:08,980
It's mixed by hand to make sure that we're not over breaking it up, making sure that it still has a nice, fluffy texture to it.

477
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:11,910
But at that point it is ready to package or ready to eat.

478
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:18,010
The whole process from milk receiving to a ready to eat chew is about two days at Zingerman's Creamery.

479
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:26,510
So often. And this is often oftentimes is the French word for aging, and it's what's used primarily in the cheese industry.

480
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,460
This is, again, a fresh cheese. It's ready to eat once we add that salt and it's ready to go.

481
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:35,090
It's worth noting you don't have to add salt to this cheese.

482
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:42,830
That is purely a preference. What you do get when you add salt at the end of the cheese making process is twofold.

483
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:50,240
One, you get better flavor. Salt helps open up your taste buds and lets you taste what you're tasting more fully.

484
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:58,850
Without salt, this would mostly taste like sour milk. It's not bad, but it's not as interesting as it is once you add salt.

485
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:02,659
The other thing that salting does is acts as a preservative.

486
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:08,240
So again, making sure that it's not a great environment for those bacterial cultures to grow.

487
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:18,680
Our cream cheese is very acidic. It comes out somewhere around 4.2 to 4.4 on the scale, and then we're adding salt on top of that.

488
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:24,980
So while it is a fresh cheese, you'd think it would be a really good medium for growing things because of the combination of acidity and salt.

489
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:31,010
It's actually relatively stable. That being said, salt is the only preservative that we add.

490
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:34,700
So it's got a short shelf life only about three weeks from the time that we make it.

491
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,240
We do occasionally freeze this cheese.

492
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:44,690
It's a soft enough cheese and has a loosely defined curd structure, so the freezing process doesn't affect it the same way it would a hard cheese.

493
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:52,070
As a general rule, as a cheesemonger, I do not recommend freezing anything harder than a soft spreadable cheese.

494
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:57,319
Because what happens in that protein matrix that we've created when you freeze water,

495
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:03,010
it creates edges in when it turns to ice and it will actually break through those protein bonds.

496
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:06,980
So by freezing a hard cheese, you end up with a very grainy texture.

497
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:13,610
If you're cooking with it, it's not a big deal. But if you're just eating cheese for enjoyment, freezing is a great way to get a texture.

498
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:16,910
That's Sandy and gritty and just generally unpleasant.

499
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:21,990
All right. So that's how we make the cream cheese.

500
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:30,090
Let's go ahead and dig into those samples. So using those sort of five steps, again, all of your containers should be labeled.

501
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:34,350
This is where if you're willing to try it just with a spoon,

502
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:42,010
I encourage you to do that first and then try it on a little bit of bread that'll give you sort of that expression of the cheese all on its own.

503
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:47,940
There is extra bread up here too. So if you need more bread, we've got more bread.

504
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:55,700
If you've only grown up having, like, Philadelphia cream cheese, this will be a little different.

505
00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:01,130
So this is a pre-World War two cream cheese recipe that we use.

506
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:13,200
1936 is when it was published, and Philadelphia Cream Cheese is a product of post-World War Two industrialization and moving food a lot further.

507
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:19,110
Right. And it's really fine with me is really.

508
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:28,889
So this time of year I talked a little bit when we talked about milk the difference in well when you're making cheese and how

509
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:36,480
that matters this time of year is when the herd in colder has made the transition out of their pasture and into the barn.

510
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:41,400
And so they're getting more dried feed and they're getting a grain adjunct on top of that.

511
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:46,440
And what that does is it encourages the cows to produce more butterfat in the milk.

512
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:55,079
So this sort of shoulder season between summer and winter milk, it doesn't get cold, full milk for whatever reason.

513
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,710
It's just the shoulder season between the two summer and winter.

514
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:03,930
But it's a higher fat content and a slightly lower protein content.

515
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:13,139
So you'll also see traditionally in the Northern Hemisphere cheeses that are soft and high fat content being made this time of year.

516
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:22,500
Things like Vasher on My Door, which is a traditional French soft cheese that's wrapped and spruce bark and other sort of holiday treats.

517
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:27,930
They're a high fat, really rich milk that comes out of this transitional period of.

518
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:39,670
So this is from last week's batch. So we're in that like nice solid shoulder season and you can really taste in the milk very clean.

519
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:43,989
This shouldn't have a lot of you know, it shouldn't be very animal or anything like that.

520
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:48,790
It should be pretty milky, little bit sweet, nice and tangy from the acidity.

521
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:53,600
And then that's salt on the finish. What do we think?

522
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:02,840
Yeah, this is when it gets quiet every time, because everybody's happily either.

523
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:09,860
Right. All right. So anything that surprised you through that process or with that cheese?

524
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:18,839
It's kind of like it's yeah, kind of like especially when we compare it to the,

525
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:27,330
the Philadelphia Philadelphia ads two things that we don't they add some gum stabilizers that give it that firmer texture.

526
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:31,830
I guess it's shiny it gets very shiny as a result.

527
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:39,510
And they also they add more whey protein in a powdered form into the cheese making process.

528
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:46,380
So they're not just adding more butterfat in the form of cream, they're adding that whey protein back in, which is sweeter.

529
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:56,010
And so it follows up that like sweetness that you get when I taste them side by side am always surprised at how on the sweet

530
00:56:56,010 --> 00:57:03,630
malty side Philadelphia tastes as opposed to the like really nicely fermented acidity of of the Zingerman's cream cheese.

531
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:08,550
So what we used to do was cream cheese to make cheesecake.

532
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,690
You'll be totally different. Cheesecake. It'll be a totally different cheesecake.

533
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:16,080
Yeah. Our bakehouse actually cuts our cream cheese.

534
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:21,870
Two thirds of ours, one third commercial cream cheese for a standard cheesecake recipe.

535
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:27,630
Because it does, the chemistry of the baking doesn't work because of the lack of those.

536
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:31,350
Those comes on stabilizers that we don't put in our product.

537
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:40,500
And it. Well, yes and no. So cheesecake as we know it was developed for things like Philadelphia as a marketing product.

538
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:47,219
So I tried to make cheesecake with like Trader Joe's string cheese before and it doesn't work as well either.

539
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:50,560
Yeah, there's definitely something change. Yeah.

540
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:56,759
That makes a no bake cream cheese cheesecake or something like a no bake with the Zingerman's

541
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,839
Cream Cheese works great because you're adding that stabilization from the gelato.

542
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:05,579
That would be an expensive cheesecake. It would be an expensive cheesecake, but it's definitely worth it.

543
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:08,820
Yeah. If you want a treat, treat the people you love.

544
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:16,710
Yeah, exactly. All right. So we're going to move on to the retail concept for ourselves.

545
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:23,550
So we sell half powders of the creamery and it is currently $18 a pound.

546
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:35,060
So a half pound comes out to somewhere around 750 to $80 compared to the average price of a half pound of Philadelphia right now.

547
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:39,140
Story yesterday was to a sale for the holidays.

548
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:44,150
So we get one out of three. All right, guys.

549
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:47,540
Ready? Keep going. Yes, more cheese. All right.

550
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:53,359
We're going to move on to the Cabot nor'easter as this is the one that's labeled as cheddar, maybe slice cheddar.

551
00:58:53,360 --> 00:59:01,010
I forget on the label because we sold this in block form, but it's also the one that we slice at Zingerman's Deli for sandwiches.

552
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:10,790
This is aged around one year. Cabot Cooperative, as I mentioned earlier, is a co-op of about 200 small family farms up in Vermont.

553
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:15,830
The various family farms are sort of grouped by region,

554
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:24,780
and each region within Vermont has a cheese plant at it that makes a specific kind of cheese or product in their life.

555
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,780
They're a big company.

556
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:36,410
As far as dairy goes, they make everything from sort of cottage cheese and butter all the way through hard age cheeses that are aged by other folks.

557
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:42,110
For them, this is one of their standard lineups, though we hand select our batches.

558
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:53,540
So we actually have people who go out to Cabot every year and they taste through three or four batches, each batches, around 400 or £500 of cheese.

559
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:58,429
And we buy 3 to 4 of those days. So we buy specific days.

560
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:07,400
They're labeled for us and set aside. And then as we order, they break them down into half pound bars and wax them and then ship them.

561
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:12,800
It's a fun process. Actually, there's. I didn't.

562
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,240
I'll send it to you.

563
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:23,390
Cabot did one of the Food Insider visits a while back, and they follow that process for milk all the way through grading the cheese.

564
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:30,580
So this gives you a little bit better visual of a lot of that process.

565
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:35,159
So we start with milk up at the top and then they're using standard pasteurization.

566
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,870
So that's the plate pasteurized.

567
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:43,800
Those are those really warm plates that the milk basically flows over and comes up the temperature very, very quickly.

568
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:48,719
From there, the standardization of filtration is something that we don't do at Zingerman's,

569
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,800
but a lot of cheese makers do, especially if they also make other dairy products.

570
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:59,759
This is pulling off some of the butterfat and making a, quote, standardized product because milk straight out of the animal,

571
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,780
as we've discussed, is not standardized with different fat contents, etc.

572
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:08,940
So they're pulling off some of the butter fat in order to make butter and other products.

573
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:14,070
And then they're adding that into the VAT. They're adding rennet.

574
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:20,310
Rennet. In this case, Cabot uses microbial enzymes, so they're considered vegetarian friendly.

575
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:24,840
And that fermentation and microorganisms happens in the VAT.

576
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:30,330
That's where the Kurds and whey separate. At that point, there's the cutting and stirring.

577
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:36,120
This breaks down those curds into smaller pieces as we get into harder cheeses.

578
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:44,339
You're doing this to drain off excess water. The more you break those protein bonds, the more you let out the water that's trapped in that curve.

579
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:53,280
Initially, after that stirring process, you drain off the way that results in sort of if you've been to a playground recently,

580
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,680
that's sort of like spongy rubber matting that they have on the surface of the playgrounds.

581
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:04,860
That's sort of what the the map of those curds looks like after you drain the way off of the VAT,

582
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:11,790
those that map of curds is actually cut and stacked on the side of the VAT.

583
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:17,610
That pressure from the weight of the the Kurds themselves is pushing out even more weight.

584
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:22,860
That process is actually the chattering process, which is where we get the name cheddar from.

585
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:28,710
So that cutting and stacking of those blocks of curd is the chattering process itself.

586
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:36,030
From there it goes into a curved mill, which is where milled curd cheese, which is the alternative name for cheddar comes from.

587
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:40,710
And that just breaks those mats or bricks of curved back up into little pieces.

588
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:45,990
If you have enjoyed poutine at this point, we stop the process and you have a cheese curd.

589
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:52,980
So Wisconsin and Quebec sort of have the cachet on that.

590
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:58,070
Once you've milled the curd, you're going to salt it. Cheddar is a direct salted again.

591
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:03,210
They're sort of if you ever see them make cheddar, it's a ridiculous amount of salt.

592
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:11,820
It's like a four gallon bucket and this guy is just flinging handfuls across the cheese from there.

593
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:15,760
If you were making out of the dash, drive them, right? No, no.

594
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:20,430
I want everybody to know that I went into town to canvas right now.

595
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:25,799
Input. There's no slides in there. So if you are following the older slides, they might not be this detailed.

596
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:32,750
So if you wanted to log out a bit and then log back in and see, my apologies, I did not give you my fault.

597
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:40,200
So there is a point here where we could pull things off for fresh cheese or cottage cheese from the Kurds itself.

598
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:45,600
Basically, at this point it's ready to eat. It's just not engaged or the flavor hasn't developed.

599
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:54,870
But for the cabinet folks, they're then pouring in the molds. They use big 40 ton bricks as opposed to the circular molds shown in this diagram.

600
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:58,500
And then those go through a pressing process. It's a hydraulic press.

601
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:04,230
And again, this is just it's the same process or the same theory as squeezing out a sponge at your sink.

602
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:10,979
It's getting all of the excess water that's trapped in those those matrix squeezed out.

603
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:15,600
So you're taking the hydraulic press, you're pressing that until you've got the texture.

604
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:23,219
So it forms the Kurds back into a block and it also gets off some of that extra away from there.

605
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:32,520
It's on molding. And for the vacuum seal and plastic bags packed into a cardboard box and toiletries in a climate controlled warehouse.

606
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,070
But that's because they make a lot of cheese.

607
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:45,629
You can also, if there's a natural rind involved, you could cloth wrap this or develop a rind by drying the outside and just ripen on the wood shelf.

608
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:51,540
The plastic wrapping is a feature unique to American style cheddar.

609
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:59,489
Specifically, it's also of note. That's where we get that very distinctive sharp cheddar note in cheeses because it's an

610
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:05,250
anaerobic process of those bacteria ripening because you're vacuum sealing in plastic,

611
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:12,900
the cheese only has itself to sort of caramel cannibalize and use as its aging environment as opposed to aging out on the shelf.

612
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:18,060
You're getting more interaction with that aging environment and a wider variety of flavors develop.

613
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:21,330
So that's the difference between a sharp and a mild as well.

614
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:25,290
So sharp and mild is the age or aging process.

615
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:31,990
At least the where the real differentiation in Cheddar gets into is clothbound,

616
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:36,160
which is also referred to as the English style cheddar versus American style.

617
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:44,320
And the American styles is either vacuum sealed in a plastic bag or wax wrapped to achieve that anaerobic aging environment.

618
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:53,560
Whereas if you're cloth wrapping, it's usually brushed in either clarified butter or lard on the outside to create a semi permeable fat barrier.

619
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:57,130
So you get more air interaction and they age at different rates.

620
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,960
If you have time, go to the deli. Ask him for an English style cheddar.

621
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:09,660
Keep this in mind or ask for another taste of an American cheddar to compare the two because they are very different.

622
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:15,310
Once they go through that aging process. All right.

623
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:19,980
Questions. What do we think of the chatter? We drive.

624
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:24,399
Oh, yeah. Dig in. And it's not yellow. It is not yellow.

625
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:31,840
So the sort of orange or yellow color in chatter comes from the addition of Annatto, which is a vegetable based dye.

626
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:37,000
It's a seed that's cultivated here in primarily Central America.

627
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:41,140
And you see it a lot in other Central American cooking as well.

628
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:49,300
Things like a traditional Theresa or other dishes include that annatto for color and for flavor because it's really intense.

629
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:54,370
You don't have to add a lot to cheesemaking to get a really intense color.

630
01:06:54,370 --> 01:07:03,640
It doesn't have a lot of flavor. And there are, in fact, cheese makers who make an identical cheese have died and have died in a blind taste test.

631
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:14,920
And you really can't tell the difference. What do you guys think that this one is better than think it's again,

632
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:24,550
like I think the thing that I distinguish themselves is they almost melt in your mouth, not really need to chew it.

633
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:28,779
And it's not what it's like. It's like that in that way.

634
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:33,070
Actually, I don't know what I mean.

635
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:41,140
Yeah. So the like some cheddar. Yeah. Lots of white cheddar are the exact same thing they've just had.

636
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:44,800
Annatto added If they're orange and not additives, they're white.

637
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:48,490
So. So the vegetable is.

638
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:58,300
Yeah, I go green diet every night. So it is worth noting in the U.S. that, well, it's not a flavor indicator being dyed alone.

639
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:06,460
There are regional differences and different regional differences in the cheddar that can sometimes be identified by color.

640
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:12,630
So in the Northeast, sort of your Vermont, your New York cheddar,

641
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:20,720
they tend to go for a very acid forward profile and a very sharp profile and they don't tend to dye their cheeses.

642
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:23,530
It's also a drier cheddar style up in the Northeast.

643
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:29,290
Here in the Midwest and especially Wisconsin, they favor a lower acidity, higher moisture, cheddar.

644
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:33,369
Maybe they do also tend to die so well.

645
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:41,080
If a cheese maker is making their cheddar and they're all dying half and not dying half, that's going to taste exactly the same.

646
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:43,899
That's not to say that if you're shopping at the grocery store,

647
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:50,379
there aren't going to be flavor differences between a cheddar that has an innovative die versus not.

648
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:54,010
But it's not universal things, right?

649
01:08:54,190 --> 01:09:00,879
If it's the same brand and the same age profile, chances are they're going to be the exact same cheese on the inside.

650
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:10,480
Just one is dyed and one is not. In terms of the tech here, does the pressing concern have anything to do with the ability to come off?

651
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:16,370
Yeah. So the question is, in the pressing process, does that have anything to do with the ability to crumble?

652
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:23,030
And so the more firmly you press, the less it's going to crumble straight off the block,

653
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:29,660
because you you'll have fewer what we call mechanical apertures or mechanical separation between the cards.

654
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:36,469
And you push those together really, really well. That being said, they're not heated in that pressing process.

655
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:40,879
So the Kurds themselves are still distinctive individuals.

656
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:45,530
So something that's going through a chattering process is going to crumble more than, say,

657
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:53,030
a Greer where there's cooking involved and the heat is is eating in the living with those curtains.

658
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:57,050
Thank you. I saw him, Jack.

659
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:04,900
Those are different. But it's two different cheeses that are mixed together at this curd process and then pressed together.

660
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:09,610
Yep. Okay. I think I'm lost. I would say. Like, how?

661
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:13,570
What differentiates, like, cheese curds from cottage cheese and cream?

662
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:20,080
What is the process? Yeah, so it's it's very little.

663
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:28,160
Okay, so the difference between what we would call a cheese curd and a fresh cheese are purely that pressing stuff.

664
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:33,430
Okay, so you can take cheese curds and you can press them and voila, you have a French cheese.

665
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:42,309
But and for cottage cheese, those are usually back dressed with a mixture of cream or yogurt or sour cream,

666
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:46,120
something in that realm to give you that creamy quality to it.

667
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:54,610
But yeah, the differentiation between a Kurd and a cheese is like it's the magic differentiation,

668
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:59,320
light of like dressing, and all of a sudden it goes from curd to cheese and it's done.

669
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:05,530
But most things that start that, that you would eat a cheese curd of, if you're going to aged the cheese out,

670
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:11,950
it's usually, you know, a minimum of about three months before you would consider that a finished cheese.

671
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:18,400
For those of us that grew up in the state of Michigan and I've ever traveled north, you go through a little town called Pinconning.

672
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:24,250
What? Why? How does Pinconning come to be like the cheese capital of Michigan?

673
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,460
Like any is. They just have a cheese.

674
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:32,460
Is it? Oh, geez. So it's both. So it is a style of Cheetos.

675
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:35,820
It's related to Michigan. Know what I'm talking about? Okay.

676
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:47,140
Got it. Yeah. So Pinconning is a style of cheese related to Colgate in that it's a washed curd chattered cheese if we're getting really technical.

677
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:55,270
That being said, yeah, it's really just attrition, but it's the sort of cheese capital.

678
01:11:55,480 --> 01:12:04,570
So especially throughout the Midwest, in the 1800s, leading 1800s, you had a cheese factory or a cheese cooperative every 8 to 10 miles.

679
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:11,760
And the reason that that was the distance is that was how far a farmer could load milk onto or a horse drawn wagon,

680
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:19,120
get it to the cheese factory and get home in the same day and still have time to do the rest of their chores.

681
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:27,009
So every little town and village especially, and you still see this to an extent over in Wisconsin, had a cheese factory.

682
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:31,630
I'm going to say that with quotes because most were about the size of the room that we're in right now.

683
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:44,140
As the food system grew and became more of a national food system and we added refrigeration into the ability to move things,

684
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:46,629
then that's where you see milk.

685
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:57,160
And she is being more concentrated and sort of the larger dairies buying up smaller dairies and closing them to bring central production.

686
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:00,399
Kraft especially helped with that.

687
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:08,980
They were based out of Chicago and they would have refrigerated train lines that went up into Michigan and Wisconsin from Chicago.

688
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:17,229
And so all of the small town independent dairies that made things like butter and cheese and ice cream in those

689
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:25,180
communities were then just selling liquid milk off to a larger cheese factory in the outskirts of Chicago.

690
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:31,120
So especially in the Midwest, it's the story of the rise of craft, which is if you look it up,

691
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:37,570
it's a fascinating look at how economics played into the food system at the turn of the century.

692
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:50,150
We got one more cheese. One more cheese. This is the Google Earth Parmigiano-reggiano, which is referred to as the king of cheeses.

693
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:54,740
Parmigiano is named protected. You can only make it in Modena or Emilia-Romagna,

694
01:13:54,980 --> 01:14:02,450
and you can only make it using the recipe and techniques from the consortia that runs the name production.

695
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:09,080
It's approximately a 13 year apprenticeship. In order to be a master cheese maker for primary generation.

696
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:17,390
And that's when you're finally able to be the one in charge of making the cheese and not just an assistant under the purview of a master cheesemaker.

697
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:25,680
This cheese is produced by a co-operative within the consortia so well parmigiano-reggiano because it's name protected,

698
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:29,810
they don't differentiate the farms really. It's just parmigiano-reggiano.

699
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:31,129
But within that,

700
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:42,320
you have the combination of small farms that make 5 to 7 wheels a month versus a larger co-operative which may be making 20 to 30 wheels a day.

701
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:50,630
So this one is sort of medium sized. It's the only co-operative that has a female master cheesemaker within the consortium.

702
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:55,550
At the moment. She's getting ready to retire. So we're crossing our fingers, though.

703
01:14:55,730 --> 01:15:00,260
She has found an apprentice that's going to take over because we really love her cheese.

704
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:05,360
It's produced down in the lowlands in Emilia Romagna.

705
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:10,760
So it's not in the Po River Valley as opposed to upgrade to the foothills of the Alps there.

706
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:14,210
And it's got a really nice brassiness to it.

707
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:17,110
Northern Italy.

708
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:28,170
So if you've got the blue lights closed, so if you've got the blue and you get up and it's sort of in the hip region of Italy up at the top.

709
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:38,170
I mean, I've been talking to him all week, so I've been using my own work here by the example of where him comes.

710
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:42,960
Oh, there you go. So these come in big £80 wheels.

711
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:52,740
So that last slide that we had where it had the cooking process, the where it was cooked and stir, that happens with parmigiano-reggiano as well.

712
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:58,690
The chattering does not. So they keep this up to about 120 degrees.

713
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:02,590
Hold the curd there. It's not enough that it's considered pasteurized.

714
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:12,040
It is still considered a raw milk cheese. But this is this is where that textural component that we have the question about comes into play.

715
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:17,850
So when you cook the curd that heated that has been allowed to settle, well, it's still warm.

716
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:21,780
So it's sort of like melting the cheese together at the bottom of the vat.

717
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,380
They then pull that up out of the bottom of the vat using a big cheese class sheet,

718
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:33,310
cut each about worth into two pieces, and each vat produces two £80 wheels of cheese.

719
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:43,570
This is another one. I've got a good video I can send you. It is all in Italian, but it's if you watch the process, you don't really need car.

720
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:49,460
I liked what you guys have posted and your Zingerman's yeah yeah.

721
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:54,459
So that it's a very hands on process.

722
01:16:54,460 --> 01:17:06,340
It's a lot of work to learn. And then here I've got so this is the VAT itself that's approximately a 300 gallon vat.

723
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:11,800
Just to give you some size reference. That's a six foot guy standing next to it.

724
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:16,360
So it looks small compared to him, but he's a big guy.

725
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:21,370
This is after the so the first slide is the mixing of the milk.

726
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:28,719
At the very beginning in the picture here, you can see that's the cheese that's been formed down at the bottom of the vat and

727
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:33,310
they're getting ready to cut that in half to create the two wheels of cheese.

728
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:43,990
So this is the mold. So once the piece is cut into two, each one is settled down under one of these molds.

729
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:49,719
That green color that's around the outside is where you get the pin pattern on

730
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:55,150
the outside of a wheel that reads parmigiano-reggiano and it's got the date.

731
01:17:55,220 --> 01:18:03,400
And so you can see they've sort of added the different colors that's giving you the month and the year of when that wheel was produced.

732
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:08,200
Every wheel is basically tagged and tracked.

733
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:12,310
You can use a wheel of parmigiano-reggiano as loan collateral.

734
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:22,120
In Italy, it's considered that valuable of a commodity that if you're a cheese maker, you can use your back inventory as collateral for loans.

735
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,980
How carried on out is a brine finished cheese.

736
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:31,780
So after it's molded and it sits in those molds for a couple of days, it goes into the brine.

737
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:42,490
But each of these holds, I think, 15, 15 or 16 wheels in there, and they'll stay in those brine baths for up to a month.

738
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:54,130
It's a pretty long soak in that brine, but the up at the top, you can see the sort of they look like sort of shelves up there.

739
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:58,960
Those actually come down and they help submerge the wheels completely.

740
01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:05,229
There are also those are lifted and all of the wheels are turned by hand before they're re submerged

741
01:19:05,230 --> 01:19:09,730
to make sure that that saltwater brine is in contact with all the surfaces of the cheese.

742
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:16,630
So does the salt brine change the content of the cheese or is it just used to dry out the it does.

743
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:20,950
So this is actually the only place that we're adding salt in parmigiano-reggiano.

744
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:25,120
It's not direct salt. And so we don't add any salt directly to the curd.

745
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:29,560
It's just in this brining stuff that you're adding salt to the cheese itself.

746
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:35,620
Is anybody been watching this, Stanley Tucci. Italy's.

747
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:40,630
He encounters many of these wheels along the way.

748
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:48,940
Yeah, I'm quite enthusiastic about it. So this sort of gives you the scale of an aging facility for Parmigiano-reggiano.

749
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:57,970
Again, you can use that as loan collateral. That's something like a billion and a half dollars worth of cheese just in that picture alone.

750
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:08,770
In terms of what that would be valued at. And it's one of the reasons why the consortium is as aggressive as they are with sort of imposters.

751
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:18,070
And it's why you won't ever see a cheese here in the United States labeled Parmigiano-reggiano unless it comes from Italy, because they.

752
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:25,810
And why most of the makers here in the US use the name Parmesan, which is not name protected, it's not related to the branding.

753
01:20:26,650 --> 01:20:29,830
So but it gets around some of those issues.

754
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:36,370
If it's labeled Parmigiano-reggiano, it's come from the consortia and it's the real deal.

755
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:44,440
Once you're aged out, we crack it down and you can see it on your sample as well as in the picture that most texture to the cheese.

756
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:56,230
That's where, again, the cheese is just sort of breaking naturally as it dries and as those curds separate along micro visions through the cheese.

757
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:07,030
This is actually the previous slide. So there was a 24 month this is actually a 38 month deal that we've got open right now at Fidelity.

758
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:11,650
Little over three years. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

759
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:15,559
It's like it's how we start that and yeah.

760
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:23,640
After that. I think what I think about right, a lot of that is the size of the wheel.

761
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:30,730
So when you have £80 of something, it's got the mass that's going to keep the moisture content at a steady pace.

762
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:36,820
Most Parmesan cheese that's produced here in the United States maxes out between a 20 and a £30 wheel.

763
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:40,600
So a fraction of the size of these guys, I think. Yeah.

764
01:21:40,810 --> 01:21:46,000
What are the like? Maybe you said this already, but they're like tiny, tiny, little, little.

765
01:21:46,570 --> 01:21:54,190
Yeah, no, that's a perfect question. So those are crystallized amino acids as the protein structures and she is break down through the aging process.

766
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,590
They break down into various amino acids.

767
01:21:56,770 --> 01:22:03,580
Tyrosine specifically crystallizes when you lose sufficient moisture content, and that's what gives you that crunch.

768
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:10,329
In general, it's about a year before those tyrosine starts to crystallize between the breakdown of

769
01:22:10,330 --> 01:22:14,680
the protein and the amino acid and then the loss of enough moisture to crystallize.

770
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:22,300
So those the flavor crystals, as they're sometimes referred to as the cheese community, are a sign of a well-aged cheese.

771
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:28,090
But they're not added. They're not a thing that we intentionally add at the beginning.

772
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:31,570
It's just the natural aging and break down of the proteins.

773
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:35,530
We didn't try really any like rotisserie type cheese like that.

774
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:42,219
Right. Are those name protected? The one that has to be manufactured in the cave and some of them.

775
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:53,170
So Roquefort, Stilton. There's a couple other French ones that are less well known and a couple of Spanish and gorgonzola as well.

776
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:56,530
So there's a lot of name protected cheeses out there.

777
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:06,550
Last I checked, the European Union track a little over 350 as far as cheeses that had name protections encoded in law.

778
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:13,060
And those determine where they can be made, what they can be made with and a whole host of other factors.

779
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:19,780
We don't have that here in the US and in general our government doesn't recognize that those protections are valid.

780
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:28,690
However, within the cheese community, we try not to be [INAUDIBLE] to each other because I know I was on a roll,

781
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:37,870
but I haven't worked on required as much occurrence of F-bombs in my life as all alone.

782
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:43,030
Well, we're almost out of time. Did you have any wrap up?

783
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:53,010
That is any wrap up there? This is in the slides that you already have, but there's some if you want to dig into the world of cheese and more.

784
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:57,220
Okay. Well, that you are a correct.

785
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:05,950
Every time. So obviously you're not talking about the world meet, but this is what I'm going to do.

786
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:12,670
So I'm going to take the 12 slides on that PowerPoint that I still think are really relevant,

787
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:19,239
important, and then record myself, be like half an hour, recording maybe a little longer and put it up.

788
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:28,830
We don't have class next week. So, you know, it's just sometimes, you know, say, Oh, Susan, I want to hear the car for 30 minutes or listen to that.

789
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:32,770
So so I'll try and get that out by Friday at the latest.

790
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:40,120
I did remember I mentioned last week that most White House by theme, I mean, it is so cool because she was an artist also.

791
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:43,270
And so everything in here is handwritten and dry.

792
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:48,129
I have my go to like my noodle kugel page is one that I use all the time.

793
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:51,910
And this this Swiss cheese mushroom piece is my go to.

794
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:58,720
I always use this recipe, but the original vegetarian is pretty awesome.

795
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:04,360
Prebuilt pre bulk burger you know pre industrialization of the vegetarian I

796
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:09,399
was about to say this is late sixties early seventies the O.G. of vegetarian,

797
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:14,680
right? Yeah. Which one did you like it? It's a cottage cheese.

798
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:18,970
A green, I think it's a label. Is a Russian casserole.

799
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:23,810
Well, yeah. So if you guys want to take a look at it, I'll keep it in my office to you.

800
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:29,440
Happy Thanksgiving. If you celebrate, safe travels, whatever you do have,

801
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:35,679
because really we've got a couple of extra kits and any of the bread that you guys want to take to Nashua.

802
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:48,600
And I'm going to go back to the house. The cheese. No, tonight, you know, I'll take one for my coworkers that slowly smiled at me like I said.

803
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:57,880
Yeah, yeah. I even have an across the board.

804
01:25:58,130 --> 01:26:09,100
I'd be surprised. You know, I don't care if it's the difference between having something that's made in a factory without any protection,

805
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:20,620
that once it comes out of the pasteurization, everything's here. You know, I was thinking maybe you have a nice time for that.

806
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:35,530
You could tell me something that we're looking at. Where you're telling me that I was just telling students.

807
01:26:35,950 --> 01:26:39,820
Oh, nice to keep it open. Yeah.

808
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:43,810
You know, I was going to say, you know what? I didn't bring any of my cards.

809
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:50,050
You think that's something I can write on that? I was wondering what bread what bread you brought.

810
01:26:50,230 --> 01:26:54,370
That was the paisanos. So it's an Italian style with a cooler.

811
01:26:54,370 --> 01:26:57,960
Stover Yeah, it was really good. Thank you. Thank you.

812
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:08,970
Thank you, Daddy. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

813
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:26,410
I mean, I know, I know, I know.

814
01:27:26,500 --> 01:28:20,480
There's something, you know, I wasn't the best that for you when you're talking about how hard I feel like I is to do that.

815
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:54,980
But I know. I know you're going to have to get out of this.

816
01:29:04,190 --> 01:29:09,990
Probably that was great.

817
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:12,410
Like you're choosing to just.
