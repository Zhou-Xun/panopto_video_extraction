1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,879
He. All right.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,590
Good afternoon, everybody. Good to see you.

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,770
All right. We're going to get started. I'm excited to talk about the apex today.

4
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,100
That's our plan for today. You might see this coming.

5
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,500
You'll end up in your groups at the end so you'll get a chance to stretch your legs towards the end of the class.

6
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:38,160
So I missed you all last week. I know Dominique was here helping to make sure you all knew about the Ali.

7
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,639
It seemed like you were on pretty good save. Regarding the IOC.

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,160
But we're here for you if you have more questions about that.

9
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:55,669
Today, we're going to focus on the apex and hopefully answer all your questions and hopefully reassure you that you're in good shape.

10
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,120
I think and I think a lot of you might be in better shape than you realize for this.

11
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:06,020
That's why I'm hoping to help you. For those of you who feel like you don't have a plan at all, we're hoping to help you get a plan to.

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,060
So we're hoping you feel better after you.

13
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,660
Quick reminder, although I think you most you all mostly know this, the individual development plan assignment was due today.

14
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,040
I think most of you have turned it in. If you haven't, go ahead and get it and we can let us know if you need any help on that.

15
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,490
We'll take a look at that. We'll start looking at that suit this week.

16
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,040
Okay. So here's our plan. Basically talking about the apex.

17
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,300
I'll do a little recap. I know for those of you that had us last winter, we've talked a lot about Apex, some of our Ajami students.

18
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,350
You've heard a little bit about it, but we'll try to make sure everyone's on the same page.

19
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,950
We'll do a little recap and then we'll talk about how you're submitting it,

20
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,470
which is through this class that'll help us introduce some of the assignments that are related to the API, the fact practice product submissions.

21
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,540
We'll make a couple notes. You're all getting many of you, I think, or in EP at 530.

22
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,290
Probably most of you are in 530. See some nods.

23
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:09,100
So we'll just kind of try to make a connection between 530 and six or three because you have an assignment in there called the Apex or the fact sheet.

24
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,810
So I just want to try to connect that and kind to help make sure you understand sort of how they relate to each other.

25
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:21,070
Talking about just the survey where you guys are all at as a class and how how for those of you who still need to find practice partners,

26
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:29,169
how you can do that? I'll introduce the assignment that's due in two weeks, which is the practice product proposal, which again,

27
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,480
the point of that is really just to help you start planning and help you see that you're on the right path.

28
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,659
Or if you have an idea that maybe doesn't quite meet the requirement,

29
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,379
we can help you see that upfront instead of like waiting till the end of the semester to know that.

30
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,660
So it's really a planning assignment to get you ready for the submission and then

31
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,130
we'll get into the groups and we'll help you all think together about like,

32
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,280
does my idea count as an apex? What might work? Or Who are the partners?

33
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,040
Who did you work with? Maybe how did how can I find someone to work with too?

34
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,550
So that's what we're hoping to do today. Any questions?

35
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,800
All right. Very good. And maybe, maybe I'll just ask just to kind of take the temperature of the room right now,

36
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,060
like when you're thinking about Apex, like what's the biggest thing on your mind right now?

37
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:21,600
Just to help help us understand where you're at, what are you most thinking about or worried about or just wondering about?

38
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,690
Is there anything that's specifically on your mind?

39
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,400
He. Finding partners.

40
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,030
Okay, so that's what's on your mind is finding people to work with. Okay.

41
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,660
Which track are you in general? General IP.

42
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,180
Okay. In your internship was academic.

43
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:50,090
Okay. Okay. Perfect. What else? Any other things that are just, like, on your mind right now?

44
00:03:51,590 --> 00:04:02,990
Yes, please. Excellent.

45
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,380
That's what we're hoping to solve today. So just to say it again so people can hear it on the recording later.

46
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:14,090
Just one of the questions was just trying to know if what someone worked on will actually work as an apex.

47
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:19,250
And that's what we're hoping to clear up today. And some of that will be in your peer group talking to each other.

48
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,280
And we'll kind of come around and try to just hear and confirm.

49
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:28,090
I do want to just step back and say, like, we're trying we're not trying to make this hard.

50
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,110
We are open, we are flexible. Like, I think there's a lot of ways to make things work.

51
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,090
And that's why I'm saying that I think many of you are probably in a better situation than you might think.

52
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,600
And if you don't have anybody yet, we're going to help you figure out how to get one.

53
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:49,220
I would say, too, like nine times out of ten, if you did an internship that is out with an outside practice partner that is not academic based,

54
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,890
you probably did something that would count like. Most of you probably have done something that.

55
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:02,490
We'll work through that today. So please ask questions clarifying like that's what this class is for.

56
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,640
We want to hear from you. We want to make this conversational, make sure we're answering your questions.

57
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:14,200
So first, just just to recap and hopefully this is like becoming repetitive for some of you, but I just want to make sure we all are on the same page.

58
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,219
So first, the apex. This is actually a requirement for all schools of public health.

59
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:27,640
This is part of our accreditation. Everybody has to do this. So all your colleagues and other MPH programs and other schools are also doing an apex,

60
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:35,050
or sometimes they call it eight, but an applied practice experience. And the idea that you're applying the competency that you learn in the classroom,

61
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,530
you know, you're applying them in a way that comes up with some kind of tangible,

62
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:44,620
tangible product that meets the needs of practice partners and that is specified by these accrediting bodies.

63
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,790
And we think it's important to because it really links you to, you know,

64
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,400
what you're trying to learn in epidemiology and how you can work with it in the field.

65
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,240
We think it's an important part of your learning, and this actually is also set by the accrediting bodies.

66
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:03,040
There are two products that must be submitted. They are created with a practice partner and we can talk about what that is.

67
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,480
And they are linked to five unique competencies of those MPH competencies that

68
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,660
you've been learning in your core classes and some in your concentrations as well.

69
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,610
Of the five three need to be foundational, the other two can be foundational,

70
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,959
or they could be concentration conferences going to go through each of those three parts.

71
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,010
So that's to me, when I think about Apex, that's what makes it up to products.

72
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:31,660
At least you could submit three if you needed to, but released two products, a practice partner, and you link it to five competencies.

73
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,830
That's what it is. And that's how it is for all schools. That's not that's not.

74
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,140
We didn't make this up. This is like the requirement across all schools of public health.

75
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,489
But we like it and we think it's important. Okay. So first the practice products.

76
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,340
So what are they? They can be so many things. This is not an all inclusive width here.

77
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,129
I mean, honestly, if you think of something that probably counts,

78
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:56,840
like it's something that you work on with a practice partner, it's supposed to be something tangible.

79
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,290
Sometimes you can get a little creative thinking about what is that tangible thing?

80
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:05,510
Because sometimes it's a presentation that you made. Maybe it's the PowerPoint slide, maybe it's a recording of what you did.

81
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,180
You know, sometimes you have to describe it.

82
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,890
Sometimes people work somewhere where it's confidential and they can't share it, so they just have to tell us what they did.

83
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,059
But here's some examples. The the one that seems to be very common is the brochure, infographic or fact sheet.

84
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:27,020
That seems to be a common one. It doesn't have to be that, but that's one that is commonly done for our students at any time.

85
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,370
So you were doing an internship or working with an organization where you help them analyze data.

86
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,790
That in itself could be an Apex product. You're thinking about how you present it, how you turn it in, and we can figure that out.

87
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,999
But that in itself can be something that you did. It's a tangible thing.

88
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,879
You did help a practice partner, some kind of evaluation plan, a literature review,

89
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,400
a grant proposal that you helped with creating a web page or a dashboard or a user guide to use that dashboard.

90
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,850
A policy analysis curriculum that you made.

91
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,850
I don't know if you guys can think of anything else that I'm not saying or that's on your mind. It probably is a practice product.

92
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,140
Questions. Ideas. Yes, we to know how.

93
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,680
Good. So the question was, if you did data analysis, how would you show that?

94
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:21,820
So you do have to get it. Think about what you did. Maybe there is a results output, maybe there are some tables that you made or something like that.

95
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,820
You have to think about, you know, when you're submitting it, you have to make sure that de-identified and the stuff that you're turning in.

96
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,350
But that would that would be fine. That works. That definitely works.

97
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:37,620
And I think that would apply. You know, a lot of our especially rapid students tend to get involved in data analysis, and that's great.

98
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,350
You're using the skills that you've learned. So that will work and will help you.

99
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:48,310
And I'll show you in a minute how what we're asking for to submit it and how you're linking it to the competencies.

100
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,959
That's the part where we really will drill down into to make sure that it really counts.

101
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,530
And you'll explain those activities to us. So we'll get to that in a minute.

102
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,330
Good. So that's a good example. All right.

103
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,410
Well, later, when we are talking together, like you might have other ideas that we can think about with you.

104
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,990
Okay. Who is the practice partner? There's a lot of different things.

105
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,890
The biggest thing that and again, our accrediting body actually requires this, too.

106
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:17,420
But again, we think it's good to get outside of academia a little bit and connect with different people.

107
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,540
But this is basically a non academic organization.

108
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,660
What it really means to me is that you're using something in the field and somewhat you're making something that's getting used.

109
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:33,290
It's great. We all, you know, maybe you've had opportunities to participate in writing a manuscript that's going to get published.

110
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:39,370
And that is also very important. That is kind of seen as like an academic product when you think about it that way.

111
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,360
Like it's something that you're doing research,

112
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,240
you're eventually going to get it published and maybe then after it's published it will be useful in the field.

113
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,660
But at that moment it's not something that's used like by an organization at that moment.

114
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,430
Sometimes you're doing research that will get published, but you also made things.

115
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:00,350
You were working with an organization while you did that research and maybe you summarize the data.

116
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,829
You made some kind of you know, you made a report that goes out early to the the organization is using.

117
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:11,210
So that could actually be an apex, even though a bigger part of what you were doing was more academic research.

118
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,309
So it can get a little bit nebulous and we're here to help you think it through.

119
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,840
And we take the approach of, you know, how can we make it work?

120
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,580
How can you, if you can tell me who the practice partner is,

121
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,900
who is benefiting from the work that you did, whose need you're meeting, then that might work.

122
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:36,850
So often the examples are like local health departments, state health departments, any industry consulting firm,

123
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,940
for profit agencies, not for profit agencies, faith based organizations, health care systems.

124
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,790
Even in our university, some university settings will apply.

125
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:53,110
So the things that tend not to apply sometimes that affects our students is maybe you did a research internship with a faculty.

126
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,220
I was just talking to Kelly Borkowski and I know some of you worked with her.

127
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,580
Hers is probably pretty academic. You kind of is pretty internal.

128
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:07,930
You may not have had a chance to partner with somebody else outside where your data that you're working on also gets shared out.

129
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:13,810
But there could be things where maybe you're helping a university, our university health clinic.

130
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:14,530
You know,

131
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:22,240
if you're creating something that the university is using on the ground to help improve the health or somehow the public health of our community.

132
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,650
That's a practice product. So I think there's a lot of ways to make things count.

133
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:32,440
The trick is just the ones where you've had a very research focus, which are great opportunities,

134
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,560
but also we want you to have a connection to a practice partner in some way and we might have to help some of you think about that.

135
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,249
Any questions or examples of practice partners you want to shout out at me and

136
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,900
see if you're wondering about or we can do this later in our big groups too.

137
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,280
But. This is checking to see if there's anything on your mind right now.

138
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,940
Does that feel pretty clear? Like make sense.

139
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,660
Okay. Okay. Okay.

140
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,360
The competencies. Okay. You guys know you guys know about the competencies, right?

141
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,900
I do. You've been learning these in your core classes,

142
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:11,290
so you should know there are foundational competencies that you are learning pretty much in your core

143
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:15,340
classes and you have some concentration competency that you're learning in some of our classes.

144
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,850
Hopefully those are made clear to you as you're taking the classes.

145
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,270
But we have a list and they are, you know, I'll show you.

146
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:27,370
But on the assignments, I've got a link to a document that lists out all of our competencies.

147
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:32,859
So if you don't know, we want you to understand them because we want you to be able to say, What have I learned?

148
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:39,280
What did I learn in my MBA program? Like, we want you to make that connection between what you're learning and what you're doing.

149
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,990
And some of that is understanding what is the competency. And if so, you can talk about it too.

150
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,890
You can tell someone, this is a skill that I have, it's a competency that you have.

151
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,580
So there's the list. It has to be five competencies, five unique competencies.

152
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:58,810
So different ones across the two products. Three of them have to be from that foundational list.

153
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,650
The other two could also be foundational or could be concentration ones.

154
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:11,050
It doesn't matter if one product has four competencies and you know the other has one, or if you have the same five or two products.

155
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,140
As long as there's five and there's two products. You're good.

156
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:24,020
Okay. So that's kind of what it is, making sure everyone knows that. How are you submitting it?

157
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,540
So you've been hearing all along, you're submitting it in this class. Well, now you finally have the assignments, right?

158
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:35,450
You can see them in the canvas. Pages are open now. So the final submission of the Apex product is the apex.

159
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,320
I wrote that backwards apex practice, product submission.

160
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,650
I wrote it in the wrong order, but that's okay. Apex Practice, product submission.

161
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:49,130
That's the assignment where you are turning in the apex and meeting the apex requirement.

162
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:56,120
That is due December 16th. Basically, it's uploading the practice products and then there's a worksheet.

163
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,790
I like my worksheets, there's a worksheet that asks you to fill out a little table, which that's like the meat of it, to be honest.

164
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:10,489
And we'll go through that and then there's some reflection as well. When you download the worksheet, this is the important part of it here.

165
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,690
And there's this table. It looks kind of small, but you'll see in the example, which I'll show you in a second,

166
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:23,420
you can take time to fill out and you may adjust this table a little bit depending on what it is you are submitting and how things match up for you.

167
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:30,050
But basically when Dominique and I are looking at this to assess them at the end, we want to see what are the five competencies.

168
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,220
I want you to put the number and the actual full description because I might

169
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:38,960
remember now that I think 22 is that the IPG one like I kind of know that one.

170
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,100
If you just put 22, I might forget I want to see number 22 and without the competency,

171
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,400
I want to know who the practice partner is that you worked with.

172
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:54,180
I'm curious if it's internship related that doesn't really meet the requirements is this helps us know how our students are coming about

173
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:03,600
these experiences and then this is the this is the part where it really helps us link your competency to the actual practice product.

174
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:09,870
What did you actually do if you tell me you did you know something about communication?

175
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:14,129
Maybe you pick one of the competencies related to communication and your practice

176
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:20,490
product is maybe it's a presentation that you did or what did you actually do?

177
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,610
And this is in your own words that demonstrates that.

178
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:31,949
So you might just say, Oh, I, you know, I use different principles of talking to general audiences.

179
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,579
I revise it multiple times. I practice it.

180
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,940
You know, I did this a lot. I recorded it. It could be lots of different things.

181
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:49,200
And I'll show you an example. It may be that one practice product was the same for, you know, same practice partner.

182
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,480
So you would you could merge these as you like. I'll show you in the example, but what makes sense for yours.

183
00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:02,880
But what we're looking for is what is the competency that I can see a practice partner was linked somehow what you did because we'll be making sure.

184
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:07,049
Does it make sense somehow? If you tell me, I'm kind of blinking.

185
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:13,670
All the competencies are. But if you tell me you did some qualitative data analysis, well, tell me what you did exactly like.

186
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,050
How did you do that? And just, you know, a sentence or two.

187
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:26,340
Like, I created the survey, I tested it out, I performed the survey, I coded the focus group, something like that.

188
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:31,240
Like what are the activities you did that connect those things together? Okay.

189
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:39,160
And then there are some reflective pieces as well. One is just a few sentences or however long you need to.

190
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,760
Just tell us about how you found your practice partner. What it was like.

191
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,010
Was it a good experience or maybe not so good?

192
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:51,120
Would you recommend this for another student in the future and then how your work was beneficial to that practice partner?

193
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:54,730
Like what did they need and get out of it? So we want to see that somehow.

194
00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:00,549
What was that connection with the practice partner and was that what what need were you meeting that's in your own words,

195
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,720
what makes, you know, just a few, few sentences or so that that makes sense to you?

196
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,549
And then the reflection piece, which is telling us what you learned from the overall process,

197
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:15,940
challenges or surprises and something you learned about yourself. So just a chance to reflect on what you actually learned doing that.

198
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,440
And I'm always interested in finding out, you know,

199
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:24,040
I think often people are learning a lot from this and what it's like working with different types of organizations,

200
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,549
how messy it can be at times, how sometimes communication can be challenging.

201
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:34,450
Those tend to be things that people talk about. I have an example you can link to this.

202
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:41,459
So this is in the. If you go to the canvas assignment or in my slides, you can link to this as well.

203
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,260
But this is the example. So it goes through and you see this is the whole assignment.

204
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:53,610
It kind of define the different things. Here's a link is this link that links out to the competencies you want to see them.

205
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,290
And here's an example of one that's filled out. So in this case.

206
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,520
See if I can make it. I'm making it smaller on purpose so that you can see.

207
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,549
One practice product was a bigger one. It was a surveillance system evaluation report.

208
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,910
That's kind of a that's a big product, actually. That's a big project.

209
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,530
It could take a little while to do that. And in this example, it was leaked to.

210
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:24,060
Three competencies. So you see how they did this for the Smith County Local Health Department.

211
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:29,940
This is all the same. But there were three different competencies linked to this practice product.

212
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,900
So one was number three, analyzing quantitative and qualitative data.

213
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,490
Number four was interpreting the results. And number 21, that's wrong.

214
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,950
21 is perform effectively on interprofessional teams, not 20.

215
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,290
So then the activity part. So zoom in so you can see that a little better.

216
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:52,709
So then is describing what were the activities that helped you say number three analyzed

217
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:57,360
quantitative and qualitative data collection methods for a given public health context.

218
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,350
How did that line up to doing a surveillance system evaluation report?

219
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,330
So this person says, I don't.

220
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:09,960
I downloaded and clean a dataset for syphilis cases from the last ten years and analyzed quantitative data using descriptive statistics.

221
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,880
Give us some examples and associations of missing data by hospital use are and added findings to the report.

222
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,150
So just a simple explanation that was pretty straightforward. It was like data analysis resulted in a surveillance system.

223
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,030
What was the in that you did? All right.

224
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,290
Does this seem pretty straightforward? This part. Okay. This is how we make the connection.

225
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,930
There have been times we had a different way of so many of these in the past.

226
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:36,460
And there have been times where, like, someone would say what competency they used and they'd have a product,

227
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,540
but it was like a little hard to see how those were connected and they very well may have been.

228
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,800
I just couldn't really see it.

229
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:48,850
So I think this activity part really helps you showcase what you did in your experience, and then that's it, and that looks great.

230
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,700
So that's the example. And you'll see in this one, I mean.

231
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:58,170
You get smaller again. So there were, I think, three for that one.

232
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:04,010
And the other one was a literature review. And they use two other competencies.

233
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:11,660
They selected a concentration competency, the five critically evaluated epidemiological findings from published research studies,

234
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,110
and number 18 select communication strategies for different audiences.

235
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,520
And then again talked about how they did it and and then what the actual product was.

236
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:28,280
So that's really the final submission. And then in the canvas page you'll upload the products and you'll upload this worksheet.

237
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:37,270
If you have a special case where again, you worked like you were in a consulting company and it was secret, top secret, and you can't upload it.

238
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:41,680
That's okay. Just, you know, maybe make a word doc or something and just like tell us what it was.

239
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:45,630
Give us a little idea about it. Okay.

240
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:54,120
Questions? Yes, please. You're. We have been allowing that.

241
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,260
So I think that's fine. So just for people who couldn't hear the question, what can you use?

242
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,840
You know, you might be in one track, but you might find a concentration, competency that might match what you did better.

243
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:09,300
We're allowing you to kind of pick and choose between all the concentration competencies right now.

244
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:14,640
In theory, probably we should be using the lines like we were teaching you,

245
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,680
but I think right now we are allowing that as long as they make sense and you feel like because I think a lot things do overlap.

246
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:27,800
So probably stuff you might have learned and you might have learned it. So, yes, that's the simple answer for now for this class.

247
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,780
Any other questions about this? Look back over.

248
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,860
Okay. So that's what it looks like when you submit it. Okay.

249
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,770
There's a rubric in there too. So you can see, just like when Dominique and I are reviewing these,

250
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:51,299
we will use this as basically yes or no student submitted at least two products that are in,

251
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,840
you know, final form, you know, a good quality, something professional.

252
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,530
Yes, there are at least three foundational. There are at least two additional.

253
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:04,320
Yes, yes, yes. You know, the activity descriptions align with the competency.

254
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:11,790
You know, that's just us reading it and trying to make an assessment. So it's pretty straightforward that you basically completed all those things.

255
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:15,239
You've met those. All those things. Yes, yes, yes, yes. And complete.

256
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,650
You have it. You have met the requirement for the apex. So that's that's what we're looking at on our end.

257
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,900
The more exciting part is you finding the practice partner is doing the work with them and what you learn from it.

258
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,400
That's the exciting part of it. Okay.

259
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,880
I want to make a quick note about Apex and Epic 530.

260
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:39,660
I think most of you are. You raise your hand if you're taking 530. Okay.

261
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:44,690
So a lot of you are not all of you, but a lot of you are. So you've probably learned.

262
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:51,439
You've seen the assignments you have coming. I know you're working on the posters first, and there's like an abstract and a poster.

263
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,440
And one of your later assignments is the Apex assignment, right?

264
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:01,250
It's making sure I'm in there. I see your canvas page in there. So I know you have one called Apex slash fact sheet.

265
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:12,739
So the idea of this is that in that class, you're learning specific skills that align actually very nicely with some of the competencies 18,

266
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,410
19 and 20, they're are kind of in the communication category.

267
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,600
That's the purpose of that class, is to help you know how to communicate with diverse audiences.

268
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,780
So you're one of your assignments is to ask you to do that. And you can either choose sort of a hypothetical factsheets or you have the

269
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,200
option to work on something that you are actually using with a practice partner.

270
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:36,410
So she calls it Apex. Professor August calls it that because it could be an apex that you're working on for her class.

271
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,260
So you're doing it.

272
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:47,209
The assignment there is she's focused on the quality, like helping you learn these competencies, and that's where that class is focused.

273
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:53,000
So you will have an assignment you off to turn something in that that I think you do a peer review and things like that.

274
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:58,030
To get it to actually count as the apex requirement. You then submit it through 603.

275
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:05,530
So even though you did it in the 530 class, you'll be assessed more on your use of the you're learning of the competency.

276
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:10,450
That's what you're doing in 530, in six. But in 530, she's not asking you to show.

277
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,440
How did you do that? How did you link it to the competency in six or three?

278
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:20,350
You are welcome to if you worked on something in 530, that's with a practice partner.

279
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:25,150
You can use that and submit it as one of your apex products here.

280
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,030
You just link it as you did on that worksheet.

281
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:35,590
So the idea that is actually helping you spend time and improve a product and like really learn about it.

282
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:39,800
So just doing it on your own and then submitting it here, you're getting some, some feedback and peer review.

283
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,840
You're spending a little more detailed time on that product in her class,

284
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,730
and we'll have time to workshop another one, if you like, in this class, too.

285
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,460
But that's the that's the connection between 530 and 603.

286
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,480
So basically 530 is where you can work on one practice product in detail.

287
00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:00,880
Six or three is where you submit all your practice products and link the products to meet the apex requirement.

288
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,320
I hope that clarifies things. I know sometimes it gets confusing.

289
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,430
Any questions about that, please? She clearly.

290
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:17,050
Practice for. Right.

291
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:24,020
So I think the question was for the 530 class, if you say make the hypothetical fact sheet, then that does not count as an apex.

292
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,500
There needs to be a real practice partner involved if you're actually making something

293
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:32,270
with or for some organization or group or something that someone actually needs,

294
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:40,700
like for real, it's going to be used in the field. She is not bringing them in.

295
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:46,470
So. Exactly, exactly. So I think the question is, will 530, are you going to get help finding those practice partners?

296
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:54,270
No, but we're going to try to give you in fact, I think it looks like asks is 603 to get your practice partner, so we're going to help you.

297
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,080
And we've been for many of you, we've been kind of giving you ideas since last January.

298
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,280
Like, there's a few things I'm going to point out that I've mentioned before and I'm going to strongly recommend them again,

299
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:07,830
this time to help you link to people to find a nice practice partner to work with.

300
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,180
But if for her class she allows you to do a hypothetical one if you don't have something.

301
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,839
But I think for those of you that are looking for something, you need it for this class anyway.

302
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,530
You might as well get about that, right? So I know you want to know how to get there.

303
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:25,710
Practice partners, and we'll we'll think about that. Yes.

304
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,270
There is the opposite of that. If you've done something for.

305
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,700
Great question. Yes. So for a lot of you, you might have already made something over the summer.

306
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,870
You all did. You gave your work products. You were doing your internships.

307
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,870
You gave your stuff, you finished, you finish things.

308
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:51,360
You can still use things so you can take something that you worked on over the summer and you can bring it to 530 and kind of workshop it more.

309
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:57,180
Now it'd be nice if you're able to give like say you in you made an infographic, but then you made it better.

310
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,710
You'll have to assess, like, does it make sense to give it back in its better form,

311
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,150
or did they already print a thousand of them and they like to leave?

312
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,510
You'll have to assess that a little bit yourself.

313
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:14,970
But if you are able to say, Oh gosh, I improved this product and I know you're still working on it and you could give it back.

314
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,810
So you do have to kind of decide that yourselves. But you are welcome to use something that you already worked on.

315
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:25,810
If that's if that's the most convenient set up for you, you can do that for 530 and you can turn it in for 603 as well.

316
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:35,080
Good. Okay. My favorite question doesn't count as an apex.

317
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,620
I know you guys have those questions, so I'm going to encourage you to ask us that.

318
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:44,569
And then when you get your groups, we'll have you ask that too. But so okay, do these count as an apex?

319
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:49,370
You guys tell me you make an infographic created for a health fair sponsored by a local clinic.

320
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:53,270
Does that count as an apex? Yeah, that's good. Okay, I see nodding heads.

321
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,770
Mm hmm. You did a literature review for a university health clinic as part of their

322
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:02,270
quality improvement process related to offering pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV.

323
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:09,860
Does that count? Yes. Even though it's university affiliated, it's being used on the ground in practice.

324
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:16,140
That as a practice partner, I know we get confused sometimes about like academic versus nonacademic, but you're using that in the field.

325
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:22,820
That's definitely a practice product. What about a manuscript, a manuscript draft for research conducted over the summer?

326
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:28,860
You might have more questions. Sometimes I start this one, probably not.

327
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:32,140
But then sometimes I start to ask questions like, Well, how? Tell me about it.

328
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,150
Who are you doing it for? What is the situation like?

329
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:38,250
Maybe there's some way I can figure out how that it was going to get news right away by your practice partner.

330
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,920
I'll think about it, but probably not. That's one of I question.

331
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:46,950
The other one poster showcasing your internship experience at a local health department.

332
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:53,290
What about that? This is another one is like the manuscript.

333
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:59,740
Probably not, unless you can tell me how. Maybe the Health Department needed you to make that poster for something they were doing.

334
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,860
Maybe it is a if it's a poster for our poster session.

335
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,610
That doesn't count because it's not really they like to see it,

336
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:11,809
but it's not like if they're not using that in their daily work like they come, they may support you.

337
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:17,210
They're excited to see the poster, but they're not taking that poster and using it in their work in their field.

338
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:23,719
But maybe you had to make a poster for something they're doing something or they're doing or something else that maybe counts.

339
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,620
So there's a few right there. Okay, maybe tell me tell me where it's being used.

340
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,629
How is the practice partner benefiting?

341
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,459
Well, how are they using it? And if you can show me how, then it might count.

342
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:39,560
But those are the ones we tend to like. Oh, you said manuscripts and poster and like how is how are they using that?

343
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:47,030
Yeah, that's my that's always my go to when someone asks me is this does this count is how is the practice partner going to use it?

344
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,140
How is it benefiting them?

345
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:55,150
So I think that's a question that you need to ask yourselves too, like, how is my practice partner going to be able to use this product?

346
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:01,410
So maybe there's a way we're open to hearing it. You know, so that's that's the question we like to ask.

347
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,400
A descriptive statistical analysis for a phone survey conducted by the University of Michigan Library.

348
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:16,860
Would that count as an apex? I would argue it would in this one, I think, because it's they're going to use it in the field.

349
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,480
They're trying to do something for their library. Maybe they're improving. I might ask more questions.

350
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,050
I think maybe they're trying to improve their accessibility of their resources.

351
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:30,160
Okay. I can go with that. It's something they're using. It's something they're using in the field.

352
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:36,200
So I hope you can see that a lot of different things could count as an Apex product.

353
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,870
Just have some partner product, you know, a partner organization that's not, you know,

354
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:48,010
our own faculty researchers mostly it's just outside of us and that someone's going to use the work that you did in some way.

355
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:55,540
You're good when you think about what competencies you. Okay.

356
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,580
What else do you guys want to know? What else counts? Are there anything else you want to know?

357
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:03,960
Like, those are my examples. What do you guys have? Anybody has anything that they're working on and they want to know the accounts.

358
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:12,550
Please. I'll ask. Yeah. So one day I was.

359
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:23,550
Parasitologist. I have four kids.

360
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:32,420
I have. All of our data set specifically so that.

361
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:39,910
Drugs. Child. So I had to deliver that.

362
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,190
But how do you know it's. Also to be yourself?

363
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:53,040
Probably. Let's ask the group.

364
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:57,540
Do you guys would you guys think do you think that accounts? I think.

365
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,529
Yes. And again, we're we want all this awesome work that you're doing to count.

366
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:07,320
And you can see you just told me how it's being used in the field. She just convinced me.

367
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:12,120
And I was gonna say, too, like. Like you said, you're going to use your dataset for something else.

368
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:19,350
Sometimes you can come up with more than one product out of your research dataset or whatever you have.

369
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:23,160
You can come up with more than one product. Doesn't mean you can't use it.

370
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:31,090
Does that make sense? Sometimes people get their IOU and they get a you know, there's like all of it comes from one experience.

371
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:34,570
Sometimes people do multiple experiences. Question on the front.

372
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:42,010
So do we just describe. Yeah.

373
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:46,060
So occasionally this doesn't happen a lot. But every now and then we have a student, they might have worked.

374
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:53,980
It's usually like a consulting company or an industry and whatever they worked on is like not it's not ready for release, it's not approved.

375
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:00,190
So in that case, what we've done is ask people to describe what they did and just like a little word

376
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:04,540
doc or Google doc or something that you would submit in place of the product.

377
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,230
So you would tell us what it was, maybe tell us about it, and we could help you kind of troubleshoot that.

378
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,729
So the sort of, you know, case by case discussion sometimes,

379
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:18,459
but if there's something that for whatever reason, you can't it's top secret and you just can't tell us,

380
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:24,880
then we still want we know that you did something and we want you just describe it and you still do the matching of competencies.

381
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,590
We just want to actually see it. Mostly we want to see them. It doesn't happen that often.

382
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:34,050
But. But we'll work with you if that's the scenario that you have. Question in the back.

383
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:42,270
Much wanted there. Sorry.

384
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:46,650
I'm really realizing we're probably not capturing all the voices for the recording too, so I just want to make sure.

385
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:56,520
Thank you. I have a presentation that I shared with another student in HP HD,

386
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:07,050
and within that we share like six slides and then we both go into our own presentations with in the one should I like.

387
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,930
Cut hers out, even though part of it is also hers.

388
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:17,570
Gotcha. So it sounds like you created a presentation for some organization or something.

389
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,760
You did that with a student. You can work. You can work through group you know, group work for these things.

390
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:30,110
I think you could submit the whole presentation because you see it really in the final form and then in your activities.

391
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:36,350
Describe I created, you know, the first half of the presentation slides 2 to 10 or something, whatever,

392
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:41,419
and just tell us what you did so we can just see what you did and we see the final product also.

393
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,510
This is not being shared out with anybody else.

394
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:49,280
So it's not like it's a confidential thing because nobody else is going to be able to write.

395
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:55,880
Question. Do you think you. Bring in the mic.

396
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:06,080
Thanks nominee. How do student orgs work in terms of like practice partnering?

397
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:12,560
Like if you're doing like service, even if it's just with students or in the community, like can you do it that way?

398
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:18,680
Absolutely. I'm really glad you asked that. I think student organizations are probably like a under tapped resource for this.

399
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:25,610
So if you're doing something that is going to get used somehow and it's using your skills here, I think.

400
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:32,809
Yes. So if it's you know, there might be many of our student organizations do service may reach out in certain ways,

401
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:39,050
or maybe you're helping a student organization analyze something and make an improvement process, something like that.

402
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,430
I think that would be a really nice product. Yeah.

403
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,970
Yes. In terms of like does this count question.

404
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:55,990
I was at EPA this summer. I mean, my research project was on vehicle emissions inspection.

405
00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:01,120
So it was about production of air pollution. And I was researching basically policies.

406
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:06,730
There wasn't really any episode in it, but it was definitely an environmental health.

407
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:15,220
Is that okay? And for students, is it okay to use an IHS competency or does it have to be within it?

408
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:20,100
Question So you have a concentration. Is that what you're saying?

409
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,180
We have the foundational ones. And then you're looking at a concentration. Yeah.

410
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:27,569
Yes. Yeah. Okay. Maybe, I think.

411
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,720
Have you've taken classes that have learned that? Yes.

412
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:37,260
How? Yeah. I mean, I've taken a we have to take a bunch of classes in the DHS department.

413
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,560
Okay. I think that's reasonable because it aligns with what you've been learning.

414
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,229
It might be like if someone took none of those classes and tried to pull on a company they've never learned or talked about before.

415
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:52,020
That might be a little weird to connect, but if you've been always taking those classes, then I think that makes sense.

416
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:59,850
Okay. Thanks. Yep. Go ahead.

417
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:11,030
I love it. Um, could you clarify with what you mean by key informant interview in the slides?

418
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:18,139
Oh, sure. Yeah. Key informant interview. Well, if you haven't taken Publico five or six yet, you'll learn about them next semester.

419
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,610
Which doesn't help you, because that's in there. It's in our leadership class where we also learned about qualitative data.

420
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,569
Don't ask me about that. But so what a key informant interview is,

421
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:33,320
is basically you're just finding a few people who are kind of key people that are involved in a topic that you might be researching.

422
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:44,479
So maybe you were doing I don't know, maybe you were like trying to improve hand hygiene on a hospital floor and you were like,

423
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:52,310
you wanted to know why you couldn't get your numbers up, so you might select a few people to interview, and that would be a key informant interview.

424
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:59,059
So there's selected people and you could choose, but you would. So if you were doing that as an example, you would do that with a practice partner.

425
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:04,670
So you would you would want to work with someone who needed that. And then you could help develop, say, an interview guide,

426
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:11,330
or you could do the one that makes the transcript of the interview, or you could code the interview.

427
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,750
So that's what a key for an interview is. Does it help?

428
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:26,780
Yeah. Can I ask about my. Yes, I think. So I was I worked for the Israel Ministry of Health this summer and I interviewed a bunch of like

429
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:32,960
department heads in the government on like the state of the corporate forces in the country.

430
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,350
And I have all of these interviews like transcribed.

431
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:43,340
But as of right now, I don't know what my boss is going to do with them or if she's going to do anything.

432
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:49,120
But that sounds like a very good potential product and a really useful product, too.

433
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,600
So you took the time to interview people from different parts of the Ministry of Health.

434
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:57,620
And what was the purpose like? Why were you what were you looking at?

435
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:06,830
So there have been in corporate post this this year in Israel, and I think so I interviewed like the head of the Department of Agriculture.

436
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:15,920
It was originally to get an idea of like why they were having issues with enforcing the regulations in the first

437
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:24,650
place and then also why they were having issues determining what level of exposure was safe for the public.

438
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,300
And it was for me to get context for the data that we had.

439
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:36,080
But I do think that I got a lot of useful information that I should do something with.

440
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:40,640
And who created the interview guide? Did you have an interview guide? No.

441
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:45,080
Why? I guess I created them like they had certain questions that you asked or.

442
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,930
Yeah, depending on which department,

443
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:53,030
because I it's like the head of agriculture and then the head of the Ministry of Labor and then the head of the Food Authority.

444
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:58,430
So they different questions. Did you have a couple of possibilities? You have potentially an interview guide that you might have created.

445
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:02,890
You have the transcripts. You might want to think like one thing you could even offer.

446
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:08,600
Like maybe you did some early coding or something, like you did something to organize it in some way and give it back.

447
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,880
Or you could, you know, you could through this semester you might reach out and say, Hey, I've got these.

448
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:20,810
What is the next step in your mind? What would be help? What would be the next helpful thing to do for whatever their next step is?

449
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,430
I mean, ideally, really meeting the need of a partner, understanding what it is that they want.

450
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:30,830
So you could try to do that and work on that, too. I think you have some good some good options there.

451
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:34,560
Okay. Figure out what they're going to do with it.

452
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,080
Great. Okay. I'll get another question. Yep. Yeah.

453
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:47,040
Yeah. I mean, I don't know. Okay. Hear and the recording.

454
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:56,430
Okay. It's a quick one, I think. So if you and another student works jointly on one single deliverable,

455
00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:02,610
can you both submit the same deliverable to the as an apex if you define concisely what your role in the deliverable is?

456
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,590
Absolutely. Yes. Be perfect. Good question.

457
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:14,100
I'm glad you asked. Anybody else? Okay.

458
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:20,130
All right. A couple more things. Okay.

459
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:25,380
Okay. Just so you know, so thank you for completing the survey. This is what you all said in the last two weeks.

460
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:29,720
So almost all of you completed the survey. 43 of you said you were all set.

461
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,809
53 said you needed help trying to drill down into that.

462
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:39,930
There was 24 of you who did not have a plan and needed help getting started. 29 I think you have some ideas, but you might need help.

463
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,450
My hope is that as we review things,

464
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:48,810
I'm really hoping that that 29 that maybe a lot of you see that you do have something or that you're close or that you know you've got a plan.

465
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,160
So that's that's what I'm hoping. But we'll we'll see how that went. So that's where you all work.

466
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:59,560
For some of you. I know you're worried about finding your practice partners, though. So this is where I want to just step back.

467
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,010
And this really. You have to take the initiative to do this.

468
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:08,169
We can give you some ideas, but a lot of it, like talking about student organizations like that's a really great one.

469
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:12,069
I think in the past year when I've talked to students who really had a hard time,

470
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:16,670
we're just kind of we're like the last ones to finally get onto the Apex train.

471
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:22,599
They, they realize they had contacts like through their own jobs or just people they were connected to.

472
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,809
So it doesn't have to be something through that we organized with the school.

473
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,610
It could be something in your own personal life.

474
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:35,560
It could be what you've done as a volunteer or a job you used to have or, you know, your your church or,

475
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:38,950
you know, whatever faith based organization that you're part of, that maybe you're helping.

476
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:43,720
Like those are all great things. That could be something that is a good practice partner.

477
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,970
As Dominique said, we like to start. Did you do your internship with a practice partner?

478
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,770
That's like the best place to start.

479
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:56,620
So for those of you who are at a health department or some nonprofit organization or something, you probably did something.

480
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:00,130
You might think that you did something. You must have done something during your time there.

481
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:04,000
Maybe it didn't go well. Maybe now there might be a few of you were like, things didn't work out.

482
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:07,090
I know that probably might have a new view of you, but in general,

483
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:12,610
usually if you did an internship with someone that wasn't like hard core research one here at our school,

484
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:18,249
you probably we have something there and we're, you know, as we just said, like, what did you do that helped them?

485
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:22,090
And then that's your product. And then think about the competencies that you linked to that.

486
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:29,250
So if that's not the case, you're internship totally fell through or it was a focus on research or you didn't do one and you're, you know,

487
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:35,620
if wanted to create a student just starting or you're a Jamie student who was in the lab, okay, then there's other ways to find a practice partner.

488
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,990
So there's a great, some great things to explore.

489
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:43,750
I'm going to mention fast mention Ginsberg, SeaTac, I'll tell you both about those a little bit more.

490
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:48,730
But also just to highlight again your own connections, which I think works well for a lot of people.

491
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:57,040
There's actually you can click this link in the slides. This is sort of a like a listing for volunteers and it's a it's an interesting it's a local

492
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:04,180
it's Washtenaw County and they organize like organizations that need help with projects.

493
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:07,029
And you can also sign up to help people with projects.

494
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:13,570
So you can actually search on that and maybe some there could be some organization that's looking for someone to do program evaluation.

495
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:19,659
You can say, I can do program evaluation. I think on there they tend to give you like an estimate of how long it would take.

496
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:22,870
So that's actually an interesting resource to check out.

497
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:31,540
And then talking to you that maybe you have a faculty that you're close to, like even if maybe you did a really, you know, very focused research.

498
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:35,589
Internship, but maybe, maybe it doesn't work out always.

499
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:40,540
But sometimes there's a faculty member that also has a connection to an organization that they might be able to help you connect with.

500
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,989
So you could ask your faculty. That works sometimes, sometimes doesn't.

501
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:47,740
But also just talking to your peers and find out like, how did they find theirs? Who are they connected to?

502
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,670
Is there a club or something that I could get involved in that might even just be service related?

503
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:57,070
I would say to if you know, any students that graduate it previous students and you know who they are,

504
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:00,670
I have contact with them, but they've done this so they could help you to.

505
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,170
Absolutely. So my big plug for fast.

506
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:12,120
So where is where am I fat students or staff who all live in fast food all does a fast member and what can I see them.

507
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,979
Okay if you view. Well I do want to put a big plug in for fast.

508
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,490
And all these pictures are from a trip that some of us took to Kentucky recently.

509
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:28,230
If I wasn't here last week, our fast team was asked to deploy to Eastern Kentucky to help do a Casper,

510
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:34,350
which is like a rapid needs assessment to understand the needs of a community after the devastating flood they had about a month ago.

511
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:39,629
So we've got Rihanna. We've got you got Supriya, we've got Rashmi somewhere.

512
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:42,690
I don't think I see her. Don't worry.

513
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:49,920
Rise. Rising. I know you're listening later. We all went down with some other students, too, and we drove down.

514
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:54,059
We were there for a whole week and we all were dispersed out to do surveys.

515
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,510
So we were doing surveys to do this rapid needs assessment.

516
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:03,720
So there's some pictures. This is our whole group here. This is OSHA, who was the incident command from the CDC,

517
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:11,010
who was the epidemiology intelligence officer who was running it that was needed for cleaning and reconciling my data with my partner Ed,

518
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:16,260
who's the pre I got to work with as well. Here's Brianna reconciling her data as well.

519
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:23,159
That's a little survey form. So through fast, they're not always, you know, these big deep deployments like we just did.

520
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,640
But these opportunities do come and it's for people who are part of fast.

521
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:31,830
So those of you who are also members of Fast, you might have been able to do other projects.

522
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,790
They sometimes are local projects that have been really nice apex projects as well.

523
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,450
So I'm just putting these links here. You can check out the Web page.

524
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:45,990
Shoddy, shoddy. Richardson talked to us last semester, so that's who leads fast.

525
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:50,759
She's doing an information session tomorrow evening so you can register there.

526
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:56,610
If you want to find out more about fast, you do need to apply and get kind of accepted into fast.

527
00:46:56,610 --> 00:47:00,720
So if if you're looking for something and you're not sure how to find anything

528
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,879
fast is a really good organization to think about and I encourage you to do that.

529
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:12,840
Go to the information session, find out if it feels like a good fit for you and apply before the application is due on September 18th.

530
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:16,800
So that's fast. Any fast members want to say anything else or put a plug in?

531
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:24,070
You guys are getting lucky because I'm running out of time for your groups. Was there a comment back there?

532
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,579
No. Okay.

533
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:31,850
So that's bad. So that's a really great one to check out. A lot of fun.

534
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:38,160
There's also SeaTac, which, if you remember way back last winter, for those of you that were in our class last winter,

535
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:44,100
we had a Briana from Ginsburg came to talk to us about the Sea-Tac or the Community Technical Assistance Collaborative.

536
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:49,950
This is also a way where different organizations, they reach out to Ginsburg, which is a university.

537
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:56,610
It's part of our universities through other schools, too, but they help to organize basically community partners.

538
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,880
And there's ways for students to get involved so you can reach out.

539
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:04,770
And this is just from this is the website and it says, are you a student interested in joining SeaTac?

540
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:10,829
Learn more here. If you're ready to join, email Ginsberg. So also, this could be another good way to find.

541
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:15,060
If you're really looking for something, reach out to SeaTac and see if there's something that makes sense there.

542
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:18,570
I would do it early because I think as the semester goes on,

543
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:25,170
they kind of get people matched up and people seem to be more successful when you reach out at the beginning of the semester so fast.

544
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:30,930
And SeaTac to me are really like concrete things that you could do, but also, you know, you don't have to do those things too.

545
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,970
You can try that volunteer website.

546
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:37,080
You can look at the organizations you're in, you can look at the jobs you're in, you can think about all kinds of things.

547
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,620
Talk to your friends, talk to your peers and see what see what they're doing.

548
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:47,300
Okay. Okay, so we're almost there. No group time, darn it.

549
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:57,080
So I know you guys are disappointed. So the assignment that is due in two weeks is the Apex Practice product proposal.

550
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:03,170
So this again is the purpose is to just help us know where you're at and make sure you're on the right track.

551
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:08,720
It is okay if what you propose is not the same thing that you turn in at the end of the semester.

552
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,610
This is looking at your plan.

553
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:16,620
If you have a plan, I think I'm going to make this thing and then that thing doesn't work out and you have to scrap it and do something else.

554
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,780
That is okay. But we just want to be able to look at it with you and say, Yeah, that looks good.

555
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:24,259
Or actually, from what I'm seeing, you know, I have a question.

556
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:27,530
This may not this may not work. So this is that's the purpose of it.

557
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:32,540
And to get you planning, because, you know, you don't want to be doing this like December 10th.

558
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:37,270
When do on the 16th. That will be hard for you. So it's doing two weeks.

559
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:44,540
Yeah, it's one of my worksheets. So it's basically tell me about what your plan is.

560
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:51,200
So just in a paragraph or two, there's an example that you can look at too that you could follow after.

561
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:54,680
This is really, you know, free form depending on what your experience was.

562
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:59,390
It could be I don't know yet, but I think I'm going to do.
