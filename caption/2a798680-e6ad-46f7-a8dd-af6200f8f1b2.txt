1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:17,660
Can you go? Since you.

2
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:51,660
I know. You seems to be doing okay.

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,260
All right. All right.

4
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:07,170
That's seriously people.

5
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:19,140
And I thought I did something new with new eyes.

6
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,849
So I'm going to be presenting a lot of growing healthy kids in Ann Arbor Public Schools.

7
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,410
So I'm here that you're going to all are going to be the Ann Arbor Public School.

8
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,920
So this is an overview of the community problem.

9
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,440
So in my community assessment,

10
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:44,040
we found that very few children in Ann Arbor actually are receiving an adequate serving of fruits and vegetables in their diet.

11
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:52,710
Basically, healthy eating patterns is shown to increase longevity just because of decrease in chronic diseases.

12
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,400
And children who engage in earlier, better, healthy eating habits are more likely to be continued on in adulthood.

13
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:08,460
And as you can see, only 15% of Ann Arbor kids are actually consuming five servings of fruits and.

14
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:20,710
So growing healthy kids is a garden enhanced nutrition curriculum targeting healthy eating through direct education in school settings.

15
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,930
The purpose to increase the exposure to fruits and vegetables by tending to a garden,

16
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,410
increasing fruits and vegetables, consumption and modeling healthy eating choices.

17
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:37,990
So the intervention strategies is made up of a team of nutrition educators and classroom teachers and a master gardener with garden volunteers.

18
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:45,560
The curriculum lesson plans are all free and provided by garden healthy kids or growing healthy kids.

19
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:52,630
There are seven lessons and all of them are less than an hour, but basically introducing different types of fruits and vegetables.

20
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,590
The big component about this is the food tasting.

21
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:04,350
So there's a bunch of different resources. This is specifically for second and third graders, is where you see the most beneficial.

22
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:11,079
But there's all these different activities that you can print out and then you can go to the Garden Quarter.

23
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,530
So there is also an outdoor indoor and a mural portion.

24
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:21,310
So if you can't have access to this garden, which in our public schools do have that access.

25
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:27,009
But overall outcomes show that the is an increased consumption of fruits and vegetables.

26
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,210
There's also new exposure, but a big outcome is the secondary audience.

27
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,350
So these kids are coming home and introducing these new fruits and vegetables to their families.

28
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:42,760
Overall, increasing the exposure to fruits and vegetables. They're also drawing and interacting with what fruits and vegetables they have at home.

29
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:49,330
So they're eating them in the classroom and then their task and homework outside of classes to go and try a new vegetable.

30
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,569
And so some evidence of success.

31
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:59,890
There's been two major studies. One, schools in Oregon did a pilot program in 2008 where two counties participated.

32
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,370
And then in 2009 to 2012 were 12 counties participated in this.

33
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:12,930
Both saw greater increase in the number of different foods consumed and also a higher level of preference for a variety of vegetables consumed.

34
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:18,870
Overall, students, teachers and parents all expressed extreme enthusiasm for the camp.

35
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:25,809
And. There's also community based initiative in low income families that is growing healthy kids.

36
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,300
And a purpose was to prevent childhood obesity.

37
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:36,700
The results found that the increase in availability and consumption of fruits and vegetables had a 17% decrease in children's BMI.

38
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:47,320
Addressing the childhood obesity issue, and particularly among low income Latino immigrant families, which were comprised of 60% of the study.

39
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:57,040
Overall, the increase of access to fruits and vegetables did so beneficial for these studies,

40
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,540
and I think that's why Ann Arbor should incorporate these in their public school systems.

41
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:10,450
Just because only 15% of kids are getting fruits and vegetables, which is very much associated with slower decline in chronic diseases.

42
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:53,370
If you hit the slideshow at the top right those almost kick off ideas items in and you guys are the Ann Arbor City Council and today

43
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:59,650
I'm talking about the vegetarian model as a way to reduce food insecurity through increased fruit and vegetable intake in Ann Arbor,

44
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:05,140
Michigan. So here's my one pager. We're going to go through each section pretty quickly.

45
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:13,090
And then I told you why we should implement the vegetarian model, because it's been implemented in a lot of places.

46
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,530
So I'll go through successes as well. So basically food insecurity.

47
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:22,870
10.4 A Washtenaw County for 10.4% of Washtenaw County residents experience food insecurity,

48
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,469
and almost a quarter of those residents also experience low food access.

49
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:32,590
So food insecurity is basically when you're not quite sure when your next meal is going to come from.

50
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,490
And it's related to both chronic diseases like type two diabetes and cardiovascular disease,

51
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,000
but also is influenced by the social determinants of health. And the veggie ban model kind of tackles all of those things in a way.

52
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,600
And then separately, fresh fruit and vegetables are more expensive.

53
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,270
So if you're experiencing food insecurity, you're less likely to get five servings of fruits or vegetables a day,

54
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,420
and only a quarter of Washtenaw County residents get five servings.

55
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:01,000
Well, the dietary guidelines for Americans suggest that you get five servings of vegetables and three servings of fruit a day.

56
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:14,259
So basically the veggie ban is a mobile farmer's market and it provides low priced vegetables and fruit to communities

57
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:18,400
that may not have access to a farmer's market or a grocery store where there are low priced fruits and vegetables.

58
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,100
So you basically like it. It looks like I didn't include a picture, but it is decorated really bright and colorful,

59
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,790
and most of the YMCA is in the places where they've been implemented are running them.

60
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:32,860
So they have like the YMCA lettering and people are kind of familiar with the people who are working in the van.

61
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,919
And so it's kind of like a bright and fun spot in these communities.

62
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:43,660
And they have a very well-established way of they've recorded in the literature of figuring out which communities would benefit most from the.

63
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,930
And so if you choose to implement one in your community,

64
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,569
you can use these already published methods which kind of provide like the best place to do it.

65
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:59,290
So overall it decreases food insecurity because it increases self-efficacy of people like we know that you can supplies,

66
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,130
produce and is reliable, so you can always know when it's going to be there.

67
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,100
And it uses in-season produce, which also helps lower the cost.

68
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,020
And then because it's moving into communities, instead of having communities come to it,

69
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,759
it lowers barriers to food insecurity, like access to transportation and grocery store access.

70
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,910
And in multiple, multiple studies, the average increase produced consumption was 1.6 servings a day.

71
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,530
So moving people up by almost two servings a day is pretty beneficial.

72
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,140
And then this I included at the bottom. The vegetation is conducive to Ann Arbor because of the Mason food covered and food gatherers,

73
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,440
although those establishments are already no well known in the community.

74
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:48,760
So using the budget as a way to increase access to those resources would be like a first step in and kind of implementing the model.

75
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:55,360
And we could use it as a stepping stone to having the Ann Arbor YMCA or other community partners implement the project themselves.

76
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,139
And that way you kind of get word up and the community understands what the program is,

77
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,450
and then you can increase the amount of people who are using it,

78
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:08,980
because if they don't know where the program is, then it doesn't have the same effects as increasing service per day.

79
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:15,790
And so overall, the vegetation is a pretty well-established way to increase vegetable consumption.

80
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:22,390
And then through that method, it kind of lower food insecurity because of increased self-efficacy and access to produce.

81
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:51,950
So. Hi, everyone.

82
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,890
I'm sure. And you guys are the Washington County community.

83
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:09,829
And I was looking at the elderly population ages 65 and older, and we found 80% of elderly people less than five fruits and vegetables per day.

84
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:13,010
And this can lead to malnutrition, chronic diseases such as stroke,

85
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:18,740
cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, and a social determinant that can impact this is income.

86
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:24,350
So when looking for a program that could reduce all of these,

87
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:31,729
the home delivered and congregate meal service for older adults was created by the Community Preventive Services Task Force,

88
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:39,470
which allows for home meals to be delivered to the elderly, age 60 and older, and that lived independently.

89
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,520
And so what they did is they created this program to reach different communities.

90
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:51,860
And as they reach these communities, what they do is they take a they gather all the information and then after they gather information,

91
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,500
they do systematic reviews to see what was effective and what wasn't.

92
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:03,950
And so one of the goals of these of this program is to reduce malnutrition, along with increased social connectedness by partnering with the CDC.

93
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,309
And so the effectiveness of this program is they reached their goal.

94
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:13,700
They were able to decrease malnutrition in the elderly, along with reducing food insecurity.

95
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:24,590
In regards to the social connectedness, they were able to increase the quality of life for the elderly along with decreased depressive symptoms,

96
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,250
which is kind of key when it comes to the social connectedness aspect.

97
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:35,150
And when implementing this in the Washtenaw County, looking at 80% of the elderly that are malnutrition.

98
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,200
Malnutrition? Excuse me.

99
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:56,810
We can. Sorry, but. Okay.

100
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:07,040
So this will allow the elderly to have it can reach lower income elderly neighborhoods along with teaming up with Meals

101
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:16,490
on Wheels and different food pantries to reach the elderly and have the food distributed as a distance by one teacher.

102
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:56,260
Thank you so much. It's our slight increase.

103
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:04,780
It only came out. What you sent was just the PDA, just by understanding how it works.

104
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,190
Good morning, Mayor Duncan. And City Council members. City of Detroit.

105
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:16,600
We'd like to start this morning by providing some context for some overarching matters that affect the city of Detroit and its residents.

106
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:22,180
Ten years ago, the city Detroit filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in the history of the United States.

107
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:29,920
Since that time, the city has had to address the issues that came from decades of neglected infrastructure, public works and social services.

108
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,290
Looking at the statistics here,

109
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:40,090
what we already know about the city is that it has been a majority minority city for the last 50 years and a third of the population lives in poverty.

110
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:48,580
Right now, the city of Detroit has a nearly 40% obesity rate, with 35% of residents reporting low levels of physical activity.

111
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,760
The two issues that we're most often cited as barriers to physical activity by residents are not made here.

112
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:06,370
So in early 2021, the city of Detroit began to develop its own ten year strategic plan to address the issues of public health,

113
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,200
the environment and connectivity.

114
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:16,960
By prioritizing a series of capital projects, using their limited resources to improve public spaces and programing, using an equity framework.

115
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,810
Our assessment identified five key priorities for addressing obesity through a physical activity intervention.

116
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,660
The five priorities can be seen here.

117
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:34,180
These maps highlight the city's ability to address two of the priorities walkable access and focusing on underserved communities.

118
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,820
Currently, 80% of Detroit residents are within walking distance of a park.

119
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:45,700
And that's the bottom map with the blue no more than a half mile from at least one park.

120
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,040
Looking at the maps above identifying populations of color and low income households,

121
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,530
we can see that the current inventory does more than an adequate job of serving the most marginalized communities.

122
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:03,700
And in the next ten years, the Parks and Rec Strategic Plan addresses how they will get to 95% by 2033.

123
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:12,670
So this chart here, which is to to try to change plan details of all the initiatives that are to

124
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:16,960
be completed in the first year of the city's existing plan beginning in 2023.

125
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:25,030
The START items address our remaining three priorities from our assessment year round programing, safety and improved communication.

126
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,710
I love this quote here. Innovation is rewarded.

127
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,700
Execution is more than ideas are great.

128
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,780
But if you can't bring ideas into reality because they are financially impractical,

129
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:43,870
lack infrastructure or take too long to develop and you can't serve the most vulnerable populations.

130
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:48,100
Execution is worshiped because it makes things happen.

131
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:56,200
Given the city's limited resources, we believe it's important to build upon an existing plan that the city already has budgeted for.

132
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:04,090
So let's make something. The Community Preventative Services Task Force conducted a systemic,

133
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:09,129
systematic review of 38 studies on municipal infrastructure and public health

134
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,690
interventions and found that when parks and Greenway improvements like the city's

135
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:18,519
Parks and Rec strategic plan repair with deliberate programing medium park use

136
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:25,240
increased by 17% and there was an 18.3% increase in moderate or vigorous exercise.

137
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:31,300
This review became the foundation for the CDC's Active People Healthy Nation Initiative,

138
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,810
which provides easy to implement strategies that promote physical activity in the community.

139
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,230
And what we're seeing here are some of their marketing materials.

140
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:45,850
This note Cost Tool Kit provides marketing materials, evidence based interventions and community masterplan resources.

141
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:52,179
Our recommendation is to use the existing Parks and Rec strategic plan as a foundation for a physical

142
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:58,780
activity intervention aimed at reducing obesity by leveraging the assets available through the active people.

143
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:04,360
Healthy Nature Action. If you haven't been keeping track,

144
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,709
you've addressed all five of our priorities without adding a single dollar to

145
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:14,200
Detroit's position or acquiring any more staff and at no extra cost of the taxpayers.

146
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:22,270
Furthermore, we believe there may be additional cost savings as outside consultants would not have to be hired to develop programing and materials.

147
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:57,799
Thank you. Everyone here, the Sterling Heights Public School where my name is Ina,

148
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:03,920
and I'm here to advocate for a school based healthy food pantry with the intent to augment the general health of adolescents in Sterling Heights,

149
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,000
Michigan. So there are a couple of general health issues that face adolescents in this community.

150
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,530
One is food insecurity.

151
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:15,290
If you look at income residents under the age of 18 years, more than one in six are food insecure, which is a really high rate.

152
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:19,370
And it's higher than the rate for the state of Michigan. So this is something we want to be sure to address.

153
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,739
And then another issue is food quality.

154
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,870
A really low amount of Michigan high school students are reaching their daily recommended intake of fruits and vegetables.

155
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,450
And for most of them, it's lower than the average for a U.S. student.

156
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,190
So they want to be sure to increase because it has a lot of thanks for your help.

157
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,609
And then we also specifically address consumption behaviors,

158
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:44,780
because the adolescent age group is particularly vulnerable to what we call public health.

159
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:49,879
Risk behaviors are not limited to, but including consumption behaviors, things like that.

160
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,290
Even fruits and vegetables. Consuming, all consuming. Sugary or caffeinated beverages.

161
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,270
Consumption of alcohol and drugs. All things that have been shown to have health outcomes later on in life.

162
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,950
So it should be really important to address them at this stage in life now.

163
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:11,180
And so one of the ways that we propose on doing this is through a school based healthy food pantry intervention.

164
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:17,180
So having those three pantries available in public schools, the main goal of this would be to increase tourists ability,

165
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,240
especially for students and families who are struggling with food insecurity.

166
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:26,749
But we also want to increase the average fruit and vegetable intake for adolescents by offering those foods at food pantries,

167
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,460
like offering fresh produce in addition to like normal pantry items.

168
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,350
Like, it's not always the case. The pantries will have like fresh produce.

169
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:41,269
And then in general, we also want to promote healthy and safe consumption habits among adolescents.

170
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:46,580
And these can be through small educational schools available at the pantry, like, for example,

171
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,180
ethnically relevant like meal kits or cooking demonstrations based on like the demographic at that particular school.

172
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:01,100
And so there are a couple of places where the like school based food pantries have been done.

173
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:05,269
So like Traverse City, West High School and Traverse City and also Huron High School here in Ann Arbor,

174
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,870
where they have these food pantries with the intention to like help food insecurity.

175
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,960
And they find a lot of success and success with it and students like using it.

176
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,179
For this, we specifically want to focus on having a healthy food addiction within the pantry,

177
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,050
because like I said before, pantries don't always have those like fruit and vegetable options.

178
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,739
I saw a couple of places where they've tried this.

179
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,059
There were, I think, three food pantries in Arkansas that gave us a try in 2015.

180
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:36,920
And they found that household calories increased and also the servings per person of fresh fruits, vegetables increased in those households.

181
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,379
So having a healthy food initiative, we hope not only would help with food security, but also would help with diet quality,

182
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:48,230
which is something we really want to see and we think would help improve the general health adolescents in the community.

183
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:56,060
Thank you. She?

184
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:15,620
Good morning, everyone. My name is John Jing and you guys are the Detroit City Council.

185
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,540
Today I'll be presenting about your faith activity and nutrition program in Detroit.

186
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:27,770
See, the problem that I will be presenting today is the high prevalence of chronic diseases among adults in Detroit,

187
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,590
especially among the African American population.

188
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:38,180
So when we look at the acute rates of selected chronic diseases and also the age adjusted mortality rates in Detroit,

189
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:44,210
we can see that it is actually way higher than those an average Michigan State and also in the US.

190
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,790
In Detroit, there's also a high prevalence of obesity and also high blood pressure.

191
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:58,610
Approximately 40% and 20% of adults in Michigan did not consume at least one fruit and one vegetable, respectively, per day.

192
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:07,400
When we compare these selected morbidity indicators among African American population to the overall overall state population,

193
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:17,210
we can see that the African American population have higher prevalence of obesity and cardiovascular diseases and also diabetes in Detroit.

194
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:25,070
Majority of them, which is 79.7 of the population, are actually being identified as African American or black.

195
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:32,250
Thus, an intervention that educate the public on healthy eating and encourage physical activity is essential.

196
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,030
The solution that I propose will be defined program to be implemented in Detroit City.

197
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,690
The purpose of this program is to increase physical activity,

198
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:48,320
fruit and vegetable and also fiber wholegrain consumption among the adults in African American churches,

199
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:53,180
and enhance the organizational practice of physical activity and healthy eating.

200
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:06,320
The structure of this program is that the university researchers, they will actually trendy community health advisory from local community centers,

201
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:11,540
which in trying to train and provide technical support to church committees.

202
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:20,479
The church committees actually composed of the key members of the church, including the pastors, the church leaders,

203
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:27,920
and also church members that is interested and passionate and advocating physical activity and also healthy eating.

204
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,270
The church committees will, in turn, to design and implement activities,

205
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:40,040
events or programs that fit to the church congregations interest meet and also according to their own resources.

206
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:49,370
Although they have the freedom to design different types of activities related to healthy eating and also physical activity,

207
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:55,400
but there are certain required activities that the event program will require the church to carry out,

208
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:00,530
including sharing the messages about physical activity and healthy eating during worship services,

209
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,700
distribute educational materials and create a bulletin board.

210
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,190
They will also suggest physical activity and healthy eating guidelines or policies that pastor could set.

211
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:20,780
With this, we believe that the church congregation will be able to learn more about healthy eating and physical activity,

212
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,829
especially the pastors or like church leaders, will be able to provide them.

213
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:31,790
A firmer idea of the results of this program show that people, the church members,

214
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:41,869
actually have a higher report of seeing fruits and vegetables being offered at church events and also share those benefits for them

215
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:50,720
individually by meeting the recommended amount of fruit and vegetables and reported that being less inactive and compared to the control group,

216
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:58,110
the intervention group also report have higher confidence in implementing physical activity and healthy eating program in your church.

217
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:04,730
And two years after this event, implementation, most churches kept at least one program component going.

218
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:11,240
And fairness also indexes, as in the National Cancer Institute, evidence based cancer control programs.

219
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,090
So I believe this will be a program that will be beneficial to the Detroit city population.

220
00:25:17,600 --> 00:26:02,400
Thank you. And the Washtenaw County Health Department's members, Ypsilanti City Council members, and my blow by blow follow health professionals.

221
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,310
Good morning. My name is last Friday as a health worker.

222
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:14,790
I will be presenting the results of the community health assessment and recommendations that can be implemented in Ypsilanti.

223
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,890
I'm sure the audience here understand the importance of addressing food insecurity.

224
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:28,440
But I hope today I will give you an overview. Imagine being 65 years old with physical limitations.

225
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:33,180
It is hard to perform daily activities, including opening and preparing food.

226
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:38,010
That's why older adults are more at risk for food insecurity.

227
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:45,240
You can see that 6.8% of older adults in the United States were food insecure in 2020.

228
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:54,050
In our country there were 10.4% of Washtenaw County population in 2020.

229
00:26:54,750 --> 00:27:04,480
Of. Food insecurity cannot be separated from socioeconomic status, such as income, which affects the full access.

230
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:11,710
So if you look at the data, there were 23.1% of Ypsilanti families live under the poverty line,

231
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:22,300
and a greater risk was observed in certain racial groups being older age, making a person more likely to experience health problems.

232
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:26,500
But food insecurity is also associated with poor health outcomes.

233
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:34,240
Based on the previous studies, we can see that people with insecurity have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease,

234
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:41,230
obesity, diabetes and also mental illness. This is certainly of concern for US health professionals.

235
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:52,950
Therefore, the intervention recommendation that I present today is put share a program to improve food insecurity and also how outcomes,

236
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,970
especially for adults, lower population and ethnically diverse individuals.

237
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,550
The strategy to use input share is to all participants to order fresh flint boxes

238
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:10,220
containing vegetables and fruits that can be paid with cash or snap in the package.

239
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:16,240
Culturally accepted cards will be provided that are tailored to the contents of the box receive.

240
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:25,480
These boxes will then be distributed through partners who collaborate with the program and in addition to connect participants with share,

241
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:34,720
split insecurity, training and referral will be conducted as the success story of food share in Columbia, South Carolina.

242
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:42,040
They successfully establish partnership with 33 community organizations, including senior centers.

243
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:52,989
From 2015, 28,000 boxes were distributed, of which 56% of boxes were purchased using snap foot share.

244
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:59,760
Also, there has been an African American families based on their cultural preferences and witness.

245
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:06,610
My presentation comes to an end considering the importance of addressing the challenges of food insecurity and older adults.

246
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:15,670
I believe this intervention can be implemented in our city, Ypsilanti, also with the goal of improving the health status of elderly here.

247
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:27,990
Thank you. So Isabel's going to go at the end.

248
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:49,409
So whoever's next. So.

249
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:54,800
Good morning. School administrators and also Detroit District Council's finance guy issue.

250
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:57,900
And today I'm going to introduce a program called the School Meals for All.

251
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,400
Food insecurity and the low for supplementation.

252
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:09,370
Program participation rate has been identified as a part of the nutrient concern for adolescents living in Detroit.

253
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:17,500
For insecurity can lead to a worse health effect, which include an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, anemia and also mental impairment problems.

254
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:26,020
There are 16.4% of adolescent women enjoyed our economy food insecure and compared to three zero this year,

255
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:33,700
there is a 3.9% increase in the number of are their quality of adolescence has been assessed based on vegetables,

256
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,660
fruit or 100% fruit juice and debris intake and comparing to sea level.

257
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:43,030
All those are quality and nutrition index for amount adolescents living in Detroit.

258
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:53,260
As for the participation in food supplementation programs, the eligibility rate is 68.3%, but the actual participation rate is 44.8%.

259
00:30:53,590 --> 00:31:02,110
So there's a significant, significant gap between the participation rate and the urgency with this program that houses school

260
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,340
meals for all aims to increase the participation rate into the full supplementation program,

261
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,640
as well as reduce food insecurity and adolescents.

262
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:14,799
The program provides free breakfast and lunch for student are enrolled in the schools

263
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,000
that are a part of national school lunch program or the school breakfast program.

264
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:26,559
Unlike the traditional four supplementation program, this programs does not require any application process and the students are not

265
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:32,050
going to be evaluated for eligibility based on the income level of the household.

266
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,870
So this means that as long as the students is enrolled in the school, they can receive benefits from this program.

267
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:46,409
As a result of the competition for the participation rate of the for supplementation

268
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:51,540
program has been increased for 4.5% and student were more likely to meet

269
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:56,430
the recommendation of dietary intakes from the dietary guidelines and both the

270
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:02,640
food insecurity number among adolescents and the households with food insecure.

271
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,270
For courtesy, food insecure has also been decreased by 3%,

272
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:13,260
and the healthy eating food score were also increased due to increased intake in vegetables, fruits and dairy consumption.

273
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,209
So based on the result,

274
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:23,000
is a fear that the program can't effectively address the two nutritional cultures among adolescents in Detroit and should be further noted.

275
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:11,690
Good morning, everyone. My name is Melissa Rivera and I'm going to talk about the and mobile market to address food insecurity,

276
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:15,990
food activist and older population in the city of Detroit.

277
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:29,929
And so some of the problems that I identified in my needs assessment of the city or

278
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:35,890
in Detroit is that there is higher food insecurity rates in the city of Detroit,

279
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,680
lower access to food in the city of Detroit.

280
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:49,329
So we can see in these two graphs we see that 17.6% of Wayne County where Detroit is located has food insecurity versus the state of Michigan,

281
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:58,930
which will adds 11.5% food insecurity. And another factor to point out is that the average cost per meal in the city, I mean, the in Wayne County,

282
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:04,660
where Detroit is, is much higher than the average cost per meal in the state of Michigan.

283
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:13,210
Some other key things related to this are that Detroit has a higher crew rate of diabetes than in the state of Michigan.

284
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:21,400
It's about four times higher than in the whole state. And diabetes related mortality disproportionately affects black residents in Detroit.

285
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:28,840
And in the literature, it is already well known that food insecurity has shown up negative health outcomes for those at high

286
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:35,890
risk for type two diabetes and can contribute to heart health management and those with diabetes already.

287
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:42,550
So I am proposing that we implement this regimen produce market model to address

288
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:46,930
these key priorities for the older adult population in the city of Detroit.

289
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:54,550
Some of the intervention strategies that are important are to partner with community organizations or to the target population.

290
00:34:54,850 --> 00:35:03,159
So thinking of organizations that already serve older adults in Detroit would include having weekly produce markets at convenient

291
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:14,139
community partner locations and can offer bundles of shares of local and seasonal produce to the community at affordable prices,

292
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:23,950
usually half the price of your traditional CSA boxes, and would also include offering these produce boxes.

293
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:35,410
Offering these by allowing people to give various forms of payment, including cash checks or snap cards.

294
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:42,450
And another key component of this intervention is to include nutrition education curriculum during short interaction.

295
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,370
So while people are getting their produce,

296
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:55,480
have a cooking demonstration or be able to talk about the local produce and some of the key results from this that has already been implemented

297
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:02,380
in other cities are that participants in the Veggie Van Intervention Group consume more vegetables per day than the control group.

298
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:08,290
So one of the randomized controlled trials that initially was done showed that the intervention

299
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:16,930
group consumed 3.64 cups per day compared to the control group that went to 2.82 cups per day.

300
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:28,880
And another from this study that was shown is that this helped increase self-advocacy related to incorporating fruit and vegetables into daily diet.

301
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:34,299
So this means that people felt better about how they were able to incorporate fruits and

302
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:39,940
vegetables into their meals and into being more creative and how they included it in their food.

303
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:46,990
So I think this model can be applied to help address food access among the older population in Detroit.

304
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:52,749
And I think this would help increase fruit and vegetable consumption in older adults in Detroit,

305
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:58,510
because in general, in the literature that I looked at for adults,

306
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:05,080
older adults in the U.S. are not consuming enough fruits and vegetables or using any of the daily recommendations for food intake.

307
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:11,770
So this would be a very important intervention to include. And here is my one page, your advocacy document.

308
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:34,640
So thank you very much for listening. If it looks like you guys are on track.

309
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:40,730
Roughly 4 to 3 minutes. I'm not going to hold my hand up. I'm just breaking your cadence, and I understand.

310
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:48,470
So. So unless you start going on to 4 minutes, then I'll start leaving my hands and, you know, you think like that.

311
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:52,790
Okay. All right. Hi. Good morning. My name is Hannah Trough.

312
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,869
And today I'm going to be presenting about the BNA Star Health program.

313
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:59,750
And you guys are the interest in our public schools.

314
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:10,520
So the priority that I identified through my needs assessment is that not only do many Americans struggle to meet the dietary guidelines.

315
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:16,400
Some people struggle more than others. And most times that is a that is a group of people of color who do not have adequate

316
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,500
access to nutritious foods through not having adequate resources or possible income.

317
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:29,780
And in Ann Arbor, two groups that struggle a lot due to systemic racism and spandex materials.

318
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:39,830
I'm going to be focusing on the Hispanics. So any Ann Arbor, around 5600 Latinos are there.

319
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:51,110
That's there are 5600 Latinos in Ann Arbor and 5.9 of them are unemployed at around 28% of our Hispanic children in Ann Arbor are overweight or obese.

320
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:56,300
So a program that I found is the very star health program.

321
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,720
And in Spanish, Starr means wellness or well-being.

322
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:06,530
And this intervention is a coordinated health program. When you work together with teachers, gym teachers, food service workers,

323
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:15,740
parents all together collaboratively to prevent early onset diabetes and children ages like pre-K to eighth grade.

324
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:23,059
And it can help any child really of any background, but it's tailored for Mexican-American children and they focus.

325
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:28,280
This program focuses on four areas that influences a child's health behaviors in the home,

326
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,980
in the classroom and school food service and in the gym like gym class.

327
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:41,960
So in the home, some some of the things that they do is it allows there's like four different activities that allows parents to get involved.

328
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:49,700
So there's cooking dance or there's cooking demos, salsa dancing lessons and nutrition and exercise games and school.

329
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:55,730
The students are taught 13 different health classes that cover various topics like nutrition, diabetes,

330
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:04,100
and then in gym there's like an after school health club that promotes exercise and they like review some of the topics that are covered in the class.

331
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,670
And then the food service workers actually get educated as well,

332
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:13,280
and they get some material based on like food are like fruit and vegetable requirements that children should

333
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,490
be getting and so that they can pass that knowledge along to children when they're picking on their food.

334
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:29,350
So evidence of success. A study was done in 27 elementary schools in Texas, but San Antonio is where this program is mainly based.

335
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:35,890
And they measured fasting blood, blood glucose levels, body fat, physical fitness scores and dietary fiber intake.

336
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,490
And they found no statistically significant differences in body fat percentages or energy from saturated fat.

337
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:50,890
However, the rest were significant. DNA saw participants had a decreased fasting glucose compared to controls.

338
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:58,120
The I saw participants decrease or increased excuse me their fitness scores by 1.81 points compared to controls.

339
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:05,229
And many participants increased their dietary fiber intake, which are all very important.

340
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:10,330
And this was only in one community. So imagine what this could look like in a different place.

341
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:20,049
So this little guy here, he like the curriculum, looks like there's workbooks and videos that are in Spanish and English.

342
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:26,560
And I was like watching one of the videos prior to this and they, this is him eating his carrots and celery.

343
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:35,709
And the star was developed to provide culturally relevant advice and support for Mexican-American children to prevent Type two diabetes.

344
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:44,680
And there's many positives shown to decrease blood glucose fasting blood glucose levels, increase your fiber intake and increase physical activity.

345
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:53,049
And implementing this in in our schools would allow Mexican Mexican-American children and parents to play an active role in their health.

346
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:57,160
And everyone deserves an opportunity to be there, help themselves. And I think this would be a really great first step.

347
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:57,530
Was finally over to the far left in the beginning to keep going over to the farm.

348
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,330
Okay. That's not your life.

349
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:07,910
Yeah. Oh, right.

350
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:22,570
And he's. 40.

351
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:28,320
My name is Troy, and today I'm going to introduce a program like my kids that I view.

352
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:36,790
I give you the prevalence of childhood obesity. So first, let's take a look at the background.

353
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:42,610
The prevalence of childhood obesity is about 90% of AIDS affects children in the world.

354
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:48,160
And the rate of childhood obesity has more than tripled over the last four decades.

355
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:54,520
All right. Since you've been talking about sending money to childhood obesity, should it be house?

356
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,150
House, many contact contemporary obese children.

357
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:07,570
They will remain healthy is what they were doing to adults. And many studies have shown that overweight and obese is more likely to develop

358
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:12,940
chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age.

359
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:26,110
So on my plate is a person that personalized food and that based on individuals age, sex, height, weight and physical activity level.

360
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:33,800
It helps you figure out how many calories you can consider everyday and shows you the targets,

361
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:37,930
what and how much you can eat within your moderate hours every day.

362
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,649
And so this picture shows how it works.

363
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:49,940
So if people are trying to age at the click the calculator, then you go for age and you realize, Oh.

364
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:53,510
Well,

365
00:44:53,630 --> 00:45:05,930
here is strategies and outcomes we can implement to my plate and choose for lunch and provide recipes according to suggestions about a second week.

366
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:12,300
I have children designed out of my playpen and encourage them to follow it week.

367
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:18,560
I also create interactive events and activities for children to improve their healthy health.

368
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:28,010
And lastly, we have classroom space attractive posters from my page and all the outcomes we expect to see include

369
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:33,560
decreased prevalence of childhood obesity and also an increased consumption of healthy foods,

370
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:41,170
including fruits and vegetables among children. Here is the evidence of effectiveness.

371
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:47,290
This is a study comparing calorie counting versus making recommendations for weight loss.

372
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:58,959
The study found that actually is very useful for helping weight loss and reduced risk for us and also provide the opportunity

373
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:09,190
of Scott's calorie counting and is also helped to improve and increase health related quality of life and also for health.

374
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:16,600
So as a result, I think that it can be a good program to help increase the prevalence of childhood obesity.

375
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:44,240
Thank you. Hi.

376
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,690
My name is Jean. So today I'm going to talk about problem problem.

377
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:55,690
I saw an animal and as a potential solution for had that I use a lot of data from the Washtenaw counties because there is a lack of data and above.

378
00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:02,960
So as we can see table one the stroke the stroke prevalence among all causes of disease

379
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:07,790
risk of all the fits and the the heart did this resident there the first position

380
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:11,990
there is a close relationship between the stroke and her do this as we can see table

381
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:19,010
two of the crude mortality rates of stroke is about 200 per 100,000 population.

382
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,730
As we know, there is a causal relationship between diet and the risk of cardiovascular disease.

383
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:27,230
As we can see in table three,

384
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:38,180
the of the proportion population of older adults in Washtenaw County consume more than five times fruit and vegetables per day is about 20%.

385
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:42,170
While research has shown that in many countries the reduction consumption in fruit

386
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:46,430
and vegetables is closely related to the increase of the stroke mortality rate.

387
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:56,330
In addition, as we can see in Figure one, there is only about 50% of the US older adults medicine requirement of the added sugar intake.

388
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:05,000
This makes those weighing table two. There is about 27% to 47% of the population are obese.

389
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:11,120
So myself I stopped program is one of the solution to that mess.

390
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:17,840
All lifestyle program, also known as an SNP MSP is aims to transpose a transformed the editorial diet

391
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:21,950
to sources US population to reduce the risk of various chronic diseases,

392
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:27,590
including a stroke among older adults in close to primary strategy.

393
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:31,100
Among things is intervention. The first strategy is education.

394
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:38,720
It includes a manual that contains a table to improve the diet quality close to Mediterranean diet and increase of physical activity.

395
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:43,939
It also includes a food and resource manual and also in grocery interviewing.

396
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:52,280
It contains full monthly interviewing, the first interviewing applied, and then it's a risk assessment and diet and behavior modification.

397
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:57,250
It also contains the 15 minutes of check and reassess after intervention at the Met.

398
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:01,190
Angus, just to let you guys know,

399
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:07,909
the SRP only we only follow the Southeast U.S. population if you have an eating

400
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:12,870
habits but this may be need to modify for those is population level and

401
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:19,880
for that expects Alfonzo there are three primary outcomes of first outcome is the increased fruit and vegetable intake and increase not seeing take.

402
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:23,870
It also has a drop in sugar sweetened beverage consumption.

403
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:30,110
It's also have a dramatically increase in physical activity in terms of the secondary outcomes.

404
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:39,919
Are we? One publication did not show us significant weight reduction that the number of predicted participants have controlled blood

405
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:49,190
pressure increase of these program this center of to this mission as it's increased quality of the protocol is here so that you

406
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:58,650
also increase access also here so lifestyle now the older adults we improve their life quality it also prevents older adults

407
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:05,870
secures care so this institution to with calls and labor force because it can prevent disease of head and also saves the public.

408
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:10,129
Here's the results. It's just the most severe and fatal disease. So let's try it.

409
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:14,220
And that's in terms of yourself, older adults. Well, our grandparents and parents and.

410
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:53,990
Everyone. My name is Kayla, and I focused on assessing diabetes risk in adolescents in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

411
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:04,280
So the problem that I focused on was that the prevalence of adolescent diabetes has been increasing and that is also is also associated with,

412
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,169
ah, the risk of chronic disease.

413
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:16,700
And then I also focused on why that was the case and because it's because of the lack of food accessibility and then lower educational attainment.

414
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:30,110
So the need in Grand Rapids was to prevent type two diabetes and the intervention that I found was to in schools,

415
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:36,650
get those who are prediabetic and get them involved in a program to prevent the full onset of Type two diabetes.

416
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:41,540
And this includes nutrition and physical activity, education lessons,

417
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:47,720
and then also teaches the high school staff how to start living high school staff and students to start living a healthy life.

418
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:58,260
And there is a high demand for this intervention to be a part of schools and then also showed benefits and physiological changes.

419
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:08,150
So the strategies in this intervention was to get parental consent to obtain a C levels, blood pressure, height, weight and BMI from the adolescents.

420
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,590
The coordinators go to different schools in the area to organize and conduct the screenings.

421
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:18,500
The educational lessons are given to the students focused on healthy living, nutrition and physical activity.

422
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,720
And then, after the educational lessons,

423
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:26,540
there's break up discussion sessions for students to work in a smaller group and then also work with the coordinator.

424
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:31,240
And then throughout the day, text messages are sent to the students to remind them what they learned.

425
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:38,180
And then there was data collected through lifestyle questionnaires and to track patterns of,

426
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:43,160
um, to track the patterns and then also the lifestyle choices of students.

427
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:53,360
So this intervention saw positive outcomes. They saw decreased weight, no longer risk for diabetes, and then decreased A-1 C levels.

428
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:59,210
And this there was full integration of the program in the school's daily operations.

429
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:13,280
So specifically in the intervention that I found, they saw significant decreases in weight as well as ANC levels and then decreased BMI.

430
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:38,670
There since. We be sits on the dare I put it on the desktop.

431
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:45,490
I think it's. Yeah.

432
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:53,390
Good morning, everyone.

433
00:53:53,630 --> 00:54:02,120
My name is Keith Kitchen and I'm currently and each student and today I'm advocating for the application of the food pantry model.

434
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:08,180
So. So the innovative food pantry model is called first place entry model.

435
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:17,180
And it aims to reduce food insecurity by addressing the underlying causes of poverty of residents in the North End neighborhood of Hartford,

436
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:27,260
Connecticut. So this for security is really a problem in the U.S. because there are currently actually 60 million

437
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:36,200
Americans are being the emergency food pantry users and 67% of them are being classified as food insecure.

438
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:40,910
And such insecurity can result in a lower score in the health meaning index and

439
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:47,030
much lower percentages of the dietary reference intakes in several nutrients.

440
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:52,970
And for security, insecurity can also lead to relatively low lower intake of fruits,

441
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:58,910
vegetables, dairy products, protein in B6, calcium, magnesium and zinc,

442
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:06,920
which can lead to death related chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension and lipid damien and poor general health,

443
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:11,329
both physically and mentally, and also the traditional food pantry programs.

444
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:18,680
They only provide prepackaged bags of short term food supplies without any other supplement supplemental services.

445
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:24,470
So here the solution is a the in the food pantry model.

446
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:34,580
So overall, the first place is a collaborative program that are led by three different community agencies.

447
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:41,870
And it is a one year food pantry program that provides a fundamental approach to reduce food insecurity.

448
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,860
And so the there are mainly three innovative approaches.

449
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:52,820
So the first one is that the first place in our food pantry they are there is a client choice setting.

450
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:59,330
So the clients of the pantry, they can choose their own foods according to their cultural and personal preferences.

451
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:05,030
So it actually imparts a sense of dignity to their preferences.

452
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:07,340
And the second one is the clients,

453
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:19,100
they would meet with a project manager once a month and in the form of motivational interviews to develop and track their personal goals

454
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:29,670
of becoming more food secure and self-sufficient and to identify some of their expectations and potential barriers to achieving that goal.

455
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:34,910
And the third one is that first place offers various tailor services to referrals,

456
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:46,910
such as they could take a six week cooking class that would prepare them to cook there because to cook their food more in a more healthy way.

457
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:55,520
And so the outcome, considering the outcome so the three main indexes, the indicators have been all been improved.

458
00:56:55,850 --> 00:57:03,409
So less than half of the participants of the program were classified as experiences experiencing very low

459
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:09,590
food security compared to the baseline where 50% of the participants were experiencing fear of the security.

460
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:16,219
And the self sufficiency score of the clients have increased by 10% compared to

461
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:21,770
the baseline level and 5% higher than the control group and the control group.

462
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:25,220
The people doing visit the traditional food pantries.

463
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:34,639
So the last one is that the mean fruit and vegetable score of the freshly fresh place clients was 13% higher than the baseline level

464
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:41,510
and 14% higher than the control group suggesting that this program actually works to enhance their diet quality of the residents.

465
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:50,060
So in the light of this, I think that the application of this innovative entry program or model can be applied in not only to Hartford in Connecticut,

466
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:56,660
but also can be transferred and applied in other communities all around the US.

467
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:04,570
So thank you so much. It's about.

468
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:12,070
Let me have you go first because I to have the sign out for you to sign in and choose as you are.

469
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:20,950
Oh, you did? Okay. All right. So just give me a minute here and just.

470
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:30,959
It's. You keep saying just because.

471
00:58:38,809 --> 00:58:43,369
Education reform is coming.

472
00:58:51,979 --> 00:58:58,038
Hi. Good morning, everyone. My name is Isabel Gomez and today I will be presented to you by new bands for older adults.

473
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:05,028
And again, there is a food insecurity issue in Detroit and food insecurity is defined as a lack of

474
00:59:05,029 --> 00:59:09,919
consistent access to enough food for every person in a household to get an active lifestyle.

475
00:59:10,249 --> 00:59:20,269
And this is very pertinent, especially among the older adult population, because we have a in the population that is getting older by 2034,

476
00:59:20,509 --> 00:59:24,079
the amount of older adults will be greater than the amount of younger adults.

477
00:59:24,439 --> 00:59:28,609
And older adults face higher negative health outcomes when it comes to food insecurity.

478
00:59:29,389 --> 00:59:36,109
And additionally, older adults may have some mobility issues that may limit their ability to access food and supermarkets.

479
00:59:36,589 --> 00:59:39,679
Specifically, if we look at the two images I have here,

480
00:59:39,919 --> 00:59:47,479
these are the census tract where at least 500 people live farther than half a mile away from a supermarket or the closest supermarket.

481
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:55,098
And while half a mile may not seem like a lot for people who are everybody, half a mile is a lot for someone who has mobility issues.

482
00:59:55,099 --> 01:00:01,909
And therefore, I suggest we bring the food to the people and we do this by having veggie bags.

483
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:10,098
And so the veggie bags will have vegetables and fruits and they will be able to accept different forms of payment,

484
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:15,229
such as debit cards, cash checks, net weight or transfer cards.

485
01:00:15,649 --> 01:00:27,768
And they will find specific communities that have that have a low access to supermarkets and go there to sell some fresh fruits and vegetables.

486
01:00:27,769 --> 01:00:33,199
And this will hopefully increase food accessibility and reduce food insecurities.

487
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:38,059
In Detroit, the veggie ban has been implemented across the United States,

488
01:00:38,299 --> 01:00:42,679
and here are just three different case studies of where it has happened and how it has been successful.

489
01:00:42,949 --> 01:00:47,358
So first, it's actually been done here in Michigan and Grand Rapids and the Grand Rapids

490
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:52,159
and teamed up with the YMCA and they purchase according to the purchase data,

491
01:00:52,309 --> 01:00:57,289
they served about 1000 residents and completed 1400 transactions in 2017.

492
01:00:57,559 --> 01:01:03,619
And 93% of people who participated in the regimen reported eating more fruits and vegetables.

493
01:01:04,009 --> 01:01:08,449
And additionally, it was conducted in Springfield, Massachusetts and Albany, New York.

494
01:01:08,659 --> 01:01:15,229
And in these two cases it was tailored to older adults. And the older adults overall had a really positive experience with it.

495
01:01:15,889 --> 01:01:24,169
Specifically in Albany, New York, 77.8% said that they like the convenience and 69.8% said they like the low price of the veggie bags.

496
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:35,388
When push back is, people say that this takes away from the local market, so supermarkets, etc. So I suggest veggie vans to partner with supermarkets,

497
01:01:35,389 --> 01:01:40,729
local grocery stores so people feel the stays within the community and it doesn't take away from that local community.

498
01:01:42,259 --> 01:01:47,599
Thank you so much. I do.

499
01:01:50,829 --> 01:02:24,699
You should be up on the desktop. Slideshow in one of the tabs in the middle.

500
01:02:29,499 --> 01:02:35,319
Hi everyone. So my name is Leah. I'm here to address childhood obesity rates in East Lansing, Michigan.

501
01:02:36,279 --> 01:02:39,309
So I'm here within Michigan.

502
01:02:39,369 --> 01:02:43,419
Obesity rates for kids is going to be about 34%.

503
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:48,459
Now is is higher than the county of Washtenaw, which is going to be about 26%.

504
01:02:48,759 --> 01:02:52,149
That's also higher than the national average, which was 20%.

505
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:58,149
So not only is there a discrepancy with a series within kids within the county,

506
01:02:58,539 --> 01:03:07,509
but there's also going to be a couple of things like income and race that will affect the series within kids within L.A.

507
01:03:08,549 --> 01:03:18,399
So kids with lower income and kids who are of African American descent and Latino all have high rates of obesity rates.

508
01:03:18,849 --> 01:03:27,279
So in order to address this issue amongst different kids with different income levels and kids who are from different demographic groups,

509
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:32,229
the best way to address this, I would think, would be within our education system.

510
01:03:33,049 --> 01:03:43,269
Our system can not only reach kids from all different income levels and racial groups, but it also can help teach them healthier habits.

511
01:03:44,739 --> 01:03:53,039
So the program that I found was physical education and nutrition, working together or peanut or peanut.

512
01:03:53,949 --> 01:04:05,369
So peanut. The goal is to motivate kids, parents and teachers to eat healthier or to live healthier lifestyles.

513
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:15,639
So the goal of the program is not only to improve school nutrition, but it's also to affect healthy behavior change within the individual.

514
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:25,089
So some of the changes that they wish to implement is to do health is the goal parties, no sugar rewards and community engagement.

515
01:04:25,419 --> 01:04:29,259
And some of the behavior changes that they wish to implement was, of course,

516
01:04:29,259 --> 01:04:35,129
washing hands before eating, trying new things and increased physical activities.

517
01:04:36,489 --> 01:04:42,969
So with any of the peanuts and even the peanuts.

518
01:04:43,239 --> 01:04:50,978
So five intervention strategies that we have to enforce these changes or healthy educations within the

519
01:04:50,979 --> 01:04:59,049
classroom and through physical education to students for physical activity and nutrition announcements,

520
01:04:59,769 --> 01:05:02,889
take home activities and then parent engagements.

521
01:05:05,409 --> 01:05:10,309
So some of these are some of the outcomes that I found, for instance.

522
01:05:11,489 --> 01:05:22,209
So this comes from a study that came from 2017 to 2018 from Wayne County schools, specifically the 17 school systems.

523
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:29,679
They took surveys at the end of the year, at the end of the year,

524
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:35,379
and they of the service were not only taking from the students, but it's also taking from the parents.

525
01:05:36,339 --> 01:05:43,419
They saw that 40% of they saw that most of the kids not only eat healthier, but they chose to eat healthier.

526
01:05:43,509 --> 01:05:48,339
They also had more fruits and vegetables.

527
01:05:49,959 --> 01:06:00,009
And we actually asked certain parents to pick up more healthy snacks and also saw that they had an increase of physical activity.

528
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:14,499
Yes. So implementing peanuts into a school system not only will give not only will help to improve them.

529
01:06:15,849 --> 01:06:28,359
Sorry, guys, but not only will help them to improve helping choices, but they'll get them better education about what healthy choices will look like.

530
01:06:28,869 --> 01:06:32,499
So that is an intervention program. And they listen.

531
01:06:40,069 --> 01:07:04,499
Everybody you did. I just want to say all did a great job.

532
01:07:07,429 --> 01:07:17,699
You all did a great job. Thank you. It's not easy getting up and speaking before people.

533
01:07:18,899 --> 01:07:28,348
And, you know, we all I've been teaching for 14 years and I will tell you that the first few years

534
01:07:28,349 --> 01:07:34,589
was a nerve wracking experience because it doesn't matter what the audience is,

535
01:07:34,949 --> 01:07:41,249
if it's, you know, some public statement doesn't come easy to everyone.

536
01:07:42,479 --> 01:07:50,638
And so you all did a great job, you know, to have me interrupt you partway through to let you know that,

537
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:53,759
you know, 30 seconds you're going to be wrapping up.

538
01:07:53,789 --> 01:07:58,189
That's not easy because it breaks your, you know, your thoughts and so forth.

539
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:09,899
So kudos to all of you, especially those in the very beginning where I would like to be able to get back on pace.

540
01:08:09,989 --> 01:08:14,369
It's not easy. I know that. So great job.

541
01:08:15,449 --> 01:08:21,699
I encourage you all to keep working on the skill set because it does improve over time.

542
01:08:21,749 --> 01:08:27,599
It really does with, you know, more practice becomes a little bit easier.

543
01:08:27,959 --> 01:08:31,139
So. So great job.

544
01:08:32,009 --> 01:08:35,609
Wednesday, we have the rest of the class.

Please be sure to send me your slides. Not only just upload them to canvas,

546
01:08:41,219 --> 01:08:49,018
but also send them to me Tuesday night or no later than 730 Wednesday morning because I have

547
01:08:49,019 --> 01:08:54,059
to get in here before the first class in this room so that I can load them on the desktop.

548
01:08:55,319 --> 01:09:02,399
So great job, everybody. And those of you presented today, you can go, oh, yeah.

549
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:11,219
Okay, that's it for today. If anybody have anything they want to grab me about, I'll be down here for a bit.

550
01:09:11,489 --> 01:09:16,699
Otherwise, a day, I'm looking for people on.
