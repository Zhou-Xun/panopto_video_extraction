1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:18,570
All right, here we go. Good morning, everyone. So our goal for today is to finish the last bit of the previous lecture on personal monitoring,

2
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:25,170
then move into surrogate approaches of exposure assessment and then by plan,

3
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,250
hopefully leave a little bit of time at the end of class just for any questions and

4
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:36,210
answers or review that would be helpful in preparation for the exam on Thursday.

5
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:47,280
All right. So with that, where we left off last time was actually we finished talking about underestimating and overestimating monitored exposures.

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:56,850
Moving on to that, we have the issue of personal exposure from point sources and a couple of different circumstances,

7
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:07,230
one of which is things that can be a really big exposure, a high level of exposure related to disasters.

8
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:13,470
But these often end up being difficult to measure or capture because they're not very easily predicted.

9
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:22,380
Right. They kind of come out of the blue without much warning. We also have the the occurrence of a routine exposure.

10
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:22,590
Right.

11
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:33,240
So not one off kind of disaster, big ones, but ones that are kind of continuous, perhaps from a single source, but much lower levels of exposure.

12
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:40,590
But over a continuous time period, these often end up being easier to measure because you can pretty much count on,

13
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:50,680
you know, when they're in operation, what the characteristics of the emissions might be of the agents of concern.

14
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:58,450
We can also there are times where we're also concerned about and actually this is the reality of the world for the most part about diffuse sources.

15
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:04,030
So it's easy if you're just concerned about one and only have to worry about as one source at a time.

16
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:10,540
In reality, we're kind of bombarded all over the place, all around us from many different sources,

17
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:16,930
sources of contaminants or agents of concern that also occur on a routine basis.

18
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:30,720
Some examples listed here write air pollution from vehicle exhaust, pesticides, metal, mercury and fish that we eat and so forth.

19
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:38,130
So with regards to the biological monitoring and these biomarkers that we kind of tend to think, wow,

20
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:46,470
this is perhaps a gold standard, they're widely utilized when it comes to both blood and urine.

21
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:58,170
So things like blood alcohol level. Right. There are very standardized approaches to to assess this, we can assess blood for carbon monoxide exposure.

22
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:04,410
There are good urinary markers for accessing exposure to arsenic.

23
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:13,620
This means a whole blood allows us to measure for markers of mercury and lead exposure.

24
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,020
Serum ends up being good for things like flame retardants and organochlorines.

25
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,310
There are other types of biological monitoring that's less invasive.

26
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,110
Right? So most of those ones that we just went through examples, you know,

27
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:34,290
you're collecting a urine sample, you're using a needle to draw or take a blood sample.

28
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:40,680
Others are less invasive. We can actually use some spectroscopy,

29
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:51,630
which is basically kind of just sitting for an X-ray to assess levels of things like lead or cadmium or arsenic that might be in bone toenails.

30
00:03:51,630 --> 00:04:02,130
So toenail clippings can end up being like a relatively noninvasive marker to measure metal exposures.

31
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:08,310
I think we talked or had a question or comment last class period about that pad measures for various

32
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:14,850
lipid soluble toxicants and then exhaled breath is another one where we have an opportunity.

33
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:25,940
It would be representative of a biomarker sample, mostly looking for four volatiles and exhaled breath.

34
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,370
So all we need to do is assess biomarkers, right, when everything's good.

35
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:37,640
Not not exactly. There are definite advantages of biomarkers.

36
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,770
Uh, one is that they demonstrate that an exposure has occurred.

37
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:50,930
Right. If you could detect it in someone's biological sample, they've been exposed to whatever you measure in that sample.

38
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,340
It also serves as an integration across all exposure routes.

39
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:08,840
Right. So whether it's ingested, inhaled, was absorbed through the skin, etc., it's kind of conserves biomarkers can serve as a cumulative exposure.

40
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,530
Let's see. Limitations.

41
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:21,980
So this is why the answer to that question at the top is, is that it's not correct that all we need to do is assess biomarkers.

42
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:28,730
We're not able to identify the source where the lead came from, for example,

43
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:37,220
or the the root of exposure simply by detecting it in a biomarker sample and then a big one.

44
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:44,300
We've also started to talk about here is most biomarker samples are are highly invasive to collect.

45
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:52,080
So it makes them not very practical in many scenarios.

46
00:05:52,080 --> 00:06:01,650
A couple of notes here on how we might actually monitor exposures in terms of some sampling devices.

47
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:07,440
There's a type of sampling called passive sampling and a couple of pictures.

48
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,060
Here are schematics where in many cases a worker.

49
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,230
But this is easily able to be done in a community setting as well,

50
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:28,740
can wear like a small badge that allows like something like a volatile in the air to absorb across the diffusive surface.

51
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,080
And basically what we need to know is how long did the person wear the badge in that environment

52
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,300
that we're concerned about their exposure and we can kind of come up with a qualitative estimate.

53
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,820
What's the concentration of of said contaminant that they might have been exposed to?

54
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,310
So this is a passive sampling approach.

55
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:55,830
It's easy to do because it's very small, you know, kind of clips on to the person lightweight, not too disruptive.

56
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:02,880
In contrast to that is active sampling. So active sampling requires a pump.

57
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,580
So you see this worker here basically carrying a pump on there on their belt

58
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:14,850
with a tube going up to where the sample inlet is in their breathing zone.

59
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:21,300
So this might be the case, active sampling to draw either air or water through, you know,

60
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,900
an absorbing material or some sort of filter that's integrated over a known amount of time.

61
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,060
The disadvantages is that it's bulky and needs power for the pump to run.

62
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,620
Right. So some sort of battery that has kind of weight and size to it.

63
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,240
In some cases, if it's too bulky, this might push us to doing area sampling.

64
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:49,740
Right. So it doesn't need to be actually carried by a person. It would be set kind of in the vicinity where they're working or spending time.

65
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:57,930
But it does give us the benefit over passive sampling of having much more accurate assessment of the exposures,

66
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:04,680
the concentration values that we reach, the active sampling are much more accurate than those from passive sampling.

67
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:14,190
And this is because we can actually have a flow rate. So how much air volume is truly being sampled over how much time?

68
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:21,300
And then if we measure the mass of the quantity of the contaminant on that filter or on that sample inlet,

69
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:33,180
we can then calculate a mass of contaminant per volume of air or water or whatever the medium may be.

70
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,850
There are also some direct reading instruments so similarly designed where

71
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:44,160
it's using a pump to pull air through an inlet and someone's breathing zone.

72
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:51,000
But instead of having to integrate that over time and take that sample back to a lab for an analysis afterwards,

73
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:01,080
it basically had the device has an analytical unit built into it and can record in almost real time or semi continuously

74
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:09,090
what the concentration of exposure is so it can measure concentrations over with high temporal resolution,

75
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:18,300
things like temperature. Right. Whether we're concerned about heat or cold things like noise, radiation with air pollutants,

76
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:26,610
we can measure particulates in addition to gases in real time with one of these devices.

77
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:31,530
With regards to the particulates, there are some specially designed inlets,

78
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:37,470
if you remember back a couple of lectures ago, we talked about how the size of the particles is pretty key.

79
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,530
We're not just concerned about are all particles in the air.

80
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:47,460
We're concerned about those particular sizes in terms of them getting into our airways and causing respiratory problems.

81
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:53,910
So there are personal exposure monitors that are designed with an active sampling approach,

82
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:59,790
with a known flow rate coming through that only particles of a certain size

83
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,890
and less can actually get into and be embedded on to the the sample filter.

84
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,720
So there are cut point diameters.

85
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:17,720
We might have a sample inlet that's designed for 10 particles and less or two point five particles and less so forth.

86
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,160
And there are also these direct reading instruments as well. Cost is the main concern.

87
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:32,210
It's generally less expensive to buy one of these types of inlets up to a tube and a pump and collect an integrated sample over time versus

88
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:44,060
having one of these fancy direct reading instruments that is recording data and giving you real time information on what exposures might be.

89
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,410
So here's a framework for why you know Michael.

90
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:55,250
Well, these are too expensive. Why use them? There are benefits when we're doing personal exposure.

91
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:02,000
We can use we can really take advantage of that high lead time resolved dataset.

92
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,810
So, for example, we're looking at exposure here. This is a idealize exposure profile of someone during their commute.

93
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:15,770
Right. They're exposed to high levels in the morning, maybe not so much when they're at work, high levels again in the afternoon,

94
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:26,420
what they're exposed to at home and for outcome measures like personal spirometry,

95
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,960
heart rate variability, blood pressure, things that are changing over a very short time durations.

96
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:45,220
We can actually assess impact of pollutant exposure in real time on these outcomes also of a similar temporal scale.

97
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:54,670
So a little bit of a summary here for inhalation exposure route, mostly the media we're concerned about is the air.

98
00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:01,420
We've got a couple of different approaches we can use personal monitors or maybe secondarily an area monitor.

99
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:08,140
There are also biomarker samples available to us, right? Things like breath or urine for ingestion.

100
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:14,110
This might be food or water. An environmental sample might be a tap water.

101
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:21,130
We can duplicate portions of what people eat and then their biological sample approaches are available there as well,

102
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:27,340
as well as for dermal exposures through soil or dust.

103
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:38,230
All right. And then we shift gears and kind of continue on a similar topic, but moving to surrogate markers of exposure.

104
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:44,030
Any questions about those last few slides on personal monitoring?

105
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:55,900
Yeah, we get into it like probably on the monitor, but yeah, this one is only looking at biomarkers and point what happened.

106
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:08,140
I'm not sure it's it's it really has very little perspective value or right or predictive value, it's mostly looking back in time.

107
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,270
There are obvious circumstances where that's super helpful, of course.

108
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:21,300
But, yeah, it certainly has limitations in terms of the the framework of exposure assessment as well.

109
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:32,660
Any others? All right, so let's move on to now.

110
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,150
Surrogate markers of exposure and we're going to focus mostly actually on questionnaires.

111
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:43,760
This ends up being a really popular and widely utilized one that we will top about.

112
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,530
Talk about a few other types of surrogate measures of exposure.

113
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:57,620
So we want to define the types and applications of those questionnaires and other surrogate measures for monitoring and estimating exposure.

114
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:05,540
Describe again, kind of like we have been for four different approaches with some of the advantages and disadvantages are of these various surrogate

115
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:14,720
methods and learn about the important variables to consider when we're utilizing these different types of surrogate measures.

116
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:22,880
So just a little bit of review. We looked at this last time. You know, if we have our our way, our preference,

117
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,670
we want quantified measures of personal exposure right through ideally through

118
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:34,730
a combination of biomarkers as well as external measures of personal exposure.

119
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:43,130
These would be the best for almost all circumstances for estimating what the actual exposure is secondary to that,

120
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:50,510
if we can't do personal measures of exposure, being able to look at area level exposure.

121
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:55,670
Right. This might be nearby in the workplace where the person spends time.

122
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:00,560
It could be an area sample inside someone's home and so forth.

123
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,750
Beyond that, everything else is really a surrogate of exposure.

124
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:12,620
And there are many. And one, we'll talk about some of these as well as some examples of them.

125
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,240
When we talked about personal monitoring and biomarkers,

126
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:25,070
it's over here on this side of the figure where these are direct methods of exposure assessment.

127
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:32,870
When we talk about surrogate markers, surrogate measures of exposure over here on this side where we're utilizing indirect methods.

128
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:39,560
Right. And so that's where things like questionnaires and diaries reside.

129
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,820
So we'll step through each of these, we'll spend most of the time talking about questionnaires,

130
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:51,890
but there's also things like interviews that a trained interviewer might conduct with the study subject or a worker,

131
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:55,880
diaries that people keep observation.

132
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:06,800
So someone that just watching a worker or a child and documenting what their exposures could be based on their time and activity records,

133
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:14,480
accessing records or proxy respondents for people that are either not available or perhaps are are deceased.

134
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:23,570
Employment information can serve as estimates for surrogate markers of exposure, expert evaluations.

135
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:27,950
We'll talk about this. And then very basically just location or proximity.

136
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:38,360
If you know where someone live, where someone worked, this might help you to estimate what their exposures might have been looking back in time.

137
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,100
All right. So so what's your question? And we're going to talk about this for for a few minutes here.

138
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:51,120
It's a tool designed to elicit and record or guide the elicitation recording of recorded exposures from subjects,

139
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:59,780
usually within an epidemiological study. But again, this is this is can be done as on a routine basis within a workplace.

140
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:06,890
And the objectives are really to balance a few competing interests in this approach.

141
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:13,760
Obviously, you want to obtain measurements of exposure, variables that are essential to whatever the study is.

142
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:21,290
We want to minimize the error and those measurements, but we also want that instrument, that questionnaire,

143
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:30,080
to be something that's easy for the interviewer to actually use and more importantly, for this subject to use.

144
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,360
Right. Because if it's not you, you're going to end up with not very useful information.

145
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:42,290
And then secondarily, we want the investigator, whoever's conducting this study or this assessment,

146
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:49,040
to have the results able to easily be processed and then analyzed.

147
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,950
So to kind of start with the take home message and then we'll get into some of the detail,

148
00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:01,310
the advantages of questionnaires is that they're generally a quick and easy way to obtain data.

149
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:08,900
They're less costly, right. Than these personal exposures that we talked about, whether you're collecting a biomarker sample, analyzing it in a lab,

150
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:18,660
picking someone up with a personal monitor, analyzing things in a lab, and they can be used to estimate exposure retrospectively.

151
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:24,830
So we're looking back over time. These questionnaires can be highly advantageous in that scenario.

152
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,990
The disadvantages are that they're typically more qualitative, right.

153
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:39,050
We're not going to come up with the value of eight point two for some excessed exposure like we do with the personal monitor or a biomarker sample.

154
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:43,840
They can be prone to errors. They can also be difficult to validate.

155
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,780
And I think we'll talk about that in slides to come up.

156
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:58,560
But there are not many opportunities to compare a questionnaire with a gold standard in real time.

157
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:07,590
So oftentimes they're used with other exposure assessment techniques and not relied upon solely when we're using

158
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:14,790
questionnaires for exposure assessment back to the issue of of underreporting and overreporting on the potential for them,

159
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,740
we need to be aware of where these instances might take place.

160
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:25,590
So for underreporting, that could lead to bias in the data.

161
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:30,370
It could be caused by the lack of understanding of the question, right.

162
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:41,370
By a person, by a subject or a lack of knowledge about the exposure that's being asked about or generally if there's kind of unexpected or sorry,

163
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:46,560
unacceptable or threatening issues inherent in the question.

164
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:52,320
For example, like someone who's self reporting smoking during pregnancy,

165
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,110
if there's someone conducting an interview asking a question, especially the way the question is asked,

166
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,500
the person might be likely to answer no, that, you know,

167
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:09,660
I don't smoke during pregnancy because they know that there's some, you know, social stigma that that that's a bad thing.

168
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:15,250
There can also be instances of overreporting or something called RECALDE bias.

169
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:21,990
Um, so those that subjects that already have some sort of existing condition or disease are

170
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:27,420
generally more likely to report certain exposures compared to those without a disease,

171
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:34,050
even when there's no true difference in exposure. If someone has a condition and they know what some of the contributing factors are to it,

172
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:39,840
they're going to be much more aware of what those exposures are around them.

173
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,870
Ideally, we can gain exposure information without the knowledge of disease being present.

174
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:54,880
So when a prospective cohort. Right. So if the goal is to assess what are contributing, what exposures contribute to poor birth outcome.

175
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:02,340
So following pregnant women, for example, and then in case control studies, uh,

176
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:12,180
it's important that we have careful attention to appropriate questions so that we can help to minimize that recall bias.

177
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:17,190
When we're designing a questionnaire, we want it to have clear aims and objectives.

178
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:25,560
Seems kind of obvious, but we don't want to have a bunch of questions in there that don't really contribute to what we're trying to find out.

179
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:31,860
It can be tempting, as you might imagine, like, oh yeah, it would be good to ask about this and it would be helpful to know this as well.

180
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:37,380
If they're not contributing to our study objectives, they really should. Those questions really shouldn't be included.

181
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:44,970
And along those lines, we need to be able to think of the data analysis approach before we even start designing the questionnaire,

182
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,160
but then as we're designing it as well. Right.

183
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:56,470
So you can envision how the answers to particular questions are going to be informing the data analysis process.

184
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:01,650
Number two here is selecting the items that need to be translated into questions.

185
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:06,420
So, again, you know, what variables are we trying to get information on and then saying, all right,

186
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:12,270
which questions can we ask that are addressing and giving us information on these particular variables?

187
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:17,610
And then, of course, it needs to be in a logical order that can't be like random jumping around all over the place.

188
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:24,670
It's going to be pretty confusing, uh, to to a study subject.

189
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:34,660
So a higher response rate and a completion rate are both necessary for a study to be successful.

190
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:43,270
One of the primary challenges of questionnaires is that they're often too long because, again, especially with like a scientist or inquiring mind.

191
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:48,960
Right. The more information, the better is kind of the approach.

192
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:57,790
And this can actually doom the study or doom the data collection in itself for self-administered questionnaires.

193
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:02,180
Risk response declines at anything more than 12 pages.

194
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:08,590
So in terms of a copy print out for data quality, you know,

195
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:16,210
as data analysts were instructed to look at straight line responses like especially towards the end of a questionnaire.

196
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:21,620
Right. If it's like C, C, C or. Yes, yes, yes.

197
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:28,420
Instead of actually thoughtful response, just because it's too long, the person's had enough.

198
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,360
They just want to be done with this process.

199
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:38,920
So, again, we don't want to include questions for which there's no obvious kind of data analysis built into the plan.

200
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:45,610
And in some instances, it might be possible to use multiple questionnaires that are broken up.

201
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:55,330
Right. And administered at different times, if, in fact it needs to all be collected, but not at once.

202
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:02,740
So related to this is respondent Birdwing, right, so if there is an increased burden, it's overly burdensome,

203
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:12,550
it's going to result in participates, participation rates being low, study subjects dropping out, having incomplete responses.

204
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:17,530
And overall, it's going to lead to reduced data quality.

205
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:23,260
Some of the particular challenges are the length and distance from from the

206
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:29,320
present time over which the period of recall is being requested of the subject,

207
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:37,210
high impact topics, big life events and frequency of events.

208
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:49,210
And then again, the complexity and the detail that's being sought by the questionnaire itself can all contribute to that respondent burden.

209
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:55,120
In terms of the types of questions, there's generally two, one of which is open ended.

210
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,450
Right. So a blank box, a blank line as a way to answer a question versus closed ended.

211
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:08,080
Right. So it's either yes or no or A, B, C or B or five, 10, 15 or 20,

212
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:16,690
etc. These types of questions can result in considerably different answers and different types of information.

213
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:22,390
For Open-Ended questionnaires, there's generally no restrictions on the answers.

214
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:30,190
These are useful for eliciting simple facts where there might be multiple possible answers that aren't easy to pin into.

215
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:35,080
A closed question, right? To just say A, B, C or D or yes or no.

216
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,410
Things that are common are like age or occupation.

217
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:54,790
Uh, how many cigarets are smoked per day? Um, these may increase response over closed ended questions for certain questions such as alcohol intake.

218
00:25:54,790 --> 00:26:06,850
And an example might be, uh. If it's a closed ended question, how much alcohol drink one to two drinks per week,

219
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:12,970
two to three drinks per week, three to five drinks per week, seven plus drinks per week.

220
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:23,290
And if I drink 20 per week, right. A there's going to be perhaps some bias built into that, because while it ends at seven plus and I drink 20,

221
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:28,300
maybe I should just because I'm a little bit embarrassed or I know I shouldn't be doing this,

222
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:37,480
I'm going to respond with something else versus if it's open ended or just a line I'm more likely to write in 20 per week.

223
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:47,380
The open ended questions are generally more common for assessing exposures, but they can be really difficult to code prior to analysis.

224
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:56,170
Right. So if you're the data manager and the data analyst charged with assessing the data from this study or from this collection effort,

225
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:04,210
it's so much easier if you have yes or no to read into your to your programing code or A, B, C or D, right.

226
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:14,350
Or some predefined binned answer versus like someone wrote a sentence in a box and you have to somehow classify that and categorize it.

227
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:20,460
Right. To put it into a format that can actually be analyzed.

228
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:29,380
Four closed ended questions, these are the choices given, you know, should be simple and brief,

229
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:38,040
uh, not used frequently for exposure, they they aren't generally as helpful.

230
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:44,070
They are common in things like nutrition, epidemiology. So like for food frequency questionnaires.

231
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:55,170
Right. Um, and again, as I just mentioned, number three, they're, uh, they're fantastic in terms of how easy answers aren't close.

232
00:27:55,170 --> 00:28:02,710
Any questions for data entry and coding data, uh, prior to analysis?

233
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:12,460
In terms of wording to questions, this is a big deal, so questions that should be asked about the wording of each question in a questionnaire.

234
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:19,780
So if you're designing a questionnaire and you're coming up with your questions, once you have a draft,

235
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:26,140
you need to ask yourself, will the words be uniformly understood by the subject population?

236
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:35,800
Does it contain abbreviations or unconventional phrases or jargon that might not be clear or confusing right to a to a subject?

237
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,720
Is it vague? Is it too precise? Is it biased? Is it threatening?

238
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,250
Uh, does it contain more than one concept? Right. This would make it complicated.

239
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,870
Does it contain something like a double negative? Those are oftentimes difficult to answer.

240
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:57,310
If the answer especially is yes or no or the answer is mutually exclusive or is there,

241
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:02,460
you know, a little bit of overlap between the options of answers.

242
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:11,860
Does it assume too much about the respondents? Behavior is an unambiguous time frame reference, is the question cryptic?

243
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:21,250
And I think there are some examples here for questions that might not be very well designed.

244
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:27,280
For example, where does your highest exposure to NATO take place?

245
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:36,590
This might have some issues because a respondants might not even know what you know to is, let alone what's a high exposure.

246
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:42,820
Um, how many minutes per week are you exposed to traffic teams?

247
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:48,250
Minutes is a pretty well defined measure, right, or something to estimate.

248
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:58,210
It's way too precise. It's going to force the respondent to try to add perhaps many minutes over seven days of a week.

249
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:06,840
That's going to be some pretty complicated math to try to figure out. And then from the subject's perspective, what counts as traffic seems.

250
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:14,040
Is that just what time do I say, OK, how much I made my car, and that's the definition of when I might be exposed to traffic fumes,

251
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:19,800
is when I'm in my car and I have the windows rolled down, but not when the windows are rolled up.

252
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:26,070
Does it also include when I'm not in my car and I'm walking down the sidewalk and there are cars, you know, in my vicinity.

253
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:33,090
So some obvious problems with that question up here on the right side.

254
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:40,500
Have you used any pesticides? Again, it's too vague what what actually counts as a pesticide?

255
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:48,420
There's no time period given. And then similarly, did you use any pesticides in nineteen ninety five.

256
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:55,410
Wow. That's that's going to be a tough one. That time period is really precise and it's a long time ago.

257
00:30:55,410 --> 00:31:02,340
We might instead ask a kind of surrogate questions to be able to get around that.

258
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,450
Uh did you garden during nineteen ninety five.

259
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:10,560
That might be an easier recall when you garden.

260
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,990
Did you have pest problems. Right.

261
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:23,370
So answers to those questions might give you a better estimate of the likelihood that someone was exposed to pesticides in nineteen ninety five.

262
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:40,730
I'll pause briefly for a drink of water and see if folks have any questions.

263
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:52,430
All right, so continuing on with that question format, so there are some principles to follow when we're formatting individual questions,

264
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:57,930
we want to identify separate parts of different questions with different face types.

265
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:02,990
Right. So with embedded within the question, we might use capital letters for the question,

266
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:14,120
boldface type for the alternate answers or like italics for the instructions to kind of easily distinguish visually within the question.

267
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:23,090
We want to include specific instructions and prompts for the interviewers, write instructions to them in terms of how the questions are being asked.

268
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:30,620
Things like vertical answer formats. From a study perspective, we want to code all of the close questions.

269
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:37,370
We already know how they're going to be coded, what we're going to do with that data for entry and analysis.

270
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:43,280
Always. We always want to associate the same code number with a particular response category, uh,

271
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:48,200
record responses to closed ended questions by circling the code number or the

272
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:53,210
alternative answer provides spaces or boxes for coding open ended questions.

273
00:32:53,210 --> 00:33:04,230
Right. So where that answer is to be provided. And then again, we want to consider the E of key entry of data when making design decisions.

274
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:14,060
So once that's been recorded. Again, this is unlike a hardcopy example, being able to key enter that data afterwards.

275
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:22,280
There are things again in questionnaire design options like skips or branches that go into more detail.

276
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:31,160
These can be difficult to design on on hard copy paper questionnaire because they add to the length perhaps tremendously.

277
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:36,200
They're definitely easier to implement within within a digital context.

278
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:45,610
So those space limitations and then perhaps increase respondent confusion, there's a matrix format that can be utilized.

279
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:53,720
So in this case, it's basically like filling out a table. Oftentimes these are open ended response.

280
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:06,030
They might be used for things like occupational or residential histories, write list where you previously lived, list where you previously worked.

281
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:16,050
The question order is is quite important, it can influence the response rate and the quality of the answers we obtain generally.

282
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:22,980
We want to begin a questionnaire, uh, with one or more kind of simple,

283
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:29,610
but also interesting questions to engage the participant and also kind of get them off to a good start.

284
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:36,960
Right. And lead to valuable responses throughout the remainder of the questionnaire.

285
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:49,200
And we want to order questions in a way that maintains kind of flow and respondent interest over time over the chronology of the questionnaire.

286
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,500
There are some aides to recall,

287
00:34:52,500 --> 00:35:00,660
so some things to consider in the questionnaire designed so respondents might have difficulty remembering specific facts.

288
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:09,600
Right. Multiple choice questions or supplemental cards with alternative answers can be helpful for recall.

289
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:14,790
Use of a calendar might also help depending on the context of questions.

290
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:24,060
There's an example here of pregnancy. This might help looking back in time of a pregnancy and also letting respondents to the

291
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:32,670
extent possible know what types of questions to expect in advance of the questionnaire.

292
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:42,450
Another eight is a tiered approach, so having general questions followed by more specific questions, uh,

293
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:50,130
there can be several layers of detail that might be useful, especially when we get to the data analysis.

294
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:54,240
And this is commonly used for for occupational exposures. Right.

295
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,620
So what company did you work for? What type of industry was it?

296
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:03,990
What was your job title? What were the tasks? What was the chemical type that you worked with?

297
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:13,620
And then, you know, the specific chemical. So it's kind of starting broad and general at the top and then kind of zeroed in as it goes down.

298
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:23,300
And then again, like we talked about previously, with pesticides and perhaps use of a garden is asking instead about surrogates of exposure.

299
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:32,680
So if it's going to be difficult for someone to recall a very specific instance a very long time ago, we can ask more general questions.

300
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:38,490
Have you had pest problems in the home? Uh, do you have gas stoves in your home?

301
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:43,830
Right. Based on those kind of surrogates, we might be able to estimate what type of airborne exposure,

302
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:54,910
what type of dermal exposure, if pesticides are being used, if there's combustion with cooking and so forth.

303
00:36:54,910 --> 00:37:00,340
Once we have a questionnaire in place, it really needs to be pilot tested.

304
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:06,790
We can't just say, all right, I have all my questions, let's go do this big, expensive study and collect all the data.

305
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:16,780
So the objective of pilot testing is to identify questions that might be poorly understood or ambiguous, uh,

306
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:25,330
not fully answered or answerable or that evoke kind of undesirable responses like, oh, we didn't really think people were going to answer that way.

307
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:33,220
Right. So steps in kind of pre testing and final development of a questionnaire is, you know,

308
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:39,700
first just obtaining peer evaluation of a draft circulating in among colleagues,

309
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:48,790
people who study team, having them give feedback, uh, testing revisions to that questionnaire on a sample of convenience.

310
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:58,000
You know, your family at home again, your colleagues, some of your friends getting some kind of informal input,

311
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,890
uh, then preparing instructions for use of that questionnaire and training interviewers for a pilot test.

312
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:12,880
So problems requiring revision of the questionnaire could be encumbered by going through that process,

313
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:19,750
pre testing the questionnaire on a sub sample of respondents that are representative of the

314
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:25,780
population that you're actually going to be studying or where your subjects will be drawn,

315
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:30,190
obtaining comments of interviewers and subjects, preferably in writing.

316
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:33,610
So you can actually go through them in detail,

317
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:42,640
making revisions to those questions that are identified to be causing difficulty pretested and revise it again,

318
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,650
prepare those revised instructions and train the interviewers for implementation of the study,

319
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:51,730
revise the questionnaire if this process uncovers more problems.

320
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,340
And then even once it's rolled out,

321
00:38:54,340 --> 00:39:03,790
we'd still want to monitor the performance of the questionnaire during the early phases of the study and kind of be open to stopping if we need to,

322
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:12,620
to revise and pretest before before continuing. Translating questionnaires, right?

323
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:24,440
So this is language based. Translation, It's often necessary in diverse populations or multicenter like institutional studies.

324
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:36,260
So questionnaires should be translated and then back translated by multiple people with expertize people that are fluent in the languages involved,

325
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:42,320
people that understand that topic matter and what the study objectives are.

326
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:51,110
And then the back translation needs to be done by someone who's not actually seen the original version of the questionnaire.

327
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:57,770
This tells us that the translation is accurate and beneficial.

328
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:04,580
Translating needs to take into account cultural differences and again requires kind of a separate pilot test.

329
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:11,450
Right. So if you've designed the questionnaire, let's say in English and you go through the pilot testing process and work out all the kinks,

330
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:22,970
if it's also being administered in Spanish, that basically requires its own complete piloting and pretesting.

331
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:30,050
We talked about validity kind of earlier on in the slide deck, so with regards to questionnaires,

332
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:36,650
does the questionnaire actually measure what it needs to measure or what we're hoping it's going to measure?

333
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:47,570
Ideally, all questions in a questionnaire would be validated against a gold standard done on a not perhaps a sub study in a population.

334
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,140
Often this this isn't possible.

335
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:59,540
It might be because there is no clear gold standard for exposure there just kind of multiple ways to estimate what the exposure might be.

336
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:09,350
Um, and then in reality, few questionnaires and exposure assessment, uh, have been formally validated.

337
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:17,960
So what we end up doing in many cases is relying on previously used questions and kind of simply trial and error.

338
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:24,200
Right. So if it's not validated, it's not able to be measured against the gold standard.

339
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:29,060
But there's been 20 other studies that have used this questionnaire.

340
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,610
We can interpret our results within the results of the other studies.

341
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:41,270
Right. So our conclusions, maybe we find a lower rate of exposure as was found in these other communities or in these other workplace settings.

342
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:46,340
It's still valuable information, but it doesn't quite get us to, you know,

343
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:54,570
what is the exact exposure or there's a larger amount of uncertainty associated with our estimate.

344
00:41:54,570 --> 00:42:01,620
With regards to assessing that validity, uh, there are a couple of key components that we're trying to assess.

345
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:13,410
One is sensitivity. So this is looking at the probability of getting a positive answer when the exposure is truly present.

346
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:24,930
And then conversely, we're assessing the specificity, which is the probability of receiving a negative answer when the exposure is really absent.

347
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:33,630
So these these indicators, uh, are measures of whether our questions are valid or not.

348
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:37,350
We can assess the positive predictive value.

349
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:46,260
So this is the probability that a person is actually exposed, given that the person gave a positive answer.

350
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:54,510
And we also assess negative predictive value. So that's the probability that a person is truly not exposed, right.

351
00:42:54,510 --> 00:43:09,390
When the person gives a negative answer. Another measure of, uh, of questionnaires is its repeatability or reliability or reproducibility.

352
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:16,140
So are the same answers obtained when the questionnaire is is administered multiple times.

353
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:30,210
Uh, this can be assessed by administering the questionnaire twice to maybe a subset of study participants and looking for correlation between answers.

354
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,860
Self-administered questionnaires,

355
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:43,980
these generally are the the easiest and cheapest or less resource intensive ways to obtain information on both perhaps present and past exposures.

356
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:50,610
They require the least amount of involvement from both parties. Right. Like an interviewer or a subject.

357
00:43:50,610 --> 00:44:04,840
They can be handed out right on hard copy, perhaps mailed to study subjects or digitally recorded through devices, online, etc., cetera.

358
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:12,310
Um, they generally give us a lower response rates compared to other questionnaire methods.

359
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:16,590
Uh, you know, if it's hard copy and it's being mailed, it might not be received.

360
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:21,130
It might just be kind of pitched right away into the garbage.

361
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:33,910
Um. Handing out a questionnaire with some sort of personal contact, even if it's to be self-administered, usually helps the response rate.

362
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:40,090
And in this case, when it's self-administered, it really can't be too long and needs to be relatively brief,

363
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:44,620
something that can be completed in less than 60 Minutes for sure.

364
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:55,680
Ideally less than that. All right, so moving from questionnaires into another category of surrogate measures of exposures.

365
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:05,460
So talking about interviews, diaries, observation and then accessing records and the use of proxy respondents, so interviews.

366
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:09,740
Right. So for the most part, we're talking about face to face interviews here.

367
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:15,420
The advantages are that an interviewer can explain any question if necessary.

368
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,340
Right. So they can ask a question.

369
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:25,200
And if the subject doesn't understand the question and kind of ask for clarification, there's this is a definite advantage.

370
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:33,290
They can explore answers to certain questions in more detail. And because of the engagement involved, they can generally be longer in duration.

371
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:41,130
So so perhaps over an hour. The disadvantages is that it requires a really well trained interviewer.

372
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:48,600
Right. So you can't just pull somebody off the street and say, hey, go administer this questionnaire.

373
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:56,040
They really need to be well trained on the questionnaire itself, on the topic and content.

374
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:02,830
It might result, again, a disadvantage of interviews that might result in more socially acceptable answers.

375
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:05,400
Right. If a person is just kind of responding,

376
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:14,040
saying maybe a self-administered questionnaire and it's a question about drinking alcohol during pregnancy or smoking during pregnancy,

377
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,800
keeping kind of that pregnancy as an example, you know,

378
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,680
they might be more likely to be more forthcoming versus if there's a person sitting there across from them when they're feeling a little bit,

379
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:29,370
you know, this is going to be a tough one to actually admit to to another person.

380
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:34,800
They're logistically more difficult for for in person or face to face interviews.

381
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,560
It involves travel and involves scheduling when or when are both parties available.

382
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:47,650
So in general, it's much more expensive or resource intensive than a self-administered questionnaire.

383
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:53,190
Um, so if they're not face to face in person, they can be over the phone.

384
00:46:53,190 --> 00:47:02,820
They can be a video interview. Some of these advantages is it still allows the interviewer to to further explain any question.

385
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:11,310
Again, more detailed responses can be acquired. It's easier to organize and cost less for sure than the face to face.

386
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,680
And in these cases,

387
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:22,380
it might be more time and resource efficient because data entry can actually be done during the interviewer during the course of the interview.

388
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:32,580
Uh, disadvantages. Again, it requires a pretty well trained interviewer needs to be shorter in duration because it's not face to face generally,

389
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:37,620
maybe thirty to forty five minutes over the phone or over video.

390
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:41,370
And it might need to be recorded to kind of ensure that quality control.

391
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:49,690
So an opportunity to kind of go back and document or make sure the information was recorded properly.

392
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:56,470
For self-administered diaries, these can be used repeatedly to obtain information on present exposures.

393
00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:03,010
So, again, some examples are food frequency diaries or microenvironment studies.

394
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:11,980
We can use them to assess day to day variability within subjects, as well as variability between subjects and some scenarios.

395
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:22,460
They might be used to represent long term exposures, and they can also be combined with exposure measures to obtain improved estimates of exposures.

396
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:36,280
But again, since there self-administered, they need to be relatively short and easy to fill out, and that doesn't require much of any detailed recall.

397
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:42,760
Another approach for four Sergant estimates of exposure is through observation.

398
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:49,480
So when additional information is exposure related to behavior is needed is often when observation comes in.

399
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:55,390
So examples are safe for children and hand-to-mouth contact, right?

400
00:48:55,390 --> 00:49:01,510
It's really hard to ask a parent or a child how many times that your child would put their hand to their mouth per day.

401
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:09,160
Right. So if you can just simply be in present with the child and observe them against someone

402
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:15,220
who's trained to do this can record hand-to-mouth contact similarly for work tasks.

403
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:24,520
Right. For a worker who doesn't actually realize how many times they do this or that or whether they do it at all, just simply through observation.

404
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:30,280
This can be more accurately documented. It could take place in real time or utilize video.

405
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:37,030
Right. So someone just kind of recorded on the job and then at a convenient time following that,

406
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:40,840
someone goes through the video and is making these observations.

407
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:47,770
Advantages of an observation approach is that it could be more accurate and objective than other methods.

408
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:52,570
The disadvantages that it's can be quite time consuming and resource intensive.

409
00:49:52,570 --> 00:50:04,150
Right. So costly. And for the most part, it can only be conducted on a smaller number of study subjects.

410
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:08,080
So accessing records as a way to estimate exposures.

411
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:15,550
So records can be used to obtain obtain objective information on past or present exposures.

412
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:20,650
Some examples might be what a person's job title is, uh,

413
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:33,580
what material safety data sheets say about what their job title encompassed as part of the company records.

414
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:39,220
Some limitations might be if you're looking back over, say, a 30 year time period.

415
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:47,620
The terminology used in those records may change over the years in between different sources of the records.

416
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:52,180
They used to collect that information this way. And then it now was collected this way.

417
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:55,630
They used to use these terms. Now they use these terms.

418
00:50:55,630 --> 00:51:04,450
This can make it difficult to analyze that data or information might be difficult to gain access in the first place.

419
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:15,350
In addition to interpret or organize the. Proxy respondents are also used to help us estimate exposures.

420
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:22,910
So these are people who provide information on exposure in place of the subjects themselves, right.

421
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:31,460
So it's learned that workers in a certain industry, many of them died of cancer.

422
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:40,220
And so there's a study done to try to determine if their death due to cancer was actually caused by something in the workplace.

423
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:48,320
Clearly, the respondents, the subjects themselves are no longer around to be able to ask questions.

424
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,920
So there may be proxy respondents in their place.

425
00:51:51,920 --> 00:52:00,200
So, again, this proxy respondents could be used in terms of death and might be used in terms of something like dementia,

426
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:05,330
you know, cognitive abilities, very young children who can't easily answer.

427
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:13,790
So perhaps a parent or a caregiver providing the respondents or the answers using this approach can

428
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:20,930
help increase the study size if the presence of these conditions is high for a population of interest.

429
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:26,690
There are also some issues. We need a high total number of subjects due to.

430
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:32,780
There's going to be more error since it's not actually the subject themselves, it's a proxy for the subject.

431
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:39,710
We need proxies that have the best knowledge of the subject exposure and the quality

432
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:46,040
of the data relies on the type an impact of exposure and exposure scenarios.

433
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:50,060
And the proxies are generally providing less detail.

434
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:56,270
And it's going to lead to more missing responses in that questionnaire.

435
00:52:56,270 --> 00:53:05,060
There are quantitative and semi quantitative surrogates of exposure estimates and again,

436
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:12,470
what kind of do some comparison here within the occupational setting, as well as kind of a community environmental setting?

437
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:18,740
Within a workplace setting, we're often using surrogates like employment duration.

438
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:24,920
How long did someone work there? What was their job title? What were their job tasks?

439
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,690
We can utilize the job exposure matrix. We'll talk about all of these here in a minute.

440
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:36,140
We could also utilize expert evaluation within a community setting.

441
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:44,000
We're often using things like distance from something and address where someone lived.

442
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:53,990
Um, guys incorporating geospatial components into the analysis as well as time and activity.

443
00:53:53,990 --> 00:54:06,030
So behavior of subjects. So within that workplace, getting exposure surrogates, we can utilize things like employment history and duration, right?

444
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:12,120
What's the general industry and the inferred or likely exposures associated with that?

445
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:17,460
This might be obtained from records, the employees themselves or proxies.

446
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:22,050
The job title can in itself be quite useful.

447
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:29,760
Generalized job titles are less useful if someone's job title is an operator in a chemical plant.

448
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:36,150
That doesn't really tell us exactly what they might have been exposed to if their title was a reactor operator.

449
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:44,160
That would be much different, right? That would allow us to to zero in and point it in the direction for assessing a more specific exposure.

450
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:49,620
But there's still substantial misclassification that can occur if employees within a

451
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:55,200
title performed different tasks like even though their job title was reactor operator.

452
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:03,480
But in reality, they did a lot of other things unrelated to operation of the reactor.

453
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,320
Continuing along these lines, job processes, right?

454
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:14,370
So what are the services provided, the products manufactured in this workplace, the materials being produced,

455
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:20,040
processed or handled can help us to estimate exposures, a map of the work area.

456
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:28,050
Right. So like a physical layout of a factory, for example, or a description of the environment,

457
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:34,740
there was a lot of airflow there or not could help us assess ventilation and then documentation

458
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:42,870
of process changes that might affect exposure levels where there are substitution involved,

459
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:52,230
where the controls in place was personal protective equipment utilized or standardized or required job tasks.

460
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:56,130
So job specific questionnaires can be useful.

461
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:58,080
So within a work history,

462
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:07,590
they can provide more specific information than just the title or the duration they might aid in expert evaluations of exposure.

463
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:14,390
But they also may be difficult to gather that detailed information.

464
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:24,770
So with regards to a job exposure metric, these are mostly used in case control studies requiring historical exposure assessment.

465
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:36,650
So in this case, the occupations and or the industries are listed on one axis and then the exposure agents of concern are listed on the other.

466
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:42,560
In some cases, a calendar period might kind of form a third access.

467
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:49,890
They're designed to be study specific and usually assign exposure to a very detailed list of jobs.

468
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:55,370
There's an example here that is kind of a hypothetical example of a job exposure

469
00:56:55,370 --> 00:57:00,320
matrix highlighting kind of the basic elements where again and one access we have,

470
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:15,460
uh, kind of like the industry or the occupation, the types of jobs, and then on the other axis, what the exposures of concern might be.

471
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:20,520
And then expert evaluation can be useful for assessing exposures.

472
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:30,550
So this involves in error, enables us to interpret applicability of existing measurement data or maybe fill in the gaps.

473
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:40,870
Where no data exists is thought to have a better vantage point than study subjects themselves due to kind of the expertize level of training.

474
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:51,700
This would involve someone with knowledge of both work processes and study objectives to help determine the jobs and exposures that are most relevant.

475
00:57:51,700 --> 00:58:02,050
And it's traditionally performed like in a workplace by a trained industrial hygienist within like an occupational cohort study.

476
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:09,400
Its use is growing in case control studies, and some of these experts would be industrial chemists,

477
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:16,390
engineers, occupational physicians or industry specific professionals.

478
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:28,090
This type of approach is rarely used in those kind of community contexts, at least to date.

479
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:35,260
So use of interviews with with key informants, published literature in similar settings.

480
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:42,310
Um, this would be like a two phase paradigm in expert evaluations, and it's shown to provide a greater amount of precision.

481
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:48,940
So, again, it's really tapping into the expertize of this of this person or team.

482
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:58,810
The disadvantages of expert evaluation is finding someone who's familiar with all jobs.

483
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:05,680
Right. Or conditions and all time periods, especially if you're looking retrospectively back in time.

484
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:14,890
Uh, you know, the black still have lack of knowledge on a wide range of industries and jobs found in work histories and a population based study

485
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:25,470
or lack of knowledge on important work site characteristics without actually having detailed reports from the subjects themselves.

486
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:35,120
Moving to kind of some of those community environmental examples of quantitative surrogates, one is geography, right?

487
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:41,970
So relying on spatial difference and exposure can help us to estimate what those exposures might be.

488
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:52,410
So we often have groups of individuals in one area that have a higher exposure to an agent of interest than other groups.

489
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:57,690
There can be systematic differences in exposure over distance as well.

490
00:59:57,690 --> 01:00:01,650
So things like a home address is very common. Where have you lived?

491
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:15,220
Um, using GPS coordinates, collecting that residential history information and then combining that with other known things geographically.

492
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:25,990
Right. So if we know where someone lived and then we combine that with this example plot over here on the right, a toxic release inventory.

493
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:32,940
Right. So we know where all of the dense highways are or the highest amount of traffic is.

494
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:42,720
This would allow us to know where a large amount of traffic related emissions are at industrial sites for metals,

495
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:54,060
for waste, et cetera, in urban areas, perhaps their Superfund sites where there's hazardous waste present in more rural areas, agriculture, crops,

496
01:00:54,060 --> 01:01:03,270
exposures related to farming, and then other potential exposure sources, uh, radio transmitters, power transformers, et cetera.

497
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:09,060
If we know where someone has lived over time and we can combine that with what

498
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:14,670
doe those exposures are in their local community during those time periods,

499
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:27,720
how far they've lived from these sources of toxins or agents, we can construct quantitatively an exposure estimate.

500
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:34,470
All right. So a few conclusions here with with regards to surrogate measures of exposure.

501
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:39,570
So the use of surrogate measures is usually less costly than personal monitoring.

502
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:47,340
Right. Collecting biomarker samples, but also, again, typically comes with less accuracy and precision.

503
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:50,850
It's associated with an increased amount of measurement error,

504
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:57,000
and it really needs to be validated, although there are challenges to actually accomplishing that.

505
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:02,040
Sometimes surrogate data is is the only data available.

506
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:09,270
Right. So when we're doing a retrospective exposure assessment, looking back in time, it's pretty much our only option, right?

507
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:12,570
If we collect a biomarker, perhaps it would be useful.

508
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:22,830
If we monitor someone externally, it's not going to be very helpful for knowledge about what they're exposed to in the past,

509
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:29,410
many times, combinations of these surrogate measures or surrogate measures combined with monitoring data.

510
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:37,680
Right. Are used. It can be very useful and actually strength and increased confidence in our data and then

511
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:43,920
increase access to large databases over time here is improving our ability to do this,

512
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:50,260
as well as enhanced assessment of the validity of these various approaches.

513
01:02:50,260 --> 01:03:03,310
All right, I successfully got through it, leaving 16 minutes left in class for a starting with questions on today's lecture,

514
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:21,980
but then secondary to that, any questions that folks have regarding the exam on Thursday?

515
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:24,960
So remind me, like your tenants today. Yes.

516
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:42,710
Uh, so the material that we just finished covering is where we draw the line for material to be included on the exam on Thursday.

517
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:48,760
But the question Panopto credibility like the limitation, right, or Hathway,

518
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:56,170
should we be really looking at the equation or is going to be like 11, 25 percent?

519
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:58,990
It's been three days. Yeah, no, no.

520
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:10,920
The basic data to kind of what are the variables that go into being able to calculate a half point, an elimination rate and so forth?

521
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:19,450
Uh, I'm I don't don't expect, you know, some really complex again, no calculators are going to be needed, uh, for the exam.

522
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:31,260
It's going to be like very simple on paper or mental math.

523
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:43,860
At the same time, the fear is that exposure to of the units that might be construed like consistent with them or one of the factors.

524
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:48,480
So I'll give a general answer first. This is not going to be a calculation.

525
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:57,370
Having them, uh, I don't actually recall offhand.

526
01:04:57,370 --> 01:05:03,790
Less than 10 percent, I would say, of the questions on the exam, even involve, you know,

527
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:12,650
some sort of basic calculation, um, more a more specific answer to your to your question.

528
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:19,240
Um, and then go ahead, risk it again. I think you pretty much answered it, but really, congratulations.

529
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,660
But unions, you convert. Yeah. Yeah.

530
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:32,530
But there's not going to be like a random link here is KG's per cubic meter, please, you know, convert this to micrograms per whatever.

531
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:39,130
But that's not important in my in my view. I trust that you would all be able to figure that out.

532
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:48,280
And that's not something you need to be examined on.

533
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:55,760
But, you know, just general concepts of units, if we want to estimate how many particles are floating around in our classroom,

534
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:04,480
where we would know that in order to collect the sample, we would put it that collected under a filter by drawing air through it.

535
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,270
We would measure what the mass of the particles is,

536
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:15,490
and we would need to know how much air we've drawn through it in order to calculate a concentration rate of mass per volume of air.

537
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:27,120
So conceptually, yes, I'm hoping that you understand that within, you know, different exposure, media exposure pathways.

538
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:36,440
But but conceptuality, not with any specific detail behind it.

539
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:42,590
But these days, for like.

540
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:51,530
All of the British going to look for legislation and standards and things, yeah, that's a really good question.

541
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:55,730
I'm going to repeat that one actually for the recording. So our date is important.

542
01:06:55,730 --> 01:07:03,770
So, for example, knowing when a particular legislative act was passed or when a certain standard was implemented, generally, no.

543
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:13,850
I think more conceptually, again, I mean, understanding that there was quite a bit of kind of progress several decades ago and perhaps not so much

544
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:24,480
progress or updates to standards and regulation in more present relative years would be useful to understand.

545
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:33,350
Um, not so much the dates, but over time, what has been updated.

546
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:44,730
Right. So where did we stand in 1970 and in at least what was improved upon or updated in terms of standards in 1990?

547
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:48,620
Right. So from a long time ago to a less long time ago.

548
01:07:48,620 --> 01:08:21,180
But yeah. Not needing to recall specific dates. Let's go up here first and then we'll come back over you.

549
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:28,560
Go ahead. How much will the readings be?

550
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:33,360
Yeah, good question. So how much will the readings be emphasized?

551
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:38,130
So, um, the readings are like, I really want you to do them.

552
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:42,750
I hope you've been doing them. I hope that you're benefiting from the readings.

553
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:52,410
They go into much more detail and give much more background and context that I'm able to cover in an hour and 20 minutes in each class period.

554
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:57,130
So you should be gaining a deeper understanding from the readings.

555
01:08:57,130 --> 01:09:02,370
Um, but but to answer the question and I think the way you're probably answering it or

556
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:08,580
asking it is I'm not going to pull out some random factoid from chapter three,

557
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:13,860
page thirty nine in the last paragraph at the bottom that happened to mention,

558
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:18,870
you know, that, uh, whatever, twelve point five was found or something like that.

559
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:21,270
Right. I'm not going to ask you about that.

560
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:34,050
Um, but, you know, hopefully your ability to answer the questions, uh, accurately and fully, that you'll benefit by by having done the readings.

561
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:45,810
Does that that a fair answer? OK. OK, and then if I remember correctly, one of the.

562
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:56,670
Sure. So simple questions are absolutely it's a great question, so I can walk through kind of the logistics of the exam.

563
01:09:56,670 --> 01:10:02,670
So for the most part, people that are relying on the recording for today, you know,

564
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:11,310
you're taking it online and it's a different set of logistics for everybody here who's going to be taking it in person in the classroom.

565
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:17,640
It's the same start time as our class, right. So we'll get going right at eight thirty.

566
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:22,920
You'll have until nine fifty the end of the class, period. That's like a full 80 minutes.

567
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:29,850
It's going to be old school hard copy. So just bring something to write with you won't really need anything else.

568
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:36,630
Stay in. You're kind of like assigned seats or whatever. You're already kind of distance on purpose, right?

569
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:43,360
So you're not sitting right next to somebody. I'll pass out the exam right away.

570
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:52,080
I'll be here the entire time, you know, for any questions that folks may have in terms of the design of the exam,

571
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:57,960
I've written it that most people should be able to complete it within 60 minutes.

572
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:03,510
I fully expect that some of you will complete it in less than that.

573
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:10,440
Probably forty five minutes. That was kind of my own estimate. Will certainly be at least a couple of people.

574
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:17,070
A reminder, as you finish early, you're free to go, right?

575
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:25,110
Certainly turn in the exam, but just try to kind of quietly excuse yourself as others are continuing to to work on the exam.

576
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:36,180
Um, so yeah. So that's the kind of my time estimates and answering your question in terms of a number of questions on the exam.

577
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:44,100
Gosh, uh, maybe like thirty five questions, something like that.

578
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:49,050
Um, a large number of those are multiple choice.

579
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:59,250
There are also questions that are kind of like filling in the blanks or, you know, list three of these, four of those, something like that.

580
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:03,330
And then there are a few answers that you would truly call short answer.

581
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:11,700
Right. So I'm asking you to write a few sentences in order or a few bullet points to actually answer a question list.

582
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:18,170
Three examples, something like that, is that most of the information you're looking for.

583
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:29,230
OK. I don't know what it is, but there's a question about to start with you, your.

584
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:36,020
That's for me. And we're looking more like heat exhaustion and heat stroke, really, just in case.

585
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:44,570
Absolutely. No, this is like stuff we've covered in class. You know, not not expecting you to have read the latest from the journal.

586
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:53,870
Heat stroke and exhaustion or anything like that. Um, just being able to to the primary concerns with regards to health and heat exposure.

587
01:12:53,870 --> 01:13:08,760
Yeah. Oh, two more questions as well, that hand first, can you just go back over like Hazard vs. toxicity?

588
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:13,770
Yes. Do you actually have it pulled up? There's this there's a slide.

589
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:20,110
Right, specific to that.

590
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:29,050
If you can hear me and I want a lecture that was I'll download it, and so we're all looking at the same thing as lecture for the war.

591
01:13:29,050 --> 01:14:00,720
So this is one, two, three, four. And then up and down the slide, number 16.

592
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:06,030
Perfect. All right, thank you for that, super helpful.

593
01:14:06,030 --> 01:14:16,710
OK, so and for context, right, this is if you remember, we were using different schemes to classify chemical exposures.

594
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:20,700
Right. To what this is within the context of buy use.

595
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:30,180
So how chemicals are used. And then we'll just I'll just read the definitions here and then we can kind of discuss it if we need to.

596
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:41,610
So when we talk about toxicity. Right. So this can be considered an intrinsic property of a substance and it's evaluated with respect to a

597
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:49,740
target organism or site within an organism and the time frame over which the toxic effect occurs.

598
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:58,500
This would be toxicity, whereas hazard is it's a function of the toxicity.

599
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:06,300
But then also, in addition to that, the nature and the intensity of exposure.

600
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:17,520
So a highly toxic material can represent a low hazard if there's little or no potential for exposure.

601
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:27,030
So a nuclear power plant is potentially highly toxic.

602
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:38,980
But if the nearest one to you is located on the opposite side of the earth, it actually represents a relatively low hazard to you.

603
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:45,340
That's a kind of an oversimplified example, but hoping that it kind of distinguishes between the two does not.

604
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:51,140
Yeah, like I think they're kind of like looking at this last night, I was thinking like asbestos.

605
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:55,370
It's highly toxic, but, yeah, encapsulated in yellow.

606
01:15:55,370 --> 01:16:00,200
That's a great example. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

607
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:08,520
And then you had a question about, yeah, actually, OK, it was the first couple lecture's lectures.

608
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:13,400
It as a definition of like you can have a biological or chemical hazard.

609
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:18,530
And we also use the word Tresser. Are those synonyms? Is there a difference?

610
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:23,600
Yeah, they're they're synonyms probably isn't fair, but they're very similar.

611
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,860
And I'm actually thinking back to I don't know anybody else remember this.

612
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:35,690
I think Professor NEITZEL right. When he gave his lecture on physical hazards, he said, I'm just going to state up front.

613
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:41,780
I'm going to use these terms and use these terms almost interchangeably.

614
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:46,910
Right, between physical exposures, physical hazards.

615
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:56,030
So it's it's one that. Yeah. And again, this is something that's kind of evolved over time, um, in terms of the use of terms.

616
01:16:56,030 --> 01:17:00,200
And it's a little bit confusing generally speaking.

617
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:09,770
Yes. People are going to say, uh, physical exposure, a physical hazard, a physical stressor,

618
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:15,580
and they all are kind of implying the same thing when they use those terms.

619
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:24,480
OK, so generally speaking, yes, but if you really got down to the nitty gritty, they're not exactly synonyms.

620
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:34,440
But if it is, something is asking, like you said, like give an example of a hazard that could be like a specific chemical or like.

621
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:38,820
Absolutely. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. OK, yes.

622
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:48,990
No, good question. And apologies for the not very precise answer.

623
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:53,280
Yeah, so Professor, release section,

624
01:17:53,280 --> 01:18:03,810
one of the questions on the study guide is compare and contrast the differences in the risk for environmental and occupational.

625
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:08,520
There's like a value like one to the like one in ten to the negative six.

626
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:17,110
And then like, are we supposed to memorize the values? But there's also another slide where it compares like involuntary or voluntary.

627
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:25,440
Yeah, I'll pull up her slide deck. Uh, here it is, page forty six.

628
01:18:25,440 --> 01:19:00,060
Forty six. OK. But this one, yeah, OK, where was where was the one that there is actually a slide that has one in.

629
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:11,750
One more up. Yeah, right, controlling or comparing, uh, EPA and OSHA, uh, my, uh.

630
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:14,180
There you go.

631
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:31,400
Yeah, so this was in the context of acceptable risk of health effects and, uh, I think she was illustrating that within a workplace setting,

632
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:40,700
what's deemed acceptable, uh, is one in 10 to the minus three, which is, I believe, one in a thousand.

633
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:52,370
And then with the Environmental Protection Agency, which is looking at, um, you know, exposures taking a place across like a community more public,

634
01:19:52,370 --> 01:20:02,000
not within a workplace, the acceptable risk of health is much lower rates of one to 10 to the minus six, which is about one in a million.

635
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,950
And I'm actually going to turn that one around and see if anybody can answer it.

636
01:20:06,950 --> 01:20:19,830
So what was her point in illustrating those those differences? Mantosh has a much lower volume down to arrest the EPA.

637
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:31,280
And one of my fingers tied up with that where she was, Dwayne works out for or getting cancer 40 years and was.

638
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:40,280
Sure, yeah, so she was she was kind of trying to get across this point, and again, her lecture was mostly focusing on workplace exposures, writer,

639
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:44,930
occupational based exposures, but she was trying to kind of highlight that actually,

640
01:20:44,930 --> 01:20:49,580
I think it was her her very first line write it said like safety first.

641
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:53,730
Just kidding. Right. Or something like that is I like the motto of occupational health.

642
01:20:53,730 --> 01:21:02,030
Um, and so, you know, kind of getting across the message that, uh, and there is a little bit of logic behind it.

643
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:07,010
If it's a child at home in their neighborhood. Right.

644
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:15,320
If they're exposed to something, it's really not by anything related to their own doing or choices.

645
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:20,360
And because of that, the acceptable risk to health is very low.

646
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:31,850
Right, as enforced by the EPA. Whereas in a workplace setting, the worker is doing this job for the most part by choice,

647
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:42,410
with with information and kind of inherently within that, whether you agree with it or not, is a totally different, you know, conversation.

648
01:21:42,410 --> 01:21:50,130
But because of that context, the acceptable risk to health tends to be higher.

649
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:59,580
But that was that was the basic message that she was kind of trying to get across by by doing that comparison, oh, we are over time.

650
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:06,630
Thank you so much for these questions. You're all going to do great on the exam between now and Thursday.

651
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:11,970
If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

652
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:19,907
Thanks so much. Have a good day.
