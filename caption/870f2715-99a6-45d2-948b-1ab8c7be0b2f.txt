1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,041
Part 3, breastfeeding.

2
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:11,703
It is becoming common knowledge that
breastfeeding improves the health of

3
00:00:11,703 --> 00:00:12,665
newborns, but

4
00:00:12,665 --> 00:00:17,410
it is also true that breastfeeding
improves the health of mothers.

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,400
And these are long term health benefits.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,340
If we look at this list here, so improving
the rates of breast cancer, the process

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,310
of lactation decreases a woman's
lifetime risk of getting breast cancer.

8
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,660
If we look at other issues,
heart attacks, hypertension,

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,200
type 2 diabetes,
these are associated with the fact that

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,220
women who breastfeed are less likely to
be obese or to gain excessive weight.

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:48,210
So it is healthier for them, and all that
leads to a decrease in maternal deaths.

12
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,075
If we focus on the many
benefits of breast feeding for

13
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:57,430
children's health, this is one
example of a study that was modeling

14
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,960
if 90% of women followed American Academy
of Pediatrics recommendations,

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,350
saying that women should breastfeed for
the first six months.

16
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,250
And then continue to breastfeed for
the first year, it would prevent over 2.5

17
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,440
million gastrointestinal infections,
over 600,000 ear infections.

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,510
It would actually prevent over 700 deaths.

19
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:25,000
We would have fewer serous respiratory
infections like pneumonia.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,110
And we would decrease cases
of childhood obesity.

21
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,090
So if we think of this from
a public health standpoint,

22
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,750
we can certainly say that
promoting breastfeeding and

23
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,780
actions that promote breastfeeding
are great for our public health.

24
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,150
And so to talk just a little
bit about what breast milk is,

25
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,840
breast milk out during the first three to
four days after delivery is colostrum.

26
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,420
So this colostrum here,
colostrum is very small concentrated,

27
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,480
straw colored liquid that
comes out of the nipples.

28
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,310
It contains antibodies and immune cells.

29
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,830
And is considered sufficient to
fully nourish a healthy baby

30
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,140
until regular milk comes in.

31
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,280
And regular milk so
divided in this foremilk and hindmilk.

32
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,740
Regular milk comes into women's breasts at
about three to four days postpartum and

33
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,740
contains all of those fats, carbohydrates,
proteins and also antibodies and

34
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,670
immune cells that are specially
tailored to the baby at his or

35
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,810
her current developmental stage.

36
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,300
And is much more
digestible than cows milk.

37
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,870
So let's talk about who breastfeeds and
for how long people breastfeed.

38
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,080
if we look at Michigan,
this is recent Michigan data from 2014,

39
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,450
we have our healthy people 2020
goals which are right here.

40
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,840
That ever breastfed,

41
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,800
meaning that baby goes to the breast
at least once in the postpartum period.

42
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,350
And then compare that to
Michigan's report card, so 75%.

43
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:02,000
We've got an achievable goal if we want
to get to this 81%, which is exciting.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,090
If we look at formula
in the first two days

45
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,730
that's about 15% of women are doing that.

46
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,390
And then exclusive breastfeeding.

47
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,590
So the recommendations are exclusive
breastfeeding for the first six months.

48
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:21,760
But we are still only about 40% at three
months and then only 16% at 6 months.

49
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,200
Any breastfeeding at all at 6
months is still at about 46%,

50
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,480
which is actually not bad, these are much
better numbers than even a decade ago.

51
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,010
And almost a quarter of women are still
breastfeeding some at 12 months.

52
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,050
Even though once again,
the American Academy of Pediatrics

53
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,560
recommends that all babies should
breastfeed for the first 12 months.

54
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,440
So let's think a out who is
least likely to breastfeed.

55
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,390
Based on the data that we have,

56
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,890
breastfeeding is a cultural practice and
is

57
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:56,975
also something that needs to be supported
in our communities and in our families.

58
00:03:56,975 --> 00:04:00,705
So women from rural areas
are less likely to breastfeed.

59
00:04:00,705 --> 00:04:05,105
Young women, women who have
only a high school education,

60
00:04:05,105 --> 00:04:09,515
women who are living below the poverty
line and African American women.

61
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:13,565
So when we talk about targeted
interventions to try to increase breast

62
00:04:13,565 --> 00:04:19,840
feeding rates, we really need to look very
closely at these populations of women.

63
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,820
There are multiple factors that
contribute to lower breastfeeding rates.

64
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,160
First we'll start with birthing practices,
practice of high cesarean rates,

65
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,430
of inducing labor,
of providing narcotics during labor.

66
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,710
Those are all practices that decrease
that successful breastfeeding

67
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,660
in the early hours after the baby is born.

68
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,390
We know that there are ways to mitigate or
reduce those harmful

69
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:51,000
practices as far as porting breastfeeding,
but it continues to be a problem.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,470
It has been a custom

71
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:58,600
to have babies separated from their
moms immediately after birth.

72
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,670
In many hospitals, it continues to be a
common practice, where as soon as the baby

73
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,520
is born, the baby is taken over to
a warmer either in the same room or

74
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,910
in a room nearby, where the baby
is assessed by professionals and

75
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,540
then is returned to the mother
with a diaper and wrapped up.

76
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,460
And we know that that separation
decreases successful breastfeeding rates.

77
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,960
If we look at medical and
nursing education,

78
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,580
20 years ago it was very well documented
that basically medical students and

79
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,670
nursing students received very minimal
training around either the benefits

80
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:35,250
of breastfeeding or the mechanics of it
and how to support a mom in breastfeeding.

81
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,650
We are working towards improving that,
though it still is a weaker area

82
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:46,090
in our education compared to the long-term
health benefits that it promotes.

83
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,310
Early hospital discharge
has been considered or

84
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,600
labelled as one of the reasons for
decreased breastfeeding.

85
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,440
It's really common that women
are discharged at most 48 hours after

86
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,590
a baby is born and even 24 hours.

87
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,740
And if there is not substantial
follow-up care and advice and

88
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,710
support in the home environment
that can be a deterrent.

89
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:14,120
Limited support at home, we do not have
a nationally mandated paternity leave,

90
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,070
so it's not guaranteed that a mother
will have additional support.

91
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,090
It can also be that the additional
support may not have

92
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:26,430
any experience with breastfeeding and
so it can be undermined at that point.

93
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,820
If we look at access to lactation support,
there are professionalized roles,

94
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,085
IBCLC in board certified lactation
consultant or certified lactation

95
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:40,660
counselors are individuals who have
received additional levels of training.

96
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:46,520
However, that is still not very commonly
or easily accessible in many locations.

97
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,570
Formula companies have profited
tremendously on the decreased levels of

98
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,660
breastfeeding in this country.

99
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,050
And it is of course in their best interest
that as soon as someone waivers and

100
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,610
consider initiating formula
they want their company,

101
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,990
their product to be a brand recognized.

102
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,600
If we think about formula companies in
general, they used to routinely, and

103
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,510
it still happens in some hospitals,
provide free diaper bags.

104
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:19,130
They also generally provide free
formula for hospitals and it's a way

105
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,370
to get their brand and their recognition
of their brand in the hospital system.

106
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,090
We know that the more someone sees
a specific brand or sees formula being

107
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:34,640
used by a healthcare professional
settings, it's more likely to be adopted.

108
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,870
Maternity leave and return to work,
so depending on how long a woman is

109
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,480
able to be off work after her baby's
born can contribute to whether or

110
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,990
not she's able to successful breastfeed.

111
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,410
And finally undermining
women's confidence.

112
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:53,225
There's a lot of literature out there of
the first week or two after a baby is

113
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:57,673
born are very vulnerable times for
women, very open to suggestion.

114
00:07:57,673 --> 00:08:01,200
And any suggestion that their
breastfeeding is not adequate or

115
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,592
concerns that the baby may not
be getting enough nutrition,

116
00:08:04,592 --> 00:08:10,698
can rapidly erode a woman's commitment and
confidence with breastfeeding.

117
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:15,842
One case study example of how a hospital
can change their practices is,

118
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:18,210
the idea of the sacred hour.

119
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,760
So this is allowing continuous
skin to skin contact

120
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,200
immediately post birth until the first
breastfeeding has been completed,

121
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,310
so that's usually about an hour.

122
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,490
And this is actually a radical
practice change for most hospitals.

123
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,790
Because there are a lot of
task oriented items that

124
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,520
hospitals are used to doing
in that first hour of life.

125
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,240
So this is actually putting mother and
baby first and

126
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,340
postponing those task issues.

127
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,000
So in this one particular
study that they did,

128
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,368
they looked at rates of exclusive
breastfeeding at time of discharge.

129
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:57,420
So only 28% at this one
particular hospital,

130
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,110
before they did the intervention of
supporting continuous skin to skin and

131
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,340
the immediate hour after birth,
the sacred hour.

132
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,580
And then they doubled their exclusive
breast feeding rates within a year after

133
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,930
implementing this and they continued
to increase it two years later.

134
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:19,401
So this, to me, is a very inspiring
example of how we can change our hospital

135
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:27,311
practices and we can see marked success
rates in a short period of time.

136
00:09:27,311 --> 00:09:30,525
If we look at legislation to
protect breastfeeding in public,

137
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:34,586
we can say first of all that there is no
federal legislation that protects a woman

138
00:09:34,586 --> 00:09:35,937
to breastfeed in public.

139
00:09:35,937 --> 00:09:41,590
Even though at the state level in the last
15 years, we've seen a tremendous

140
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:46,902
movement where almost all states now
at least have a statute that protects

141
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:53,090
a woman who is breastfeeding from public
nudity, misdemeanor or even a felony.

142
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:57,920
But as we see here in 2005,
in Michigan, we passed this so

143
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,290
that a woman couldn't be charged with
public nudity if she was breastfeeding,

144
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,130
but there wasn't actually a state
law protecting her right.

145
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,110
We had a numerous incidents
here locally in Ann Arbor.

146
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:14,480
The Ann Arbor city code was changed
in 2006 after an episode of a woman

147
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,430
being asked to stop breastfeeding her baby
on a public deck of a swimming pool and

148
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:25,120
there was a large public outcry to that
and so Ann Arbor passed the city code.

149
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,490
And then if we fast forward here another
eight years, Michigan legislation

150
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,210
formerly protected a woman's right
to breastfeed in public places.

151
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,340
Once again, there's only one state
that's holding out that does not have

152
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,510
that legislation passed.

153
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,980
If we consider the federal legislation
that is promoting breast feeding,

154
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,040
we do have currently the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act,

155
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,910
which states that all employers must
provide a space that is not a bathroom for

156
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,130
breast milk expression for
the first year after birth.

157
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,550
And it also includes
the use of a breast pump or

158
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,330
access to a breast pump that
is covered by insurance.

159
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,690
So that's in our Affordable Care Act.

160
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,910
However, we have no nationwide
protection still against

161
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,530
breastfeeding discrimination.

162
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,820
So that is something that we
continue to advocate for.

163
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,080
So what's next with breastfeeding support?

164
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,470
We need to continue at the individual
level providing extensive support and

165
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,940
outreach to women during their pregnancy.

166
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,470
And especially, in the first week
postpartum for a successful breastfeeding.

167
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,560
We do need to improve our education for
healthcare providers who feel capable

168
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,670
of providing key information to
the patients that we care for.

169
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,790
We need to legislate an increased
maternity care leave to 12 weeks.

170
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:45,760
Currently, there is no federal mandate for
maternity care at all.

171
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,960
For companies that do
provide maternity care,

172
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,330
it's approximately six
weeks has become the norm.

173
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:57,880
However our data suggests that
a minimum of 12 weeks is best for

174
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,880
bonding and establishment of breastfeeding
before a mother returns to work.

175
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,591
We need a national legislation and

176
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:08,490
not just at the state level to protect
women's right to breastfeed in public.

177
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,684
And we need to work towards making
baby friendly hospitals a priority.

178
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:17,713
And so baby friendly hospital's
actually a UNICEF designation

179
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:23,765
of meeting very specific criteria that
are known to promote breastfeeding,

180
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:28,513
including the skin to skin,
not offering routing formula,

181
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:33,410
keeping babies and
moms together during hospital stays.

182
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,040
And so this is taking off.

183
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,260
And there's actually five hospitals in the
state of Michigan now that are designated

184
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,140
baby friendly.

185
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,433
And there are more to come.
