1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:10,830
Different from the types of presentations that I typically give, especially those of you that have me for virology.

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,000
And they just sort of.

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:22,850
It's going to be a very different type of presentation because my goal today with this presentation is, well, first to show you slides.

4
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,250
Here we go is to, you know,

5
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:34,479
the what we like the speakers to do and even have a speaker yet so don't know this what we asked the speaker to do

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,090
is to walk you through how they got to where they what their job looks like now and how they got to where they are.

7
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:47,920
I feel like you probably have a sense of what my job looks like now because you you are seeing me more and more around the school,

8
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:58,479
but I want it to take a little bit of time and talk through how I got to this point in my career and what the academic track look like for me now.

9
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:06,790
What the academic track looks like for me is, you know, there's a lot of variation in how you make your way through and through an academic track,

10
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:14,139
and then you'll get from Dr. back to Syria and you'll get her perspective in a couple of weeks and then in a few more weeks.

11
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,719
Ariana Myles Jay is the sort of cross between laboratory skills and bioinformatics skills,

12
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,320
and she's working for the State Health Department, so she'll give you that perspective. So.

13
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,720
The title of my presentation is Persistence. It's not just for Bacteria.

14
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:36,080
Actually gave this talk to the ME class maybe five or six years ago.

15
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,710
And it was funny just reflecting on how much how much things have changed.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,370
Right. It's not just for bacteria, it's for viruses and it's also for epidemiologists.

17
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:55,190
So I would start my presentations in sort of talking about how I think most of you probably know I was an

18
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,500
undergrad here in the microbiology program and a student in a immediately applied to public health schools.

19
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:09,350
I got into the big program here and decided I was going to go into AG and then I decided to take a

20
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:15,250
break and not go to graduate school because of some family health issues happening with my parents.

21
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,760
And so during my break, I went to work.

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,309
I went I moved to Seattle kind of on a whim because my boyfriend at the time got a job out there.

23
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:31,490
I didn't have a job and I got a job working for this woman, Dr. Debbie Nickerson.

24
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:41,150
She at the time was she was one of the the brains behind what became the hat map.

25
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,459
The hat map was after the Human Genome Project was was sort of wrapping up.

26
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:52,700
I went there towards the end of the Human Genome Project, which is when they sequenced one human genome for the first time.

27
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,899
It's very exciting.

28
00:02:53,900 --> 00:03:01,910
We all got a poster in the mail and the poster took up a whole wall in the lab and we would stand around and read it like it was that exciting.

29
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,460
So in the Human Genome Project concluded,

30
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:13,460
there was this thing called the hat map that was trying to define important haplotypes that might eventually be important for genomic epidemiology.

31
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:23,450
So I got a job as a lab tech working in her lab at the time in order to sequence even just a few genes for for people it would require.

32
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,389
So we had this army of tax working two shifts and sharing a wall of thermo

33
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,560
cyclers because we were amplifying individual applications and sequencing them

34
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,990
and then trying to piece them together using pretty rudimentary sequencing

35
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:45,590
tools at the time and using that to kind of define genomic variants and alias.

36
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:56,390
She recently she recently passed away very suddenly. And so I just wanted to kind of acknowledge what a what a huge influence she was.

37
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:04,730
But so this sort of got me started at the time. My name is Emily Tove and she got me started in working in human genetics.

38
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:13,370
And so my training was all from that initial training as a lab type was all just thinking about snips,

39
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:19,070
single nucleotide polymorphisms and alleles and sequencing, but from a very human perspective.

40
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:26,540
But I wanted to go to graduate school and at that point I was thinking more of going into epidemiology instead of health behavior.

41
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:38,729
And much to Debbie's dismay, as much as she tried to get me to go work for some very good genetic epidemiologist and cardiovascular epidemiologist,

42
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:43,380
I really wanted to work in sexually transmitted infections and infectious diseases.

43
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,720
And so I got a job at the University of Washington Andrology Research Clinic.

44
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,660
And this as this was as a graduate research assistant.

45
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,680
So when I was so the University of Washington Virology Research Clinic is a it's a very

46
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,860
kind of broad tagline for what is the the number one herpes virus clinic in the country,

47
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:17,290
both for treatment and for and for studies, both randomized trials, vaccine studies, treatment, strides studies, social behavioral studies.

48
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:23,510
Every everything, everything. Herpes virus, like, really kind of comes to this clinic.

49
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,940
So, so I started working there.

50
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:35,540
I actually saw Debbie again at she was a guest speaker in one of my classes, one of my summer classes, my first year of graduate school.

51
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:44,750
I came in 15 minutes late as I usually do two things and I Alex, I'm just the speaker today, so I don't know if that's disappointing or not.

52
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,729
So I came in 15 minutes late to class, as I always do.

53
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:56,300
And Alex and Debbie was like, start like 100 students in the room was like, Emily.

54
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,809
Nice of you to join us. Have a seat. Like, stop the lecture called.

55
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,610
I was like, Great. Thanks, Debbie. So.

56
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,060
So I started working at this clinic and it was.

57
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,330
It was a clinic. It was a clinic and a research center.

58
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:18,860
And I went there thinking that I was going to be a the next, you know, the next leading researcher in sexually transmitted infections.

59
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,740
And Dr. Wald hired me thinking that I was going to answer the phone for six months.

60
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,490
And this is her rule. You you started working there.

61
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,520
You read this book, managing herpes.

62
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:37,190
If you didn't know enough about herpes and then you answered the hotline and they did answered the hotline for months.

63
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:42,080
And I learned a lot about public health answering the herpes hotline, I have to tell you.

64
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,120
And I also learned a lot about health communication.

65
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,670
There's a lot of things that I said that first couple of weeks that a clinician would have to run out of the back room and be like,

66
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,720
let me just take the rest. So this was a good app to like cover for me.

67
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,440
So it was Trial by fire. Oh.

68
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,290
But I eventually did do a study and started working in that clinic.

69
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,930
And one of the reasons they when we worked there is is you had all this training and how to do genomic sequencing.

70
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,110
Well, at the time, it was just genetic sequencing. We weren't using the genome.

71
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:20,880
It was just one gene at a time. And. Virology and thinking about how pathogen sequencing evolved.

72
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:26,620
The human genome and genetic space moved much, much faster than the pathogens face.

73
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,209
And so while I was working there, they were like, Now you can't possibly sequence this.

74
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,960
This is too much information. It's like it's a DNA virus.

75
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,320
Shouldn't it work the same there like now? Can't possibly.

76
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:46,739
So what I did so actually Larry Corry is like a big person in the vaccine development space, in the HIV vaccine trials.

77
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,000
And so he was Keiko mentoring me along with and I was like in his lab and working for Ana.

78
00:07:51,630 --> 00:08:00,810
And they had all of these specimens from partners where there had been a transmission event,

79
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:08,250
either in the placebo arm or in the in the vaccine arm of a vaccine, a partner vaccine study they were doing.

80
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:16,520
So we were vaccinating people and they were vaccinating their vaccine partners who were in discord, what we call discordant partnerships.

81
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:22,710
One partner has herpes simplex two and one partner does not.

82
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:29,490
And so they were vaccinating the partner that does not, and they were still counseling them on prevention and all that sort of stuff.

83
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,689
But so they said, we have these transmissions.

84
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,750
Can we see can you use an AC to figure out if those transmissions are actually linked?

85
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:45,690
Like as partner one, a partner, you're going to have the same virus. And, you know, in 2006, this was very advanced science.

86
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:51,780
So kind of goes to show how much the field has changed since they were like, but don't use sequencing.

87
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,379
It is far too much information. And I said, okay, so here's, here's what we're going to do.

88
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,740
I'm going to use RFP restricted fragment.

89
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:04,590
Like I don't even remember what the acronym means anymore, but you like you cut it up like lysis.

90
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:12,650
Length, length, polymorphism. That's what it is. And we do it sometimes we still do it.

91
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:20,390
And I don't I, I cut it out when I was doing 545 because I was like, do you use restriction enzymes to chop it up into different type?

92
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,240
I don't know if you're still doing it in five over. Okay. Five, of course.

93
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:32,730
So so you can use that in the polymorphisms, basically change the lengths of the different viruses and you could use a bit.

94
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,830
This used to be a genomic epidemiology paper like molecular epidemiology paper used to be this and

95
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:42,890
like published two pictures of my gels with arrows pointing to where I wanted people to look.

96
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:49,879
Right. So so you could see that for most of these pairs, the patterns look the same.

97
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:55,700
And then for these this pair, the pattern looks slightly different. And for this pair, the pattern looks very different.

98
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:04,840
And then I counted the number of differences between the people. And then we did what was called a hetero duplex mobility assay,

99
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:11,080
which is you actually try to fuze the fragments together and then and if they don't fuze together completely because they don't match,

100
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:18,639
they bubble up and they move slower through other. Interestingly enough, the fun fact the woman that taught me to do this is still at that lab today.

101
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,129
And when I went back for my sabbatical this summer in Seattle,

102
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,730
I went back to the same lab and she was still there and she had to teach me to do something else.

103
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,770
And she was like. You're back.

104
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:34,640
So we had to like we would use we used me to sort it other.

105
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:40,860
So this is the deal. I said, I will do it your way if I can have a couple of months at the end of the project to try to sequence it.

106
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,680
And they were like, okay, we'll never work. Okay.

107
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:52,830
So sequence day and this is actually we used to use these grids in human genetics and learn how to make these grids from Debbie.

108
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,389
And this is the pairs or A and B are numbered by the the couple here.

109
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,810
And here's my reference train at the bottom and then the part like the minor

110
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,040
illegal I basically highlighted in each of these and you can see in this top grid,

111
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:16,669
everybody, all the pairs, they all had the same minor alias. There were a couple peers, however, who had very different minor wills.

112
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:22,120
And I think ten a was was completely different.

113
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:27,620
Their sequences is so different is a sequence can be given that they were.

114
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,810
You know, it's a DNA virus. It's not super, super variable.

115
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:42,600
And they we went back into their clinic records and actually it was a non-monogamous relationship.

116
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,430
However, it was being a monogamous relationship, having only one partner.

117
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,840
Her partner was part of the inclusion criteria. The study, well, neither person.

118
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:57,629
It was a non monogamous relationship in both directions and neither person knew about the other direction.

119
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:04,920
So we actually had two individual herpes and HSV two interactions happening.

120
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,680
This was also my first introduction to the intersection between science and law,

121
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:19,020
which I will tell you about a little bit later because once so it did during this time period and I'll introduce that to you.

122
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:24,359
There was a lot of issues around, particularly HIV,

123
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:33,900
but also sexually transmitted infections around whether a part one person infecting another person could be a legal event or not.

124
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,719
And so I got a lot of calls from lawyers Miami to run this on their people.

125
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,460
And I was like, that's I'm a grad student. This is like above my pay grade.

126
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:51,810
So once I wrapped up that job or that, that my master's,

127
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:58,680
I should you'll see from the dates if you know my CV that the paper came out quite

128
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,800
a bit after my master's because I'm pretty slow when it comes to writing papers.

129
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:09,480
So it looks around for a job for a really long time, and I had a lot of trouble finding a job because I really wanted to work either in health policy.

130
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,760
Or in. Here's my health policy slide. Maybe I put it later.

131
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,730
I really want to work in either health policy or in in in HIV advocacy.

132
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,459
And I couldn't find jobs in either.

133
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:31,550
And I got a job working for Seattle Children's Hospital for a woman that was working on herpes viruses that in fact, children, HIV, sex.

134
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,300
So she knew me from the herpes clinic, from when I trained, and she hired me there.

135
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,469
So I worked.

136
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:47,700
There is a study coordinator for a few years and after about three years working there, the two guys that I work for sat me down and said.

137
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,410
So we had lunch with your master's mentor the other day and she mentioned that

138
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:59,820
you got halfway through graduate school and then left with your masters. And I, you know, I think in the MPH world, this is completely normal.

139
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:04,139
In the Ph.D. you were in the Ph.D., M.D. world.

140
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,340
I think it was kind of strange that I they were not really sure what had happened.

141
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,720
And I had the opportunity to stay for a Ph.D., but I decided not to.

142
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:18,899
Why did you decide not to? And I was like, Well, I was tired of school and loans and money and all this sort of stuff.

143
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,080
So I went to take a break and work and they said, We really think you should go back.

144
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:30,060
And so I used to there was a new virus that had been discovered about that time, Boca Virus.

145
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,600
And I reapplied to University Washington to go back,

146
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:40,590
got back into school and I continued with that process to study this new virus that had just been discovered.

147
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:49,900
And he actually did it. Unlike most of our current PC students, I worked the whole time, so I did it on the side side.

148
00:14:50,540 --> 00:15:00,669
So. I was studying this virus that was similar to two viruses the animal kingdom, a cow virus and a dog virus.

149
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:07,000
A canine virus. That's my nephew getting infected with parvovirus right now from his his dog.

150
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:15,850
And, you know, the epidemiology of this virus was really confusing because Seroprevalence data basically

151
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:21,579
showed that really early there were antibodies that were probably maternal antibodies,

152
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:27,430
and then the antibodies were really low. And then in the population, almost everybody was getting it by about four years of age.

153
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:37,210
So everybody was getting infected. So it's a pretty universal virus and it's not something we usually see for primarily respiratory pathogen viruses.

154
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:45,070
We see it for other things you see like EBV, where you see a lot of other viruses that work like that, but not so much poorer respiratory viruses.

155
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,320
And within five years of discovery, because, you know, between when I sort of.

156
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:58,220
Left graduate school and the interviewing five years doing molecular detection of viruses had completely exploded.

157
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,020
And so this is how this virus had been discovered and saw a lot of other ones had been discovered as well.

158
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,860
They were like discovering new viruses all the time. And then somebody would publish the primaries,

159
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,629
and then everyone really would go into their freezer and then test everything in their

160
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,920
freezer and then publish an article like Associating the virus was just something random,

161
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,430
even though the stuff in the freezer had not been collected with this virus in mind.

162
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,229
So within five years of the discovery,

163
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:28,640
there were over 200 articles on this virus and 25 review articles talking about the history of the virus in only five years.

164
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,290
So and these were all done with these leftover clinical samples.

165
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:41,180
And so there was this laundry list of like ten conditions that people said that Boca virus caused, including some pretty serious conditions.

166
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,700
But it was a virus. But we know that the virus infects everybody by the age of four.

167
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:51,620
So explain to me how this causes like these massive cardiovascular events in children and yet everybody gets it.

168
00:16:51,860 --> 00:17:02,720
There was missing pieces of this puzzle. So at the time, I was helping to coordinate as a study coordinator the study of Boca Virus in child care,

169
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:09,860
where we were sampling kids every time that they were sick. And this was in partnership with the military base south of Seattle.

170
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:18,440
And we had nurses that were actually based in the child care, and they'd swab the kids every time they became sick,

171
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:23,450
and we would keep swabbing them until they were PCR negative for all the viruses we were testing for, actually.

172
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,940
And we thought that that was going and it just completely destroyed the budget with this because I thought it

173
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,129
was going to be like one or two swabs a kid and it was like said it like these kids are positive for five,

174
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:46,220
six, seven weeks, a positive forever. And when we looked for risk factors for infection with Boca virus, which should be really run this age range,

175
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:52,549
we didn't find any significant risk factors because they were all getting it because they were all in daycare.

176
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,490
I mean, almost every kid got it as part of the study.

177
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:04,290
It was the second most common virus detected in the entire study, this sort of newly discovered virus.

178
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:11,790
But it was also 72% of the detections had another virus detected at the same time.

179
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:16,169
And if you look at these other viruses we are detecting, like it doesn't even come close to those numbers,

180
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:21,050
maybe RSV, but almost all of the viruses had another one detected at the same time.

181
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:26,370
So is it really causing anything? It's very hard to say. So what we did next was.

182
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,380
We saw when we enrolled the kids, we swallowed them whether or not they were sick.

183
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:38,320
And the. The at enrollment.

184
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:43,719
So this is kind of the funniest thing. The symptoms at enrollment.

185
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,040
Yes, no total. If you kind of look at aggregate these numbers right here,

186
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,600
like half of the just by walking in the day care, almost 50% of the children are sick right then.

187
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:59,590
So we had it in an instant cross-sectional study. I compared the sick kids to the day I walked in the daycare to the kids that weren't

188
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:05,890
sick and more HIV positivity rate was actually higher in the kids that weren't sick.

189
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:14,260
So. Okay, well, that seems like a problem. So what did I try next?

190
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:26,440
I tried their first swab, their baseline when they were they when I encountered them with their first acute active respiratory illness.

191
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,980
And I found an association there. So the percentage of.

192
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,330
Well, I find his decision in the wrong way.

193
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:43,150
The percentage of them positive at baseline when they have no symptoms was 52%, and the percentage of their first acute illness was 32%.

194
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:48,040
So also not really saying the Ebola virus causes respiratory illness.

195
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,990
So I had planned my whole dissertation on the role of Boca Virus in causing respiratory illness.

196
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:59,160
And then with my first paper show, the Boca Virus does not cause respiratory illness.

197
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,950
It was very sad for the last two aims of my dissertation. So what did they do next?

198
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,970
I after a week of like feeling sorry for myself.

199
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:14,760
So I got access to these samples from a natural history study.

200
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,260
And this I went back to Danielle Zehr,

201
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:25,379
who had hired me after the working at the herpes clinic to do to look at these samples that were collected weekly,

202
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:32,280
these saliva samples from infants, from they were collected from birth to two years of age with a daily symptom diary.

203
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,910
These kids, these parents were collecting daily symptoms from these kids.

204
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:44,860
And so incredibly rich in like detailed study, although it's only it was only with 277 kids.

205
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,880
And so what we did is did what's called a case crossover design.

206
00:20:49,450 --> 00:21:00,520
So we basically found their first illness and we picked control periods before and after that illness so that each kid is their own control.

207
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,220
And you compare that kid to themselves before they were sick and that kid to themselves after they were sick.

208
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:14,139
When you do it that way. Actually, Boca Virus suddenly was associated with respiratory illness.

209
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:21,940
It was associated with health care visits and having a new class, and it was associated with a whole bunch more symptoms.

210
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:29,740
Once you restricted it to those that had a really high viral load, this did involve a lot of very long hours,

211
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:33,750
hours in the lab going through and retesting of these specimens for the intestine, for Boca virus.

212
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,580
So I had to do it. So. But strangely,

213
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,129
what I found was so it was associated with having a like primary book virus

214
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,060
seem to be your first respiratory infection syndrome associated book virus.

215
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:54,139
But The Shag, because I had these weekly samples, I did the same thing.

216
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,340
We did the day care. And I tried to test them until they weren't positive anymore and they were positive.

217
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:05,570
Something good. One kid was positive for 402 days. The most kids have kids were positive for over 50 days.

218
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,990
They're positive for really, really long time with this virus.

219
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,239
So if you think about it as good epidemiologist,

220
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:17,389
you think about what happened when this virus got discovered and everybody opened up their freezer of non systematically collected samples.

221
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,570
Right. They were picking up all kinds of new and old virus.

222
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:25,500
Right. Any time the kid came in, they're going to be positive for Ebola virus for half a year.

223
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,239
So anytime they go to the hospital, the hospital gets a swab. They're going to pick a book.

224
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,570
A virus has nothing to do with the reason that they're at the hospital.

225
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,360
50%. It's all going to return it. So this is what the shedding patterns looked, look like.

226
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,480
And on the x axis, I have months.

227
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:47,140
So just these tick marks are every other month and you can see these positive results.

228
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:52,220
How long? I mean, these kids consistently had virus at a detectable level for a very, very long time.

229
00:22:53,700 --> 00:23:00,540
And they would also have what we now know is called flipping, which is a super technical sounding term, but flipping.

230
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,380
So they're flipping. They're resolving here, flipping and coming back.

231
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:14,700
And here's some more. And so then actually what I did is a secret step and everybody's like, really?

232
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:23,220
You're going to stick with it? Yes. And you could see that children would have kind of allelic changes in pattern over time.

233
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,800
And so they it seemed like they were likely having a second.

234
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,840
Some of these children were having a second. And for this child, even a third introduction to me.

235
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:40,400
So. Okay. That is. So then that became that became the end of my dissertation there.

236
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:48,019
So this is typically the type of presentation that you get in the like, here's how I started my career.

237
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:57,170
And then I got a postdoc and then I got a faculty, I got a faculty position and this is who I am now and I'm very famous and thank you very much.

238
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:04,070
So what I wanted to do, because this is kind of annoying me because of survivor bias.

239
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:13,460
So what I wanted to do, though, is go back and walk through those steps I just went through and tell you how everything that went wrong.

240
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:18,950
Also, because you are about to launch on a bunch of research projects.

241
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,940
And so you have about t minus two weeks before the first thing goes wrong.

242
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:27,079
If it has not already happened, may have already happened for some of you.

243
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,640
And I want to normalize the idea that more things go wrong than go right.

244
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:37,100
So my redo, my talk. This is a story about behind the story.

245
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:42,660
First thing that happened. I really wanted to go to a public school. I got into the HBCU program here.

246
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,770
I decided not to go. And I said, I can always go later.

247
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:53,180
So I moved out to Seattle. By the time I had a car and a boyfriend and an apartment and a lease, I decided,

248
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,560
Well, I'll just go to University of Washington because it's right here. The University of Washington rejected me.

249
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:03,020
I ended up getting I think I paid twice as a good time.

250
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:08,720
I got on the waitlist and I decided at that point that I was going to law school.

251
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,400
And I started studying for the outset because I've always kind of liked health policy and I was going to go that route instead.

252
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,730
It's going to be the future. I don't. Those of you that are new to southeast Michigan.

253
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:21,589
Joy Malachi Roose is our most famous lawyer and her face is on billboards everywhere.

254
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:27,650
And I'm like really intrigued by her. Anyways, so was going to go to law school and I got rejected.

255
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:31,969
I got into the University of Washington AP program as a master's student.

256
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:39,950
At the last possible moment, it was like the last it was a and I had been taking the classes because I was like,

257
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,980
you know, trying to work and go to school at the same time.

258
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:48,709
So I was going to I was working full time and then I was one class at a time

259
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:52,460
in the program because University of Washington pay for one class at a time.

260
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,040
So I was like, I got to see how far I can make in the program before they let me in.

261
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,750
And so I and we did the professor was like, I'm trying to get into the program.

262
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:04,670
Do you know anything? And he was like, he's like, Yeah, somebody just he's like, Yeah, we're closed.

263
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:10,430
Although someone just backed out of the program yesterday, so we might let one more person in, but we're closed.

264
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,040
And then the next day I got an acceptance letter.

265
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:22,070
So the last person to get into it was the worst candidate to be accepted to the school and reality program in 2003.

266
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,829
So. Um, but I, I, I like, I was, I was a plucky youngster.

267
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:33,860
I was like, I'm not going to let that bother me. So I then started my MPH internship.

268
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,120
And actually the funny thing was, is I had the way Washington works,

269
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:44,240
you actually take your Ph.D. comp exam during the master's program to make you eligible to apply for the beauty.

270
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,800
I'd taken so many public health classes by that point because they were taking one class.

271
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,930
The time is actually eligible to take that exam.

272
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,429
As I was starting the master's program and they were like, You'll never pass it.

273
00:26:55,430 --> 00:27:02,239
And I was like, Let me just turn. And I passed it. So I had like it was very out of sync.

274
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,049
They didn't know what to do with me. So. So then I decided.

275
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:12,140
So then it's time to like, pick your ily and everybody's get. I'm working at this really high powered vaccinology clinic, right?

276
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:16,490
And they're like, okay, so let's start your summer internship. How many hours do you want to be here?

277
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:22,670
What do you want to do for your internship project? And I was like, I think I'm going to go work in HIV advocacy for this summer.

278
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:28,010
I got this job working for a lobbyist, and I'm going to I'm going to lobby against at the time.

279
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:35,299
The big issue is partner. Like I said, there was a lot of legal issues around partners partnership in sexually transmitted

280
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,380
infection and it was for the HIV community is around partner notification

281
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:51,320
what was your legal responsibility to notify in what in what's parameters and why and what is the role of the police in that in that relationship?

282
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:58,700
And and there were some laws that were being proposed by the Washington state legislature that were very discriminatory,

283
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:07,190
and it kind of under the guise of partner notification, but would have been really damaging to to that community the way, you know,

284
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:10,910
it's all it's all about, you know, it's always like it's always in the details, right?

285
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:15,530
And so I said, I'm going to go work for this lobbyist for the summer.

286
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:19,249
And she was like, is that is that an epidemiology internship?

287
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:23,980
Like, you're not going to get a paper? And I was like, Yeah, I know, but I really want to work for this lobby.

288
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,090
So when I did that, it was fine.

289
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:33,469
As you say, I ended up publishing in Ailey what our capstone project Art Ailey anyways, even though I went to do what I wanted for my internship.

290
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:37,340
So don't be afraid to learn what you want to learn.

291
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:45,680
And then I ended up at Seattle Children's Hospital kind of away from this, away from the idea of health policy,

292
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:52,940
which I had been sort of thinking towards and more towards childhood vaccine research in childhood viruses.

293
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,600
And that's how I kind of got along the track of doing vaccine work like I do today.

294
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:07,270
And as it was going so, you know, I was at Seattle Children's all the way through finishing my Ph.D. The PHC program wasn't my idea.

295
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,200
If you remember, they said, Why don't you just go finish school? So I don't know about it, but okay.

296
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:18,559
And they were like, You know what? If you don't want like, I don't really see myself being a faculty member, that doesn't seem like me.

297
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:24,150
So I don't know why I should do my like, well, just do it and then finish and nothing will change here.

298
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:33,229
You can be a study coordinator as long as you want. So the day I graduated, I, like, turned in my stuff and I got wind that I graduated.

299
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:41,810
And I got a notice saying that I had to take a $25,000 pay cut because study coordinators make more at Seattle Children's Hospital than postdocs do.

300
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,649
They were like, You can't be a peace study coordinator. You have to take a pay cut.

301
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:54,530
So take a pay cut. So in order to make up the money, because, you know, I was young and plucky and needed that $25,000.

302
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,880
I became a secret infection prevention.

303
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,850
Actually, this happened a bit before too complicated as I was sort of trying to finish my my PHC.

304
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:15,070
I became a secret infection prevention test and I started working infection prevention on the side and doing the like hand hygiene monitoring,

305
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,139
which I think a lot of people end up doing.

306
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:27,730
So I was I had to monitor for extra money to help pay for my bills, but then also to like make up my salary once it started to pick up.

307
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,259
Except for it was a very secret because I was this pregnant when I started doing it.

308
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:39,549
And so I would like try to hide behind, you know, I try to be you try to try to be as unobtrusive and not noticed as possible.

309
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:43,180
But everybody knew who the large pregnant woman who worked at Seattle Children's was.

310
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:50,709
And so, like, I kept walking into the store and they'd be like, okay, I'm already like, We know that you're trying to not be noticed, but we see you.

311
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:56,980
And can you just sit down because you're like really pregnant and you're making us nervous and can you just sit in this chair in the like,

312
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,910
putting put in whatever you want? You can say we did whatever, but like, please stop standing up.

313
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,020
So it was not very good at being a secret infection prejudice.

314
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:15,460
So this is this picture is from when I was doing my Ph.D. I got pregnant during my APEC.

315
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:22,139
It was a welcome. It was a welcome pregnancy. But it wasn't a long my life.

316
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:27,750
It didn't follow my life plan. And so my husband and I had my daughter.

317
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:36,810
She was and then my and so then after I got pregnant, I met with all my advisers and they said, okay, here's how it's going to go when she is.

318
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,160
I'm going to do this and I'm going to do this at the time, and I'm going to take my prospectus exam and then I'm going to defend.

319
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,360
I had to do like an oral exam as part of the process.

320
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:53,759
I'm going to do it the last week of September and then I'll take five weeks off and then I well will be week five and I'll take four weeks

321
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:01,940
off and then I will have the baby on schedule and then I will resume my PGD three weeks later after I sleep and thank you very much.

322
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:05,100
And they were like, okay, good luck with that.

323
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:12,389
And sure enough, like two days before my exam, I went into labor like two days before a real exam and I went five weeks early.

324
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,810
I went to the OB and she was like, So you're beginning labor, we're putting you.

325
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:20,129
I was already on bed rest and she's like, because I had complications and she was like, okay,

326
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:24,720
so I'll probably see you on Monday if you don't go into labor over the weekend, we're going do see you.

327
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:33,480
And I was like, I have an exam on Tuesday. And she was like, No, you don't tell me you have a baby on Tuesday.

328
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:40,410
And so I turned in the written person of the exam and then I went into labor to have a baby.

329
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,919
And I called my adviser and she was like, So you're going to need a month off, right?

330
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,249
And I was like, Listen, I'm not getting any smarter with this baby.

331
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:53,160
She hasn't slept in three days. I will see you in a week and we're going to get this done and then I'm going to take them.

332
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:59,130
So I did. I like it was the only exam I've ever seen that they brought baby presents, like the baby presents.

333
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:03,990
And then I did my exam really fast and then they rushed home to pump because I couldn't.

334
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,910
Then they were like, You can bring the baby to the exam. And it's like, I won't be able to do that.

335
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:13,390
So she was there. My daughter was there the whole time. She's my supervisor here.

336
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:16,709
She is bossing me around and here she is at my graduation.

337
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:22,470
And there's a picture I couldn't find of me trying to finish up my dissertation before the semester deadline.

338
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:27,270
Because, you know, if I missed that deadline, you got to pay tuition for a whole other semester and that was going to be tight.

339
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,840
And so I had to make the deadline and she was cranky.

340
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:36,090
And so she's in a pouch and I'm like typing while she's like in like my like kangaroo pouch.

341
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:45,720
Okay. So at that point, I start a post-doc project and I couldn't really find a postdoc that was working for my mom of a young child situation.

342
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:55,230
So I went to do my postdoc with the infection prevention unit that I had been a secret pregnant woman at, and they had me run a trial.

343
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:00,780
It was a double. So this is what the paper looks like. So when you look at papers, always remember this is what you see on the paper.

344
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,830
Randomized double blind crossover trial ultraviolet light sanitize.

345
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:08,100
Key words in pediatric hospital. Sounds super fancy.

346
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,690
This is what actually happened. If you can look carefully,

347
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:19,860
I have picture after picture here and this is only one of many pictures on my hard drive of broken computers, like broken keyboards.

348
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:27,570
These things were like pieces of junk. So it was this company that had made this keyboard and it would retract and it would

349
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:32,639
like irradiate it with UV light and it would spit the keyboard back out except for,

350
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:37,110
like, what? It spit the keyboard out, the keys would fly off itself.

351
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,630
And so they had some and I was like, well,

352
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:45,090
you can make a randomized trial if you make some were the light bulb was taken out and so those are the placebo.

353
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,410
So it's placebo controlled.

354
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:53,610
Nobody knows if they're using the UV light keyboard, something like this, but nothing would happen and then it would spit out and thought so.

355
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:02,639
And so this just so like a window they installed, it was like a big cart in like piles of computers and keyboards.

356
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,370
And they swapped out the keyboards in the pediatric hospital, including the Pediatric Emergency Department.

357
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:15,450
And then I put my pager number on the side because pagers because that's the era was I put my pager number on the side and it said,

358
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,850
page Emily at this number, if there's a problem with this keyboard. And so I would get these pages at 3:00 in the morning.

359
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,749
That would be like, I am a pediatric ICU nurse.

360
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,840
Do you know how long I need to endure this order and the keyboard?

361
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:31,200
It it was like you could go use a different computer with a different computer,

362
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,309
like get in the car and drive to the hospital at 4:00 in the morning to like take that.

363
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:39,660
And by the end of that, the end of the month, all the keyboards were back out because they kept breaking.

364
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:47,400
And I had to kept getting. The worst breakage that we had was a keyboard that was located in the pediatric emergency department caught on fire.

365
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:56,310
And so I had to go get that, too. So I had to actually I ended this trial trial early for safety reasons.

366
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:05,040
Like I was so angry about how bad these keywords were that I submitted an adverse event report to the IAB and I was basically like, These are unsafe.

367
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,640
They keep catching on fire, but. He's very angry about it.

368
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,589
So that actually ended my postdoc, actually where postdoc was supposed to be for two years.

369
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:17,080
And it was for eight months because the keyboards got fired.

370
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:24,340
And obviously the company that contracted me to do this wasn't going to keep paying me after I said that.

371
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:32,830
So. So a postdoc ended. So I got a job at Wayne State University and this is my first faculty position.

372
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:36,280
I there were a couple of research scientist positions that I really wanted,

373
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:42,010
but it didn't work with the to body problem with my husband wanting to go back to school and what's going to be in your family.

374
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:47,530
There is a faculty position always at university. I said, I don't really want to be faculty, but that's fine.

375
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:58,090
So I took the job here. Notice that this is a picture of a pharmacy department with a lot of young, trained pharmacists in training.

376
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,950
I'm not a pharmacist. They weren't epidemiologists, but this is who hired me.

377
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:07,479
So I was my first faculty job was in a pharmacy department teaching public health to

378
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,980
pharmacy students and often to pharmacy faculty that didn't want to listen to me.

379
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,450
But it was a really good experience, and I really learned a lot about teaching.

380
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:21,220
I like smaller universities, do a lot in terms of teaching.

381
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,180
Like you have to go to teachers college for for part of it.

382
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:36,700
So I learned a lot there and actually kind of luckily built a really great team there of of mostly undergrads working for me and I did not.

383
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:40,120
When I first got hired, they said, We can hire you, but we can't give you a lab.

384
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,600
And about six months later, I said, This is not working without a lapse.

385
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,050
They said, okay, well, we'll give you this lab that the chair used to have at the end of the hall.

386
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:54,190
Here's a key. I don't think anybody's been in there since for about 15 years, but pretty sure all the equipment is still there.

387
00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:00,400
So I get the key and I go and I open the lab. And literally when the guy got voted in this chair, he walked away.

388
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:07,390
He closed the lab, made experiments, and went downstairs to the fancy office and left everything there.

389
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,550
The things that I felt like I found big flasks of orange juice.

390
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:16,270
He was like studying other orange juice compounds can be used for medication, a big slice of orange juice with things floating in.

391
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:21,700
There was there was a mouse. There was a mouse experiment stopped midway with.

392
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:28,090
There were there was a brain. They found a brain. So like I found a lot of stuff in this lab.

393
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:31,170
It was awful. But they were like, if you want it, you have to clean it.

394
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,580
And so we did it.

395
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:43,120
And then we bought all fancy new equipment, which my undergrads immediately broke like this, didn't start like this, it got stuck closed.

396
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:47,200
So basically by the time I got to the lab, they said the centrifuge was stuck closed.

397
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:50,320
I was like, okay, how did you get from that to here?

398
00:38:50,800 --> 00:39:01,140
I'm not really sure, but. And then it was still you know, they hired me to study antimicrobial resistance and to teach,

399
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:05,730
but I was still kind of dabbling in my virology research on the side.

400
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:15,450
And I had had a couple of papers come out that I started actually collaborating from afar with the department here at U of M.

401
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:22,739
And so I had a conversation at some point where somebody says, you know, Dr. Matter who's over.

402
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,270
And of course, I knew who he was. And you're like, he's he's going to retire soon.

403
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:32,220
Okay? Mind you, this is in 2014 and he's going to retire soon.

404
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,430
So we're going to be hiring some more. Virologist. Do you want to come over?

405
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:39,659
But the catch is you have to go back to doing virology research.

406
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,990
Your your antimicrobial resistance research is kind of crap.

407
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:54,450
And I was like, okay, so I came back, I started working in the lab and that's so now this is what you see if you like, work on websites, right?

408
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:57,570
I'm like doing stuff at the CDC and the NIH,

409
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:06,600
like some things where a lab coat I have all these great esteemed faculty members that I hang out with down here I'm hanging out with.

410
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,660
And Sugar, who was the deputy director of the CDC,

411
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:17,310
was really like the law at I mean she was like made everything happen at the CDC and

412
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,959
yeah but think about all of us like this doesn't reflect you go to my web page.

413
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,860
It does not reflect all of those other steps that got there and all of the different people at University of Washington,

414
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:31,710
the admissions office, who were like, you can take the exam, but you're never going to get into the Ph.D. program.

415
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:39,610
So. Started here and of course, ran into the same.

416
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:47,290
You know, the here is one of the our favorite studies that I that we've done that would come out of the

417
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:53,320
lab this is Sydney working on and the studies and we had the great power outage of 2017.

418
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,570
Now the generator plugs in the labs upstairs, the red plugs there, only about every other bay.

419
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:02,980
So all of our equipment stayed plugged in, but all of our monitors turned off.

420
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:10,510
Say, plug them in all next to each other. So what we were able to do is string cords and use boxes to put all the monitor,

421
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,659
to connect all the monitors back to the equipment to get us to the power outage.

422
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:19,630
But unfortunately for it to work, Sydney had to stand there for 3 hours and keep the monitor from falling over.

423
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:24,130
But she got a great project. Her aioli was so good.

424
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:30,020
And then she got a fellowship at NIH. So. It was worth it.

425
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:36,350
Then. Ten and is up to 2020.

426
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:42,590
I began actually so is getting closer to applying for tenure and I decided to go back

427
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:47,420
and do what I had wanted to do beginning and get some training in health policy.

428
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:55,970
So I joined a policy fellowship on campus for faculty and for legislative, mostly legislative aides and people that work for politicians.

429
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,799
Marissa Eisenberg During the year after me, my field trip was canceled to Washington,

430
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,530
D.C. because of COVID, and so I got to go on Marissa's field trip the next year.

431
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:10,190
So I got to go to get Marissa and Emily take D.C. by storm. So, as I said, the Capitol.

432
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:16,790
And so January 2020, I started a health policy fellowship.

433
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,180
And I'm sure you all know that you all have stories like this is how the story ends.

434
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:24,770
And in February of 2020, I started doing health policy.

435
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:34,100
So I started working for this is this is a website that Marissa and I made to like so the governor's office could

436
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:40,940
communicate about which just kind of levels and things were going on for COVID helped with the Michigan Safe Start plan.

437
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:45,019
And this is from a briefing with the state legislature.

438
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:51,829
And then this is I'm at a governor's press conference right here where it actually got taken out by one of the governor's police force.

439
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:56,420
So the state police forces like her not she's not Secret Service, but like her protectors.

440
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:02,150
And I was following behind her to go into the press conference. And you didn't realize they're supposed to be there.

441
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:08,740
And he, like, took me out like this, and then the governor turned around and was like, Let the doctor walk.

442
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:13,400
Yeah. He was like, I'm so sorry. And then I got an apology from the Michigan State Police Force.

443
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,510
So again. Here is the stuff that ends up on the website.

444
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:24,959
I'm going to end with a couple of things that did not end up in the website.

445
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:32,290
And then we're going to we are going to close this. Very indulgent in presentation I give you so.

446
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:43,700
One of the strangest things I did not expect to happen during this process is I you know,

447
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:50,360
Marissa and I both Dr. Eisenberg, both have one of the things.

448
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:54,260
So we had never worked together before. We knew each other. We worked down the hall from each other.

449
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:59,870
We never worked together. And as COVID was sort of happening in other countries, I was like, Hey, Marissa, I want to make it.

450
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:05,780
We got a bunch of people asking us to make this model. She's like, Oh, that's not what models should be used for.

451
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:09,940
And I was like, Please, can you please just go to this one meeting with me?

452
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,210
One meeting, and she's like, Fine.

453
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,799
So we would do like we ended up being three meetings.

454
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:21,590
We'd schedule three meetings and the third meeting there's like a doctor from the VA, Emerson AI, in a conference,

455
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:26,270
the conference room on the second floor with all the windows, and we're working out parameters of the model.

456
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,729
And then they closed the university, right?

457
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:33,139
And so that everybody's like literally leaving, they're stopping, they're being like, Are you guys leaving?

458
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,980
And we're like, We don't think we leave. Like, we think we're staying.

459
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:41,030
We don't. We, like, kept working on the board too. Like parking didn't get any better.

460
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:49,159
In case you're wondering, when everybody left and we were the only ones here, so that that sort of launched the kind of turn one thing led to another.

461
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,080
And it launched all of this work that we were doing for state and for local businesses and stuff.

462
00:44:54,590 --> 00:45:01,129
And we were very always clear if we were going to do this, we were going to do this in a way where we are very transparent,

463
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:04,280
and so we're going to provide the same information to everybody that asks.

464
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:09,020
Everybody gets the same answer from us. It doesn't matter who you are, what side of the aisle.

465
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:14,120
And it's true. We briefed the governor, but we also briefed many in the Republican Party.

466
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:19,670
We briefed a lot of different people from a lot of different perspectives and a lot of different people that didn't like us.

467
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:25,729
So when this went to when the governor's orders went to the Supreme Court,

468
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:32,150
so the Supreme Court took up a case about whether the governor was allowed to implement public health policy by executive order.

469
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:41,930
And it was really based on a very kind of detail aspect of the executive order, the way that executive orders, the mechanism that's used for them.

470
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:50,420
And when that went to the Supreme Court, Marissa and I got together with a bunch of other faculty members and basically said,

471
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:57,110
we're going to take all the information that we gave the governor and we're going to put it in what's called an amicus brief.

472
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:00,950
It's a friend of the court brief. We're going to write it down and we're just going to send it to the court.

473
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:04,670
We're not hiding anything. This is what we told her. This is what we told everybody.

474
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:09,680
We're going to write it down and send it right in. So we did this.

475
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:16,100
Wait here. What you can see is not the brief. This is the objection to the brief that was filed by.

476
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:20,600
If you look really closely right here. Oh, if you can't see my cursor.

477
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,700
I've been pointing it this whole time. Yeah.

478
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:29,270
So. And Bears. All right, now does that work? Okay, on the left hand side, all the way bottom,

479
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:35,540
the Midwest Carwash Association is a bunch of private jewelers and then companies I've never heard of.

480
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:44,840
And Sotheby's like. And then the auction house and the Midwest Car Wash Association file the ten pages and type of a ten page brief.

481
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,310
Where they say. That.

482
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:56,150
Players did not learn the true identity of the amicus until after the motion for leave was filed.

483
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,740
They are mostly professors from the University of Michigan and Michigan State University.

484
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,660
Critically, two of the professors, Martin and Ms. Eisenberg, are material fact witnesses.

485
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:12,200
They have been reputedly and actively working with the government in developing policies, methodologies and lockdown orders.

486
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,799
This is like a ten. It ends up goes it goes on and on for a while.

487
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,550
It's a ten page document about why Marissa Eisenberg and I can't be trusted.

488
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:23,760
And and because of this, they struck the document from the court.

489
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,950
So it actually didn't end up showing up in the case because an official record of the case.

490
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:33,300
That's the analysis we did, the stuff we sent because mercy cannot be trusted.

491
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:47,590
So, but we continued to provide data. Our data currently goes on the data and modeling reports for the states.

492
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:51,640
We continue to provide briefings to the state that continue to get posted.

493
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,510
The most recent one was September 20. They come out pretty frequently.

494
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:59,860
Recently, Charlie LEDUFF from the Detroit News called them and I quote,

495
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:06,610
a vomit of useless data and charts to which the Metro Times it's somebody I've never heard or I've never met.

496
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:12,340
At the Metro, Times wrote a rebuttal about why the vomit of useless data and charts are very useful,

497
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:19,450
and I took screenshots of different graphs, was like, See, see, vaccinated people are less likely to die from COVID.

498
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:27,820
It was pretty interesting. So that was my that's the real side of my foray into into health policy.

499
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:35,420
That's what I got. That's all I put together for you. So with that.

500
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,730
Turn off the recording.
