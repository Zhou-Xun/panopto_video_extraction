1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:09,660
In my house. You got to rearrange.

2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,080
I know. I don't know where he is and not having a good time.

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:24,269
I think he's ready to get back up on Matthew's sister.

4
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,739
Want to link? Not lately.

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:38,910
Late Monday he kind of like almost ready to like I know what I was going to say and that's going to take the whole living thing on credit.

6
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:46,290
Go ahead. Do the same the same flight on Sunday instead. And then the registry I want a day later.

7
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,800
We are appreciate your option.

8
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:03,000
Go in a real gently. For seven years, you got all concrete together, you know.

9
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,110
Good. I think I'd be split. Yeah, that's right.

10
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,410
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I think we're on the oh three.

11
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:19,520
Do they. Do you got a water treatment? Yeah, I think powder.

12
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,070
Daddy, I want to run to the toilet.

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:50,330
I don't know. I didn't know yet, so I just got to do how well you can get information on how to use the site, even.

14
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,130
I know you can. Oh, yeah, that's good.

15
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:05,190
I did accounting and I did, but I could tell you how I was told you have to put it out.

16
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:17,010
So I didn't want to check it out. And I think I think stuff like this, to me that sounds like maybe more like I had to take a few hours.

17
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,080
And I do want to just like. Yeah.

18
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,220
Like a concussion does that he's.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:41,280
I don't think that that's how I read it I like it's hard sometimes and they got until yesterday, but otherwise I'm not like, you know that's true.

20
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,440
It's the way that it's very hard.

21
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:58,960
And I think that I have got a couple of points to finish up from last time and then we'll shift over to hospitals tomorrow.

22
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,150
So last time we talked about profit maximization,

23
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:10,350
the golden rules set want to set quantity by determining and where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.

24
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:19,600
And then if your firm is sloping demand curve, you also have to determine the price of that profit maximizing quantity back into your demand curve.

25
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,690
Essentially, answer the question What's the highest price I can get away with charging for that quantity?

26
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:36,360
Since they want to close the loop on that and wait out the sort of profit maximization and revenue maximization are in fact not the same thing.

27
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,649
So profit maximization or the role was more equals.

28
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:50,610
AMC just want to ask, does that last unit I produce balance the extra revenue that I generate and the extra costs that I have to incur.

29
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,810
So on that little last fraction of a unit I producing, I'm essentially breaking.

30
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:01,560
Even if marginal revenue are greater than marginal cost, then I'd be profiting on that last unit and I ought to produce a little bit more.

31
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:10,170
Marginal revenue is less than marginal cost. I'm actually losing money on that last unit and these are going up less than my costs are going up.

32
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:18,990
So I ought to back off and produce a little bit less. Now, if instead I wanted to maximize my revenues, I would take no account of cost.

33
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,950
And I would just say, at what quantity is marginal revenue equal to zero?

34
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:29,730
I want to produce every single unit for which the marginal revenue is positive because my revenue would be rising.

35
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,950
I would not want to produce any unit where the marginal revenue is negative, where they are.

36
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,590
Our curve kind of falls below the access because my revenue would be decline.

37
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,810
So therefore, whereas my revenue maximized exactly where marginal revenue equals zero.

38
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,410
So let's use that same demand curve that we had last time and the same marginal revenues curve associated with it.

39
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,420
What was the rule for getting from a linear demand curve to a marginal revenue curve?

40
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:03,760
So if I have some debts, it's like twice as deep same or something.

41
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:09,750
Twice the. Steve So if I have any generic linear demand curve, solve it for price since prices are y variable.

42
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,080
So generic form of line, the marginal revenue curve.

43
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,860
Very simple. You just keep the same intercept and you double the slope of the original slope as negative B,

44
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,610
the slope of the marginal revenue curve as negative two.

45
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:42,010
So if you of keep that rule in mind, you improve it with calculus that it has to be true for any linear demand curve whatsoever.

46
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:51,520
So we had our demand curve equals ten minus. Q So the marginal revenue was, was ten minus two.

47
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:58,760
Q. Same intercept with double the slope. So just set that marginal revenue curve equal to zero and solve for Q.

48
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:05,300
So that's the quantity where IMR equals zero. If you remember what the M.R. curve looked like.

49
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:10,410
So there's a quantity of five. That's Grandma equals zero.

50
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,320
So if we wanted to maximize our revenues, we would keep producing every single unit that added to our revenues,

51
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:21,880
and then we would stop as soon as that R was zero. Okay.

52
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:30,390
So if we did that, we'd get a quantity of five rather than the profit maximizing quantity, which was for a lot of our revenues, be $25.

53
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:38,399
And yeah, that is a dollar more than our revenues were at the profit maximizing quantity at the quantity of four, we charge a price of six.

54
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,610
So our revenues were 24. But would this ever be a reasonable objective for a firm?

55
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:52,490
Firms say they may consider maximizing our profits. Let's just make it simple as maximize our revenues.

56
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,930
What's wrong with that? As a rule for the firm? Not completely ignores costs.

57
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:07,820
So in the example we use where MCI equals two, we could say, well, I make a little less profit doing that, but it wouldn't be terrible.

58
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,870
But what if marginal cost was 100? What's the revenue maximizing quantity?

59
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:23,660
Five. What's the revenue maximizing price? Five. So it's still at $25 in revenue, but now I'd spend $100 a unit times five units to create it.

60
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:31,219
I'd have massive losses. So revenue maximization and profit maximization are definitely not the same because profit

61
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,240
maximization should take into account the balance between marginal revenue and marginal cost.

62
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,170
It doesn't ignore the cost side of the equation,

63
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:46,370
whereas revenue maximization just takes into account what the demand curve looks like and hence what the associated marginal revenue curve looks like.

64
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:52,960
And a completely ignores what your costs are. And there it goes.

65
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,690
See that graphically? Last time we solved for.

66
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,540
Profit maximizing quantity. Four.

67
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,010
What's the profit maximizing price? Look up to the demand curve.

68
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,810
Say, what's the highest price I can get away with and expect to actually sell four units.

69
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:25,420
I'd love to charge $12 a unit, but in fact, nobody would buy anything from me at a price of 12, so I can't be the profit maximizing price.

70
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,870
Instead, I say the profit maximizing price is six. Revenue maximization not looking for the point where more equals them.

71
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,370
See, it's this point I'm looking for the point where I lower equals zero.

72
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:47,170
I keep producing as long as my revenues are rising by producing more with up to the demand curve.

73
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,380
I get a price of five. That's the highest price I can get away with charging if I expect to sell five units.

74
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,180
So there's my revenue maximizing price. So that's just how those two.

75
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:11,780
Questions about that before we move on. Right.

76
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:17,579
So now we can get to the supply curve. So if we have a price taking firm.

77
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:23,460
So now we're back in the world where the firm's demand curve is horizontal at an externally determined market price.

78
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:30,450
In other words, that firm is too small for its own quantity decisions to discernibly impact the price that it can sell its product at.

79
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,450
So we used a commodity market as an example, like a market for weeds or barley or corn,

80
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:42,720
where there are many small producers, small relative to the world market on which those prices are set.

81
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:52,180
You say that the supply curve for such a firm is going to be very much related to its marginal cost curve?

82
00:09:54,150 --> 00:10:01,770
We've got this sort of odd combination here. It's the upward sloping portion of the marginal cost curve above minimum, average cost.

83
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:06,090
So that's kind of weird, sort of a long set of conditions.

84
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,920
Let's see if we can kind of understand why. Suppose we've got a firm that has.

85
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,379
An optimal scale type production technology.

86
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:30,950
So it's got a U-shaped average cost. Analysts say its marginal cost looks something like that.

87
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:38,150
So it turns out marginal cost will sort of cut average cost from from the bottom, if you remember what those graphs look like.

88
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,350
So we did what we did. Cost curves. Q.

89
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:53,630
What's the profit maximizing rule? It's M.R. equals M.S. is sort of the generic golden rule.

90
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:03,530
But for a price taking firm, we know that marginal revenue is equal to price because they can produce any quantity without having to change the price.

91
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,920
The firm facing the resulting demand curve, if they want to chart, if they want to sell another unit, they've got to lower the price.

92
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,080
So for them more is going to be less than P,

93
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:19,190
but for a price taking firm R has to be equal to P because I can sell any quantity I want at the going price.

94
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,110
So in other words, my revenues always go up by p dollars if I sell another unit.

95
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,890
So we know that to maximize profits, the price taking firm is going to set acquiring reprice equals marginal cost.

96
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,840
We also know that in the long run, they have to do what in order to stay in business?

97
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,700
What do they have to accomplish in order to say yes? It's worth still being in this business in the long run.

98
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:52,559
At least break even, right? We break even in economic terms.

99
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,590
These are covering the opportunity cost of their inputs. So what if the price was way down here?

100
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,850
IPL below. So there is the profit maximizing quantity for that firm.

101
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,560
The quantity reprice equals marginal cost. But there's a little bit of a problem.

102
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,900
That price falls short of the average cost of producing the profit maximizing quantity.

103
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:22,260
So that firm is going to be out of business in the long run. They'd say, Hey, this is not a sufficiently attractive industry.

104
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:32,670
I'm going to take my talents elsewhere. And so the firm is actually going to supply zero in the long run, a price appeal,

105
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,020
because that price is too low for the firm to water even remain in this industry.

106
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,710
And what if the price is a lot higher? What's the profit maximizing quantity for that firm?

107
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,880
Again, we're applying this rule for how to look for a quantity or price equals marginal cost.

108
00:12:49,920 --> 00:13:05,700
Boom, that's a profit maximizing quantity. And in fact, their price is a lot higher than the average cost of producing profit maximizing quantity.

109
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,670
So, yeah, I want to be in this industry. So essentially.

110
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:16,080
A different color here. Think of the supply curve of this firm.

111
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,650
As being zero and prices below the minimum average cost.

112
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,030
The price is below the minimum average cost. There is no quantity. I wish I could break even.

113
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,510
It's below the lowest possible average cost. I don't want to be in this industry.

114
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:46,480
However, it is at least as high. As the middle the average cost my profit maximizing quantity is determined by the quantity.

115
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:55,720
The price equals marginal cost. So there's my supply curve, supply curve that says if I observe a certain price in the market,

116
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:04,000
what is the quantity that I want to supply to that market? And that quantity is determined by the quantity where price equals marginal cost.

117
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,240
So essentially, this is my supply curve.

118
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:22,230
So demand curve just said, if I observe it as a consumer, if I observe a certain price, what's the utility maximizing quantity that I'd want to pick?

119
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,100
The supply curve is exactly analogous.

120
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:32,210
The firm observes a certain price in the market and asks, What's the profit maximizing quantity that I'd want to produce at that price?

121
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:47,120
A few summary points and first primary objective analogous to the consumer maximizing utility.

122
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:52,909
We assume that most firms most of the time you can kind of understand their behavior by saying what

123
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:59,990
would they do to maximize profits and probably will not predict or explain what we observed them do.

124
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:08,480
And profit maximizing quantity. Again, we follow the Golden Rule. Find a quandary where marriage is not messy or sometimes are more than one.

125
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,200
There's more than one quantity where that's true. And then we have to figure out which was the best one.

126
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:19,400
So it's necessary but not sufficient. We have to be at a quantity where are equals and see it for maximizing profits.

127
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:26,179
But just because we found such a quantity doesn't mean that that's a profit maximizing quantity because there might be more than one quantity.

128
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,090
Where that holds, you have to figure out which is the best one.

129
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,140
Big difference between firms that are price takers and firms that face downward sloping demands.

130
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,410
And it's about their market structure and their position in that market.

131
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:48,040
Am I a little tiny producer in a commodity type market, or am I relatively big compared to the market I'm selling and I'm relatively big.

132
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:57,690
I'm one hospital out of two in Ann Arbor. I'm going to have some ability to set price in the face of downward sloping demand for my product.

133
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,470
In other words, I can decide, you know, I sell charge a really high price.

134
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:07,380
And yes, can I get away with that? Absolutely. But what penalty do I pay for making that decision?

135
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:19,380
I'd limit my sales. So if I want a really high price, I'm going to have to accept the fact that I'm not going to sell as many units.

136
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,310
I'm free to make the opposite decision. I want to sell a lot of units.

137
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:34,350
What penalty do I pay for making that decision? You're going to have a really low price.

138
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,550
If I want to sell a lot of units, I'm going to have to accept a lower price.

139
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,690
So essentially, I face the price quantity tradeoff given by the demand for my product.

140
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,610
I can set a price as high as I want if I'm willing to sacrifice sales.

141
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:55,260
I can sell as many units as I want if I'm willing to sacrifice the price I can charge.

142
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:06,330
And so what we just saw is that direct relationship between profit maximization and a price set or supply curve.

143
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:13,980
So essentially a supply curve is really just to answer a simple question at a given market price, what quantity maximizes your profits?

144
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:21,870
And that's the quantity or price equals marginal cost, provided it's a profitable quantity, provided you can at least cover your average cost.

145
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,660
Now, we said for a price taking firm, that's a supply curve.

146
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,170
We didn't talk about a supply curve for a firm facing a downward slope.

147
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:35,490
And demand curve is in a sense, that firm doesn't really have a supply curve.

148
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,349
If you think about what the demand curve said for the consumer, it said, Hey,

149
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:46,790
the market tells you what the price is and you decide on quantity for price taking firm.

150
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,130
That's exactly analogous. The market tells you what the price is today.

151
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:56,819
You decide your quantity is the market telling affirmed with a downward sloping demand curve.

152
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:03,440
What the prices? A firm is setting the price.

153
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,530
So we think of a supply curve as I'm responding by picking a quantity.

154
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,080
What am I responding to? I'm responding to an externally set price.

155
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,059
It was $5 a bushel today. How many bushels of I stored?

156
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:22,970
We do. I want to sell. We're the firm facing a downward sloping demand curve is not responding to it.

157
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:28,760
And externally set price by picking a quantity, it's simultaneously picking the price and the quantity.

158
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,840
It can set a high price, but then it has to accept a low quantity.

159
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,590
It can set a high quantity, but then it has to accept a low price.

160
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:42,200
It's sort of setting both the price and the quantity. It's not responding to a price by picking a quantity.

161
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:47,290
Its quantity is actually determining the price you can set or you can look at it.

162
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,720
Conversely, if the price it sets determines the quantity it can sell.

163
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:58,130
So whichever one you kind of think of them setting first determines the other based on their demand curve.

164
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:07,049
So there's not really conceptually a supply curve for a firm facing a down sloping demand curve because it's picking both the price and the quantity.

165
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:11,430
It's not responding to an external price. And in the short run,

166
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,559
we see the firm will operate at least offering cover its fixed costs and have something left over

167
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:22,530
to help cover its variable costs and have something left over to help pay for its fixed costs.

168
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,299
So it might operate at a loss in the short run long run firm would never operate at

169
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,900
a loss is in the long run it could get out of the business and do something else.

170
00:19:36,060 --> 00:20:00,350
Any questions about that before we move on? It's not going to move to a particular market.

171
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,209
The market for hospital services that dropped to sort of three parts.

172
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:10,940
First programs, walkabout is just sort of some institutional background on the U.S. hospital industry.

173
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:19,670
And then we're talking about mergers in that industry and pricing and some of the policies related to that was.

174
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,890
Why did the hospital sector grow so rapidly in the US?

175
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,200
Largely it was because of policy.

176
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:37,210
The Bill Burton Act, passed just after World War Two, provided major subsidies for the construction of new hospitals,

177
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:42,820
and that went on for a number of decades, and it particularly targeted rural and underserved areas.

178
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:53,080
What we saw over those decades is a big, big increase in the number of hospitals and hospitals peaked in 1974 with over 7000 in the country.

179
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,660
Then a few other things happened.

180
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:03,520
One of the big things that happened is Medicare decided we're going to stop paying hospitals based on a bill for how many days

181
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,850
the patient was in the hospital and how many aspirin pills they got and how many this they got and how many that they got,

182
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:18,190
and so on, which was incredibly inflationary because hospitals had an incentive to simply do more because they could build more profitable rates.

183
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:24,880
So they said, You know what, we're going to pay a flat fee. We're going to classify all your admissions into groups.

184
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:33,520
Several hundred groups kind of based on sort of the primary procedure that was done or the primary reason the patient was in the hospital.

185
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:41,290
And you're going to get a flat rate sort of based on the average cost of delivering care for a patient in that group.

186
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,810
And so what happened in response is a big, big decline in length of stay.

187
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,240
So there are a lot of empty hospital beds. So kind of big policy change.

188
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:58,160
Instead of saying, you know, well, hey, we could get another thousand dollars by keeping you another day.

189
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,860
And that last stays, that 10th day or that 14th day is a pretty cheap day because the early days

190
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,010
of most hospital admissions are the ones that are really resource intensive.

191
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:11,540
So at that point, I'm getting another thousand dollars for basically giving you three crappy meals.

192
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:17,679
Changing your batteries. That's a pretty good deals. Now, all of a sudden,

193
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:25,090
I get a fixed amount of dollars per admission and those three crappy meals and the change of bed sheets is actually just a cost to me.

194
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:34,330
And there's no extra revenue associated with it. So once we're past those intensive days, keeping you longer is just a loss.

195
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:39,160
So big decline in length of stay. A lot of the hospital beds.

196
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:48,230
And we got a big change in the number of hospitals. And so we sent over 7000 hospitals in 1974.

197
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:59,000
2019 was a little over 5000. So the hospital industry shrunk by about 30% in terms of number of hospitals over that time period.

198
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:03,500
It also declined in terms of its share of all health care spending.

199
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,850
In 1980, hospitals accounted for 43% of health care spending.

200
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,350
Had fallen by ten full percentage points by 2019.

201
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,670
And you can also see how the distribution of ownership, a little over half of hospitals are private nonprofits.

202
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:25,160
About a quarter of that were for profits and a little under a fifth of them are government.

203
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:38,940
So VA hospitals or local or state hospitals. And so it's probably not surprising we have a decline in inpatient days over time.

204
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:46,620
So reflecting both that change in incentives from a DRG system which was then adopted after Medicare did it by a lot of private payers.

205
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:51,030
And we also had then changes in technology.

206
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:57,090
So a lot of things that had to be done, inpatient can now be done outpatient or it can be done with,

207
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:02,670
say, a day in the hospital rather than a week in the hospital. Classic example would be gallbladder removals.

208
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:10,740
The old open surgical procedure had you in the hospital for 7 to 10 days and it had to be done in a hospital.

209
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:17,310
Now there are moves laparoscopically and can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis,

210
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:22,560
and even if they're done in the hospital, you rarely spend more than one night in the hospital for yourself.

211
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:29,129
So the combination of changes, of payment incentives and the development of more technologies that allowed procedures

212
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,210
that used to have to be in the hospital to be moved to outpatient surgical settings,

213
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,100
or if they're still done in the hospital to be done with much shorter length of stay if the patient

214
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:44,310
recovery was so much quicker combined for sort of a big steady decline in the use of inpatient beds.

215
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,950
So inpatient days per thousand started about 750 in 1985.

216
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,730
A little over two decades later, it was kind of under 600.

217
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,060
On the flip side, hospital outpatient visits substantially rose.

218
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:09,590
There are about 1500 per thousand patients in 1995 and went up by about 50% in the following couple of decades.

219
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,210
Again, that's partly as procedures are being moved out of the hospital,

220
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:28,280
giving patient outcomes that post-surgery or otherwise are better when they need to leave the hospital because sometimes hospitals have nasty bugs,

221
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:34,370
etc. Where are all the antibiotic resistant bacteria going to be hanging out?

222
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:38,630
Yeah, they're going to hang out in hospitals where they've been exposed to a lot of antibiotics.

223
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:46,280
So I want to get out as fast as I possibly can. If it's safe for me to leave, I want to leave the hospital.

224
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,560
Another big change over this time period was the organization of the hospital industry.

225
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,320
Not only did we have a big decline in the number of hospitals,

226
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:06,970
but we also had a big change from independent to system owned just in a little over a decade.

227
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:12,400
We went from about 45% of hospitals being independent.

228
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:19,910
Only about a third of hospitals being independent, about two thirds being part of a health care multi hospital system.

229
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,470
So we have a lot of mergers. We've got a lot of closures over time.

230
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,170
And we've got a lot of mergers among those that remained.

231
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,510
So you can imagine what's happening to the level of competition in a lot of hospital markets where you combine,

232
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:38,900
there's fewer providers overall, and the providers that are there tend to be consolidating into multi hospital systems.

233
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:46,280
It varies a little bit year to year, but you can kind of see, you know, large numbers of mergers.

234
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:52,910
Most years the yellow is sort of the number of deals and the orange is the number of hospitals involved in those deals.

235
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:00,970
So most recent years, they've had sort of over 200 hospitals a year being involved in mergers.

236
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:15,510
Okay. So those are called horizontal mergers. So in the Justice Department or the FTC looks at mergers and decides whether to try to block them,

237
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:20,129
what they consider horizontal are mergers of two players in the same industry.

238
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:26,430
So a hospital merging with the hospital is a horizontal merger. They're also what's called vertical mergers or vertical integration.

239
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:31,660
That's when different parts of the supply chain effectively are integrated together.

240
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,880
So when hospitals acquire physician practices. That's called vertical integration.

241
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,260
If a hospital acquired a home health agency, that would be vertical integration.

242
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,600
If an insurer acquired a hospital, decided was going to become a provider, that would be vertical integration.

243
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:55,200
So vertical integration is integration or mergers between firms that are at different parts of the supply chain, whereas horizontal are same the same.

244
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,770
So if physician practice merges with the physician practice, that's horizontal.

245
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,340
Physician practice is acquired by a hospital that's a vertical merger.

246
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,990
And we see a rapid rise in physician practice acquisitions as well.

247
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:15,330
And so just over a six year period, the number of hospital employed physicians went up by almost 80%.

248
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:23,920
The share of hospital share, a physicians or hospital employee went up about 70% from a quarter to nearly half.

249
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,300
So by 2022, probably were around half.

250
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,230
And assuming these trends of continued, which are definitely now.

251
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:44,540
So let's look at hospital prices. And one useful benchmark for prices is relative to Medicare.

252
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:49,520
Medicare is obviously a huge payer and it's centrally census prices.

253
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:56,570
So hospitals might want to say, well, compared to Medicare, what am I getting from various private insurers?

254
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:02,300
And what I see is a lot. And B, it varies a lot.

255
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:10,430
So for inpatient facility fees and the national average, commercial rate is just over double the Medicare rate.

256
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:16,590
But let's see. Out of the ranges, the minimum is 40% over Medicare rates.

257
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:19,670
The maximum is 174% over Medicare rates.

258
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:25,610
So from the most expensive to the least expensive metropolitan area, it's almost a 2 to 1.

259
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,880
Difference in commercial price relative to Medicare price.

260
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,860
Okay, that's the extremes.

261
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:40,770
Let's look at maybe the middle of the distribution, the inner quartile range, which basically is comparing the 75th percentile to the 25th percentile.

262
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:47,580
So we're not looking at the very extremes on either end. So it's more of the, you know, where does the middle half of hospitals rank?

263
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:55,890
And that was about 35%. So even that's a pretty big variation just to go from 25th to the 75th percentile.

264
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:01,000
Outpatient facility fees, we see a very similar story, even a little more.

265
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,799
Very little more variation. It's more than double maximum.

266
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,030
The quartile range is higher. And the mean is a little bit higher.

267
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:18,630
For professional fees, we see a little bit smaller difference, 63% commercial premium on average above the Medicare.

268
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,170
But the range is also pretty variable, more than 2 to 1 from the max to the middle.

269
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,300
Another big thing that's changed, particularly post ACA, is uncompensated care.

270
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:42,120
So taking a look at Michigan hospitals, we've got the Healthy Michigan plan, which is the name of Michigan's Medicaid expansion.

271
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:57,530
It took effect April 1st, 2004. So we look at hospitals while there's obviously 2011 to 2013, HP didn't exist, 2015 to 2017, they existed.

272
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:02,810
We've seen all 12 months kind of on average was about half the year in 2014.

273
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:10,490
I think on when the hospitals fiscal year is some of the some fiscal year obviously exactly the calendar year.

274
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:16,850
That's why it's not nine months of the fiscal year in which the 2014 occurred.

275
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:26,600
Let's take a look at hospital uncompensated care as a percent million dollars million for hospital.

276
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:41,630
And we can also look at 2% of hospital expenses. So prior to the ACA, over $7 million a year and that was well over 3% by 20 1413,

277
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:48,560
7.8%, $7.8 million per hospital and 3.8% of their expenses for uncompensated care.

278
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:58,090
Okay. So let's jump past 2014 was that was the transition year, the 2015, the first full year of Healthy Michigan plan.

279
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:04,680
7.8 million fell to 4.4 million and 3.8% of expenses fell to 2.1.

280
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:11,250
And by the time where in 2017, we had about $4 million and 1.6%.

281
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:15,720
So basically uncompensated care at Michigan hospitals fell in half.

282
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:27,480
Due to the Medicaid expansion. So on a national level, it fell from 6% of hospital revenues to 4.6%.

283
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:34,320
Michigan's trend was stronger because some states didn't expand Medicare or didn't spend Medicaid.

284
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:40,530
So had every state expanded Medicaid. Then that 4 to 4.6 would have been even lower.

285
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,340
Especially as there are some really big states like Texas and Florida that didn't expand.

286
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:53,870
No. Interestingly, the hospital sector still accounts for the greatest share of spending of any other,

287
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:58,940
but it's only 33% now and 43 that's still bigger than any other single component.

288
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,830
Physician services would be second, but it's declining in size.

289
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:09,290
Share of. We've seen big changes in ownership.

290
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:14,780
We've seen closures, we've seen mergers, we've seen physician practice acquisitions.

291
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:20,240
And we've seen a general move from the inpatient setting of care to outpatient setting centered care.

292
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:28,870
And we've seen obviously as big decreases in uncompensated care, particularly in states like Michigan that expanded Medicaid.

293
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:36,399
So that's kind of just a structural background. That's sort of the 10,000 foot view of what the hospital industry looks like

294
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:41,230
today and how it's evolved in the last few decades to get to where it is today.

295
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:48,040
So any questions or comments on that before we dig into mergers a little deeper?

296
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:07,049
Question. Yeah. I mean, just looking at that table you showed,

297
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:13,920
can you can you think of any real economic justification for refusing to expand Medicaid beyond the politics of it?

298
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,150
Does the economics look pretty straightforward?

299
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:23,970
It really just is. The politics is if you consider that for the first few years, the ACA,

300
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:31,440
that the federal government paid for 100% of the costs of the expansion and even now they're paying for something like 90%.

301
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:41,280
Just the dollars you're bringing into your state are substantially greater than the state outlays and probably just sort of tax

302
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:48,370
revenue that you end up getting back from those extra dollars is probably going to make up even that 10% or so that you have to pay.

303
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:53,430
So it really I can't think of any rationale other than making a political statement.

304
00:34:54,570 --> 00:35:03,450
Thank you. My only rationale rationale that I can think of for that is that politicians see that and just think I mean,

305
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:08,480
if they even see that that hospitals are giving that money back, they're not spending on uncompensated care.

306
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:12,270
So it's not like necessarily, you know, it's going directly to the government.

307
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:18,270
It's just going to the hospitals. So hospitals, while they're lobbying for this, are not the politicians that actually make the changes.

308
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:23,280
So that that's looking out for your states interests,

309
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,280
presumably bringing more revenue into your hospitals and reducing their unconscious, it carries accrue into your state's interest.

310
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,770
One would think you would hope so.

311
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:38,940
States like Texas are filing different waivers to get that money anyway, and it's going directly to the hospital regardless.

312
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:44,100
So they're already doing that. They're just not actually expanding health care for anyone in the process.

313
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:54,540
I just don't get that. Like the waivers. Like why is the federal government proving that when like I saw stop, that's when we all have to do it.

314
00:35:54,540 --> 00:36:01,200
Texas papers aren't even covering the COVID care in Texas.

315
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,300
So yeah, and like health care, there's like other markets that it would boost.

316
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:13,740
So yeah. So the question is, when were the waivers approved or are they approved under the Trump administration or the Trump?

317
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:20,160
Yeah. Is that probably is part of the answer because the Trump administration obviously was entered into,

318
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:24,990
you know, did not like the ACA and likes the state of Texas.

319
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:34,890
So some of these waivers are not approved. The waiver is supposed to be approved if it's meeting the intent of the federal program.

320
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:42,809
And if you're not actually covering the uncompensated care, it becomes a little squishy to argue it's meeting the intent of the program.

321
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:46,020
But the administration has broad discretion in deciding that.

322
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:52,500
So based on the administration's politics, you might decide, I'm going to approve this waiver.

323
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:59,790
You know, even if it doesn't really meet the intent of the program or say, you know, hey, I believe in the intent of the program as written.

324
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:03,450
I'm not going to approve that waiver because it doesn't the intent of the program.

325
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:10,860
So, I think is whether the administration says, I want to approve this despite it not meeting the intent,

326
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,030
because I agree with that versus I agree with the intent.

327
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:19,140
Therefore, I'm not going to approve a waiver unless it meets the intent of the program.

328
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,500
I think that might be the the flip side there.

329
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:31,050
I wouldn't expect to see the same waivers approved by the Biden administration were approved by the Trump administration.

330
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:37,799
There's always going to be a discretion for the administration to say, yes, this is a waiver that may seem tender.

331
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:49,550
No, it isn't a waiver that meets the intent. Discretion bar bounded by legal challenge potentially should always get lawyers involved.

332
00:37:54,130 --> 00:38:00,670
All right. So as we saw, it's kind of the big trends. I call the mega trends hospitals declining as a share of spending,

333
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:09,730
but the remaining hospitals are consolidating into systems with each other and integrating with other levels of care, particularly physicians.

334
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:21,010
So how do we define market concentration ends up being a kind of a squishy conceptual question because you have to define the market.

335
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:24,880
First of all, you have to say, well, what's the extent geographically in which we're competing?

336
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,940
What's the and with which providers are we competing?

337
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:32,170
Are only competing with other hospitals are competing with providers at different levels of care.

338
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:40,480
So generically, a measure that is often used by the Federal Trade Commission to measure competition is called

339
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,209
the Personal Hirschman Index Game Changer and starts with defining the market segment.

340
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:50,560
So what's the geography over which the market is constructed?

341
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:57,520
And then who are the actual providers in that market? And then they obtain some measure of market shares of those providers.

342
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:03,580
So once we've defined the geographic market and the product market and therefore who are the competitors in that market,

343
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:12,730
we have to come up with some measure of their size. So might use a crude measure like PEDs or maybe a somewhat less crude measure like admissions.

344
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:20,010
Is the bed might be empty. And say, well, here are all the admissions that occurred in this market last year.

345
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:26,640
And this percent of them were hospital one. This percent were hospital two of the source that were hospital three and so on.

346
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:34,460
So once we have that those shares, we can construct the HHI just by squaring the individual firm's shares and adding them up.

347
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:39,690
And then that's going to give us an index that ranges from 0 to 10000.

348
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:45,080
So 10,000 is a monopoly market. Complete concentration in one firm.

349
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,910
Why? Because that one firm would have 100% market share in 100 squared is 10,000.

350
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:54,760
Zero is sort of the mathematical lower bound.

351
00:39:54,770 --> 00:40:03,950
If you had sort of an infinite number of infinitesimally small producers and you square one over infinity, that's one over infinity.

352
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,570
Nothing. Add them up, you approach zero.

353
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:16,610
So as the number of producers approached Infinity, that number would approach a limit of zero.

354
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:22,180
So you're never have a real market that's close to zero, but that's sort of the theoretical limit.

355
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:30,509
So zero would be absolute perfect competition. You've got gazillions of little tiny hospitals and 10,000 is no competition.

356
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:35,900
We've got one hospital that's got the entire market. So there's our monopolist 100 square, it's 10,000.

357
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:45,230
What would our HHI be if we had two hospitals in a market and they were sized on each one would have a 50% share.

358
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:50,840
50 squared is 2500. There's two of them. So 2500 plus 2500.

359
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:56,150
We have 5000. Now, what if we had two firms in the market?

360
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,450
But rather than being equally sized, one of them was a lot bigger.

361
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,810
One was 80% of the market, the other was 20.

362
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:11,120
That would represent sort of a less competitive situation than the two equally sized firms, because you've got and still have just two firms.

363
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,900
Now, one of them is much more much bigger, a much more dominant in that market.

364
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:23,550
So if one of them had 80% of the market, so 80 square to 6400, the second one would have 20% of the market.

365
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:29,110
20 square is 400. So you'd see that the HHI in that market is higher.

366
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:35,300
It's a more concentrated and less competitive market than the HHI when we had two equally sized firms.

367
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,889
And finally, if we have maybe a relatively competitive market,

368
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:44,570
we're not going to get towards zero, but we can get pretty low in this range from 0 to 10000.

369
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:52,580
If we had ten equally sized firms. So each one of those to give us ten squared as a hundred, we'd add them up ten times.

370
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:58,490
We have an HHI of a thousand. So there's just sort of four hypothetical markets and sort of where they would fall.

371
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,720
Now, how would the FTC judge those markets in terms of how competitive they are or what they use?

372
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:15,170
The opposite term of competitive, concentrated and say, well, under 1500, the FTC would typically consider on concentrated market.

373
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,069
So they wouldn't have a lot of worry about competition and they would be

374
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:26,210
unlikely to block a merger if the resulting market would still have under 1500.

375
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:35,120
Moderately concentrated, 1500 to about 2500, highly concentrated 2500, up to about 5000.

376
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,690
And then finally, super concentrated as 5000 and above.

377
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:45,110
So in these four examples, obviously super concentrated, super concentrated,

378
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:51,170
how to write on the border between highly and super concentrated in this one on concentrated.

379
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:54,979
And we then write down a different one that is falling in this range.

380
00:42:54,980 --> 00:43:04,970
And you can see, you know, maybe if you had five, five equally sized competitors as each one have 20%, so be 400 times five is 2000.

381
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:11,990
So if we had five firms each with 20% of the market, it would have an HHI of 2000 in the moderately concentrated.

382
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:18,860
Yeah, I've only ever really seen this. Used to kind of give a general gauge of price controls.

383
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:24,530
So like in a super concentrated market for very little price control, in a super competitive market, you have better price controls.

384
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:27,140
People are fighting for different prices in the same market share.

385
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:33,470
Are there other economic concepts that generally come up surrounding concentration and competition?

386
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:38,920
So one thing it comes up a lot in hospital cases is also quality.

387
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,560
So quality and cost.

388
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:48,310
Hospitals will argue that if we merge, we're going to raise quality and we're going to get all these efficiencies that we can reduce our costs.

389
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:54,580
So that will often be their defense to saying there are benefits from that greater concentration.

390
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,989
And we'll talk about the evidence on that.

391
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:05,950
And the evidence is not so robust to say take those claims with a grain of salt or maybe with the lack of salt.

392
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:17,210
Okay. So why are some markets concentrated? Everything generically, not just about hospital markets.

393
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,960
Why are some industries have concentrated markets, other industries less concentrated?

394
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:25,130
Sometimes markets are just too small to support a lot of competitors.

395
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:35,000
So if you do think about it in terms of hospitals, if you have a rural town with 5000 people, how many hospitals is it going to be able to support?

396
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,590
It's going to have ten hospitals sharing that market going away.

397
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:46,190
So some markets might be concentrated simply because they're not big enough for multiple competitors to be viable.

398
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:51,110
Another reason why markets might become concentrated as well.

399
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:57,530
If one firm produces a better and cheaper product than its competitors, it will win a large market share.

400
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:10,670
So in a sense, it's one the competitive process. So what might be a market like that where it doesn't have to be in health care, where, say,

401
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:17,210
one firm has realized that they've developed a great product and therefore they're kind of a big gorilla in that market.

402
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:29,490
Yeah. So what are you looking at back there? Looking at your phone?

403
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:37,080
Will that be an example of a market maybe where, you know, Apple has produced a product that lots of us really like.

404
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:46,890
And they've become very big. And then also relates partly to network effects, another phone thing.

405
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:54,640
So there are certain functionalities that are easier if we all have iPhones or if we all have Google phones.

406
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,240
They play they play together nice more nicely, or we have an iPhone and Apple computer.

407
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:07,560
So we can use the same apps and we can share it, use the same cloud and so on and so forth.

408
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:14,490
So there are also sort of network effects that once we have a classic example of network effect, is going back to the telephone.

409
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:19,440
I mean, the telephone was invented in like 1876.

410
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:27,330
Was there any value to having the first telephone? What are you going to call yourself now?

411
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,410
I've got the only phone call. It's useless.

412
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:42,840
You know, being early adopter gets you nothing. But once other people have phones, then getting a phone is more valuable.

413
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:51,180
You know, if most of my friends have phones and I don't, all the sudden it's like, wait a second, if I got a phone, I can call my friends.

414
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,520
So the value of product may increase with the number of users.

415
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:04,780
So Bell Telephone back in the old days was a monopolist and they controlled the phone network.

416
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,050
And then finally we have what we've been talking about today, mergers between former competitors.

417
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:17,320
So markets can get concentrated for any and all of these reasons and sometimes for a combination of these reasons.

418
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:27,840
And so we had the horizontal mergers. We got to our rules. So that top rectangle.

419
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,690
We got the vertical mergers. We've got hospital and physician, the vertical rectangle.

420
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:37,620
We can also have horizontal mergers between physician practices.

421
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,780
So we have horizontal at the same level, single specialty practices that become multispecialty practices.

422
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,070
Small primary care practices can become big primary care practices.

423
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:55,319
And we can also have horizontal where physicians are buying hospital practices.

424
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:03,550
And now they're employing physicians who used to be independent. So why integrate?

425
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:09,100
Coming back to the question, well, hospitals are often going to claim.

426
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,690
If you let us integrate, if we let us merge, we're going to become more efficient.

427
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:18,440
We're going to reduce costs. There's scale economies.

428
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,489
There's to be less duplication of equipment and service. We're service lines.

429
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:29,209
We can spread fixed costs of investments like our I.T. system over a larger quantity, and our costs will go down.

430
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:35,660
And because of that, we'll be able to charge lower prices and everybody will be better off if you just let us merge.

431
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:43,930
Leave that. She's taking shaking. Yeah, you shouldn't believe it.

432
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,879
Hospital physician integration. Think? Well, we'll have better care.

433
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:55,840
Coordination will be better. Communication will all be on the same HIIT system, so we'll be less likely to duplicate tests.

434
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:02,290
We know there are a lot of problems in the U.S. health care system in terms of handoffs between different levels of care.

435
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:09,100
You know what happens when a patient gets discharged from the hospital? Do they have a good plan of continuity of care in the community, etc.?

436
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:15,640
So if we avoid the physicians would be easier for us to do that. We could reduce readmissions to all kinds of great stuff.

437
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:23,530
So all these things in principle could happen. You know, they're not sort of a priori silly arguments.

438
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,610
So it's more of an empirical question of how often do they happen?

439
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,960
So what do economists fear and what do regulators often fear?

440
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:39,590
Well, if we let them merge instead of those good things on the last slide, we get less consumer choice.

441
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:48,910
We're going to get higher prices. We're going to have less competition, not just on price, but based on clinical, all of your customer service.

442
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,740
And that even if the great things on the last slide actually happen,

443
00:49:54,250 --> 00:50:02,740
those savings are just going to accrue to the merging parties pockets and not be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices.

444
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:07,470
So that's the fear. Here's the claim for the hope.

445
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:15,950
Maybe there is the fear. I feel like we need something for this.

446
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:21,890
We do need to see one possibly in the gym.

447
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:28,820
So those are those potentially would be some of the efficiencies if you could do the same thing with less people.

448
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:35,780
It's not good for those people who are laid off, but it might be a lower cost for the health care system.

449
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:43,520
And the question is, does that get passed along in the form of lower prices or does it get us long for higher prices because there's less competition?

450
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:54,200
Okay, so let's look at quality and kind of the overwhelming evidence seems to be that mergers tend to either decrease quality or leave it unchanged.

451
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:58,500
Decreases tend to be fairly small, but there's not.

452
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:05,350
But the most important part is there's no robust evidence that murders consistently raise quality of care, which, again, was one of the claims.

453
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:14,310
We can deliver better care if you let us merge. Sort of neutral to negative on quality rather than the claims positive.

454
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:25,470
A mergers could decrease cost to hospitals. But that tends to happen only in one particular scenario if the hospitals actually merge service lines.

455
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:33,960
So if before the merger, we had a cardiac surgery program in my hospital and you had a cardiac surgery program in your hospital?

456
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:38,550
A lot of times when we merge will still have a cardiac surgery program in both of our hospitals.

457
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:43,680
And if that's the case, costs don't go down. But costs do go down potentially.

458
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:50,100
If we say, okay, we're going to close the one in your hospital and centralize it all in my hospital after the merger.

459
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,040
So the one example where there is evidence that costs can go down is if you literally eliminate

460
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:00,870
merge service lines and consolidate them and say things we used to provide in multiple hospitals.

461
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:04,580
We're now going to centralize in one. Yeah. Two things.

462
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:09,209
One, do you have a sense of the fraction of mergers that end up this way where they actually do

463
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:15,390
merge subsides or is it kind of just too complex and they sometimes merge some service lines,

464
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:23,760
they sometimes merge some, but it's not not as many big service lines are merged as you would expect because it's hard to do that.

465
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:29,610
Yeah. You know, if we're going to merge and I say, well, you know, after we merge, we're closing your cardiac surgery line.

466
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:35,220
Are you happy about that now? Are your physicians going to be happy about that?

467
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,370
So it's hard to do because there's politics there as well.

468
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:45,210
It's like the internal politics of the organization. No,

469
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:53,780
I'm I know that it's more efficient for us to have to all the cardiac surgery in my hospital and close the cardiac surgery program in your hospital.

470
00:52:54,650 --> 00:53:00,950
But we have to merge and become partners. We have to make sure the physicians don't revolt and leave.

471
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:10,250
So your cardiac surgeons, if they're not going to be able to come to my hospital or don't want to come to my hospital, they want to stay in yours.

472
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,810
You know, now we've got them leaving the system, you know, and that's a problem, too.

473
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:22,640
So. Service lines don't merge as often as you would expect, especially big service lines.

474
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:30,920
And then a second question, kind of along the lines of like what they might do with the money from increased prices and decreased costs.

475
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,870
Do you see any changes in uncompensated care post-merger? Not really.

476
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:40,550
Oh, awesome. Okay.

477
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,400
Yeah. Do you think consolidation might be more likely in administrative or non-clinical roles?

478
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:50,290
I was working at Spectrum right up until I started the Beaumont merger.

479
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:50,570
Right.

480
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:58,150
And the first people getting caught and the first things getting merged were like the Rapid Cycle Team and the contact center and they were, you know,

481
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:03,550
getting rid of some of their mid-level management that they no longer thought they needed that

482
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:08,719
that was like the first place that they consolidated and caught well in that merger in particular,

483
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:15,650
that was the only place they really could have consolidated because they were merging a hospital system operating on the west side of the state,

484
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:18,320
with the hospital system operating in the southeast of the state.

485
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:23,750
So it's not like they're suddenly going to send their cardiac surgery patients from Beaumont,

486
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:26,960
from the old Beaumont over to the old spectrum in Grand Rapids.

487
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:36,980
So the only place they possibly could merge would be in administrative functions that could be, you know, do the umbrella over both systems.

488
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:41,690
So that's probably why they looked there because that was the only place that they could look.

489
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:48,860
Do you think that's common, though, in mergers to try and like if you can't merge a service like a clinical service line,

490
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:52,519
is it common to merge like your administrative team? Yeah,

491
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:58,249
I think that's more common in actually merging the clinical service line and some

492
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:02,309
of the some of the administrative functions kind of can be put under one umbrella.

493
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:09,290
And now that unit probably will be bigger than it was for either one of the systems alone.

494
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:16,280
So question is how much how much can you really reduce that number if you can really only reduce it a lot?

495
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:22,700
If those systems were kind of very different to start with and one of them was a lot more efficient than the other.

496
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:33,290
There's also been a lot of research on the efficacy of mergers due to both companies views on administration as well.

497
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:38,930
Right. So like the way they handle things and the way they expect to merge and that sort of thing.

498
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:49,860
Yeah. And so it's not a lot of evidence that mergers do all these great things that hospitals claim they're going to do when they merge.

499
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:55,020
But there's pretty clear evidence that they do increase prices. It depends quite a bit on context.

500
00:55:55,350 --> 00:56:08,610
The context that content depends on context could be 5%, could in some context be as high as 50%, typically more like in the five, ten, 15% range.

501
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:14,010
And it turns out that even nearby hospitals that weren't part of the merger get to

502
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:17,280
benefit by raising their prices because they're now in a less competitive market,

503
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:23,700
too. So if the four of us all have hospitals in this market and we merge you guys,

504
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:27,510
it will raise your prices, too, because you're now in a less competitive market.

505
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,280
So even though you didn't verge, you weren't part of the merger, your market has changed.

506
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,620
In a way that now makes you maybe more important to certain insurers.

507
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:47,040
So in horizontal hospital hospital mergers to do this also look and somebody

508
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,000
mentions of workforce and jobs I think you mentioned jobs as a possibility.

509
00:56:51,180 --> 00:57:02,540
I don't think it can change his wages. So mergers that substantially increased market power ended up affecting wages of certain employees.

510
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:08,060
Which types of employees? The ones for which hospitals are a very important employer.

511
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:15,170
So you can imagine there are two types of workers. There's things like nurses and various technologists, radiation techs, people like that.

512
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:24,550
Hospitals employ a significant share of all those people. So in terms of the nurse labor market, hospital employment is important.

513
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:28,150
And then you can also say, well, there much your general skills.

514
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:34,390
Skills that are hired throughout the economy that aren't, you know, for which hospitals are only a very small hirer.

515
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:38,680
You know, everybody hires custodial services. Everybody hires food services.

516
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:43,990
So where would you expect of hospitals merged? Wages would be affected.

517
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:55,240
I feel those job classifications for which hospitals are an important part of the employment opportunities.

518
00:57:56,090 --> 00:58:05,350
You know, so if I'm a nurse and 40% of the nurses in my area work for hospitals and then these hospitals become more powerful,

519
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:13,480
maybe that's going to affect my wages. If I'm a food service worker, I could work for a gazillion places other than hospitals.

520
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,579
It probably won't affect my hospital merger, probably won't affect my wages.

521
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:22,480
And that's exactly what we found. So four years post-merger.

522
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,590
Our ends and pharmacists are in 6.8% less.

523
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:34,700
In the emerging markets than they did in the non emerging markets, other sort of skilled medical type categories,

524
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:39,750
radiation techs, for example, about 4% less now recalls their general labor.

525
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:45,710
The types of workers that are hired throughout the economy and hospitals are not sort of an important part of employment opportunities.

526
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:50,750
Custodial food service? No. No. Noticeable effect on wages.

527
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:59,630
And where nurses were unionized, the effects were smaller. So the organization did mitigate the wage cuts post-merger.

528
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:09,230
Let's talk about the other kind of merger vertical in particular, hospital physician,

529
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:16,579
lots of kinds of vertical mergers, post-acute care providers, shares, they could merge with hospitals.

530
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:26,300
But we'll talk about physicians as kind of probably the most important change that we've seen as things increase in hospital acquired practices.

531
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:35,810
Our prices for physician services tend to go up about 14% after merger, and about half of that is just because of silly payment rules.

532
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:47,570
Where Medicare, for example, will often pay more for the same service delivered in a hospital setting than delivered a non-hospital setting.

533
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:57,280
And if the hospital owns the practice, all of a sudden that office becomes a hospital based practice and the hospital's facility fee gets paid,

534
00:59:57,670 --> 01:00:05,520
which is higher than the facility fee. So. You have to example, very close to, oh, my wife was an oncologist.

535
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:12,190
She was in private practice. In about eight or ten years ago, the hospital bought the practice.

536
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:17,770
They rented their office space from the hospital in a building that was physically attached to the hospital.

537
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:26,390
But while they were an independent practice, their facility fee was less than it was after the hospital bought their practice,

538
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:32,660
which was still located in the same physical office, in the same building owned by the hospital attached to the hospital building.

539
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:36,500
Except because they were not renting it from the hospital. And now.

540
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:43,410
The hospital was employing them. It now became a hospital based facility when it wasn't.

541
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:51,120
They literally did not move. They were providing chemotherapy to the same patients in the same chairs, in the same physical office.

542
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:59,390
And the hospital could get paid more money for their services than they could get paid as an independent practice.

543
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:09,690
Does that make any sense? May do so.

544
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:17,940
About half of the increase in the price of physician services post-acquisition is just from exploiting these silly payment rules.

545
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:28,040
The same thing happened in the hospital. Like if somebody gets really in the hospital, if they are admitted, they charged him with money for that.

546
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:34,620
So the hospital. So it's so we don't have site neutral payment.

547
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:44,670
If you say what we're paying for is the service and we don't care where it was delivered, we wouldn't get as much of a price increase post-merger,

548
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:51,059
and then we would have less of an incentive for hospitals to buy physician practices in the first place because they know if they buy the practice,

549
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:54,350
they can exploit these site differential payments.

550
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:04,420
It mixed effects on quality. Vertical mergers tend to increase prices and spending.

551
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:13,330
There are some marginal improvements, and some studies on mortality are very small, inconsistent outcomes in terms of other outcomes.

552
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:21,229
So again, not a not quite as bad as the hospital hospital merger with sort of neutral or negative here.

553
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:26,640
We've got sort of neutral or small positive, but it's also not sort of a big slam dunk that, you know,

554
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:32,170
while quality and outcomes are really improving after vertical integration, that's not the case.

555
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,440
So hospital markets have become increasingly concentrated.

556
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:43,210
Large reason is merger and acquisition activity.

557
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:49,990
We also see a big increase in those vertical mergers between hospitals and physicians and for the most part,

558
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:55,780
the biggest, clearest, most robust in terms of research findings, impact is higher prices.

559
01:02:56,820 --> 01:03:02,040
And the impacts on other outcomes, costs and quality tend to be fairly small and inconsistent.

560
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:08,310
When you talk about vertical integrations on the last slide and the impacts on quality

561
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:14,520
is this is the same hold true when you talk about vertical integration with payers too,

562
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:18,389
because then they're responsible for the outcomes.

563
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:21,930
So with that increased quality or does it not too?

564
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:27,000
So I think there has been less research than like Kaiser, for example.

565
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:36,300
Yeah. So Kaiser has long been an integrated system and that is what one of the benefits of an integrated system is.

566
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:42,810
You're you're going to be responsible for the outcomes and you're going to be responsible for the cost.

567
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:49,820
So you have you have a lot of incentive to worry about things like getting the handoff from hospital to outpatient care.

568
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:54,209
Right. Because if there are readmissions, you're the one who eats those costs even before there are readmissions.

569
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:59,790
Penalties from Medicare. Yeah. Even in fee for service medicare where you got paid more.

570
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:09,749
If the patient got readmitted before the penalty started, the Kaiser wouldn't win from that because they pay the entire cost of the hospitalization.

571
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:12,540
So the readmission was already a cost to them.

572
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:19,230
So, you know, definitely there are some systems like Kaiser do perform very well and that probably is a large part of the reason for it.

573
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:24,840
But I think there's sort of less known about sort of when you take an existing insurer that was independent of

574
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:31,200
existing health systems and now the insurer buys the health system to try to create a new integrated system,

575
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:36,520
it's been a lot harder to replicate sort of that, you know,

576
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:43,910
the secret sauce or the magic fairy dust of Kaiser and a few other systems, Geisinger, Pennsylvania and Intermountain.

577
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:49,830
You should ask, do 20 or 30 years ago, what are the really good integrated health care systems?

578
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:56,250
You have the same names that you have now, and you would hope that by now you'd have the same names plus ten more.

579
01:04:57,450 --> 01:05:00,899
And you really don't. You're still talking about the same names.

580
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:04,740
There are some magic fairy dust that has not been easily replicated.

581
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:17,900
These are technical economic terms. You just need some escape.

582
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:28,060
And State has taken it over yet it seems that student achievement and I don't know the

583
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:35,390
gap between them now they have cleared by Penn State that that one is growing as well.

584
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:40,660
Yeah. Okay.

585
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:50,780
Hospital prices and how do we get to hospital prices? Small prices in the commercial sector are largely in negotiation between insurers and providers.

586
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:54,889
So Medicare obviously sets prices. Medicaid sets prices.

587
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:59,990
There's a fee schedule determined it's not negotiated by individual hospitals.

588
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:04,310
I don't negotiate my Medicare rate with Medicare. Medicare sets the rate.

589
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:13,850
It's adjusted by certain things like local wage indices, but it's not kind of adjusted hospital by hospital based on any type of negotiating power.

590
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:20,750
But for commercial prices, it's obviously the balance of power between hospitals, insurers.

591
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:26,510
So as a first question, sort of how does that balance of power operate?

592
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:34,970
The second question is, do the prices set by public programs, Medicare and Medicaid affect private prices?

593
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:39,320
So hospitals often are make up argument called cost shifting.

594
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:44,300
They said, well, if Medicare cuts, its rates will be forced to raise our prices to private payers.

595
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:50,270
Medicaid cuts. Its rates will be forced to raise our prices to private to private payers.

596
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:55,700
And we'll assess the logic and evidence of that argument.

597
01:06:56,540 --> 01:07:05,270
So in terms of the balance of power. What if consumers kind of ultimately care about when they're dealing with insurers and providers?

598
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:10,669
It's really going to be premiums is sort of the bottom line and premiums are going to be

599
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:15,649
reflective but are going to be affected both by how competitive the provider market is.

600
01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:20,420
Therefore, how high a price can providers get and how competitive is insurer market?

601
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:25,820
Therefore, how much can insurers mark up the premiums above the prices they're paying to providers?

602
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,770
And we might want to be in a sort of sweet spot.

603
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:40,340
So if we're in a market like V where there is sort of a good balance of power between hospitals and insurers, what do you mean by good here?

604
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:47,540
We mean by good is that insurers are powerful enough relative to hospitals that they have the leverage to negotiate good discounts.

605
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:55,879
There is they can say to the hospital, if you don't sign a contract with me at a good price, then I'm sorry,

606
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:59,720
but all my commercial enrollees who you'd really like to have go to your hospital,

607
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:03,320
I'm going to send them over here to this hospital because they'll cut me a deal.

608
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:09,890
So you want the insurers to be powerful enough to have leverage to negotiate good prices.

609
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:16,370
But on the flip side, if the insurers are really, really powerful in that market,

610
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:20,600
then they don't have to pass along those savings in the form of lower premiums.

611
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:30,129
So you want the insurers to be just powerful enough to negotiate good prices, but face enough competition in the insurance market that if they say,

612
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:35,770
oh, we're just going to pocket those low prices as profit and charge a really high premium that they're going to lose enrollees.

613
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:42,730
So you want the insurers to face enough competition for enrollees that they have to offer good premiums.

614
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:49,990
So you want them to be able to negotiate good prices on our behalf and pass them along to us in the form of lower premiums.

615
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:55,930
So we've got the lowest premiums that market be. That's that sort of sweet spot market.

616
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:59,920
It's just right. Insurers are powerful enough to get good discounts,

617
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:05,770
but not so powerful that they don't have to pass those discounts along in the form of lower premiums.

618
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:12,559
What if instead we're in a market like a. Called excess hospital concentration.

619
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,410
Other words, the hospitals are more powerful than the insurers.

620
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:25,850
So in that market, a hospital doesn't have to give good discounts and say, Oh, if I'm not in your network, who's going to enroll in your plan?

621
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:32,840
If I'm absolutely critical to your network being attractive to enrollees, I know I don't have to cut you a deal.

622
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:43,120
So the insurers maybe are not that powerful. They might have to pass along discounts in the form of lower premiums if they could get discounts.

623
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:47,620
But they can't get the discounts in the first place because the hospitals are even more powerful.

624
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,350
So we get high premiums.

625
01:09:51,520 --> 01:10:00,760
It can also be in a market like see excess insurer concentration is the insurers have the leverage to negotiate the discounts,

626
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:08,770
but they face very little competition in their own market. So they've got no reason to pass those discounts along in the form of premiums.

627
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:21,129
So how many different, say, metropolitan areas in the United States do you think are kind of in a sweet spot where the insurers are powerful enough to

628
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:28,570
negotiate good prices but not so powerful that they don't have to pass along those good prices to consumers as lower premiums?

629
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:35,650
You think that's like most markets. So there's a little bit of data to help us answer that.

630
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:43,389
Yeah. So where did that sweet spot be? Okay. Well, first, maybe the true sweet spot is if there's lots of competition on both sides,

631
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:47,170
because then the prices can't be high in the first place in the hospital market.

632
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:56,760
And lots of competition insurance markets, so they can't markup premiums dramatically above prices that are in tons of profits.

633
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,510
Okay. So both markets on concentrate. Okay. That's nowhere.

634
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:06,340
Literally nowhere. Okay.

635
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:10,460
So what's maybe the next best? Yeah, I'll ask quickly.

636
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:19,760
I saw the previous scientists in 2010. Why don't you think that the individual marketplaces would have an impact on reducing concentration?

637
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:29,070
You can buy it from any number of companies through the government, regardless of where you live and who covers in your area.

638
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:37,319
So you can that varies a lot by state because some states got down to sort of a single provider and competition has increased

639
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:46,200
again over the last few years of sort of around 2018 or so that a lot of the insurers pulled out of the individual markets.

640
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:50,580
You had some counties that had no insurers at all.

641
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:56,879
In Iowa, for example, a lot of other counties that have one insurer, it's gotten a little bit more competitive,

642
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:02,700
but it's largely the same insurers that are playing in the commercial market or playing at the individual market.

643
01:12:06,290 --> 01:12:10,250
All right, so that's where we'd like to be.

644
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:15,530
Nowhere. Okay. What's the next best? Okay.

645
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:19,100
Market B is probably something like they're both moderately concentrated.

646
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:22,969
Insurers have some power to win discounts.

647
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:30,050
There's enough hospitals out there competing for that to be in that insurer's network that the hospitals are willing to give good prices.

648
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:36,200
And there are enough insurers competing for enrollees that those good prices have to be passed on in the form of lower premiums,

649
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:39,889
otherwise that insurer will lose enrollment. Okay.

650
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:44,240
So if market B is kind of like moderate.

651
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:47,690
Moderate. Okay, great. That's about one out of 20 markets.

652
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:55,120
Know, what are probably some of the really bad ones? And there's a couple of bad ones.

653
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:03,420
Highly concentrated providers, highly concentrated insurers.

654
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:08,980
Well, that's over a quarter of the markets in the country. So we've got only a couple of insurers.

655
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:12,910
Not a lot of competition for enrollees. Only a couple of hospitals.

656
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:18,790
Not a lot of competition to be in insurers networks. Probably everybody is fat and happy.

657
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:22,000
Everybody can say hospitals. Hey, we can charge high prices.

658
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,520
Insurers say not only can we pass those along in the form of higher premiums, so who cares that we're paying a high price?

659
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:34,330
We could even markup the premiums further. You don't have a lot of competition. Life is good unless you're paying premiums.

660
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:39,070
Life's not so good. You can. Also, this one seems pretty bad.

661
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:42,610
Super concentrated providers, highly concentrated insurers.

662
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:50,320
Now the providers have all the power. They don't have to negotiate at all because where else is the insurer going to go?

663
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:57,430
And the insurer doesn't face a lot of competition either. So we've got a little over half of markets are in two cells in this graph.

664
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:06,129
And those two cells both look pretty bad. You know, we've got only maybe one out of 20.

665
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:11,950
Looks like it's in this sort of really good cell in all the ones that sort of might be good.

666
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:19,040
They're pretty small. And those all up about 6%.

667
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:31,320
So how has concentration changed over time? A percentages of MSAs where the HHI is above 2500.

668
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:40,410
So at least into to the moderately concentrated range, if you remember, like gradations in hospitals that's almost everywhere, above 90%.

669
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:44,250
It's only gone up a little bit because so many were already there.

670
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:48,229
But if you asked, the average concentration has gone up more dramatically than this.

671
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:51,450
This is just the percentage of Americans who are above 2500.

672
01:14:52,050 --> 01:14:55,980
A lot of the mergers take markets that were at 3000 and turn them into 5000.

673
01:14:56,370 --> 01:15:03,780
So that wouldn't even register on this graph. We say the least concentrated markets are primary care.

674
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:07,440
But that's also the one where concentration has grown the most dramatically.

675
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:17,610
Most primary care markets are still under 2500, but it's a lot less in terms of relative percent.

676
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:22,100
It's gone up by about 50% over a six year period.

677
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:28,349
So it's not a very long time period from 20% up to 35%.

678
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:38,900
So about a 50% relative increase. So higher insurance concentration does seem to decrease some physician prices.

679
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:44,690
So if we look at the most highly concentrated shirts markets, the yellows,

680
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:51,680
they tend to get a little bit lower prices than less concentrated insurance markets.

681
01:15:52,970 --> 01:16:03,770
I see. Same thing kind of for hospitals. In some types of markets, we get lower prices versus high insurance concentration.

682
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:14,350
So market power and prices, we are just couple of minutes left to go and quickly if we compare markets with

683
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:18,820
four or more competitors to those that have either one hospital or a hospital.

684
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:24,969
All hospitals are part of the same system. In this monopoly markets, there are two big differences.

685
01:16:24,970 --> 01:16:31,270
Monopoly hospitals had prices about 12% higher than hospitals in markets with four or more competitors.

686
01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:36,639
And the second difference is the type of contracts hospitals had in monopoly markets.

687
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:41,470
Hospitals were less likely to enter into risk bearing contracts.

688
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:45,879
So if we think of one of the ways we want hospitals to get more efficient is to put

689
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:50,860
them at risk for more cost so that if somebody is discharged without a good plan.

690
01:16:53,510 --> 01:17:00,470
But the costs of that come back to the hospital because the hospital is at risk for costs beyond its own walls.

691
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:06,740
Those types of contracts are less likely a monopoly markets, a monopoly hospital or monopoly health system.

692
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,980
I don't have to bear risk of stay with you for service.

693
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:21,790
In terms of concentrated insurance markets, hospital prices were about 7% lower if the insurance market was concentrated.

694
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:29,739
So in other words, if I had strong parties to negotiate against on prices that had a lot of leverage at lower prices,

695
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:33,430
and hospitals are more likely to take on risk bearing contracts.

696
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:41,090
If we look at mergers between SA geographically, proximate hospitals,

697
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:45,780
hospitals say within five miles of each other they tend to raise prices about 6%.

698
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:58,300
Okay. Cost shifting. So that story I told, if public programs cut prices, hospitals are going to make it up by charging private payers more.

699
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:03,669
Fact or fiction. So hospitals will tell you this all the time.

700
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:08,910
Well, if you cut Medicare cuts this crisis, we're going to have to raise prices to everybody else.

701
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:16,149
We got to make it up. So if you look at all the literature, there is some evidence that this sometimes occurred.

702
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:20,770
But really any paper done in the last 20 years has found it does not occur.

703
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:33,370
And so let's ask logically, why doesn't it occur? If it's profitable for me to raise prices to private payers after Medicare cuts its rates,

704
01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:40,390
would that have been profitable for me to raise prices to private payers even before Medicare cut its rates?

705
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:54,910
So why wouldn't I have done it? There my leaving sort of unexploited profit opportunities on the table just waiting until Medicare cuts its rates.

706
01:18:55,210 --> 01:19:00,460
And only at that time we'll exploit these opportunities that are previously left unexploited on the table.

707
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:09,820
Does that sound plausible to most people? Not with hospitals, whether the for profit or nonprofit hospitals.

708
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:13,810
That doesn't sound too plausible. And what's also as the flip side.

709
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:18,399
Okay. So if this cost shifting argument is true, we saw that data, for example,

710
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:23,860
from Michigan where uncompensated care fell by 50% after the Medicaid expansion.

711
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:31,019
So shouldn't that also be logically the case that hospitals want to say, well,

712
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:35,700
now we got rid of all this uncompensated care because now we're getting Medicare payment for that.

713
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:39,030
So now let's go ahead and cut our prices to everybody else.

714
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:45,420
Did you ever hear of hospitals say, because of Michigan's Medicaid expansion to reduce our prices?

715
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,770
So shouldn't the inverse also be true?

716
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:58,020
Is there a reason why a hospital, whatever cuts prices and anything without like some new technological innovation that reduces costs?
