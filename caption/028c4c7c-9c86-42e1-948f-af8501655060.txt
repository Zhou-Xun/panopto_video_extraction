1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:10,340
This recording works. So today we have a few things to talk about.

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,900
Thank you for filling out the poll everywhere.

3
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:20,160
I think we'll start with that, actually, and then I'll see if there's any residual questions from last week.

4
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:32,049
Okay. So, you know, this doesn't mean. First off, if you haven't signed attendance here and I'll try to have someone like each side in the back,

5
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:38,230
so prior to coming in to class, please sign those and do by the end of the class if you have not already.

6
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:46,130
Probably at the beginning of many classes. I'll have this this recap, this this set of questions from the previous class.

7
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:52,010
It's it's not anything that's graded. It's just a starting off point for our discussions.

8
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,910
Okay. So I want to get our terms straight.

9
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:04,450
So what term best describes health in low income countries with a focus on how people from high income countries can improve it?

10
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:12,520
That is what we would say. International health in this term was sort of in vogue from like the 1970s to the early 2000.

11
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,350
And there are still some departments of international health like Johns Hopkins has one.

12
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,429
What term best describes physician dominated approach to improving health in equatorial regions?

13
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,840
That would be tropical medicine.

14
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:35,510
We don't really use this term much anymore, except for some set institutions like there's the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

15
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:41,149
Oftentimes, tropical medicine and hygiene kind of just glommed together in the sort of our old fashioned terms.

16
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,490
I mean, we don't really say the word hygiene a lot anymore.

17
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,610
But, you know, there's there's some schools which still keep this name as sort of a historical relic.

18
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:59,120
Not possible. And then a multidisciplinary approach to improving health through the involvement of local communities.

19
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,020
That is global health in that is the focus of this class.

20
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,899
I will say oftentimes you'll also see global public health.

21
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,050
For instance, here at the School of Public Health, we have an Office for Global Public Health.

22
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,600
I think the global public health is maybe a bit redundant, but it's supposed to emphasize that maybe,

23
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:19,610
although it is multidisciplinary, we're really going to be focusing on the public health side of things.

24
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:29,050
Okay. And then the last question I will bring up earlier or later in the lecture.

25
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,660
Okay. So some things that I. So but any questions about those terms?

26
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,450
Okay, sir, I'm. Very concerned that things are just not being recorded.

27
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:48,570
So I am just double checking. Okay, so some things I forgot to mention last time.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,630
Uh, in our canvass website, I do have information on how you can contact me.

29
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,950
Uh, of course you can email me.

30
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,170
This is a pretty large class, so I would prefer it,

31
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,580
especially if it's more of a complicated question or if it's like a multipronged

32
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,750
question for you to set up an appointment with me on my Google calendar.

33
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:21,960
I right now I have slots on Wednesday afternoons and Thursday evenings, and this is just for a Zoom appointment.

34
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,830
If those times do not work with you, of course you can email me.

35
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:35,010
If those times don't work, then in your email you should propose sometimes for me just to kind of make our appointment setting process a bit quicker.

36
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:42,120
But yeah, I mean, you can email me, but again, I'm just trying to limit the number of emails I have for things which are not super important.

37
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:49,890
Like I love talking with students about their career paths, about the content of the course, about questions that they might have.

38
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,770
A lot of those are more in-depth conversations, which I would like to have, you know, face time with you.

39
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:04,000
If you aren't able to attend class, if you have attendance issues, ideally you could just fill out this Google form.

40
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,360
And again, this is the same link which is in the syllabus that just sort of minimizes the amount of my inbox,

41
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,530
which is just spent on dealing with student responses about attendance.

42
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,780
Because I, you know, I think there's probably going to be some times where many of you have illnesses or

43
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,270
have other religious or university sponsored obligations are unable to come to class.

44
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,600
That's totally fine if you have to do a make up.

45
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:34,960
There's this link right here. And again, how class works is I do have an expectation you are here,

46
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,030
but I do understand that there are going to be times where you're not going to be able to come.

47
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,459
And I don't necessarily need a reason for all those times I would say like this is

48
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,550
in the syllabus for those first five times that you're not able to come to class.

49
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:55,329
You don't need to tell me any reasons why you're not able to come.

50
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,040
But after that, I would want to kind of understand why you're not able to come.

51
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,669
I don't need extensive documentation. I don't need super big details.

52
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:12,070
But, you know, if you have an illness, write that in this form. Any questions about the attendance?

53
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,160
Okay. Otherwise, yeah. Just make sure to sign those pages at the beginning of class.

54
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,490
And I feel like there's something else that's going to turn on the campus upstate as well.

55
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,730
Oh, yeah. At my office. Hours for the GSA days are also here.

56
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,840
We're trying to have more office hours towards the end of the week,

57
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,770
especially since a lot of our assignments are due later in the week or on the weekends.

58
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:57,220
And it's just our understanding that a lot of students just kind of wait till the last minute to work on which I get it.

59
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,240
You have a lot of stuff going on, but that's why our our hours are like that.

60
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,850
Okay. So.

61
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:23,080
Last week. During the last week, you watched this debate that I did with some other people on is global health, public health.

62
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,570
That was the thing that we were trying to figure out and trying to argue for you.

63
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:36,250
So just also just to reiterate this, in the debate that we have recorded, we only gave everyone 2 minutes to make their point.

64
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,490
But in the debates that you do, you will have 3 minutes. So it's a slight difference.

65
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:45,340
I will say that everyone always goes over. So I think this is of a benefit to you.

66
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:57,060
So what we found is that before there were 79 of you who filled out this poll already, and if you have not already, you should do that.

67
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,250
So if this is something that you haven't done, there's an announcement about it.

68
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,240
This is also in the first week's material. You can still do this. But I'm just going to tell you the results right now.

69
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:13,460
There were 70 of you beforehand who said that global health was public health and only five of you disagreed.

70
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:22,380
And this is always the tough thing because if you start off really high, you have harder to fall.

71
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:30,320
And so at the end, 45 of you said that global health is public health as 24 linked.

72
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:37,830
So even though there is still more people who think that global health is public health after this debate,

73
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:49,380
the winner of the debate officially is the number which has the most movement in the in the change in being able to change people's minds.

74
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,430
And so for this debate, it would be the no side that would officially win.

75
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:01,170
Again, there is no benefit to winning this except for you two to be able to break in your own mind about it.

76
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,470
Okay. But I mean, I think this is this is a tough topic.

77
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:17,460
On one hand, I have mixed feelings about this. I think a lot of people in global health would argue that it is public health.

78
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:25,680
And part of this debate actually arose because maybe about ten years ago, when the term global health first came into being,

79
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:32,339
there was an article which was put out which basically was stating that this is how

80
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,610
global health is different than public health because this is the birth of a new field.

81
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:44,069
Let's talk about it. And then there was a really strong reaction from many global health practitioners who argued that,

82
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:51,010
you know, global health essentially is public health. So, you know, maybe we're just, like, arguing around in circles.

83
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:57,070
But in my mind, I over the years, I do think there are some distinctions between these.

84
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:04,210
For one, you know, we have a separate discipline. We've we have this global health course, this 350, which is different than 200.

85
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,939
And I hope by the end of the semester you'll understand how there are some differences in this course versus in 200,

86
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:17,620
which most of you have taken, although not all of you have. 200 is just that introductory public health for public health majors.

87
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:24,030
But I also think that we have different sets of focuses.

88
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,739
We we have as a grounding and as a theoretical basis.

89
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,580
There are some differences, and I think it's okay to talk about these differences.

90
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,879
But not everybody would think that. And that's a. Okay.

91
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,200
So. Well, any other questions about the debate?

92
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:48,920
I'm always really excited to hear from the guests about how you all put together the debate.

93
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,780
After each the debate, I will collect all the comments.

94
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,989
I'll read through them just to make sure that there isn't anything to racy in them.

95
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:02,780
And then I'll send those out to people who actually did participate in the debate or who do who were in the debate

96
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:10,660
just so that you'd get feedback from your classmates about what what they thought made them change their mind or not.

97
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:17,170
And I think that's always interesting to read through. Okay.

98
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:22,390
So in the fall I teach seven week.

99
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,500
Class on epidemiological methods.

100
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,049
And I ended up having sort of a similar attendance policy, which I implemented in this class.

101
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:46,220
But basically what I did is I, I required people to attend, but if they weren't able to attend, then they had a documented excuse.

102
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:56,390
They were able to watch the recordings. And so in the end, I graphed how often people attended class in person and what their final exam score was.

103
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:03,260
And in the end, you know, there is a wide distribution here, as one might be able to expect.

104
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,770
But generally for students who were able to attend to all seven classes,

105
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,900
there is this cluster of most of them getting pretty high grades on the final exam.

106
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,749
Whereas there's a lot more diversity among those students who didn't attend all classes.

107
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,560
And for many of these, they have documented the reasons why they weren't able to attend.

108
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:29,690
Um, but especially for the people who just weren't attending and weren't watching recordings, they got substantially lower test scores.

109
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,770
I mean, there's lots of confounding factors in this.

110
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,459
And, you know, this is just an example of one class in one semester.

111
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:42,620
But this is something that I've had substantial conversations with a number of different faculty.

112
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:49,210
I have tried to be reading what people are doing outside of our institution and what the best pedagogical thinkers are thinking.

113
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:57,320
So certainly I think there's room for criticism in how I put together my my attendance policies, but there is a reasoning behind it.

114
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:05,690
And I hope that you understand that I'm thinking about this, even if it might come to a different conclusion than you would like or you think.

115
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:16,260
Okay. So today we are going to be talking about dailies and we are going to be talking about international organizations.

116
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,120
This is just my thoughts on the different use of these terms so we can skip over this.

117
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:34,040
But actually, maybe before we talk about this, there was a up from last time, which I kind of want us to get to.

118
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,200
I don't want to spend too much time on this. So this is going to be a relatively quick activity.

119
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:46,700
But what I would like you to do is to find one person next to you or maybe two people next to you.

120
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,780
Scan this code and it'll come to this website.

121
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,769
And there are the first seven paragraphs kind of have to deal with seven different ethnic groups of people and,

122
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:02,890
and talking about their cultural beliefs relating to health. So pick your favorite number between one and seven.

123
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,150
Pick a different number than your group. Maybe read that paragraph as you only take half a minute.

124
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:13,400
Talk with your group made about like what is your reaction to this paragraph?

125
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:22,970
So I'm only going to give you like 3 minutes because I don't want this to take too much time, but I probably get you.

126
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,180
Yeah. Yeah.

127
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,290
Can somebody actually check? I checked earlier today, but I want to make sure that you actually are able to get to this.

128
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:41,100
Yeah, they're working on it.

129
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:54,190
All right. Thank you. Then I thought I was going.

130
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:19,750
You know, I never want to make a mess.

131
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:32,040
I think you should.

132
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:44,030
It sure that.

133
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,710
I just know I decided.

134
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,950
It was actually 18 years.

135
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:20,330
Tell her. Really?

136
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:10,150
It's kind of. One.

137
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,450
Okay.

138
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:33,080
And I'm sure you've got all day about this, but any any one in particular have a have a strong or not so strong reaction to what they wrote or wrote.

139
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:55,650
Yeah. So any any thoughts from any group, any strong thoughts about what was written about?

140
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,860
Well, there. So yeah, okay.

141
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:09,740
I'm going to try to pass this around, but I'm not the best seller, so it's good.

142
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:16,700
So I said in here and we're going to notice it's just that.

143
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,170
And I understand that it is very hard to get generalizations.

144
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:27,790
The problem is like when the seriousness of every person in the specific background of these things and

145
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:33,160
I think we're going to practice the hope is not general that the individual matters a lot as well.

146
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,319
But I think that's a little bit generalizing.

147
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,180
Doesn't give much room for guess individuality of data because.

148
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:50,730
Yeah. So it seems to me that you're kind of thinking about maybe there's some stereotyping that's going on or some generalizations.

149
00:17:51,510 --> 00:18:01,560
So, yeah, I mean, the reason why I am giving you this as an example of, of inexact activity early in the semester to do is.

150
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:10,110
Because yeah, there is a lot of generalizing that's going on. And, you know, maybe there are some kernel of truth to this, maybe there are not.

151
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:21,120
But I would almost think that this is a lot of othering and sort of treating people who are not who are not white,

152
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,560
who are not part of Western industrialized societies as being a bit weird.

153
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,090
And I mean, there's a over realized over generalization here,

154
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:37,440
which is saying that people in the United States think of disease as a natural scientific phenomenon and they advocate medical treatments,

155
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,400
which I could think of many counter-examples to that.

156
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,220
So, I mean, they're also generalizing. You know, somebody like me.

157
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:53,400
But, you know, as I read through this, there's only a bit that they write about, you know, like white people in the United States.

158
00:18:54,150 --> 00:19:02,490
But in general, you know, they kind of are picking out some different ethnic groups which are like nonwhite and any are making these generalizations.

159
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:09,390
And they're talking about, you know, weird things that are going on in that culture.

160
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:16,110
And again, I'm not trying to minimize what might be some some kernels of truth,

161
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:24,480
but I want us in this class to be just really careful about how we write about other people or how we write about other cultures.

162
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:34,110
And I think the whole point of like a global health perspective is that we can think introspectively in the same way that we think.

163
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:44,209
What's going on in the rest of the world. Like we should use the same analytical focus on ourselves or on the majority dominant culture

164
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:52,490
and where we live compared as we could in analyzing some other society or some other country.

165
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:58,130
So I yeah, in general, I think there's a lot of.

166
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,770
A lot of nonsense on this website, but I think that's what you'll see in a lot of writings.

167
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,870
And I would say that this is sort of an example of maybe like the international health approach, where we think like, oh,

168
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:14,339
we in the United States and especially like the dominant white culture we know best,

169
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:21,240
and it's like we're the good ones and we're going to like fix all these problems in other peoples.

170
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,799
And it can be very reductive. Don't try to stay away from that.

171
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,600
But that's something that we're going to be exercising throughout this class is not doing that.

172
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,920
Any other thoughts about it? All right.

173
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,559
So to recap from last time we were talking about health trajectories,

174
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:51,540
and this is the ideal health trajectory where we're very healthy until very a very old age, and then we die very quickly.

175
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:57,560
And these are some other circumstances where people die at various ages in their life.

176
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:03,170
This is often might be what we're thinking about. What happens here in the United States is that we just accumulate.

177
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,650
Disabilities. We accumulate chronic health conditions over time and we become less and less healthy.

178
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,460
And our process of dying takes takes a while.

179
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:25,249
What we want to do is we want to think about low cost health interventions, which predominantly are those which we advocate for in public health.

180
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,310
They're preventive. This is this is primary health care.

181
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:37,370
This is primary prevention. Things like clean water, sanitation, education, management of chronic diseases, vaccination.

182
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:46,850
Those are low cost interventions. High cost interventions are, you know, dealing with somebody in an ICU or rehabilitation to things like that.

183
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,209
So all of these are kind of assuming that we can make some relatively objective judgments

184
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:04,490
about what is somebody's health status and that we can measure incidence of the disease,

185
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:09,320
that we can measure the severity of disease. And so that's what we mean by disease burden.

186
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:13,400
So disease burden encompasses incidence, prevalence and severity.

187
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:18,410
So incidence is a measure of new cases, of disease. Prevalence is of existing cases of disease.

188
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:23,330
For many acute infectious diseases, these are relatively similar numbers.

189
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:30,520
So for instance, in the United States, about each year 20% of people get influenza.

190
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:35,150
So we could say that over a year, the incidence of influenza is about 20%.

191
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:42,880
We'd also then say that the prevalence of influenza is about 20% because influence is a very self-limiting disease.

192
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,890
So that'd be 20% for chronic conditions. These numbers can be different.

193
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:57,460
So maybe, for instance, in the state of Michigan, the number of incident HIV cases is 1000 each year.

194
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:03,300
There have been a number of new cases of people who are HIV positive.

195
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,520
So the prevalence then, would it be a thousand?

196
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,800
The prevalence would be the people who were diagnosed this year, along with people who had been diagnosed and who are still living in the past,

197
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,990
who are diagnosed in the past and still living so that be many thousands more.

198
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,080
So again, with with some acute infections that are self-limiting,

199
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:26,690
these numbers will be very similar for a numbers are for diseases which are more chronic.

200
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:33,570
These could be substantially different. And severity is just a measure of.

201
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:41,750
How bad the disease is we could think of does a result in hospitalizations test results result deaths.

202
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,520
We could also think of things like as a result in time taken off of school or work, things like that.

203
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:58,760
So the disability adjusted life here is a composite measure and it has to do with the years lived with disability and the years of life lost.

204
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:08,600
So this is just a simple schematic. And I know that this was brought up in the video that you watch before class today.

205
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,170
This is also something that you do much more in-depth during discussion this week.

206
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:20,390
But this is an overall summary. It just it's a prime you a bit before going into the calculations that you'll do later this week.

207
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:28,460
So what we think is that, you know, people can live their life and hopefully will have a healthy life for for much of it.

208
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:34,340
But there will be years that they live with disability.

209
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,980
And what does that mean?

210
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:43,240
You know, maybe if you have if you come down with influenza, maybe that means for two weeks out of the year before we go to the year,

211
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,070
maybe even just a couple of days out of a year, you're not at perfect health.

212
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:52,680
You're at something slightly less than perfect health. I mean, that's why we mean what we mean by disability.

213
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:58,680
It's just anything. Separate from a perfect, perfect health status.

214
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:06,120
So we might think of this in terms of something very small and self-limiting, like influenza.

215
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:11,970
We could think of this as somebody who's who's living with cancer for a longer period of time.

216
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,639
We could also think of differences. Remember,

217
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:24,240
from the first day of class of I had you fill out information about what you think a disability rate is for somebody who has untreated myopia,

218
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,740
who doesn't have a prescription for eyeglasses, versus somebody who does have treated myopia.

219
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:39,090
So we can think of things like that. You know, if you're living with untreated myopia, that's that's living with a disability of depression.

220
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:45,150
Those are also big things. Mental health can substantially contribute to years later with disability.

221
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,920
We'll talk a bit more about this in class, our discussion on Thursday and Friday.

222
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:57,569
But there could potentially be some debate about what we mean by disability and how we quantify that number.

223
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:03,570
And I think it's you know, there are some uncomfortable questions which are being raised like are we treating

224
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:11,010
somebody who has who's who's living in a wheelchair as somewhat less than somebody else?

225
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:23,180
Okay. And then a year of life lost. This is would just be somebody who has died prior to their expected life.

226
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:34,550
Lifespan. Okay. So one of the questions that I asked you was which country has the highest life expectancy and.

227
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:42,709
I see a few different answers and I think there is some clustering around a few different countries.

228
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:50,180
So there's some clustering around Northern Europe, Japan, maybe like the Hong Kong area and Australia.

229
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:57,770
And I will say that those are countries which have very high life spans and generally are pretty similar.

230
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,860
So I think Japan is is the country which, you know, is relatively large,

231
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:08,270
which maybe has like over 10 million people, which has the highest life expectancy.

232
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:16,460
I think it's around like 85, 87. But there are some, you know, smaller countries or smaller territories like Hong Kong,

233
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,709
I think San Marino in Europe, which also have pretty high life expectancy.

234
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:30,770
So but this is all to say that when we calculate DALYs, we need to have like an upper limit of what we think the life expectancy should be.

235
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:38,850
And oftentimes what we think about is just, you know, what is one country which has the or the country which has the highest life expectancy?

236
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:46,190
And oftentimes that's chosen to be Japan. So it's sort of like we we like if somebody dies at 75.

237
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:54,970
In the life expectancy in Japan would be 87 then, you know, the years of of life lost would then be 12.

238
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:01,310
So you can calculate daily just overall for an individual.

239
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:08,860
Um, encompassing like everything that goes on in their life and all of the diseases that they accumulate over time.

240
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,560
You could also just calculate disease specific tallies, and I think that's more often what's done.

241
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,440
So we just calculate out for like everybody in the population.

242
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:21,069
How much time did they have measles and did they died measles?

243
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:28,420
And then we sum that up together to have the amounts of DALYs due to measles within a population.

244
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:39,460
This is how we would integrate those charts that I was talking about and Delhi's so

245
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:46,210
years of life lost are lived with disability that sort of like this upper balance here.

246
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:59,070
Years of life lost are, you know, after somebody died and up to the point of when they would when we would have expected them to live until.

247
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:05,100
So this is how we would sum up a daily for an individual human being.

248
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,900
Okay. I will have you go to poll everywhere.

249
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:18,280
One more time. Give me one second to flip it over to this new.

250
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,950
Okay. So go here again.

251
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,040
I will just give you a minute to complete this and then we will talk to the answers.

252
00:29:36,360 --> 00:30:23,640
If it doesn't show up this summer. It's.

253
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,620
And I'm Sarah. And this is where it's this chronic disease.

254
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:00,800
It should have said cardiovascular disease, but we'll we'll talk about that when we get to.

255
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:47,980
Okay. He. You start presenting and I think it might take some of your quiz, but for the sake of time, let's go over this.

256
00:31:49,220 --> 00:32:00,030
So this chart shows how we can split up DALYs into years of life, living with a disability or years of life lost in years, living with a disability.

257
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,630
And those might have different numbers when you see that kind of like the distribution of things is different.

258
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:17,780
Okay. So if we think about years of life lost in this first column, I do think that the chronic diseases,

259
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:22,430
including these cardiovascular diseases, is is predominantly what we are thinking about.

260
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:32,840
Yep. So that's what you're seeing here. But if we think about the contributions of years lost to disabilities like the second column,

261
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:38,389
it's actually not those chronic diseases and these cardiovascular diseases which are predominantly driving that.

262
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:50,150
It's instead things like musculoskeletal disorders and mental health, which are contributing a lot to years, lived with disability.

263
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:56,510
So I think that's like the benefit of dialysis that incorporates both of these things because if you're just looking at who's dying of disease,

264
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:02,330
then people are really dying of like chronic back pain or something. But that could have a huge impact on their life.

265
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:10,280
And so that's why we want to have something like years living with a disability as a as a quantitative measure of this,

266
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:16,149
as a huge public health problem. So I think you are ranking these in the next one.

267
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:23,450
And I would agree that it's not like super clear on whether musculoskeletal disorders or mental health is is bigger.

268
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,350
But I would say that this is probably a pretty good order of things.

269
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:38,060
Okay. So then the second most common reason behind delays in 2015 would be infectious diseases.

270
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:45,350
So I think you must be able to get that. Any questions on delis?

271
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:49,290
This is something that I want you to be really familiar with in this class.

272
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:59,060
Again, you'll go over this in discussion this week, but a big part of your first assignment will be to.

273
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:09,620
Will be to write a report on one country and to focus on what are the realities that are highly prevalent in that country.

274
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:22,900
So why do delis change over time? Some people have tried to quantify the reasons behind this change.

275
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:30,780
And these people were thinking, you know, there could be reasons like population growth.

276
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:36,280
Obviously, you're going to have more delis as a result of there being more people in the population.

277
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,010
If the population is aging, then there might be a shift in the number of delis.

278
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:49,270
Oftentimes, older people will be more subject to chronic diseases, whereas younger folks are more receptive to infectious diseases.

279
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,240
And then so that's what the blue and the green mean, respectively.

280
00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:05,530
Red means changes in risk factors. For instance, maybe if we put a ban on the sale of tobacco products to minors or have some like sugar tax,

281
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:11,470
that would be that that could result in changes to people's dietary patterns.

282
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,950
This yellowish orange is kind of like they weren't able to quantify why that was the case.

283
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,990
But let's just focus on dailies down here. Um, so among.

284
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:26,549
So anything to the right of this is something which is contributing to a greater number of

285
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,900
Delhi's and things to the left means that it's contributing to a lower number of Delhi's.

286
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:35,399
So what this is saying is that through population growth and through aging of the population,

287
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,820
there's just going to be more disease and more burden of disease in the population.

288
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:46,379
But we're going to have sort of a decrease because of changes in exposure to risk factors.

289
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:54,630
And again, that's probably due to improvements in sanitation or various policies if we think of communicable diseases.

290
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,440
We actually have seen a much greater decline over time.

291
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:03,690
And again, this is between 2006 and 2016. There's been a greater decline in over time.

292
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:10,229
And that's because, you know, actually, as populations age, they're less likely to get a lot of infectious diseases.

293
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,800
So that's actually going to be something which results in a negative contribution.

294
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,360
But with noncommunicable diseases, with many chronic diseases,

295
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:22,380
just because of population aging, there's going to be an increase in the overall burden.

296
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:31,099
And same with injuries. But I mean, I think the the big part of this and we'll talk more about the epidemiological transition later on.

297
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:38,749
But as populations grow and especially as they age, the distribution of diseases will change.

298
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:49,850
And oftentimes, you know, this is in broad strokes. But as populations age, the amount of disease that is linked to infectious diseases decreases,

299
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:57,080
whereas the amount of disease related to non-communicable diseases or chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer that will increase.

300
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:09,709
Okay. So in my mind, burden of disease is something which comprehensively has to do with incidence, prevalence and severity.

301
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:19,910
And I think the Daly is just like this great summary measure of that global burden of disease that could just be kind of this,

302
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:24,290
uh, this idea that like, oh, we're just going to be looking at burden of disease on a global scale.

303
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:31,279
And it could be just this vague term that we use. But oftentimes when we say global burden of disease,

304
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:40,460
we're referring to a particular set of studies which is done in conjunction between the W.H.O. and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation,

305
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:49,369
which is out of the University of Washington. So every every few years they'll release a report like The Global Burden of Disease Study 2017.

306
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:55,040
There's also one done in 2019. Um, I think there has been one done since the pandemic.

307
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:01,460
But we can, you know, we'll have a library and talk with us about this a bit more next week and we can ask her.

308
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,280
But this is great information and I'm sure all of you will be going to this for your first assignment.

309
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,280
Again, the library will talk about it more. But, um, when we say global burden of disease,

310
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,780
that's probably more so referring to like the set of reports which often will show

311
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:22,969
up in The Lancet or like The Lancet public health or the Lancet global health.

312
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:29,690
There's a number of different Lancet journals. Okay.

313
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:35,300
For the rest of the class, I'm just going to be transitioning to talk about global health organizations.

314
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:42,230
And I think that's the way of thinking about this is is where where does the money come from?

315
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:49,919
How is it distributed and where does it go? So money can come from a public sources like governments.

316
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,850
It can also come from private foundations or private individuals.

317
00:38:54,820 --> 00:39:01,830
You know, like you donating in response to like an earthquake in Haiti or something like that, you would be a donor there.

318
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:10,320
But the vast majority of funds in public health come from either from governments, especially high income country governments and private foundations.

319
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:18,500
So those are the donors. The channels are the agencies which distribute that money.

320
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:22,370
So there can be agencies and we'll talk about those. The agencies could be part of the government.

321
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:25,800
So it could the channel could be a governmental organization.

322
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,730
There could also be an NGO. There could be a non-governmental organization which is distributing the money.

323
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:35,450
Multilateral organizations would be something like a development bank.

324
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:43,760
And again, we'll talk about the differences between these in a moment and then who actually is getting the money.

325
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:50,570
Generally, we do not directly give money to individuals, although I'm actually a very big fan of that.

326
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:57,500
And one of the charities that I support is GiveDirectly, which is an organization which will just give funds directly to individuals.

327
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:04,490
But in global health, oftentimes we're, for better or worse, we're talking about giving money to an organization.

328
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,330
An organization does something with that, hopefully to the benefit of people in that local area.

329
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,969
So that could be a government you could give it to. You know, the the earthquake happened.

330
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:23,120
If you do, we give it to the government of Haiti. Do we give it to a local NGO like the local branch of the Red Cross?

331
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:33,080
And, you know, there might be other things which don't fall into that. So the U.N. has a variety of programs.

332
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:42,160
You know, I think for for public health, we might talk about UNICEF, the United Nations child's fund.

333
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:48,470
They do a lot with, like procurement of vaccines and promotion of breastfeeding, things like that.

334
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:54,290
And so the U.N. is is a multilateral organization. And by multilateral, that means it's not just one government.

335
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,750
There's many governments. There's like a multitude of governments which fund the United Nations.

336
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:06,950
So, again, the United Nations is a is a multilateral organization.

337
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:12,590
And so there are funds from the United Nations, and there are also agencies which might distribute those funds.

338
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:23,069
So there are public private partnerships which so this might be what we consider some like private organizations,

339
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:26,520
but private adjacent because they exist across multiple sectors.

340
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:35,130
So the two biggest ones of these are the Global Fund and the GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund.

341
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:41,280
I think the big name for this is the Global Fund to Fight HIV, TB and Malaria.

342
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:48,420
So those are kind of the big three infectious diseases GAVI has to do with the introduction of new vaccines in different countries.

343
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:54,730
So by public private partnerships, this just means that these are, you know,

344
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:59,700
non-governmental organizations, but they receive a lot of money from the public sector.

345
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:08,940
They also receive a lot of money from individuals. So GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, is funded a lot through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

346
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,030
But, you know,

347
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:21,480
like the the downside of having these partnerships or these public private organizations is what is the sustainability of them over time?

348
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:31,799
And and honestly, as Bill and Melinda Gates got divorced, you know that that seemingly is just this one couple's personal issues.

349
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,510
But like it could potentially have huge ramifications for how global health is funded

350
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:42,090
just because the The Gates Foundation has done so much funding of global health work.

351
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:49,800
Okay. Multi-Sector partnerships. Sometimes we say that because maybe there might be a third sector.

352
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:55,230
Oftentimes we think of that as the social sectors like non-governmental organizations or community organizations,

353
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,650
which don't really fall really under this public and private category.

354
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,580
And those ideally are part of this world as well.

355
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:09,540
Okay. So bilateral agencies. So this is a way of distributing money.

356
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:19,020
So most high income countries have some agency in the government which deals with international aid.

357
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,850
In the United States, that's U.S. aid or the United States Agency for International Development.

358
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:29,160
And then they'll spend a lot of money on different programs.

359
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,209
Most of it is not so much research based. It really is its programmatic focus.

360
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:40,230
It's on improving health, improving the environment, access to energy sources, things like that.

361
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:42,630
Um,

362
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:54,360
I did though this year get a grant from U.S. Aid in conjunction with some collaborators in Indonesia to work on promotion of a COVID vaccine booster.

363
00:43:54,370 --> 00:44:01,200
So they do a bit of research funding. But part of that also is just to build up research capacity in other countries.

364
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:11,610
Um, so that is what we have here. You might hear about DFID, the Department for International Development, that's at the U.K. That's another big one.

365
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,690
And of course, you know, again, many other countries have their own examples of that.

366
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:22,889
So the U.S. often works a lot with contractors.

367
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:26,010
So these are NGOs who on the ground will be distributing the money.

368
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,650
And there's a number of reasons for this.

369
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:36,960
One is that the United States government doesn't really like hiring a lot of people for short term positions to do certain things.

370
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:44,250
That's just not how the government works. There's all sorts of laws which which are applied to federal employees.

371
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:52,170
So the U.S. government likes working with contractors because there's a lot more flexibility in hiring them and having limited contracts with them.

372
00:44:53,730 --> 00:45:00,090
So these contractors, I think some big ones in global health would be John Snow.

373
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:08,760
There's also abt your APT Associates, RTI International, FHA 360.

374
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:18,510
Basically, these are nonprofits which will get money from USA to do certain things.

375
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:21,900
They have a contract with U.S. aid to do certain things on the ground in other countries.

376
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:31,780
Okay. So development banks are an example of a multilateral organization.

377
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:45,370
And how development banks work is that countries will buy shares into that bank, and the biggest development bank is the World Bank.

378
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:52,030
So like the United States has, I think, the most shares of any country in the World Bank.

379
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:58,300
So the United States, you know, puts all this money into the World Bank. Other countries, especially other high income countries, do as well.

380
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:05,560
And then the bank will make decisions about loaning that money, lending that money to various countries.

381
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:10,750
So they went to a government and, you know, generally to be a lower middle income country.

382
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:19,750
And, you know, this this will have to do with a wide range of things, you know, improving economic stability of the country.

383
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:26,230
There might be various development projects. It could be improving health infrastructure.

384
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,040
And we'll talk about some criticisms of these these development banks in a moment.

385
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:37,330
But that's how they work. And then theoretically, the United States should be sort of getting that money back in terms of,

386
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:44,020
you know, because the the country which receives the money has to pay back that loan over time.

387
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:51,190
But there can be things called concessional loans, which are the loans which are offered at like a below interest rate.

388
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:57,730
Oftentimes, if you you might hear about like a loan forgiveness programs or sometimes, you know,

389
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:06,579
a bunch of high income countries will come together and sort of forgive a series of loans which have been processed through the World Bank.

390
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:11,680
So things like that happen. So the United States is involved in the World Bank.

391
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,300
It's also involved in the European Bank for Reconstruction Development,

392
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:20,860
the Inter American Development Bank, the African Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

393
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:28,389
And the United States is sort of the. One of the lead countries that deals with this.

394
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:34,080
So a lot of the people who work for these different banks would have substantial ties to the United States.

395
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:44,730
And so, you know, the argument could be that a lot of the decisions that these banks make is sort of dependent on United States policy.

396
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:53,190
There are some banks, banks which have grown not from the United States, but from other sources.

397
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:57,240
I think one of the biggest ones in 2016, I believe China.

398
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:06,120
Founded the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which I guess is I wouldn't say it's a competitor,

399
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,060
but it kind of operates in the same region as the Asian Development Bank.

400
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:15,000
But instead of the U.S. being the leader of it, it's sort of kind of the Chinese government being the leader of it.

401
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:21,960
I think up to this point, it hasn't released as much money as the Asian Development Bank, but certainly it's sort of on the up and up.

402
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:27,709
And it was sort of a bit. I don't want to say controversial, but, you know,

403
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:32,810
it was a decision that the Obama administration made to not join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

404
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:40,329
So I would say, you know, the majority of high income countries, including most of Europe, does is part of this.

405
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:47,890
But the United States decided not to. And I think the idea was that, you know, maybe like China is involved with it somehow and maybe sketchy.

406
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:55,190
And then what? They're pretty much there.

407
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:04,460
Yeah, I think the motivation is twofold. One is it's sort of like this is a way to help other countries and through,

408
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:11,570
you know, like a capitalist society, which most of the world is, we just use banks.

409
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:21,440
So it's a way of like lending money to organizations because, you know, like the US government could just be like here is $10 million.

410
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,670
Um, Namibia this is. And like build your own.

411
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,620
This is a way for you to kind of like improve your health infrastructure,

412
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:36,020
maybe second hand it'll improve us here in the United States through like biosecurity, things like that.

413
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,490
So it's just a way of doing global health aid. But instead of us giving it directly,

414
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:44,700
we are working through a World Bank so that it's kind of like the World Bank

415
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,300
deals with all the processing and then they deal with all the decision making.

416
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,790
And so, you know, even though, you know, maybe American citizens, which who are, you know,

417
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:59,070
on the board of a lot of these decisions, it's not like officially the US government which is making these decisions.

418
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:04,889
So I think, you know, you could think that this is just a way of improving the world and, you know, you're you're part of the bank.

419
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:07,690
So theoretically there should be a benefit.

420
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:15,420
So I would say, like the second hand part of it is there should be a benefit to your country in terms of like when the baby pays back,

421
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:24,030
that $2 million loan bill paid with interest over time. And so you should theoretically be, you know, able to get some of that interest back.

422
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:31,680
Yeah. Which country has contributed the most on, obviously, in terms.

423
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:39,020
Absolutely. I think the United States. But in terms of like a proportion of the population, I don't think it's the United States.

424
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:47,000
I think in general, the countries which contribute the most would be countries in Northern Europe, I think like Norway, Sweden do a lot.

425
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:55,760
I will look up that exact number, but that sounds like a poor percentage of you thinking of the standardize by the population size.

426
00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:04,250
Yeah. Yeah. But what do you use from the World Bank for vaccine development, the distribution of it?

427
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:13,700
I don't know the exact answer, but I would have to think yes. That is a great question, though, that I do not know the exact answer to.

428
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:22,270
I will add experiments to things to find out whether there's another possible motivation for these large countries to buy shares,

429
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,400
maybe like political influence on the world stage.

430
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:29,280
I think that's a great way of putting it. Yes. Yep.

431
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:33,709
And I think one thing that will we'll get into is that this is a way of really influencing

432
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:38,450
policy because it's maybe a bad luck for the United States to go to the BBA and say,

433
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:41,600
here's $10 million, but you need to make some changes to some of your policy.

434
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,460
But if the World Bank says that if the World Bank says, well, Wendy, $10 million,

435
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:57,380
but the strings attached are they you need to make all these changes and pass all these different laws in a way that it's like a bit indirect,

436
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:03,170
but it's not traced directly back to you. But yeah, I think the political influence part is actually probably a very big one.

437
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:11,400
Is anyone like fair game? It's not fair.

438
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:16,400
Yep. So the US will. So this is like one big way of doing it.

439
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:20,399
But for instance, US aid would be a separate way of doing it.

440
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:27,000
So US aid is a way of funneling money to these contractors or to local NGOs?

441
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:34,320
Yep. But where is the world? Whereas the World Bank in these development banks is like a separate pathway.

442
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:45,240
Great questions. Yeah. Okay.

443
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:53,940
Yep. So U.S. is a bilateral agency and by bilateral means.

444
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:56,340
There's like two institutions involved.

445
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:05,520
One is the US government and one is this like local NGO or this local local government, a multilateral organization like the World Bank.

446
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:12,420
That means, like a lot of countries are contributing money and then that organization makes a decision on how to disperse the funds.

447
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,920
Does that make sense? Any other questions?

448
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:30,350
Okay. So this is the question like who are the donors in this is this is development assistance for health.

449
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:33,469
So basically global health funding and this is just standardized to 100%.

450
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:42,410
So it is, you know, numbers hopefully will increase over time. But these are some trends that we've seen in the past 20, 30 years.

451
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:47,850
There were sort of was a period in the nineties where development banks were were much

452
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:54,060
greater as a proportion of their overall overall contributions to global health funding.

453
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:58,860
Probably the big one, which has come out in recent years are public private partnerships.

454
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:05,090
And this really would be like the Gates Foundation, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund.

455
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:09,830
Those are things which didn't exist before. It's sort of like a new category of donor funding.

456
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:19,340
Well, I suppose the Gates Foundation is this more of like an NGO,

457
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:25,400
whereas a public private partnership would be like the Global Fund, the GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance.

458
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:35,120
But you know, that's the question about like the U.S. giving directly through USA that has sort of become

459
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:40,050
like less of a thing over time in terms of the overall proportion of global funding.

460
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:47,600
This is just the different multilateral organizations, the different banks.

461
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:55,990
How much lending do they do? And the biggest one is the World Bank that has hundreds of billions of dollars that it disburses each year.

462
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:03,010
The regional development banks do less. And I think these other development banks this includes like the Asian Infrastructure Bank.

463
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:08,530
Okay.

464
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:15,649
So we're going to transition to talking about is there rights, public health and this will tie back to the World Bank and everything in a moment.

465
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:19,010
But what do we mean by is there right to public health?

466
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:23,989
We can think of health as a public right. And in that way it means that, you know,

467
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:30,020
like people should have like heavily subsidized and and even free health care, especially primary health care.

468
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:34,250
So there's a focus, you know, broadly on having really good primary health care in, you know,

469
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:38,570
in the United States would be thinking about, like O'Briens, pediatricians, family doctors.

470
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:44,600
That's family health care. And this was a huge focus of the Declaration of Alma-Ata in 1978.

471
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:50,870
This is where a lot of people or a lot of countries came together and basically came and said, health is a right.

472
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,670
The United States was not one of the signatories of this declaration. There's also a market based approach.

473
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:59,420
And this is like if you go to a doctor, you should first pay for it.

474
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:05,780
And of course, that's the system we have here in the United States with our private insurance, with co-pays, things like that.

475
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:11,870
This is associated law with neoliberal policies and especially with Thatcher and Reagan in the 1980s.

476
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:17,570
And so there's sort of been like this slingshot back and forth, because in the seventies,

477
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:22,580
there sort of was this groundswell of support of health being a public right.

478
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:30,290
Whereas in the eighties, there was this this reaction and more of a focus on there being a market based approach.

479
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:38,630
And I think the Washington consensus is, I guess, the key words for that stabilize, liberalize, privatize.

480
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:46,280
I think the idea for that is that if countries are especially if some lonely countries just have like really extensive inflation,

481
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,800
if their economy seems to be not under control,

482
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:58,010
the thing you have to do is to like try to control the economy by privatizing different sectors, including health services.

483
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:10,270
Which is all to say. That this this kind of relates in terms of horizontal and vertical programing.

484
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:21,530
So. Horizontal programs would be ones where we want to improve health infrastructure on an on a on a on a large scale.

485
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,240
We want to improve primary health care.

486
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:31,010
And, you know, this would be funding from the United States for the U.S. to kind of like build a network of community health clinics.

487
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:39,880
That would be an example of a horizontal programing package. A vertical program is targeting like a specific disease or maybe like a set of diseases.

488
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:45,799
So, for instance, you could think of GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, as a bit more of a vertical program in that,

489
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:51,230
you know, it'll go into a country and it'll be like, let's introduce hepatitis B into your vaccination program.

490
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:55,459
So it will provide a lot of funding for hepatitis B, but it's not like building community health clinics.

491
00:57:55,460 --> 00:58:00,440
It's not like training new doctors. It's not improving health care infrastructures as a whole.

492
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,830
It's just really focused on that hepatitis B vaccine injection.

493
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:11,370
So this is going to be the focus of the first debate.

494
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:15,239
So I'm not going to talk a lot about this because, you know, one, we're running out of time,

495
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:21,420
but also this is this is something which you're going to be hearing about from debaters in a couple of weeks.

496
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:26,410
But we could think of, you know, there being a bit of a continuum.

497
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:33,850
And between vertical and horizontal programing, kind of like in the middle, you could think of maybe we're not going to fund all primary health care,

498
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:38,320
but maybe we're going to come up with a package of like really cost effective things.

499
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:45,579
And UNICEF came up with this Gobi triple up package, and that stands for Growth Monitoring Oral Rehydration Therapy.

500
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:52,330
This is like for children diarrhea, giving them oral rehydration salts.

501
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:57,610
Breastfeeding in it, promoting breastfeeding. Improving immunization programs.

502
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:00,850
Also promoting family planning.

503
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:06,970
Trying to improve female literacy and doing some nutritional supplementation programs.

504
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:11,020
So this is sort of like these are the the really cost effective things.

505
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:21,010
This is what we can do in our our global health aid programs, which maybe isn't like totally saying there's free primary health care,

506
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:27,730
but for like the big reasons why people might or by why infants might get sick, this is something that we can do.

507
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:33,209
Okay. But again, there's sort of been like this, this change over time.

508
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:41,820
And what we're thinking about, I would say like the primary health care that really arose as a big push in the sixties and seventies.

509
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:48,150
Um, but then there sort of was this, this backlash as is thought that was like socialist and communist.

510
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:55,320
Um, so the UNICEF sort of, they have this compromise, um, of, of just like having a select.

511
00:59:56,590 --> 01:00:00,490
Primary health care package that it was supporting, especially in the eighties and nineties.

512
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:10,870
Any of that was potentially a bit in in contrast to a lot of the World Bank,

513
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:16,659
which again, is predominantly run by or historically has probably been run by Americans.

514
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:21,190
So, you know, especially during the Reagan and Thatcher and after,

515
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:25,960
there's sort of was this consensus at World Bank to promote these vertical programs.

516
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:30,300
But beyond that, you know, like to get money from the World Bank,

517
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:34,629
what countries would have to do is they'd have to promise to privatize some of their health services.

518
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:39,430
You know, there were many countries in Africa which were offering a lot of primary health care for free.

519
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:43,990
But then some, you know, bankers at the World Bank were saying, you know,

520
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:49,510
your economy is sort of in shambles and you can't have free primary health care.

521
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:55,540
You need to require people to pay money for them to see a doctor.

522
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:02,920
And in a way that kind of devastated a lot of countries in terms of their their health care systems.

523
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:10,930
But it was something that was just required by the World Bank. So thinking about like political influence, this might be a way for, you know,

524
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:18,790
people in the United States with potentially a bit more conservative leanings to advocate for a certain set of policies.

525
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:27,800
This has potentially led to some fragmentation in global health in the sense that, you know, it isn't just.

526
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:38,910
A local government which is dealing with global health. It is there and goes there, which can be funded through a number of different organizations.

527
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:44,400
This results in fragmentation and results in proliferation.

528
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:48,270
A lot of global health actors. The different organizations might have divergent interests.

529
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:52,870
You could think of, you know, which organizations would support abortion or which ones would not.

530
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:59,040
That's just like a simplified example, but probably a highly political one.

531
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:06,800
You could think of power relations like, is this something which people on the ground who are from a local country,

532
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:13,710
do they have a lot of say in the decision making? And how can there be accountability if there's so many different actors?

533
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:25,100
Okay. So I realize we have so little time left over, but I do want you to try to help me fill this out in the last few minutes of class.

534
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:30,749
So what will happen is that you will all I'll explain this breakout.

535
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:38,130
I'll have you work on it. We probably won't have time to talk about it, but I will snap some pictures and then we'll take this up on Wednesday.

536
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:47,829
So. Let's say we have a certain pot of money here in the United States,

537
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:54,880
and maybe we could just think where we're going, sending this money through USA to a contractor like John Snow.

538
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:03,790
Or so, that'd be like an NGO. Or we could think about sending that money to a local government.

539
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:13,750
Who do you think would be better at it? And specifically, I want you to think about like, what are some of the benefits of doing certain things?

540
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,410
And let's think of two different programs that we could do. We could do a deworming program.

541
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:24,370
So amongst yourselves in your groups, think about what are some benefits of a vertical program like this is a deworming campaign.

542
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:31,310
You're trying to get parasites out of children. What would be the benefit of using a local NGO?

543
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:33,710
What would be the benefit of using a local government?

544
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:40,400
And I guess the NGO was also thinking that there would probably be maybe a bit more involvement people from the United States,

545
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:44,330
whereas with the local government, of course, it's going to be more local government officials who are doing it.

546
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:51,530
So if we had a vertical program, a deworming program, what are the benefits of using a local NGO?

547
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:54,740
What are the benefits of using a local like the local government officials?

548
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,700
So that's a vertical program with a horizontal program.

549
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:05,500
Let's think about maybe we're trying to build a community health clinic.

550
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:10,070
What would be the benefit of going through local government would be an idea of growing things here.

551
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:16,100
So again, maybe discuss amongst yourselves for a couple of minutes and then I would love for you to write on the board.

552
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:42,730
Listen to some thoughts. Yes.

553
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:29,480
I guess. No.

554
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:59,640
You. I.

555
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:34,570
I. Only a couple of minutes left.

556
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:37,810
So this could be a great time to come up and start writing down some of your thoughts.

557
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:36,150
Now. I think.

558
01:07:43,810 --> 01:08:03,280
Just. I.

559
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:18,119
Okay. We are getting close to 550, so yeah.

560
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:26,340
Please have somebody from the group just write something even if it's very brief, but then feel free to leave and I will see you on Wednesday.
