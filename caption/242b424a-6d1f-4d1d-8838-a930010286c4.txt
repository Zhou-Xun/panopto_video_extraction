1
00:00:05,903 --> 00:00:11,240
Now being aware of culture isn't
always about finding problems.

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,070
I wanna be clear that being aware of
culture is also a really positive thing.

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,480
It can help you be more effective.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,440
When you're aware of cultural issues,

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,710
you can increase the perceived
relevance of your communications.

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,780
You can decrease people's resistance
to the messages that you're

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,440
trying to get across.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,620
And you can enable people to see how
your message fits into their situation.

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:37,960
The idea here is that being
aware of cultural context, and

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,290
issues, and
language can enable you to target or

11
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,550
even tailor your message to
the audience in important ways.

12
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,370
So what do I mean by tailoring?

13
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,700
So tailoring is any
combination of information or

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:57,820
change strategies that are intended
to reach one specific person,

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,070
based upon characteristics that
are unique to that person, related

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,670
to the outcome of interest, and have been
derived from an individual assessment.

17
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,050
That's what makes it different from
targeting, which is about groups.

18
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,540
So what do I mean by tailoring a message?

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,190
So here's two examples of tailoring

20
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,780
an intervention about eating fruits and
vegetables.

21
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,610
On the left, you see a cover page of a
brochure on the Eat for Life intervention.

22
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,940
It talks about the power of healthy
eating, and that's a broad idea.

23
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:35,740
It's not particularly associated with
any one culture, just eating healthy.

24
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,310
On the right, though, you see

25
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,610
the same page re-framed to
Getting Back to Our Roots.

26
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,220
Now this intervention was targeted for
African Americans.

27
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,500
And that Getting Back to Our Roots,
you see a change in colors and patterns.

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,320
You see a change in which fruits and
vegetables are being shown in the picture.

29
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,810
Those subtle changes, when done based upon
what somebody knew specifically about

30
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:10,230
this individual person, was designed to
help this intervention align to them,

31
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,150
to be tailored to their particular framing
of their African American identity.

32
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,702
And the idea of tailoring is that,
when you do that,

33
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:22,090
it connects to the person and
you're more likely to be effective.

34
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,380
Here's another example
of cultural tailoring.

35
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,420
This is from a study that looked at
the efficacy of culturally-specific

36
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,640
cognitive behavioral therapy for
smoking cessation for African Americans.

37
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,130
Now what they did, cognitive behavioral
therapy is a standard therapeutic approach

38
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,440
that can be used for something
like to support smoking cessation.

39
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,360
But the intervention tested
culturally-tailored topics.

40
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,480
So there were specific
intervention pieces related to

41
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,320
stressors unique to African Americans
that might drive those people to smoke.

42
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,270
Traditional African American values, and

43
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,350
how those relate to smoking or
quitting smoking.

44
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,650
Spirituality and religion in the African
American community, as related to smoking.

45
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,470
And the cultural tailoring here
enabled this intervention to be more

46
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:17,140
effective than just a standard
therapeutic approach.

47
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,430
Learning how the cultural background
of your audience makes you better.

48
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,400
It makes you better in a variety of ways.

49
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,336
And I wanna be really clear here, this is
true regardless of whether the relevant

50
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:34,540
culture is scientists in different fields,
policy-makers,

51
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,410
of field worker versus academics and
scientists.

52
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,985
People who come from
a particular geographic region,

53
00:03:40,985 --> 00:03:46,890
from a particular language, ethnic
heritage, or religious belief structure.

54
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:53,650
Anything else that influences how they see
the world and communicate with others.

55
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,922
Again, the common theme
here is don't assume.

56
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:03,000
Learn, and when you learn
about the cultural components,

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,330
the context of your target audience,
that isn't just about avoiding problems.

58
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:14,754
It also enables you to potentially
tailor your message to make it better.
