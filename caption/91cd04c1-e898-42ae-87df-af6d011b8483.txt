00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,555
Welcome back to nutrition 590.

2
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:14,460
By now, you're beginning to

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,740
realize there are
many different types

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,450
of epigenetic phenomena that are

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,860
happening to the
DNA in our cells.

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,260
Some happened early in

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,185
our lives and some are
still happening right now.

8
00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:27,150
To get us all on the same page,

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,209
let's understand the original
and modern-day definitions

10
00:00:30,209 --> 00:00:31,425
of epigenetics,

11
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:33,810
and the molecular
switches and markers that

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,300
make up the epigenomic
instruction book.

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,310
The learning objectives
of this module include,

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,085
first, defining epigenetics.

15
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,050
Second, we will describe

16
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,825
key epigenetic mechanisms
and phenomena,

17
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:52,310
including DNA methylation
and his-tone modifications.

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,290
Third, we will begin to

19
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,710
understand two key
epigenetic phenomena.

20
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,185
These are X-inactivation
and genomic imprinting.

21
00:01:02,185 --> 00:01:06,155
First, I'd like to introduce
you to Conrad Waddington,

22
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:08,900
who used the epigenetic
landscape as

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,310
a metaphor for how

24
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,305
gene regulation
determines development.

25
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:15,530
One is asked to
imagine a number of

26
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,545
marbles rolling down a
hill towards a wall.

27
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:22,540
The marbles represent a
totipotent stem cells state.

28
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,340
The marbles will compete
for different grooves on

29
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,505
the slope and come to rest
at the lowest points.

30
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,340
This represents a
differentiated cell type

31
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,270
such as a lung cell
or a liver cell.

32
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,130
These eventual cell fates or

33
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,125
tissue types have acquired

34
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,770
epigenetic mechanisms
along the way.

35
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,800
In order to roll back up
the hill, for example,

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,450
you would have to erase all of

37
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,580
these epigenetic marks and

38
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,915
reprogram yourself into
a different tissue type.

39
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:55,205
Over the last 20 years,

40
00:01:55,205 --> 00:01:57,320
as epigenetics has invaded

41
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,385
our public health and
molecular biology science.

42
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:04,490
It is also not
surprising that it has

43
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,110
played a starring role in

44
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,285
different popular culture media,

45
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:10,340
including starring role in

46
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,265
Michael Crichton's
last book called Next.

47
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:15,875
In this chapter,
Professor Garfield

48
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,055
is testifying before Congress.

49
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,600
He's saying, ''It's
not surprising that

50
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,400
researchers are
moving towards what

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,410
we call epigenetic studies,

52
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,470
which look at exactly
how genes interact with

53
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,670
the environment to produce
the individual we see.

54
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,665
This is an extremely
active area of research.''

55
00:02:33,665 --> 00:02:36,020
He goes on to talk
about and explains

56
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,570
all the details and
intricacies all the time

57
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,120
while the congressional aids

58
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,650
began to get on their
cell phones and

59
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,099
the congressmen begin to
wander in their attention,

60
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,780
which I hope isn't
a premonition for

61
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,350
what's happening as
you watch this video.

62
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,100
As we begin to think about

63
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,695
the modern definitions
of epigenetics,

64
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:57,425
we have two closely
related meanings.

65
00:02:57,425 --> 00:03:00,650
The first is the study
of the processes

66
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,520
involved in the unfolding
developments of an organism.

67
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,560
This includes phenomena such as

68
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,025
X-inactivation in
mammalian females,

69
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:12,800
as well as gene silencing
within an organism,

70
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,890
which is also called
genomic imprinting.

71
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,275
The second definition here,

72
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:19,805
which is a bit simpler,

73
00:03:19,805 --> 00:03:23,540
is epigenetics is the
study of heritable yet

74
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,630
potentially reversible
changes in gene function

75
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,075
that occur without a change
in the DNA sequence itself.

76
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:33,195
Here's how it works.

77
00:03:33,195 --> 00:03:35,720
The epigenome is
comprised of a series of

78
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,400
switches and markers that help

79
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,455
control our gene regulation.

80
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:42,485
The first switch is
called DNA methylation,

81
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:45,170
where a quartet of atoms
called a methyl group

82
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,535
attaches to DNA and
shuts genes down.

83
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:51,590
It's a little like a
dimmer on a light switch.

84
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,710
Without DNA methylation,
genes can be brightly

85
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,840
expressed to create
an environment

86
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,495
suited for reading or working.

87
00:03:59,495 --> 00:04:02,240
But with a gain of
DNA methylation,

88
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,860
a gene will be dialed down to

89
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,150
say the level of
romantic candlelight.

90
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,780
Other epigenetic markers
called histone proteins help

91
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,330
compact DNA into the nucleus by

92
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,905
wrapping it around little
spools called nucleosomes.

93
00:04:17,905 --> 00:04:21,095
In this case, DNA is suppressed,

94
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:24,580
but it's still poised
for action if desired.

95
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,860
The first of two epigenetic
phenomena that I'd like to

96
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,025
introduce to you today
includes the calico cat,

97
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:33,035
which has the traditional
tortoise shell

98
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:34,820
and white coat coloring.

99
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,344
This is an example of an
epigenetic phenomenon.

100
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:41,149
This cat, which is always female,

101
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:45,980
has an X chromosome with a
gene for a black coat color,

102
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,230
and a second X chromosome with

103
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,115
a gene specifying
orange coat color.

104
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:54,380
Differentially colored
patches result because of

105
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,590
clonal X-inactivation via
epigenetic mechanisms.

106
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,200
Here you can see that

107
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,990
X-inactivation is the
process by which one of

108
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,090
the copies of the X chromosome is

109
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,595
inactivated in female mammals.

110
00:05:07,595 --> 00:05:10,550
The inactive X is silenced by

111
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,020
packaging in such a way

112
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,075
that is transcriptionally
inactive,

113
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:16,490
and this is called
heterochromatin.

114
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,040
In the cartoon of the
chromosome that you see at

115
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,380
the bottom of the slide shows

116
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,840
different key
epigenetic mechanisms

117
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,380
that occur on the inactive X.

118
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,250
First, there's a change to

119
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,610
those histone modifications
that I introduced such that

120
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,920
you can see that these
histone proteins can

121
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,845
gain methylation
at certain places,

122
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:40,285
such as histone 3 lysine 27.

123
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:45,245
The same histones can also
lose acetylation marks.

124
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,970
This makes the chromatin or

125
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,095
the genes compact
inside our nucleus.

126
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:52,940
The third epigenetic
phenomena that

127
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,015
occurs is an increase
in DNA methylation,

128
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:57,530
so the genes on

129
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,690
the inactive X chromosome
are not expressed.

130
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,700
The second epigenetic
phenomena I'd like to

131
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,335
introduce to you today
is genomic imprinting.

132
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,130
The example that we'll look at

133
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,870
is the Dutch Hunger Winter,

134
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,120
which occurred at the
end of World War II,

135
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,660
in the winter of 1944-1945,

136
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,960
when due to a Dutch
railway workers strike,

137
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,510
there was complete elimination of

138
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,380
the food supply in
and out of the city.

139
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,195
Therefore, individuals
were severely

140
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:31,895
nutritionally deprived
during these few months,

141
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:34,685
which you can see at the
bottom of the graph there,

142
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,780
which is showing the amount
of calories consumed.

143
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,390
What scientists
did 60 years later

144
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,100
after this Hunger Winter,

145
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,455
was they identified individuals

146
00:06:45,455 --> 00:06:47,870
who were conceived
during the famine,

147
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,475
and they measured DNA
methylation in their blood.

148
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:55,220
Of complete surprise,
even after 60 years,

149
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,990
they saw decreases in

150
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,115
DNA methylation at genes which
are genomically imprinted.

151
00:07:01,115 --> 00:07:02,900
These are genes which
are particularly

152
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,700
important for growth
and development.

153
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,435
Genomic imprinting is
a relatively rare form

154
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:13,190
of gene regulation in

155
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,650
which there is a
preferential expression of

156
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,645
a gene in a mono-allelic

157
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,765
parent-of-origin
dependent manner.

158
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:21,920
What this means is that one of

159
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,185
the two copies of our genes is

160
00:07:24,185 --> 00:07:26,510
epigenetically silenced due to

161
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,145
either DNA methylation
and histone modification.

162
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:32,495
The functionally haploid state

163
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:36,095
eliminates our protection from
being a diploid organism.

164
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:38,480
So it's somewhat confusing
why we would have

165
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,525
evolved such a form
of gene regulation.

166
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:42,830
We will discuss this in

167
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,485
a bit more detail in
a future lecture.

168
00:07:45,485 --> 00:07:48,200
But one of the things that
is really important is that

169
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,305
these genes are important
for growth and development.

170
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,795
So in the case of the
Dutch Winter famine,

171
00:07:53,795 --> 00:07:57,530
individuals who were
exposed to the famine in

172
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,240
utero during the time of

173
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,190
conception are more likely

174
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,020
to have diseases later in life,

175
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,275
including metabolic syndrome,
cardiovascular disease,

176
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:09,088
and type 2 diabetes.
