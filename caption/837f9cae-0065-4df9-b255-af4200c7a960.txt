1
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,330
Okay. Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,220
And. Ooh.

3
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:47,670
Oh. I don't know whether we should wait for minutes.

4
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,610
So maybe like, let's see. Do you have any questions for me?

5
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:15,450
They just told us that because it's like there is this wonderful progressive inclusion in the United States, he said.

6
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,680
It's so much more isolated without the white.

7
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:34,700
There is no way to know. So why?

8
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:45,420
So basically when that is really it's going to go really slow.

9
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,140
The vibe online is going to be Anger Center City.

10
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,230
Do you? You can beat that. But there is no big enough plan.

11
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:01,830
There's no giving up here. So I hope we can hope that. I mean, look, I'm saying don't quote me.

12
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:15,990
There is no interest there. So there is no sort of adjustment for the the English line going to anything other than zero.

13
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:25,230
So that's why. It was stylish and wired square and made me look the other way.

14
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:36,450
That you think someone moves yourself is go to the wall, do the well, do the expression for.

15
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,180
Is this what you've been doing some more doing?

16
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:51,120
S When you were kind of writing the SS This is this guy on or so of the matrix.

17
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,760
So there is no no of that.

18
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:05,509
It's basically white crime. Why there is this his face, like Brian is indicative of the outcomes.

19
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:13,520
Black and white. That's what this is. And the decisions that we.

20
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,770
I'm doing office hours make. You start like.

21
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:34,410
So you like sort of books that make this. Through that by.

22
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,780
But conceptually, that's what he's doing. It is.

23
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:47,470
It's very difficult to go. Any other questions?

24
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,470
Yes. Kelly.

25
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,360
It's been a while on phone. Me? Yes.

26
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:10,630
Again, I guess it's been conceptually, but we will find a stoppable form but mode in in the fleeing workshop.

27
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:20,909
And we we are, you know, watching the game and yet don't know what long diagnostics that phone thing effectively means they put on if

28
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:29,300
they're up to obedience like or maybe keeping the things like obviously there is one primary predictor of

29
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:43,200
this and and that effect of the primary predictors of interest on outcome death by some from a food model

30
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:50,010
from I have tested one is what we call the uninterested to to the effect of the predicted on the outcome.

31
00:04:50,790 --> 00:05:03,900
But there will be a hard people and then maybe a hard or maybe such variables such that when you add just for that variable in the model,

32
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:16,020
the association between your primary predictor of the interest and the outcome that is affected in some way.

33
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:33,839
Now when I say affected, I mean that the coefficient estimate could change the sign for the the coefficient would change so it would be there.

34
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,250
I think the strength of the association or to the affect the,

35
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:54,599
the direction of the association and like how do you these and sort of like maybe and going ahead and and of talking more if they're confusing,

36
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:03,960
then I'll stop. But the way to assess confounding is that unfortunately there is no formal hypothesis test for quality.

37
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,979
The way you assess one for me is to think that the a model with only the predictor

38
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:17,940
of interest and then in speech and other model that say that hard variable Z,

39
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:27,710
I will look at the change in the estimates for that coefficient associated with that.

40
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:34,110
The primary predictor of the best. You look at the change going from the food to the adjusted.

41
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,559
And he quickly made kind of the rule of thumb that MATTHEWS is,

42
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:48,320
instead of more than 10% cheaper and more efficient, going from the food volume to that.

43
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:57,890
So that's that's what confounding means and not that gone from being an interaction of and

44
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:04,550
maybe this is why we come back to our interaction on farming and interaction not the same.

45
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,030
And epidemiology. I know some of you here are taking it.

46
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,240
EPI. Uh, in every interaction effect modification.

47
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:25,940
So effective modification is or indirectly even stronger than confounding.

48
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:37,160
Basically it's saying that how that how the predictor of interest affects outcome actually depends on the level of this part variable.

49
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:47,990
So a variable can be a common funder and not doesn't necessarily have to be an effect modifier.

50
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,380
So if anything,

51
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:09,280
it modification is stronger because it seems like not only does it affect it sort of get fixed in a way that depending on the value of that,

52
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:17,150
the third variable, the association between the primary predictor of X and Y changes.

53
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,640
Does that make sense? They didn't answer the question.

54
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:34,120
So some of the things that I said we don't have, there is no hypothesis test for confounding.

55
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:42,730
But this is how he says those are all things that we will be discussing in module here, but that's the conceptual framework.

56
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:56,050
And if a quantification is I know several of you on this side, you are taking AP, so you probably heard this, but statistically what that means,

57
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:06,050
if it quantification is basically the interaction framework and index for effect modification based on means test for feedback.

58
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,720
Okay. Because that was one.

59
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:29,430
He was. One of the.

60
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:44,080
G. G. Question. And what's driving the need to see the differences between use industry models for.

61
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,980
Each category is proteins and.

62
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:57,910
Eight. Categorical modeling is a continuous variable and he was trying to explain those using that and coming to see.

63
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,530
You can see the difference between the three of them.

64
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:12,740
But we haven't seen you haven't seen gone home you wouldn't need the the concept of one phone need to solve that question.

65
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,610
So it was correct. So you are talking about question, right?

66
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:26,350
Yes. On the work where we ask people. So I have also looked at assigning scores and then running them on be one.

67
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,560
Yeah. So you need one funding concept there.

68
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,770
But and I'm still glad you asked then. I mean, does that help?

69
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:47,780
No, I. But I also had the idea that 10% will for on funding.

70
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,320
And so if I don't see that difference.

71
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:07,649
Yeah. Yeah, but, but, but, you know, kind of like you are the victim person who like mentioned because that's what they talk

72
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:16,860
about but I don't think you necessarily need that the wants subtle ones that to that's.

73
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,800
Okay. That helps that it's okay.

74
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:29,140
Yeah. And it was very different from what it was painted into.

75
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:37,860
Okay. Okay. So. So would it help if I would get an announcement on campus?

76
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,980
I mean, I don't know. Is that the agenda? Yeah.

77
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:50,220
Yeah. That's why I'm saying you don't need the confounding concept.

78
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:56,460
There's nothing that big. You can use the concept of confounding.

79
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,340
So I, I'm. I'm, I'm sorry to get confused with that.

80
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:10,820
Um, so is that, as you said, a general sort of feeling of a sense that,

81
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:18,390
that you bought and you were confused because you were told to argue from time quality?

82
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:24,879
Is it? No. The reason I'm asking is because, again,

83
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:33,740
a confusion I will put up again the thing that you don't need control from the answer to that question and I'm sorry,

84
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:41,940
people are confused, but if it's not, then I don't want to confuse people for third by being that announcement.

85
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,290
So bottom line is, you don't need to argue with someone you know.

86
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,750
Any comments? Okay.

87
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:13,630
So let's continue our discussion about interaction from where we let anybody has other questions about interaction.

88
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:25,800
Okay. So. So we are going to talk about now.

89
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:41,530
And in the interaction between categorical and continuous the and the reason why we we kind of choose to sort of talk about the interaction

90
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:52,720
between a categorical and a continuous variable is because the framework allows us to sort of understand things in a much simplified way,

91
00:13:53,530 --> 00:14:01,330
rather than if we were talking about interactions between what to do with and continuous variable, you'll see why.

92
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:09,610
So here's an example a pediatric hypertension study where a clinician wishes to examine

93
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:15,040
the relationship between systolic blood pressure and for various age and gender.

94
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:22,840
Okay, so we have to pull variables age and gender.

95
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:38,479
And so SBP is the outcome and we have this group over its agenda and the questions of

96
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:47,660
interest are for males and females of the same age is is BP different on average.

97
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:59,420
Number one. Number two is is the gender reflect on is BP independent of age?

98
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,900
Number three does mean is BP change with age.

99
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:15,610
And number four, is that age effect on SBP the same for males and females?

100
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,880
These statements are these questions one more time.

101
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:35,250
And can you tell me which one of these is clearly an interaction question asking about the interaction?

102
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,660
Last month. The last question for sure.

103
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:59,440
Okay. What about anybody else? So begin the second question.

104
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,360
Okay. So I'm going to put votes for food. One vote for here.

105
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,450
One vote for the second one.

106
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:12,480
The second one to vote for this one. Three votes for this one.

107
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,240
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13.

108
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,600
And I lived Brooklyn walks in 14 and in all 14.

109
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:35,610
What's. And you are free to choose any of the other two as well.

110
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:45,070
You can cancel. Let's definitely get get get here.

111
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:58,770
Everyone's voice on this one. And you can go twice again if you both of them are.

112
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,040
So you want to gas your book for the two of you.

113
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,079
Huh? Yes. I didn't hear her.

114
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:18,410
Also looking for book. Okay. So does one vote here.

115
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:24,320
Sophia's and Sophia. Sophie are going to be Sophia.

116
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,860
Okay. And then 244 here.

117
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:49,150
Let's talk about that later. Yeah. No one wants.

118
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,620
Second one. I, I, I try not to ask.

119
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,209
In the last year did you write down but I also wanted to say no, you did not say that.

120
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:08,500
But I'm going to put your book because it can. But no, but I thought you what I thought of the idea was that we all did y yeah.

121
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:14,620
Yeah, I should have put that, but I collected votes for, you know, so.

122
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,160
And Caitlyn means the second one. Anybody else?

123
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:30,080
Hmm. The last one. Okay. Yes.

124
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,240
I would go for both. Yeah.

125
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:40,590
Okay. Anybody else.

126
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:56,650
Second one. Okay. Couple more votes from this, so.

127
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:03,040
Oh, well, what about you? Last one.

128
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:16,040
I'll get. Second.

129
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:35,940
Did they leave anyone out? Hmm.

130
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,040
Why is everybody not happy? Oh, yeah.

131
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:52,259
Is age appropriate for gender? Eric.

132
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:58,170
Monica Okay. So we'll talk about that. So.

133
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:09,810
Okay. So I think I think like there's a slight sort of preference for the second one.

134
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:21,240
And but there is also, you know, preference for the last one, but maybe the second one US by a smaller margin.

135
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,720
I am not counting clearly by the. Okay.

136
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:36,960
So now clearly these two are not right because they are essentially asking about

137
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:44,170
the third question is asking about association between SBP and age birthweight.

138
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:54,060
So gender doesn't even come into the picture. The first question is, again, as it's an adjusted effect.

139
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,100
Right. So it's between the second and the fourth?

140
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:06,300
I would argue the second one is a much clearer question about interaction.

141
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:13,200
So it's essentially is the gender effect on SBP independent of age.

142
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:22,710
So this is my outcome. This is one covariate and this is another covariate.

143
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:40,340
And basically every qualification is about is the effect of one will vary it on the outcome independent of the other covidiot.

144
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:47,190
So the second one is a much like direct to your question about the direction.

145
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:56,340
The reason why several of you still picked for is it's kind of giving that sense without being so direct.

146
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:02,729
That is the effect on SBP, the same for news and females.

147
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:08,129
If it did not ask like whether it's the same for males and females, then you know,

148
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:14,670
it would be a no brainer that it's that it's not a direction question, but because it's asking, well, you know,

149
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:24,420
and that's the advantage of having a look at people people want to know 48 when were talking about interaction because you can fix

150
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:32,990
the lens of the capital because already and you can see like the East Association between the continuous people and the outcome,

151
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,140
is it the same for all the levels of the capital, etc.

152
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,459
That's what the fourth question is is asking.

153
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,820
So so yes, it is sort of it is a little like referring to direct.

154
00:22:46,830 --> 00:23:01,620
So in a sense, but I would argue so, you know, for folks who voted for war now but had a had a preference for the second one is like me, you know,

155
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:14,100
it's basically like the second one is a much needed question about interaction, although the fourth one also is referring to interaction.

156
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:25,469
And the reason why you can interpret that is because of the fact that, you know, the third variable now gender is categorical and you can say, okay,

157
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:31,320
for the association between the continuous and the outcome, continuous variable and outcome,

158
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,459
is it same for all the levels of the categorical variable.

159
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,650
And that's for the fourth question. Yeah.

160
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:55,200
So, so that, so they know now that we all understand what interaction means, let's now go in a kind of like, you know what, see this model.

161
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:08,819
So the main effects model is and this is main effects only of both is that the SBP equal to wait an

162
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:18,240
hour plus beta one eight plus beta 2ff is the indicator variable for or dummy variable for gender.

163
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:33,000
And if gets the value one, if a subject is female and is zero, if the subject is male, get classic Selena.

164
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,860
So that's the model. So let's now look at the interpretation of the parameters.

165
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:55,110
What if we cannot be done up is again middle name is not necessarily meaningful barometer here is it's the average SBP for females of age zero.

166
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,760
So that's the interpretation of the intercept in this model.

167
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:07,620
Again, not a meaningful interpretation, but we kind of deal with that later.

168
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,650
What is beta one on?

169
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:32,640
As you can see, you can write it either as okay, what is the effect of of each on systolic blood pressure where the gender is held constant.

170
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,290
That's the interpretation.

171
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:43,770
And you can write that when gender is held constant either in terms of when we're looking at females or when we're looking at males, right?

172
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:58,290
So basically you can write it as the x, the mean systolic blood pressure for females and with, you know, with the age difference of one year.

173
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:13,110
So this is females females and the age difference between these two are need to of one year in it.

174
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:24,450
So either of these two statements is referring to gender held constant.

175
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,720
Similarly, you can also talk about mayors.

176
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:42,060
So F is equal to zero and it's the mean difference in systolic blood pressure between two means with the age difference of one.

177
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:48,030
Right? So that's the definition of beta one.

178
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:54,210
What is better to beta two is the gender effect.

179
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,850
So holding it constant meaning keeping.

180
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:10,020
The age value three step e e capital equal to smaller.

181
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:18,260
What is the difference in mean is BP between females and males?

182
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:28,610
I see some some frowns means if it's if there's any confusion, let's clear it now,

183
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:36,800
because the next model that I'm going to go in is I'm going to add the interaction term and we'll see how things change.

184
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,569
So everybody's clear on this. Okay.

185
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:47,900
So now let's go to the model with interaction.

186
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,980
So in fact, I'm going to draw a picture that might help.

187
00:27:53,540 --> 00:28:02,330
So the mean if it's only model mean if it's only I should say model implies the following relationship.

188
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:10,700
So if. If. Then it.

189
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:18,690
Yeah, that is right. He's an.

190
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:24,410
Male and female. Yes. And the method now is for males.

191
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,440
We've beat them on all of them up for males.

192
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,709
Well, it's you know, it's it's for me, it's.

193
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:38,210
We did zero. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

194
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:47,860
So now let's look at let's look at this model graphically.

195
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:58,160
So can you can I write this model graphically and and see what's going on?

196
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:06,050
So if I write once again to my advantage, gender is getting a little bit too level.

197
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,420
So let's write the model here. I'm going to write it in blue.

198
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:18,590
Let's write the model for females. For females.

199
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:27,860
What is the model? I'm just going to write that as b b equal to beta.

200
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:35,900
No last detail on each class.

201
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:39,470
Beta 2% seem.

202
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:47,439
Yes. And what about for females? So I should say females.

203
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:56,840
And for that and for males, it is be be equal to baby or not.

204
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:07,330
Plus people on its last beta two times if indicator for females so that drops off for males.

205
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:13,720
Plus it's Illinois. Okay.

206
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:17,110
So now for 5 minutes, you collect the terms.

207
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:27,390
Mm hmm. What is the intercept of this line for females?

208
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:34,440
It's better, not better to. And what is the slope.

209
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:40,080
For females is beta one for me is what is the intercept?

210
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,390
It's beta not what is the slope?

211
00:30:43,920 --> 00:31:00,390
It's still better one. So can I see that for a mean if it's only model, the lines for news and theme is had the same slope but different intercepts.

212
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:12,530
Yes. So pictorially I can represent this as here is it.

213
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,879
Here is SBP. Let's see.

214
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,550
Here is the line for females.

215
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:32,670
That is the line for males. And this is so beta, not blood.

216
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:36,780
Beta two is I should have drawn with different colors.

217
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:43,120
Beta not plus beta two is the is the intercept for females.

218
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:50,580
So here is beta not closed beta two and here is beta not.

219
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:18,680
In the way we move my y axis did.

220
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:43,470
Okay. And and the other thing that I want to point out is basically this Globes are the same means walk the slope.

221
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,950
So this is this slope is based one.

222
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:09,450
But what lines? And if you, you know, think about the slope, it's the data thing.

223
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,770
Right? So this is the dawn of this new book, the one.

224
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:23,320
Slopes of two lines mean the same means what? That the two lines are.

225
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:37,240
BABYLON And what is happening here is that if you look at Amy, so let's see, here is A1, here is A2.

226
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:45,070
Yeah, it is. If we look at the corresponding mean is BP for males and females,

227
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:58,220
the difference between these two lines at any age is gonna stand and that difference is equal to BW.

228
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:16,880
I this. So this distance is greater to this distance is greater to one.

229
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:55,340
So the two lines have the same slope, but different intercepts, meaning in a mean a fixed model where you have one categorical permitted,

230
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,360
one continuous variable, you can see that the two lines that Batman.

231
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:10,370
The main takeaway message is there is no interaction in this model between age and gender with respect to SBP.

232
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:19,160
So the the the relationship, if you sort of graphically present it, it prevents people.

233
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,700
It is the same for me.

234
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:34,470
Same thing with the associations. Okay said in another way I'm trying to say this in many different ways.

235
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:45,480
And the city in another way, like this constant separation of the two units at any age value is saying that doesn't matter what age.

236
00:35:45,720 --> 00:36:02,970
So irrespective of age, the relationship between us and gender is going to be the same.

237
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,680
Or say it in another way, irrespective of gender.

238
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:15,200
The relationship between is between needs is the same.

239
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,800
Okay. Now what happens when we have interaction?

240
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,450
So we have this model as we speak, but we cannot,

241
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:39,060
as we go on age plus be attached to the dummy variable indicator variables for gender very female stakes the value one and males are zero null.

242
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:53,250
We also have beta three I times if I which is essentially the interaction between age and gender.

243
00:36:54,670 --> 00:37:00,959
Yeah. So let me just couple other notes here because I usually upload these.

244
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:11,090
So these are parallel lines. Seems slow.

245
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:26,550
Different engenders. Okay.

246
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:34,920
And as as I mentioned, at any age, basically and the relationship,

247
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:44,700
there's a constant separation between the lines for males and females and that constant separation is equal to the to book.

248
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,740
So now in the interaction model. So here is the interaction.

249
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:55,900
And as you saw that we can pause the interaction question in two ways.

250
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:05,400
And these are symmetric. So again, is the idea of just a difference in meanings between between males and females constant across all ages?

251
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:13,590
In other words, we are asking about and the age adjusted effect.

252
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:25,120
And one way to sort of phrase this question is we are seeing does age modify the effect of sex on SBP?

253
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:32,730
So does age modify?

254
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:48,860
The effect of six. Okay.

255
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:55,400
And then the next and I said in another way I can ask, Is the sex adjusted mean changing?

256
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,210
Is BP per year of AIDS equal for males and females?

257
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:04,850
So here I am asking the sex modified the effect of AIDS.

258
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:21,579
Either of these questions are interaction questions.

259
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:25,770
And, you know, they are kind of working direction through symmetric based.

260
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:37,709
And as you can see, like how we collect the terms from the interaction model to answer the age

261
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:44,200
modification effect of sex on equip or the sex modification effect of even SBP.

262
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:52,950
The collection of tons differs, right? Because for this question whether age modifies the effect of sex,

263
00:39:53,310 --> 00:40:05,730
essentially we have the we have collected the questions for F and the interaction to signify the sex effect.

264
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:10,590
And in the sex effect, as you can see, there is a term beta three ie.

265
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:16,980
So there is age lurking in there and for the age effect.

266
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:27,660
And the next question, we have beta one plus beta three if I so when looking at the effect of age,

267
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:36,840
the sex adjusted mean change in SBP per year, we see that the age effect has that F indicator lacking in there.

268
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:51,120
Okay, now just hold that thought and now let's look at the interaction model and kind of these are the different effects.

269
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:58,979
So the interaction model also implies two separate prevention lines, one for males, one for females.

270
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,980
But what is happening here? Let's see.

271
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:13,590
So for me is F is zero. So the straight line equation is is the p equal to be de na plus beta one II plus Ypsilanti.

272
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:22,110
Okay, so the intercept is beta are not and the slope is beta one.

273
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:33,750
For females if is equal to one for black bladder b in this equation, what do I get?

274
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:40,890
Better not be the one l plus beta two plus beta three again.

275
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:48,380
Right. So that's what I'm writing here for females is BP is equal to beta,

276
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:58,440
not plus beta two collected together to give me the intercept and beta one plus big that three collected together to give me the coefficient for each.

277
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:12,630
So the intercept for females is beta naught plus beta two and the slope for females is beta one plus beta three.

278
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:25,820
So as you can see that for the interaction model, this also implies two separate regression lines.

279
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:31,220
But the two lines have different slope and different intercepts.

280
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,420
Okay. So conceptually, does that make sense?

281
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:53,020
I mean, we should sort of, um, when I say like does, is the effect of it on the, on SBP, does it vary by gender or.

282
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,700
Basically, I'm again talking about two different lines for males and females,

283
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:05,740
but if it does vary by gender, then not only will it be different, but the slope will also be different.

284
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:12,370
Okay. So that is what is going on in the interaction model.

285
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:32,710
And graphically I can draw this model once again as the P and IT and again depending on the values of a meeting on video B that are three,

286
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:37,720
the shapes of these lines will be different.

287
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,620
But here is a hypothetical situation.

288
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:54,220
So here is the line, let's say, for females, and here is the line for this.

289
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:58,810
And hypothetically, here is the line for means.

290
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:16,950
Okay. So. So this is big business.

291
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:28,040
This is big business plus big that food. Okay.

292
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:38,660
Let's see. Here is each one is two IDs for one.

293
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:45,680
So at IDs E1, the gender difference is this much.

294
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:56,430
But at age 82, the gender difference is much bigger.

295
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:10,580
So remember the constant separation in the previous graph and there is no interaction that gets disturbed.

296
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:19,410
So I mean, here is one situation where the two lines I mean, things diverge, diverge.

297
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:34,260
So the separation increases. In other words, mayors have a much lower feel that females feel the line for females is is a much steeper line.

298
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:43,990
So for every one you need one year to increase the need for females.

299
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:50,140
The SBP rises quicker than one year.

300
00:45:52,420 --> 00:46:00,880
And the two lines. So not only are the intercepts different, so for me, it's the the slope is Beethoven.

301
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:09,830
And so the. Look.

302
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:27,980
Video one and four theme is, as you can see, it's a much steeper, weaker race slope for females with beta one plus.

303
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,350
So the lines have distinct intercepts and distinct slopes.

304
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:53,010
And as you can see, the sex difference when it is equal to E one is a much smaller difference than the sex difference when it is equal to A2.

305
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:55,140
In other words,

306
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:10,600
the two lines do not have a constant separation and seeding and other we know how it affects is b b depends on whether you whether it's a matter of.

307
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:17,200
So that is that is interaction. I mean,

308
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:25,360
and it should be as transparent as as clear as daylight when you get this done so often times like

309
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:31,490
this and then set that aside more often than like in the practical settings when you're doing the

310
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:37,450
event and it's a slope and you have a situation where you have some quantity or some technical

311
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:43,640
detail for me to figure out what kind of things for stock would mean if it's more than they usual.

312
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:49,750
And then a lot of times we say that you should be guided, leading interactions.

313
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:59,890
The best for a lot of it is guided by substantive knowledge of the field, like has there been other studies that have looked at interaction and plot.

314
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:10,510
But here is here is kind of another sort of that these are quite interaction plots to assess in an

315
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:15,760
exploratory way whether there could be potential interactions and whether we could follow desperate.

316
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:27,320
Okay. So so this is a very nice way of representing interactions graphically.

317
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:36,230
So a couple more points. So here is the interaction model.

318
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:44,389
SBP equal to we do not know that we on plus beta to the dummy variable for a female's plus we

319
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:50,240
get three times the cross product we need in the dummy variable for females plus Epsilon II.

320
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:54,260
And the question of interest is,

321
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:09,740
is the HP is the age adjusted gender effect on SBP independent of age or sad in another way is that I just did a different than his would

322
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:19,970
be the same for males and females like these are the two questions right he had in our list of four questions and I'm asking which one.

323
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:26,560
It speaks more clearly about interactions. So we can ask these questions.

324
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:30,810
And now both of these are asking about interaction.

325
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:35,090
So the question is how do we test for significance of the interaction data?

326
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:40,480
So my, my, my null hypothesis is what beta three equal to zero?

327
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:44,830
And the alternative is beta three, not equal to zero.

328
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:56,140
So if the null hypothesis were to hold in beta three equal to zero, basically this model reduces to them to a mean effect only model.

329
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:02,100
Yes. So this is what we are testing.

330
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:06,700
Now, tell me, what would be the F best? How would you construct the first?

331
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:19,940
Using extra sunscreen. We have the opportunity left to provide.

332
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:28,780
And this is one.

333
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:35,720
Yes. Everybody heard that. So, again, I'm going to use the extra summer first principle.

334
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,400
So this statistic would be the extra sum of squares.

335
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:54,500
Due to bitter three division bitterness between bitter over already in the model given the main model divided by diva.

336
00:50:54,650 --> 00:51:03,140
So the numerator is divided by one because the it because I have only one extra parameter of me during the full model.

337
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:16,070
And in the denominator of this is the MSE from the model and this will have an F distribution with degrees of freedom one and and minus four.

338
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:32,900
Okay. What about. Can I do a t test here? What would be the P statistic?

339
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:39,889
Hmm. We just. Mr. Cohen, hoping that it would be.

340
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:43,380
Oh, I thought you said the with the distribution of the. They.

341
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:49,290
Know what has to be. Divided by the standard error.

342
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:58,770
Yes. And then that would be equivalent to one of the most.

343
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:15,550
Okay. So everybody agree with that. So I can report that if this genetic test here to test for the interaction.

344
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:20,710
I'll ask one other question. So here is that again the interaction model.

345
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:31,960
Now I'm asking a different question. I'm asking my this question is, does mean is BP change with age?

346
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:47,570
What about sex? How to test for significance of 4 billion.

347
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:57,820
See it here. In this model that has interactions.

348
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:13,860
So the model I'm going to I'm going to try and attack or address that question does mean as it changed with it.

349
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:19,550
So let's call it the terms that give us the edge effect.

350
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:25,520
Right. So this is a model that has the beta three growth product of E-Verify.

351
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:31,180
So I'm going to write it as SBP equal could be done on blast.

352
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:40,160
The edge effect now is going to be beat the one plus beta three times the indicator dummy variable for gender.

353
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:48,140
So this is the coefficient for e last beta two if i plus epsilon nine.

354
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:59,720
So when I'm talking about the association between age and mean SBP, basically I'm talking about the slope for age and the slope for it.

355
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:10,790
Now has beta plus beta three times the indicator for gender because gender is kind of effect is lurking in there.

356
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,190
So then what is the null hypothesis for this question?

357
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:24,940
We got to see it again would be done in a few years.

358
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:30,770
So does everybody agree with this? The null hypothesis is beta only cultivator equal to zero.

359
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:35,270
And can you see this from here?

360
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:39,320
Why? It's beta one and beta three equal to zero.

361
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:48,450
That's because of this two different lines for males and females.

362
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:51,440
So if there's a no age effect, then we don't want it to be zero.

363
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:59,960
For me is if there is no editing for females, then beta one plus beta three has to be zero and be down is zero.

364
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:01,910
So beta feasible to zero.

365
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:14,780
So essentially we get back this hypothesis now that beta one equal to beta people do zero and each one is at least one is different from zero.

366
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:20,330
Okay. What would be the best for that for this?

367
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:27,140
I want answers from this side of the room.

368
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:42,770
Let's pause here. I move to tell you a funny story after the sense.

369
00:55:43,490 --> 00:56:03,230
And then you can read. I'd like to.

370
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:19,230
And the distribution of this would be if two.

371
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:36,510
Yes. Everybody see this extra some offers to do better one with actually given beta not beta two were already in the model divided by two.

372
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:44,410
Why do because someone has to wait x parameters beta one and bigotry and he said you know you need to going to see.

373
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,990
So this was it was up to them to in minus four.

374
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:53,190
Thank you. Can I do I this.

375
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,320
No wonder. So.

376
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:07,740
So that's the interaction model and the hypothesis test for that.

377
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:11,120
So we will take up the OP note.

378
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:17,970
One other point and then we'll take a break. So recall that the interaction model implies this two separate regression lines.

379
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:25,829
He wrote it out explicitly for males and females. And in fact, I'm going to also say this again.

380
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:37,770
When you were analyzing data or when you are sort of interpreting a model with lots of interactions in the short, short, we may be long,

381
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:47,219
but the fewer short there is right now, the model seem to be doing for the different levels of the categories continue here.

382
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:51,030
It's gender. And there are two levels when you look at the equation.

383
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:54,749
For me, it's an extraordinary situation where they're getting weaker to begin with.

384
00:57:54,750 --> 00:58:00,360
I'm just thinking that is basically single and you have like four levels of thickness.

385
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:11,610
But I did write the model out for each two days and then you will see how the interpretation of all of these four features become crystal clear.

386
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:17,160
Don't try to make interpretations unless you know, you have you know, I mean,

387
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:26,450
you you even you will kind of look at a model and write to mean different things from a complicated model with experience that happens,

388
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,610
you know, after 30 years, you get a model.

389
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:36,240
But the shear shock the is just the IT itself explicitly.

390
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:43,620
And then it just becomes so clear as to what are the interpretations of the individual question.

391
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:47,849
So I'm going to just mention that. So these are the lines.

392
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:56,669
For me, it's intimate. If I asked you to go through the 95% confidence interval for each effect among females, what is the age effect on females?

393
00:58:56,670 --> 00:59:00,629
It's become 1 to 3. So what would be the point estimate?

394
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:05,970
The point estimate would be below on how can we get feedback and how would

395
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:11,820
you construct the standard or the standard for beta one half plus beta three?

396
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:18,280
That is basically the square root of the estimated variances of beta one had that feedback.

397
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:19,980
Right.

398
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:31,859
And I know that variance of two would the sum of two random variables is the sum of the variances plus two times for variance of the random variable.

399
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:38,669
So I just break up this expression and write it as variance of beta one.

400
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:45,300
Her variance of production per plus content covariance of beta one height and weight that she had.

401
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:52,889
And all of those with that, we can assume that on their heads because those are estimated quantities and

402
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:58,469
data squared to get the standard error for beta one have less beta feedback and

403
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:02,520
all of these quantities you can get from the variance convenience matrix of

404
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:10,829
the meetings so you can have RSS generic this for you and basically get done.

405
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:14,940
That doesn't go into effect for females.

406
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:20,020
Yes, but if you want to test the potential, that age might not have an effect for one.

407
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:25,780
What is that? What is it?

408
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:30,310
What is it? I guess he's actually testing the infection.

409
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:39,930
Oh, like. I mean, I don't I think it's a good way to test specifically.

410
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:48,090
I could be testing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

411
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:58,879
So basically you didn't do individual tests like that but that is I want to be taking direction with happened and you can estimate

412
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:09,500
that you know the aggregate fee is significantly different from 0 to 1 that may or may not be significantly different from zero,

413
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:13,910
but that would be one scenario. The question you're asking is how?

414
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:22,060
Okay. So everybody see, like how we would get the standard errors.

415
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:36,460
So I think I am going to pause here and let's take a break for 10 minutes and we'll come back and talk about the example.

416
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:41,590
The funny story that I was going to say quickly is this was long.

417
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:45,340
I have been in this department since 2003. So you know how old I am.

418
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:53,590
And in fact, there may be someone who is sticking out of section.

419
01:01:54,310 --> 01:02:00,130
He actually and I'm sure would be someone who didn't mind me sharing this story.

420
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,544
So I taught him 653 which is something you will see next year and then he would give was brilliant is sort of.

421
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:10,079
So let's so we talk about this example.

422
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:17,939
So, I mean, basically bringing the data now.

423
01:02:20,429 --> 01:02:35,319
So we have AIDS measured in days and birthweight in ounces as predictors of infant systolic blood pressure as BP is of thumb in millimeters of likely.

424
01:02:37,469 --> 01:02:44,019
So be reading the data fine. And it's a small dataset and equal to 16.

425
01:02:45,509 --> 01:02:59,939
So we have the I.D. numbers for the for the kids we have birth weight BWT age in these and then as BP.

426
01:03:01,739 --> 01:03:14,219
So the first thing that we are going to do is feed is BP on each birth weight and across strata of age with birth weight.

427
01:03:14,219 --> 01:03:27,539
But we are going to fit the model in this order. So each cross product, the birth weight enters the model first, then age and then birth weight.

428
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:34,469
So we fit this model and here are the future estimates.

429
01:03:35,819 --> 01:03:42,359
So we have basically we are fitting the model like, you know, is BP the way we were writing it?

430
01:03:42,719 --> 01:04:02,549
Well, to get an R plus beta one times its beta through times birth weight loss, B2C dimes, aid, we got the last September nine.

431
01:04:02,729 --> 01:04:06,209
But now when we are fitting the model, we are putting it.

432
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:18,509
In this order that and this one intersperse the crossword.

433
01:04:19,459 --> 01:04:25,229
So just keep that in mind. So here are the results from that model fit.

434
01:04:36,049 --> 01:04:39,599
Okay. The R-squared is point nine.

435
01:04:39,889 --> 01:04:45,049
Yes, that's pretty high. That's what I look for in.

436
01:04:55,509 --> 01:05:05,939
Oh, yeah, that's a. That.

437
01:05:05,939 --> 01:05:13,589
Martin That must be a typo. It's I'm not I mean, I usually indicates an indicator that you've read in the notes.

438
01:05:13,859 --> 01:05:20,219
The reason it's not I was just looking at the archive. The funding formula in the.

439
01:05:23,259 --> 01:05:30,959
The multiplication. As. I guess it just changes how.

440
01:05:32,339 --> 01:05:39,459
The application. But then it's other teams.

441
01:05:40,479 --> 01:05:46,449
Yeah. Yeah, I think, I think this is I mean I and I'm not showing you the.

442
01:05:50,129 --> 01:05:57,509
Sort of the the the step before picking the L1 function.

443
01:06:00,449 --> 01:06:07,789
So the cross product has to be created in SAS and I'd wore the cross product that has to be created outside of that.

444
01:06:07,859 --> 01:06:13,409
And I don't know if it's a function of the do I think I think it's a typo here

445
01:06:13,499 --> 01:06:17,699
because in the other slides do you see and then you go to the other side,

446
01:06:17,939 --> 01:06:23,189
I shouldn't be there. So I did the flight test on the side, which is there.

447
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:36,209
So making it definite. Yeah.

448
01:06:36,209 --> 01:06:41,359
So that just I would have to check that because thank you for pointing out.

449
01:06:41,819 --> 01:06:47,219
But definitely it's not give indication of what the problem is when you have.

450
01:06:48,409 --> 01:06:52,139
Let's start at the desk and we'll get into the story after.

451
01:06:55,169 --> 01:07:00,589
But actually the for. Not necessarily.

452
01:07:00,949 --> 01:07:05,859
But when you only have good interaction. You don't have to.

453
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:16,559
Do I have a plus size advantage? Yeah, because you could fit the same model as BP builder.

454
01:07:16,589 --> 01:07:36,639
They'd start BWT. So so this either this is a I kind of look for or is there's a kind of a typo here but please please.

455
01:07:37,089 --> 01:07:42,399
The main thing I want to point out and thank you for bringing my attention to that,

456
01:07:43,089 --> 01:07:46,989
Lisa, it does not mean that the tsunami maybe a bigger is available.

457
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:52,748
It's not. Okay. So so pretty.

458
01:07:52,749 --> 01:08:00,969
There's like this body image with BWT first, then each and then BWT in this order.

459
01:08:00,969 --> 01:08:07,708
Let me just see one thing. Yeah.

460
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:11,099
No, definitely. These are not indicators.

461
01:08:11,309 --> 01:08:21,629
So this is this is a this is a table because I have in my notes both the R and SAS outputs.

462
01:08:22,769 --> 01:08:26,189
And so. Yeah. Okay.

463
01:08:28,169 --> 01:08:31,409
So that stuff I like to ask.

464
01:08:32,099 --> 01:08:35,879
Hmm. Now that's going to kind of bug me. Oh.

465
01:08:40,369 --> 01:08:51,729
Okay. So now I'm going to compute both the sequential and the partial sums of squares for this module are.

466
01:08:51,769 --> 01:08:58,909
And on the top, here are the type one of the sequential somewhat squares.

467
01:09:02,589 --> 01:09:11,689
And on the bottom I have the Parkfield software, the type three and the type one.

468
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:17,809
Type three are also how if you are.

469
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:27,919
Sort of if you are kind of validating with.

470
01:09:30,849 --> 01:09:34,719
Output from other softwares like SAS does exist.

471
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:41,939
So that type one refers to sequences of stress free efforts to botches.

472
01:09:42,429 --> 01:09:53,739
So here are the and what you for those two different sum softwares apart from the same model.

473
01:09:54,099 --> 01:10:00,248
So now I am going to ask you this question.

474
01:10:00,249 --> 01:10:09,699
So based on each of these tables, you can construct an F test for the interaction.

475
01:10:10,269 --> 01:10:23,109
So based on the first table, the F statistic value for interaction is one 20.1 or with the P value of less than point or one.

476
01:10:23,769 --> 01:10:32,829
Okay. And it's highly significant for the second table, which is based on partial sum of squares.

477
01:10:33,249 --> 01:10:49,929
The F statistic value is 6.17 with the P value of points or to A, and that's based on the partial sum of personal.

478
01:10:49,959 --> 01:10:55,689
My question to you is you have these two F tests for the interaction.

479
01:10:56,469 --> 01:11:02,559
Are either of them valid tests? And if your answer is yes, which one?

480
01:11:03,909 --> 01:11:11,109
And if your answer is no for a certain one, then why not?

481
01:11:12,919 --> 01:11:19,399
Feel like before you leave. I feel like it should be better to include the individual covariance before you do.

482
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:30,439
Intuition. I feel like sequential. If we put you on the ballot, I guess the country would be better off if you put in the last.

483
01:11:30,859 --> 01:11:34,419
But in this case, it's been in the past. Okay.

484
01:11:35,379 --> 01:11:54,139
Anybody else want Spencer? Thank you for that. Thank you for the thought and did everybody here that anybody else wants to say.

485
01:12:08,349 --> 01:12:20,078
In this table for the top people live statistic is one 20.1 a 9.25 is the sort

486
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:30,809
of less than one or much smaller than 400 or one in value instead of them.

487
01:12:30,849 --> 01:12:34,389
This you can go see.

488
01:13:12,819 --> 01:13:24,809
They a fear? Yes.

489
01:13:24,829 --> 01:13:28,429
Okay. Thank you so and so. Thank you for all the answers.

490
01:13:28,879 --> 01:13:46,248
Anybody else wants to answer. So the first two answers from Jack and Sophia are kind of talking about the same thing,

491
01:13:46,249 --> 01:13:50,959
and both of you are kind of right and expressed it in your knee.

492
01:13:51,349 --> 01:13:58,229
So the first test or the third, based on the sequence, you had some stuff and you said, Weird.

493
01:13:58,229 --> 01:14:06,619
Jack said, Well, you know, use that indirection term, burying that lost in the model, then it would be fine.

494
01:14:07,519 --> 01:14:12,529
And all of that speaks to the fact that when we have that sequence, it's all squares.

495
01:14:12,889 --> 01:14:16,459
And when it started, beauty is the first time in the model.

496
01:14:17,089 --> 01:14:22,339
It's essentially because they've already more important the matrix and not in the

497
01:14:22,339 --> 01:14:29,599
model that it's that sum of squares for five 62.17 piece to express some of squares.

498
01:14:29,809 --> 01:14:35,658
You do that across product. Given we only had beaten up in the model, nothing else?

499
01:14:35,659 --> 01:14:50,899
No. In informatics. And essentially that is that is when there are no main effects in the model, you cannot put the interaction.

500
01:14:50,959 --> 01:15:02,629
So the big message is you have to have the mean at fixing the model modeling be even if they are non-significant,

501
01:15:02,629 --> 01:15:11,449
you have to retain them in the model if you have a significant interaction.

502
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:18,189
So. So. So you're saying it's kind of weird?

503
01:15:18,279 --> 01:15:21,589
Yes. That's basically what you saying. Yeah.

504
01:15:21,789 --> 01:15:26,408
And yeah. And it's very modified so that.

505
01:15:26,409 --> 01:15:35,349
No, no. Because as you saw, like in the in the interaction model, they call the meaning the interaction by itself,

506
01:15:35,499 --> 01:15:43,029
we go to mean that it's actually the the sort of the interpretation becomes really the model and it doesn't like you

507
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:51,249
cannot write those like the reboot the lines from these and the ones that really so it sort of becomes very murky.

508
01:15:51,259 --> 01:16:06,189
So even if the main effects are not significant according to the details you still have and then in the morning, even the interaction is significant.

509
01:16:08,139 --> 01:16:18,339
So that's one thing. And then the other critical message is that which we we talked about earlier, like in the introduction, is significant.

510
01:16:18,879 --> 01:16:31,329
Then be really careful about interpreting the main effects by themselves because the mean if it's by themselves don't have any interpretation.

511
01:16:32,799 --> 01:16:42,489
No, that's when we're talking about the where it was still like beta one plus beta three times the indicator for gender.

512
01:16:42,519 --> 01:16:51,119
And we were talking about the gender and it was still beta last beta three times age.

513
01:16:52,599 --> 01:16:57,668
So when interaction is significant, you have to be very careful.

514
01:16:57,669 --> 01:17:08,078
You cannot really degrade the main effect for Christians by themselves because the the the beta three is kind

515
01:17:08,079 --> 01:17:23,739
of lurking in the in describing the effect of either age or gender on on anybody like the previous example.

516
01:17:23,919 --> 01:17:30,459
Okay. So, so the first if statistic actually is, is wrong.

517
01:17:31,839 --> 01:17:35,738
It's wrong in the sense that that so the the valid one.

518
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:44,139
The second one because it's based on. And and thank you for that answer because it's based on the partial sample squared.

519
01:17:44,679 --> 01:17:48,909
Although it's done, BWT is in third in the model four.

520
01:17:49,509 --> 01:17:53,109
But remember, the bar shoots up subsequent for that the order of the matter.

521
01:17:56,499 --> 01:18:08,719
So the the 27.14 is basically the extra sum of squares due to age start bwt given bit and are equal and

522
01:18:08,739 --> 01:18:21,639
between beta two where in the model which is what the f statistic the numerator of that statistic should be.

523
01:18:22,299 --> 01:18:36,878
But you just told me, you know, a couple slides back like how the test for beta three should look like so that this the numerator is

524
01:18:36,879 --> 01:18:46,509
basically the partial sum of squares due to the interaction or the cross border between BWT and IGG,

525
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:52,899
given each BWT and are not but already in the model.

526
01:18:52,989 --> 01:19:02,379
So. So this second table on the bottom table has the right sum of squares.

527
01:19:02,379 --> 01:19:11,679
And so the x statistic 6.17 with a p value of one or 286 is the value this.

528
01:19:14,099 --> 01:19:21,759
Okay. So if this. Based on partial software.

529
01:19:36,019 --> 01:19:49,169
When the main effects. We are in the modern.

530
01:19:56,029 --> 01:20:01,578
So now let's change the ordering of the full body X and compute the sum of squares.

531
01:20:01,579 --> 01:20:05,569
And this is, I think, a drag. This is what you would think that.

532
01:20:06,139 --> 01:20:15,229
Okay, it would be. It would be. I don't know what you said would or better or it could be faster.

533
01:20:15,589 --> 01:20:19,819
It would be better to put this last. And that's exactly what I have.

534
01:20:20,179 --> 01:20:28,459
So these are still sequential some squares, but the start BWT is put in last.

535
01:20:28,909 --> 01:20:31,309
And lo and behold, you see something.

536
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:49,329
The sequential sum of squares for AIDS dug BWT is 27.15, which is exactly the same as the sum of squares for field sum of squares for each star.

537
01:20:49,339 --> 01:20:52,969
BWT should make a whole lot of sense, right?

538
01:20:55,399 --> 01:21:01,249
Okay. So, so that's what is going on now.

539
01:21:01,639 --> 01:21:10,178
I will save the fitted values. So note that this is the model where I have eight BWT.

540
01:21:10,179 --> 01:21:16,699
It started BWT now and I have figured out what the correct test for the interaction is.

541
01:21:17,689 --> 01:21:25,008
The target significant with the p value off point to do something or aid or something?

542
01:21:25,009 --> 01:21:30,529
Okay. So here are the feeds from the from this model.

543
01:21:31,279 --> 01:21:34,609
So just hold that thought.

544
01:21:36,139 --> 01:21:42,739
Now if I want to test the hypothesis of no interaction.

545
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:48,139
So basically my null hypothesis is beta three equal to zero.

546
01:21:50,619 --> 01:21:59,199
Okay. So I can do it either not to an F test or to discuss this.

547
01:21:59,499 --> 01:22:13,059
Did you. Those prompted me. So the estimate for each we BWT class product is negative .12 with a standard

548
01:22:13,069 --> 01:22:20,649
error of 1 to 5 with the P statistic of -2.40 and a p value of one or 286.

549
01:22:23,079 --> 01:22:29,529
Okay. So it is I would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there's a significant

550
01:22:29,529 --> 01:22:40,629
interaction between it and with the same test using the annual sums of squares and the

551
01:22:40,629 --> 01:22:47,799
FTSE to the we saw that the sum of squares was 27.15 with the EPS and this is the

552
01:22:47,799 --> 01:22:56,349
partial sum of squares for each bit BWT cross product or as the sum of you mentioned,

553
01:22:57,099 --> 01:23:04,509
this could also be the sequence field software if we let it start with the medium to last and there's last in the model.

554
01:23:04,899 --> 01:23:17,108
So irrespective of how you get it, this is the validate test with the with the F statistic value of 6.17 and once again the P value of one or 286.

555
01:23:17,109 --> 01:23:21,669
So the f this in the test equivalent as we know.

556
01:23:23,109 --> 01:23:29,079
And here because the numerator is a freedom for the f is one,

557
01:23:29,529 --> 01:23:38,589
you are testing a single parameter and both of them say that there is a conclude that there's a significant interaction between eight and birthweight.

558
01:23:39,909 --> 01:23:43,479
Okay, no hypothesis test of eight.

559
01:23:43,509 --> 01:23:59,589
And note that. So this is essentially what I asked you before in terms of the model parameters.

560
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:05,529
So how do you test the hypothesis that there's an aid effect?

561
01:24:05,829 --> 01:24:08,289
So the in the in the model with interactions,

562
01:24:08,289 --> 01:24:14,529
it reduces to the null that between equal to be equal to 0% alternative that at least one is different from zero.

563
01:24:14,889 --> 01:24:20,919
So you told me that you can do this test by computing the extra sample squared due

564
01:24:20,979 --> 01:24:28,479
to video on beta three given beta naught and beta during the model and and and and,

565
01:24:28,479 --> 01:24:38,499
you know, sort of proceed that way. So it's a to get these extra sum of squares, what would be the easiest thing to do under the null model?

566
01:24:38,529 --> 01:24:51,849
Under the null hypothesis, the model would reduce to SBP equal to beta, not last beta.

567
01:24:51,869 --> 01:25:00,249
Sometimes if I plus epsilon this is the model under null.

568
01:25:08,969 --> 01:25:13,739
Okay. And what about under the alternative?

569
01:25:14,939 --> 01:25:20,819
It's a free model. We will be going to what we don't want because we knew that these are these two models nested.

570
01:25:23,219 --> 01:25:28,199
Yes, they are very much tested. So what do they do to test this hypothesis?

571
01:25:28,649 --> 01:25:35,068
Because remember, I cannot do a t test here. I'm simultaneously testing for the two parameters.

572
01:25:35,069 --> 01:25:41,159
Beethoven, which are three close to zero. So I can go back. I cannot go back to my D table or.

573
01:25:41,879 --> 01:25:46,109
Or even double the default down to the sense of squares.

574
01:25:46,499 --> 01:25:56,129
So these two are listed model two. What can I do? I can feed these two models, the full model and the reduced model under the null hypothesis.

575
01:25:56,459 --> 01:26:03,229
And I can construct this F test by taking the difference off either the regression sample squares,

576
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:10,919
SSR or the residual sum of those from this to model divide by by two for the two extra parameters under the

577
01:26:10,919 --> 01:26:19,229
full model and take the MSE from the full model as the denominator of my year and construct that statistic.

578
01:26:20,729 --> 01:26:25,499
Yes, they speak too fast. I spoke too fast.

579
01:26:25,949 --> 01:26:33,899
Okay, so let me show you what we are doing. Do you agree those two models are nested and do you firstly,

580
01:26:33,899 --> 01:26:39,119
do you agree that those are the two models under the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis?

581
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:44,699
Okay. So no. And you would agree that they are nested.

582
01:26:47,499 --> 01:26:50,819
Correct. So that's exactly what they did.

583
01:26:51,219 --> 01:27:05,559
So under the null hypothesis, under age, not the model is just is BP as a function of birth weight that is beta, not plus beta two times birth weight.

584
01:27:07,829 --> 01:27:17,969
And under the alternative, the full module I have retired plus Piedmont Temps eight plus beta programs,

585
01:27:17,969 --> 01:27:22,349
Berkeley plus the beta three times the interaction between age and birth.

586
01:27:23,879 --> 01:27:30,178
So this is what I was seeing like in R for the L in function you can ride the full

587
01:27:30,179 --> 01:27:35,099
life mean if it's plus interaction model as just age start Berkeley like that.

588
01:27:37,409 --> 01:27:43,049
So anyway that's that's a R plug but but do you do you agree that these are the two models you said?

589
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:53,279
Yes. So it's like is BP equal to beta not plus, I'm just going to write exactly in the same order as we wrote before.

590
01:27:59,579 --> 01:28:06,869
We not bloody better. Two dimes. Oh, sorry.

591
01:28:07,289 --> 01:28:15,089
This was a different context. But anyway, birthweight for SBP as a function of.

592
01:28:19,989 --> 01:28:40,309
But we. And the alternative is is be equal to Vietnam plus Vietnam times what we sometimes eat.

593
01:28:41,899 --> 01:28:51,199
Plus interaction between age and birth, weight loss, etc.

594
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:56,869
Everybody clear so far is I did not go fast.

595
01:28:56,869 --> 01:29:00,109
Right? Or even if this is not clear, please let me know.

596
01:29:01,639 --> 01:29:07,249
Do you see how these are the components of the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis?

597
01:29:09,649 --> 01:29:15,559
I want to see if you are nodding. Yes. And please, it's not clear that we know.

598
01:29:20,779 --> 01:29:26,039
Does. Does that make sense and leads to more sinister?

599
01:29:28,619 --> 01:29:33,599
So remember. I am testing. I am testing.

600
01:29:41,799 --> 01:29:45,009
The effect of each.

601
01:29:51,279 --> 01:29:57,099
So I no hypothesis is made to be able to beat three equal to zero.

602
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:11,149
Okay. So these two models are listed.

603
01:30:11,149 --> 01:30:19,549
So what do I do? I just feed these two models and I dig the difference of the residuals, some of squares from these two models.

604
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:29,719
That gives me the extra sum of squares attributed to beta to beta three given beta not only to don't not in the model.

605
01:30:30,409 --> 01:30:33,119
So that's exactly what I did so far.

606
01:30:33,119 --> 01:30:45,289
So they fitted this model under the null hypothesis with only part three and the residual sum of squares is five for B with

607
01:30:45,289 --> 01:30:53,988
the degrees of freedom 14 y 14 because I only have that any is equal to 16 and in the model under the null hypothesis,

608
01:30:53,989 --> 01:31:00,559
I only have beta not and we on the Q parameters. So 16 minus to 14.

609
01:31:00,859 --> 01:31:05,359
Okay. And then I fit the full model of the model under the alternative,

610
01:31:05,719 --> 01:31:16,519
the residual sum of versus 52.75 and the degrees of freedom is 16 minus one, two, three, four for the 12.

611
01:31:18,829 --> 01:31:21,229
So these two models are nested.

612
01:31:21,559 --> 01:31:34,968
Now, if I take the difference in the residual sum of squared between these two models, so five 40.4 -52.75 gives me 47.65,

613
01:31:34,969 --> 01:31:46,549
which is the extra sum of squares due to beta who beta three given beta not and beta one but already in the model.

614
01:31:51,809 --> 01:31:58,199
Okay. And what about the degrees of freedom associated with this extra sum of squares?

615
01:31:58,379 --> 01:32:02,458
It's two because I have four. Minus two are 14.

616
01:32:02,459 --> 01:32:20,579
Minus two. So I construct the f test with whom I f statistics is 47.65 divided by two, and the denominator is the MSE from the full model.

617
01:32:21,299 --> 01:32:26,099
The MSE from the full model is in the previous slide.

618
01:32:29,099 --> 01:32:34,049
So it's 4.4 and.

619
01:32:37,119 --> 01:32:43,089
And I get the statistic to be 55.46.

620
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:56,699
So that might f. And this is significant with the p value of less than one or one.

621
01:33:04,699 --> 01:33:10,309
Why is that? So this is the MSE from the full model wo to the previous slide.

622
01:33:10,789 --> 01:33:15,739
I see the mse from the pool model to this is this.

623
01:33:17,619 --> 01:33:32,459
All right. Okay. So that gives me a statistic of 55.46 with a p value of much less 10.1.

624
01:33:32,459 --> 01:33:43,229
So essentially I reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there's a significant effect of age.

625
01:33:45,999 --> 01:33:49,709
But but combined with the significant interaction,

626
01:33:49,719 --> 01:33:56,799
what it's saying is that there's a significant difference of age on SBP, but it depends on both the.

627
01:34:00,599 --> 01:34:03,719
Question about why some other. I'm sorry.

628
01:34:04,109 --> 01:34:09,509
Can you go to your ritual? Like, can you go to talk to it? And what particularly we used to do the testimony.

629
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:18,519
Can I go to which one? The that one that will be distributed over.

630
01:34:20,979 --> 01:34:24,799
It doesn't work. So. Right to do so.

631
01:34:24,809 --> 01:34:28,689
We're trying to come up with the right.

632
01:34:31,839 --> 01:34:40,219
I was in. I was thinking, why can't you just not know?

633
01:34:40,219 --> 01:34:48,969
Why can't you? Because you take that age turn because on its own it's just pointless, which you take the age turns to find that.

634
01:34:48,979 --> 01:34:53,389
Why? To divide which one we did.

635
01:34:53,659 --> 01:34:57,609
The analysis of various tables that you take determines that age.

636
01:34:57,919 --> 01:35:09,279
So finally, looking into 27.15, if you put that first report, first page, I said, okay,

637
01:35:09,319 --> 01:35:15,349
I was going to use that in the table, but I can't because I personally would need to be first.

638
01:35:17,229 --> 01:35:26,239
Yeah. So and also like, remember the partial ad just for everything else in the models.

639
01:35:27,289 --> 01:35:30,569
And so it's it's it's.

640
01:35:33,609 --> 01:35:37,719
So they did kind of things already going to creep in the effect,

641
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:44,159
the effect of those other factors with creeping into the sunset squares and it would be difficult to be sent backwards.

642
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:53,829
So this is a much cleaner thing and I'm not even sure that we will be able to completely disentangle.

643
01:35:53,829 --> 01:36:02,769
You might have to force the model thinking in a certain way, like in which dance party speech does last and it will be here.

644
01:36:03,759 --> 01:36:08,499
Okay, so is everybody clear till this point?

645
01:36:11,469 --> 01:36:22,839
So I. I have to. I think I have to stop here and we'll have to come back or maybe just one other thing, and then we'll come back.

646
01:36:22,869 --> 01:36:34,869
So if you compare this to the adjusted effect in an additive model, so when, when we see a additive model for model one only speaking,

647
01:36:35,529 --> 01:36:43,659
but because it will vary again, an additive model means only the mean effects of Eden, but with new interaction.

648
01:36:43,669 --> 01:36:50,439
So as you can see, the way you end there is age plus birthday and not age.

649
01:36:50,439 --> 01:36:58,959
Start with you can again use that a nested model on the null and alternative use the extra sum of squares uploads

650
01:36:58,959 --> 01:37:07,899
to the model 50 and when you compare the F statistic is 74.9 do with the P-value of less than point one.

651
01:37:09,009 --> 01:37:16,899
Basically you are getting what an adjusted effect of age in an additive model,

652
01:37:17,259 --> 01:37:22,069
but that is different than a model with both interactions and mean effects.

653
01:37:22,089 --> 01:37:27,629
So I'm going to just stop here and we will pick up from here next week.

654
01:37:27,939 --> 01:37:29,169
Okay. Thank you.
