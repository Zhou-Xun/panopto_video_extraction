1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,860
Based on the true graft, we conclude that this true assumptions hold for our model.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,070
However, there is a problem with the covariance assumptions.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:17,010
The plot against predictive values is not a random scatterplot, but a graph with some specific patterns.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,860
So the experience assumption is valid. As a solution, we applied robust under road for coefficient test.

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:34,180
And this will give us p values for the coefficient tests and for independence assumption.

6
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,200
The assessment is by design. We're just assuming it here.

7
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,870
In addition to these assumptions, we also detect outliers by leverage and occasionally student height residues.

8
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,260
And they give us similar results. Finally, this is a summary of the four parts of our project.

9
00:00:52,300 --> 00:01:03,320
Thank you for your attention. Vermont, guys, I think we need to some color on.

10
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:25,320
Thank you very much. I do need to log off all the accounts or any other.

11
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,910
Okay. Yeah, maybe I just, uh. Oh, yeah.

12
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,370
If I just send out the guest account or I want you to sign off for my.

13
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,760
Oh, okay. I think I might still be, like, there.

14
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,940
I mean, you know, like, okay, I can sign out.

15
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,300
Okay. We need to get out of. Yes.

16
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,110
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo.

17
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:39,130
You. All right.

18
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,270
Before we get this tomorrow. No, no.

19
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,670
Where did. And my be dead.

20
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,760
Or unless they just have, you know, do.

21
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,610
Oh, yeah.

22
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,090
Good morning. So today we have.

23
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,130
Can't remember the order. I think it's ten, 11 or nine or it might be 11, ten and nine.

24
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:56,350
Doesn't that seems too convenient? So I'm going to go with you on the other order.

25
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,490
Better than I do, probably. I just looked at it though.

26
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:12,170
If you haven't done so so far, please share your presentation with me unless you have some really quick way of loading it.

27
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:23,600
As you can see, we're running a bit behind. Um, and this big mike is, is the battery seems to be dead,

28
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:32,240
so don't come up here messing with it because it's not working unless you have the magic touch to make the battery work.

29
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:38,350
Um. Mm hmm. Well, did you say that at time?

30
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:48,290
Oh, I don't. I have not the slightest. It looks like it's probably a charger, a charging situation, so I'm not going to mess with it.

31
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:55,100
We still have this one that's in my hand, and then we have this one, so.

32
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:04,610
Other than that, let's see. Oh, don't forgive that.

33
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:10,190
I will give you a five minute and a one minute warning.

34
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,770
Oh, yeah. So if there's nothing else, I'll turn it over.

35
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,220
Which one is it? Okay. Which one of is it? Ten or 11. That's going first.

36
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,350
Ten. Okay, that's all right. So I will turn it over to group ten.

37
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:36,360
Yeah. Oh, and if you use this handheld one, you got to turn it on.

38
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,010
And the clicker is there. I'm done.

39
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,550
Okay. So this. Oh, no.

40
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,160
This is. We share it with you?

41
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:10,120
Yes. I forgot about that last week. Let me just go. Sorry, I forgot about that little nuance.

42
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:23,210
Here we go. Thank you. Mm. Like they said.

43
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,920
Okay? Yeah. All right.

44
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:48,590
Hello, everyone. We're group ten and we're going to be presenting on Community Action Network or Ken's after afterschool programs.

45
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:57,049
So Can is located in Washtenaw County and it seeks to address two broad social issues that often affect children and youth,

46
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,190
which are low levels of academic support and social emotional support.

47
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:08,719
So why are these programs important? Research shows that academic support from teachers, parents,

48
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:16,030
peers and community is associated with improved academic achievement, motivation and school behaviors among children.

49
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:25,400
Youth. However, not all families may be able to provide high levels of academic support due to some structural and societal barriers and contexts.

50
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,970
For example, work schedules are transportation related issues,

51
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:35,570
and it's also important to note that teachers face barriers to providing students with individualized academic support.

52
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:40,610
A common issue is like a large student to teacher ratio in classrooms.

53
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:49,610
So academic afterschool programs like Can are able to fill gaps and serve as an additional support and resource for children and youth.

54
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:59,060
All right. So this evaluation, specifically looking at the education part of their theory of change, but this is overall what Khan is hoping to do.

55
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,070
So what's the problem with families having little to no access for opportunities and resources?

56
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:10,799
These are like the education stabilization community are like their main programs that they provide education for,

57
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,600
the afterschool programs for the kids, stabilization such as like food resources and connecting them to the resources

58
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,620
and the community is more of a community organizing and community empowerment.

59
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,770
And then through all of that, they hope to achieve.

60
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,860
Families are thriving in vibrant and healthy communities with equal access to opportunities free from poverty.

61
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,480
This is just really quickly our logic model that we developed for the education program.

62
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:43,440
So really quickly, I guess just the first row of funding and staff are inputs, activities for tutoring and for the kids outlets.

63
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,079
Students are going to be currently enrolled in the after school program with enjoying

64
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,610
their time there and enjoying some of their more of the learnings and outcomes there.

65
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,959
Um, so you have another thinking about invested parties.

66
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:06,150
Obviously, Canada's most engaged in getting children who participate in their programs to be improved and to enjoy the programs and participating.

67
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,390
However, we sort of had to use a proxy for the children themselves,

68
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:14,610
particularly because other invested partners would include their parents or guardians or their teachers in their schools.

69
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:21,900
So beginning with the can administrators and staff, they're our biggest concern when we're thinking about invested parties in this evaluation.

70
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,030
And obviously they want to understand the impact of their programing and the support that they're providing to the children.

71
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,430
We also thought about the parents of Washtenaw County, not just the parents whose children are participating in the program,

72
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:38,010
but also parents in general who want to see the quality of this program and to see that whatever

73
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,030
they're providing for can is being utilized well and that their children are being supported.

74
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:42,480
Also,

75
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,330
teachers in Washtenaw County who would want their students to succeed in the classroom and hope that an after school program to assist them in that.

76
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,200
And then finally,

77
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:56,520
fiscal sponsors can has a number of corporate financial sponsors and then also is supported by the Ann Arbor Community Foundation Fund.

78
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:03,910
So thinking about them as well and their inputs into this program. So here's our evaluation purpose.

79
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:10,540
First and foremost, I would like to gather insight into the consistency and influence of their program on the children who participate.

80
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:17,560
We wanted to especially reflect Kan's goals of both increasing commitment to schools so interest and investment in their learning,

81
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,040
also enjoyment in their learning, and then improving emotional behavioral health.

82
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,120
So looking at a more holistic way to evaluate what afterschool programs can do for children.

83
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,190
And then we hope that Khan is able to use the results of this evaluation to improve the retention rates

84
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,719
of children and staff to provide markers for consistent programing in their afterschool programs,

85
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,140
and to determine if programs are positively impacting participants in the way that they are hoping to see through their afterschool programs.

86
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,499
So for the process evaluation,

87
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:54,300
the two main questions that we're asking are how consistently are staff and children attending Ken's afterschool programs over time,

88
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,680
and to what extent are the program activities carried out as intended?

89
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,870
So the first indicators that evaluators will assess relate to cans, administrative support systems.

90
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,400
Evaluators can count the number of staff members that attend each session,

91
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:19,860
the idea being that there should be enough staff members present to support program participants and ensure that activities are run efficiently.

92
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:27,480
Evaluators can also consider the client service delivery system, which is essentially just the delivery of cans after school programing.

93
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,149
And similarly to staff attendance.

94
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:37,500
It's important for evaluators to understand whether or not participants are regularly attending cans after school program programing,

95
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:46,500
because this can be indicative of dose delivered so evaluators can assess participant attendance using a participant attendance role.

96
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,530
And then finally,

97
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:56,690
an important consideration in regards to the client service delivery system is program fidelity or whether or not activities are being conducted,

98
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:05,179
kind of how they were planned, originally planned. And in order to support this program, staff should be asked to make a note of program activities,

99
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:11,600
timelines, staff commitments, and then discuss these notes in monthly staff only focus groups.

100
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,310
Okay. And then for upcoming evaluation, our questions are pretty similar.

101
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:25,440
Both have the goal of kind of assessing the children's outcome for their learning grades and just kind of overall enjoyment of learning.

102
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,260
This is both for the parents to begin with.

103
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:35,400
So the parents are being asked to like evaluate their kids behavior at home before and after the program, along with the teachers,

104
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:42,360
kind of just assessing the students within their classrooms that are both involved in the program and not open to that.

105
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:49,710
So specifically looking at the parents to begin with, are we used to pre experimental one group pretest post-test?

106
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,880
This would be done with the parents for evaluating their children.

107
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,440
They're involved in the program.

108
00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:03,240
So this is this can be done one evaluation or survey done before the intervention or after school program and then another one at the end.

109
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,430
And they will be able to compare it, see if that had any changes throughout their evolvement.

110
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:16,230
Some of the indicators and kind of outcomes are hoping to look at for the outcome evaluation for parents as kind of child's behavior at home.

111
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:20,130
Ability to regulate them. Interest in doing their homework and reading.

112
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,580
And lastly, just attitudes towards classwork as a general.

113
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,389
Then very similar to that is outcome evaluation for teachers. But one main thing that kind of separates this and how it's done compared to the

114
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:35,470
parents is we're doing a pretest process and an equivalent comparison groups.

115
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,790
So based on these surveys that the parents are doing,

116
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:44,500
we'll be able to identify which teachers we can reach out to and they will be able to see

117
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:50,050
compare students that are in their classroom that are a part of can and not a part of can,

118
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:55,420
kind of see in how this program may have changed their attitude towards classwork.

119
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,000
Then again, for the timeline, very similar to parents,

120
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,080
we're just doing pretest the beginning of the semester after we kind of get feedback from parents of who to reach out to children,

121
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:10,600
attend the program, and then afterwards kind of have process evaluate the changes.

122
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:16,390
Then again, the indicators going to just academic standard of test scores, grades and the classroom behavior.

123
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:24,140
Um. So with our validity, we are trying to balance the internal validity versus the external validity.

124
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,969
So beginning with the parent survey, there is a lack of comparison or control groups.

125
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,560
So that does limit our ability to extrapolate this information and to make it more internally valid.

126
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,160
There also might be regression towards the mean from the pretest to the post-test.

127
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:44,240
So we want to be aware of that when we are evaluating the answers from parents before their children are in the program, and then afterwards.

128
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,669
And then for the teacher survey,

129
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:52,190
there is a very close comparison group because the children that are being compared are in the same classroom and have the same teachers.

130
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,489
So we imagine that their education within the classroom is very similar,

131
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:00,860
and the only thing that would probably change is their exposure to afterschool programing versus no afterschool programing.

132
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,839
And then but then it's not randomized. So that is something to keep in mind for our internal validity.

133
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,850
And then also you're trusting the instrumentation to teachers,

134
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,930
making sure that they understand how to evaluate the children that are in these

135
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:17,059
classrooms is something that we really want to focus on in this evaluation. And then thinking about more external oddity.

136
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,580
It may be difficult applying these results to children in schools everywhere just because

137
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,290
it is specifically focused on children who come from a low resource backgrounds.

138
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,430
So the external externality would be improved if we are looking at other programs that are also

139
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:33,950
focused on children potentially with like special needs are from underresourced communities.

140
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,770
So thinking about that, when we are applying the results to other programs, that's also pretty common for afterschool programs.

141
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:45,170
And then finally, that both outcome designs do require pretest. So that does limit our external validity as well.

142
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:54,250
Okay. So our data collection methods will be both quantitative and qualitative.

143
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,570
So for purposes of evaluation, we will expect that stuff.

144
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:05,740
We will maintain record of each session. So like the Ken stuff, we're making record acquisition and then we'll talk about whether or not they met,

145
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,840
the goals that they that was mentioned that were mentioned by Megan.

146
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,860
And they'll also take note of student engagement.

147
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,300
And then the second thing will be the staff will participate in monthly focus group

148
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,780
interviews to share the information that they've collected during the sessions.

149
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:30,819
And then for outcome of that, for outcome evaluation, we're looking at both quantitative and qualitative data collection.

150
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:41,080
So staff, teachers and parents will share information through through sit through a self field survey,

151
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,760
and then they'll share this data that staff will share the data,

152
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:51,639
attendance data, and then teachers will share academic and academic performance data,

153
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:59,560
and then teachers and parents will also share information on observed behavioral changes.

154
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:09,569
So the survey that the. That the stuff the teachers and the parents are going to feel will be will have responses on a scale.

155
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:16,950
And also they have the option to freely answer questions so that the data can be triangulated.

156
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:26,500
So for our sampling strategy, we're going to do this in a sequential sort of manner.

157
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:36,070
So first, the parents and guardians of students who are enrolled in the program in January 2013 will be recruited to complete a survey,

158
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,090
and this will be a pretty fast survey for their students.

159
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,240
This would be a non probability convenient sample because we don't expect every parent to fill this out,

160
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:52,390
but we will be sending them home with all of the new students who are enrolled in the program at that time.

161
00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:00,850
From that initial survey that parents will fill out their filling out which teacher is involved with their student in the classroom?

162
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,810
Because the students on campus programs from all over Ann Arbor,

163
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:11,430
it was really difficult to determine which teachers would have more students in their classrooms that were can't participate.

164
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:18,270
So the sampling frame is set by the parent survey. And once we establish a number and how many teachers,

165
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:22,469
because we would establish a simple random sampling to identify which teachers

166
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:28,770
would then be sampled in the next pretest post-test segment of this evaluation.

167
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,360
In our data analysis. Therefore, we have three different data sets.

168
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:42,060
We have the process questions and evaluations from can staff, including attendance rules and things like that.

169
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:49,169
We have the parents outcomes, so what the parents are seeing in their students pretest process and what the teachers

170
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:56,160
are seeing and students both can participate in the content in a pretest and post-test.

171
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:04,650
We're doing this in order to help triangulate data, because if we just did one of these, we might not be, you know,

172
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:13,060
confident that all of our data would be the most accurate representation of how students are acting and their behavior and emotional regulation,

173
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:20,370
both in home and in the classroom. So our process questions again for you.

174
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,930
We're looking at the number of staff attending each after school session over time.

175
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,580
We're also looking at the number of students attending each afterschool session over time.

176
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,890
This is more descriptive analysis,

177
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:41,640
kind of qualitative assessment of fidelity to add to our report as a kind of just description of what's happening in the program.

178
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:49,440
The number of students attending each afterschool session will be combined with the parents surveys to try to

179
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,830
correlate the attendance records of each student to the outcomes that parents are seeing in their students.

180
00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:00,959
This is more difficult for the teachers because they're not assessing each individual student.

181
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:09,280
There's a classroom full. So the parent outcomes, again, we're looking at student level motivation to complete homework,

182
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,700
their grades in school, emotional regulation, things like this.

183
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:20,260
So this will be analyzed with a parent's t test between a pre testing process to assess for changes in.

184
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,460
Changes are made between the populations of the projects in the process.

185
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:34,959
The teacher outcomes is a little bit different. We can do a charity test as well as a two sample test to look at both between the treatment groups,

186
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,070
between non-participants and participants, as well as between a pretest and a post-test for each group.

187
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:52,569
Okay. So for dissemination, we're looking at news letters to parents, teachers and the fiscal sponsors.

188
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:58,600
So everyone, every stakeholder that is every investor party will be sent newsletters.

189
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:06,010
And then we're looking at also having an inclusive dinner party that will have that will also include students,

190
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:13,329
because we want the kids to understand what's going on and to see how the program went or how the program is going.

191
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:18,819
And then we will also have tailored social media posts for kids.

192
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:25,540
So we're thinking this young kids, but kids these days have phones and they use Tik Tok or Instagram, but mostly Tik Tok.

193
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:34,450
So we're thinking of targeted Tik Tok videos, for example, that are short and easy to understand.

194
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,150
Can you speed up the heart rate program?

195
00:22:52,400 --> 00:23:00,760
Um, I'm wondering about whether there was even third party in maturity and also whether the summer school.

196
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:14,599
Starting in January and then is going to be a whole year. So we're actually thinking of sorry if this wasn't clear.

197
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,790
We were thinking of starting in January and until the school year ends. So that would be the duration of our evaluation.

198
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,420
But definitely for further and greater evaluations, that's something.

199
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:34,440
So thanks for taking. Can you?

200
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,560
Forget the. Do you go back to the slums or the.

201
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,120
I think it was the. Here it.

202
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:49,890
But because my questions about the parents. So. Why you?

203
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,780
Did you think about the potential of doing?

204
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:01,019
A comparison group with parents who don't have kids.

205
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:10,970
I would try to work for between a very. Like if you get parents to complete surveys of their kids don't participate in.

206
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:18,320
Any of the cans. Services. Why not include them as kind of a comparison group?

207
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:24,860
I guess we did. That's a really good thought. We were just kind of focusing on just trying to get as much feedback as easily as possible.

208
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:29,900
Kind of keep it simple either send it home with the kids or just kind of grab as it pick up the kids.

209
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:35,980
So just kind of do that. But that's really good thought about trying to get some comparison groups kind of get engaged with that.

210
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,430
Just trying to see the easiest and best way to gather input from people.

211
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:47,569
I think we did consider that at one point, but decided that also a lot of these parents are probably also coming from under-resourced settings.

212
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,920
And so I'm not trying to overburden them.

213
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,929
If they have no investment in the program, then I think it would have been a little bit harder to convince them to try to fill out a survey.

214
00:24:53,930 --> 00:25:01,080
So that was just one of our considerations. But I think depending on how many resources we have this evaluation, we would consider investing more.

215
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:16,410
And one more question. So. I like the idea of the focus groups of staff.

216
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,550
To. Process. Related information.

217
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:27,470
Any considerations to. I don't want to.

218
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,570
Technically it's probably attrition, but or even just like a disinvestment in the market focus group as it goes along.

219
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,440
Any considerations for how they can mitigate that?

220
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,550
I think that was less of a concern because we are doing a focus group with ten staff.

221
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:50,740
And so if we incorporate into a kind of weekly or monthly step meetings and they would be regularly.

222
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:52,130
May. Okay.

223
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,909
I hope you. All right.

224
00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:02,330
Hello, everyone. We are a group 11 and we are presenting on our evaluation of the Healthy Living Ambassador program.

225
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,830
So as I'm sure we all know by now,

226
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:12,670
the Healthy Living Ambassadors program is an afterschool gardening program aimed to teach healthy living to elementary students and teenagers.

227
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:17,050
Activities included in this program include nutrition, education through my plate,

228
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,810
making healthy snacks from the harvest, from the community garden, and learning more about the plant cycle.

229
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:31,149
So the process evaluation questions that we concentrate on were to what extent do the healthy living ambassadors,

230
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,740
the teen mentors, have adequate support to implement the Program for the Children participants?

231
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:43,570
And did the activities of this program occur in the intended order and for our outcome evaluation questions we focus on?

232
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:49,690
Did the children in this program report an increased sense of knowledge on how to improve their diet after the intervention?

233
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:56,050
And how long after the intervention were the youth still partaking in the healthy eating habits and gardening that they learned in the program?

234
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,489
So the main purpose of our evaluation was to inform decision makers about how the

235
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:07,110
program can be best expanded to other areas to decrease rates of childhood obesity.

236
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:14,220
In the invested parties that we identified for our evaluation were the school staff in the schools where the program is being implemented.

237
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,129
The program staff that is actively implementing the program, the program participants,

238
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:28,950
including the elementary aged students and the teenager, mentors the families of the participants, the school board and the program funders.

239
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,169
So next we'll talk about the program description.

240
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:40,800
So it describes the social problems addressed by this program, which is childhood obesity rates, specifically among poor and ethnic minority children.

241
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:47,190
So why do we need this program? In California, the childhood obesity rate is 30.5%.

242
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,940
Reagan, California's number 24 in the U.S. on this health statistic.

243
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,350
And 28 rates among low income children aged 2 to 5 was 33%.

244
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,340
So we see the disproportionate impact of this public health issue on low income children.

245
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,780
In California, 44.1% of high schools didn't offer nutritious foods at lunch, and only 14.9% of them offer fruits and veggies.

246
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,200
In San Mateo. The rate of childhood obesity is in 2017.

247
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:18,849
Among fifth graders was 40.1%. There have been attempts to fix this problem, including interventions related to changing environmental factors,

248
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:24,820
using adult encouragement, parental education, nutrition, education, gardening activities and other physical activities.

249
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,770
So the first program we examined was cafeteria power, the cafeteria Power Plus project,

250
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,940
which focused on using role models and social support to influence the consumption of fruits and vegetables.

251
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,970
Another program was Food Feeding in Your Family.

252
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:43,510
That combined two unsuccessful programs into one that focused on parental feeding, content and nutritious education for low income families.

253
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:49,910
Next was Eat Your Way to Better Health that used garden based intervention activities where children started to maintain school gardens.

254
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:56,710
Green Our Planet STEM Garden provided education about garden ecosystem elements and other garden related education.

255
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:02,920
And then finally, a coordinated approach to child health, incorporated school based diet and physical activity interventions.

256
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,940
So the greatest success came from programs involving multi-component interventions.

257
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:12,790
And these results from these types of programs included an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption via adult encouragement.

258
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:19,180
Combining education for both parents and families and garden programs and increase in nutrition

259
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:23,350
knowledge was seen through the use of interventions involving activities in gardening education.

260
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:29,480
So next is the logic model, which shows various inputs and activities used to run the program.

261
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,850
Outputs that were created by various stakeholder stakeholders like the children and teen participants.

262
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:39,320
And then outcomes showed an increase in knowledge about gardening and healthy nutrition.

263
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:45,379
So this also showed an increase in fruit and veg consumption as well as teens specifically showed an

264
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:49,520
increase in motivation and self-efficacy to change their behaviors toward a more healthy manner.

265
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,320
The overall impact of this program was decreasing childhood obesity through

266
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,770
improving nutrition knowledge and cultivating healthy behaviors at a young age.

267
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:05,960
So lastly, as discussed earlier, many programs have attempted to decrease rates of childhood obesity, such as those listed here.

268
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,740
Overall, some studies showed moderate success, while some showed none at all.

269
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:15,290
So through these results, we see a need for new programs to be created to address this public health issue.

270
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:19,430
And so far, the only program seems to be quite successful.

271
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:25,219
So to begin with, our process evaluation, as I mentioned before,

272
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:29,959
our first process evaluation question is to what extent do the Healthy Living

273
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,100
Ambassadors have adequate support to implement the Program for Children participants?

274
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,120
The process indicators we use for this question are one program.

275
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,439
Teachers attendance and two of schools provided adequate space for the participants.

276
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:49,910
Guardian Next, our second process evaluation question is did the activities of this program occur in the intended order?

277
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:57,200
The process indicators for were use for this question are one if the intended strategies and activities were used.

278
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:02,120
And number two, if program teachers made any changes to the curriculum or followed it wholly.

279
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:09,820
Next for our outcome evaluation. As mentioned before, our first outcome evaluation question as to the children,

280
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,590
this program report an increased sense of knowledge regarding how to improve their diet after intervention and to how long

281
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:22,150
after the intervention were you still partaking in the healthy eating habits and gardening they learned during this program?

282
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:31,650
Our outcome evaluation plan will include a pre experimental, one group pretest, post-test design and the outcome indicators for these questions.

283
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:36,540
Our students attitudes about nutrition before and after participating in these interventions.

284
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:45,809
So in terms of methods, our sampling strategy focus on the high schools and elementary schools within that San Mateo,

285
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:52,230
California County that fit our criteria. We really wanted to focus on that cluster sampling within that county.

286
00:32:52,500 --> 00:33:01,290
As for our data collection plan, we focus on both quantitative and qualitative with our quantitative approach focusing mostly on online

287
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:06,930
surveys administered to the participants regarding their overall experience with the programs.

288
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:13,770
It will have a heavy emphasis on open ended questions and whether or not the program achieved its objectives.

289
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:19,290
For example, a question would be on a scale of 1 to 5, with five being most likely,

290
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,690
how would you rank your knowledge about nutrition after this program?

291
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:32,969
Offer the qualitative approach. We would focus on group interviews to get a more holistic understanding about the students experiences,

292
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:38,010
and we would have a note taker to summarize all the information in these sessions.

293
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:43,300
The next section that we are going to discuss is the analysis section.

294
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:51,300
So again, this study was a prefix for your mental one group pretest and protest design the assessments of the students.

295
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:57,030
We want to know what the assessments of the students increase sense of knowledge and how they can improve their diet.

296
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:00,329
The assessments will also collect be collected before and after three months,

297
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:05,670
and between the intervention and that post test will include questions regarding their relationships

298
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:09,180
built through the program and if they are have healthy relationships resulting from it.

299
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:12,659
The survey will also include questions about skills, learning from the program,

300
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:21,600
how accessible gardening resources are in the school for the students, and with indicators such as what skills that you cook.

301
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:27,360
Oh, so for the standards there is no comparison group for this study.

302
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,070
But again, we will be comparing both the pre and post test to gauge the success of the program.

303
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:39,500
Yeah. As for our dissemination plan,

304
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:47,570
our plan is to involve the program users in the dissemination efforts by communicating the message through various channels.

305
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:53,149
The aim is to consider using as many communication channels as possible to

306
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:57,620
ensure that the widest possible audience is exposed to the research findings.

307
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:02,120
These channels will be accessible and free, easy to use,

308
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:09,980
while also taking into consideration the cost and cost effectiveness of the use of the use of the channels.

309
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,080
By considering the pros and cons of each of the communication channels.

310
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:22,430
A more targeted plan of action will be developed for choosing the appropriate channels for different audiences.

311
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:30,520
These are our dissemination channels. We will have formal written reports.

312
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:37,060
The purpose of this is that the findings can be disseminated quickly and they are accessible and free.

313
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:43,540
The cons are that they may be tough for the audience to find for presentations in.

314
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:51,520
We do presentation in conferences and also town halls. The pros of this is that it will give us the opportunity to receive feedback.

315
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:59,830
Cons is that Scout scheduling could be very difficult a challenge for news and press releases.

316
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,920
The pros of these are that this can be distributed. This can distribute our findings widely.

317
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:11,230
And also the cons can be also that there is a small group of people.

318
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:19,120
Social media. I propose. The purpose of this is to provide a broad reach of audience and is free to use.

319
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:25,620
But then the cons is that it lack credibility for peer reviews, journal articles.

320
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:33,910
This will lend, you know, scientific credibility to our findings, but the cons that it might take long to reveal.

321
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,630
With this, our presentation is concluded.

322
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,520
Do we have any questions?

323
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:08,280
After we receive the feedback, we can analyze the, you know, put it back into the evaluation process and then do the whole process again.

324
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,720
Especially since we're talking about expanding the program to other areas.

325
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:17,790
The feedback that we get from the town halls would help inform that as well.

326
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:29,640
You have mentioned potentially using group interviews or focus groups for your qualitative assessment.

327
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:34,920
I was wondering why you might have chose that as opposed to individual interviews and sort of what the thinking on that was.

328
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:42,780
Yeah, I can do that. So for the focus of group interviews, I know a lot of concern surrounds the whole group think notion.

329
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,940
But we found that the interviews.

330
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:54,719
Kind of facilitate more active discussion as opposed to individual interviews where students these are younger students,

331
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,770
they might not they might be afraid to answer certain questions.

332
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:02,730
So when they have their peers surrounding them, it engages.

333
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:16,130
So clear a clarifying question about the responsibility to the in town hall.

334
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,290
Are you thinking of those similar audiences or different audiences?

335
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:28,120
And the reason why I ask is because just thinking about the information that you share.

336
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,480
Those formats might. Different based on.

337
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:42,790
We for that, we would like to gauge the opinions, feedback from the community members to look back into our program so we can.

338
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:52,420
So these would be like conferences like. Local conflict like maybe like conference within the essential.

339
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,240
What is that? The seed and cemetery.

340
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:12,790
Cemetery or community. Europe brought it in.

341
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:18,140
My time for the presentation is as we go along. Thanks.

342
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:29,430
Yeah. So I worry about Taiwan, too, right?

343
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:18,440
Which. What am like.

344
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:28,630
Hill. Yeah, but the handheld was right there.

345
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:35,750
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

346
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:51,910
No, no, no, no. And so I kept thinking, well, you know, I'm just I don't know what I'm going to do.

347
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:56,040
Okay. How does this work? Right. That's right.

348
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:02,070
You. Okay. Is this okay?

349
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,420
All right. Ready? Great. Hello.

350
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:14,840
We are group nine and we're here to present a culturally responsive and responsible evaluation of food gatherers neighborhood grocery initiative.

351
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:20,030
We are Allison Chamorro, Adrian, Noel and Alexis.

352
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:27,120
Just a quick overview of the agenda. We will talk about investor parties.

353
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,040
The program description will focus the evaluation design.

354
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:37,410
We'll talk about our evidence, our conclusions, and our communication of findings.

355
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:44,500
Just a quick CDC framework reference line, just to refresh your memory.

356
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:52,540
All right, stage one, the investor parties will include clients.

357
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,960
There's a couple of examples listed. Staff.

358
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:05,680
Funders, which will include places like United Way, Arbor Area Community Foundation and the Office of Economic Development.

359
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,530
Similar organizations to food gatherers.

360
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:17,660
Couple examples their partner organizations to food gatherers, including faith based systems like churches and community.

361
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,950
So that includes Washtenaw County residents who are interested in the community

362
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:25,480
benefits of lowering instances of food insecurity and local government officials.

363
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:36,670
The purpose of our evaluation is three parts to see if the site distribution managers are trained on culturally appropriate food quality and variety.

364
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:41,170
If the trainings inform how SD, CMS order and distribute items.

365
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:47,110
And if it changes. And if changes to this process shape quality of service for program participants.

366
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:52,000
And then we want to highlight the importance of using to approach this evaluation.

367
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,790
Through our literature review, we discovered that the seven NGO's sites include a diverse and rich population of residents.

368
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:05,110
Racial and ethnic groups include Asian-Americans, Hispanic populations, Russians and other groups.

369
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,140
Given the wide, diverse diversity of the residents,

370
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:14,560
we decided to incorporate the CRE framework to ensure the inclusion of as many community members as possible.

371
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:20,910
Right? Well. Yeah. Thank you. So now we describing the program.

372
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,690
So it looks like.

373
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:33,900
Yeah, so many, if not all of us have probably heard of food gatherers, which is the major food rescue and food bank here in Ann Arbor.

374
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:40,440
And it aims to alleviate, alleviate hunger and eliminate its causes in Washtenaw County.

375
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,839
And the organization partners with a number of local nonprofits and other programs

376
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:51,240
to provide no to low cost food to members in the community and food gatherers.

377
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:59,720
Procures source and distributes food across the community. And so that takes us to the Neighborhood Grocery Initiative.

378
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:09,670
And that is a food gatherers program that supports access to healthy foods by bringing food closer to home.

379
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:19,960
And it's essentially a collection of three monthly food distributions that are held at a variety of affordable housing communities across the county.

380
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:25,330
And the products that are provided through the distributions include.

381
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:30,460
Fresh produce. Shelf stable items, protein items and the like.

382
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:34,480
And the program is operated and funded directly through food gatherers.

383
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:39,340
And again, the organization secures and delivers the foods directly to those sites.

384
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:47,900
And the distribution is managed by site staff and volunteers at zero cost to the MCI sites.

385
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,860
And those staff members are trained through food gatherers.

386
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:58,360
And so. Just describing a bit of the need for the program.

387
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:03,429
And there's just a lack of access to enough affordable, healthy food for residents.

388
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:14,650
In Washtenaw County, about 11% of residents are food insecure, and the NGO itself exists as a part of a broader network to supplement existing.

389
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,240
Food resources are led by other partner agencies and programs.

390
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:25,209
And again, it serves a population here in Washtenaw County with the focus of supporting individuals,

391
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:31,810
families and seniors, especially those who are low income or just can't travel to other food distribution sites.

392
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,110
And the NGO itself is an ongoing program. Yeah.

393
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:53,610
So essentially this logic model was created based on some short and long term outcomes that India included in a recent evaluation report.

394
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:58,770
Creating this larger model we can add and more input as we wanted to create a more

395
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:04,770
robust understanding of India's ample contributions to this program's processes.

396
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:14,400
We also updated the outcomes as well, using the smart criteria to kind of increase their performance outcomes as well.

397
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:21,290
And then we also went in and we kind of added some activities, outputs and short circuits,

398
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:29,159
short term immediate term outcomes as well, because we saw there were some gaps and we saw that it was some long term outcomes,

399
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:36,630
but we didn't know how we would get to those if we didn't have like the appropriate short term, the immediate goals to kind of lead to that.

400
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,830
Ideally, we will probably consult India before doing this.

401
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:46,260
Our role would just be a facilitator asking them how do they want to fill in these gaps?

402
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:57,880
Next slide. Okay.

403
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:03,079
So moving on to our evaluation design for our process evaluation,

404
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,920
we will conduct semi-structured interviews of the site distribution managers in

405
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,640
order to assess their experiences and perspectives of the program representation.

406
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:13,490
So some questions we will be asking them,

407
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:20,420
and these interviews will be to what extent are teams engaging with residents at the housing sites when they are selecting and purchasing food items?

408
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:28,190
To what extent are teams following food safety protocols, and how can food gatherers better support site distribution managers?

409
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:35,630
This will work to indicate the attitudes and beliefs that the site distribution managers have as far as their level of support from food gatherers.

410
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:41,459
For our outcome evaluation,

411
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:50,250
we will be using a one group pretest post-test design and we will be doing self-administered surveys of stems and engineer participants.

412
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:56,430
And this will work to assess the level of change that we saw following these trainings that Assam's received.

413
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:06,320
So some specific questions that we will ask on these surveys will be did the estimates report a change in

414
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:11,720
knowledge after the workshops that the stadiums in their program report a change in behavior or skill level,

415
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:17,420
and at the end, participants report a change in level of satisfaction at these site distribution sites.

416
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:22,729
So this will work to really assess their changes in knowledge and behavior and food quality

417
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:26,990
and variety in culturally appropriate selection among the teams through trainings.

418
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,399
And also, it will work to assess how those changes have affected the satisfaction in food

419
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:36,080
quality variety in culturally appropriate food selection among MGI participants.

420
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,490
Hello. Okay, I am sitting because I'm not feeling that well.

421
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:55,170
But for our data collection methods, as mentioned, we'll be doing semi-structured interviews for the process evaluation,

422
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:03,240
and those interviews will be facilitated by the evaluation team, and those interviews will be in person or via Zoom.

423
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:11,700
And we decided to use a convenient sampling method that's best aligned with our scheduling timeline to make sure that we're keeping costs low.

424
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:17,069
We're also going to make sure that the employees are compensated for 30 minutes of labor,

425
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:22,320
given the 20 minute expected survey completion time limits, our interview completion time.

426
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:28,860
There are a lot of benefits to this design, including the opportunity to get a question,

427
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:32,940
clarification from the interviewer as opposed to a self administrated method.

428
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:39,690
We also think that using a semi-structured interview format will give us richer data into the questions we're asking,

429
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:49,980
as opposed to a structured interview. We also think that having in-person or zoom interviews with another human being will reduce non-response error.

430
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:57,150
And we also think that the non staff interview facilitation can help to reduce social desirability bias.

431
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:04,200
However, we do feel that because the evaluation team is still working on behalf of the organization,

432
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,980
that that probably won't completely get rid of any social desirability bias.

433
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,310
So that is still sort of a limitation. There are additional costs of compensating the employee.

434
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:19,650
So that's an additional cost and it's additional labor to execute.

435
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:26,520
Having people conduct these interviews and lastly, having a semi-structured interview format can be harder.

436
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:33,419
Do it here within 20 minutes, which could also cause some issues for our outcome evaluation.

437
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:42,000
As mentioned, we'll be doing a pretest post-test design using self-administered surveys to both BSD, EMS and GI clients.

438
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:48,630
And so that will be a total of four surveys where the INSEAD clients and the teams will be administered.

439
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:59,400
The first one one week before SD workshops, in the second one, one month after the workshops, and it will be administered using Qualtrics online.

440
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:04,500
And we decided to use a simple, simple random sampling method for SDM.

441
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,400
In a stratified sampling method for INSEAD clients.

442
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:14,010
We decided to use a stratified sampling method for the clients because we wanted to make sure that we were

443
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:22,649
prioritizing making sure that they are representative of the client population by key demographics like age,

444
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:25,470
household size, racial background, income.

445
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:35,040
And we designed these surveys to be completed in under 20 minutes, which again allows us to compensate employees for 30 minutes of labor.

446
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:41,010
An engineer clients will be given a $20 gift card for each survey that they do,

447
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:50,730
resulting in up to $40 if they complete both benefits to this provides a more accurate understanding of the program impact over time,

448
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,149
and it can also help reduce social desirability.

449
00:51:54,150 --> 00:52:00,360
Bias in compensation could also help to mitigate the non-response error, however,

450
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:05,400
because it is self-administered, that could also lead to some issues around non-response error.

451
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:12,210
And there could also be limitations in the costs involved with compensating both of these groups.

452
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:18,210
And doing a self-administered survey method can also lead to a misunderstanding of the questions.

453
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:27,860
So now we move on to justifying conclusions. So as mentioned in our evaluations, we will be assessing.

454
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:31,550
Do you find it easy or challenging to follow the current food expiration guidelines?

455
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:37,790
An indicator for this will be the attitudes or beliefs of Adams regarding the food expiration date guidelines and a center

456
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:44,720
of success will be that at least 85% of seems utilize strategies to increase consistency of high food quality distribution.

457
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,800
Another one would be how do you typically interact with residents at housing sites?

458
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,510
And the indicator will be the extent and quality of engagement between items and residents.

459
00:52:53,870 --> 00:53:00,410
And the standard of success will be Simms report discussion around culturally appropriate food selection with coworkers, participants and friends.

460
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:09,459
So looking at our analysis, so our daily data analysis process,

461
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:16,150
we include a mixed method approach because our data collection process includes both quantitative and qualitative data.

462
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:23,440
There will be two periods of data analysis, and so we will analyze the greatest in the semester master interviews,

463
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,530
and then this information will be compared to the posters, which will be disseminated on following the intervention.

464
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:34,390
The information will then be compared to the overall change of the program.

465
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:45,820
Data will be stored in a CSB file, and then we will create a data dashboard to allow the staff to better to easily interpret analyze this data.

466
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:50,510
Looking at the process evaluation,

467
00:53:50,510 --> 00:54:00,169
we are utilizing a qualitative software more cell input in the ultimate coding technique and reason for doing it is we want to make sure we

468
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:09,500
get Michael more realistic organic responses from these site distribution managers to kind of better understand their unique experiences,

469
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:18,350
their size. We'll also use a relational analysis and a reason for using these is the better understand

470
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:24,860
the influence the action perception is in the overall outcomes of that particular site.

471
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:30,660
Site distribution managers. Will.

472
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:37,290
We also want to use this approach so it can help improve the experience of the residents as well.

473
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,639
How we hope to kind of capture the unique experiences of this,

474
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:49,440
all of the site distribution managers and then how that kind of relates to the residents experiences as well because they work so closely together.

475
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:58,440
For the outcome, evaluation will be measured through surveys that we include, both open and close in questions.

476
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:04,770
The open ended question will be analyzed in a similar format to the same interviews,

477
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:12,720
and then the closing questions will be analyzed using our or some kind of other data analytics software.

478
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:18,300
The closed in equation will be analyzed and interpreted through descriptive analysis,

479
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:26,550
and then we will be focusing on trends and patterns such as frequency of responses for specific answer choice variation,

480
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:29,700
where most participants will file within larger scale,

481
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:38,190
like a scale question ranges and then theater routine disease to evaluate the commonality amongst all of the different responses.

482
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:44,799
So for our interpretation, we will be utilizing the invested parties that we mentioned at the beginning,

483
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,970
such as the staff, the coordinators and the GI program.

484
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:54,140
Participants on this one called biweekly meetings and they will produce a report of their findings.

485
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:59,410
In addition, they will identify 3 to 5 themes that they observe within the data collection process.

486
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:06,860
So we're going to move on to ensuring use and lessons learned.

487
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:14,180
And so we anticipate forming populations to use the findings of this evaluation and the first being community organizations,

488
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,200
we expect them to use the results to inform programing and better understand the

489
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,880
needs and preferences of shared clients at the servants recipients themselves.

490
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,740
We expect them to use the results to provide feedback and to share perspectives and

491
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:33,080
recommendations which will be used to inform the Action Plan based on evaluation results.

492
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:39,380
The Food Gather staff and administration will use the results for data driven quality improvement and planning.

493
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:45,110
And then finally, the funders will use the results to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the program.

494
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:54,739
So these are kind of some of our products in terms of our communication plan and how we anticipate we will communicate with folks.

495
00:56:54,740 --> 00:57:00,550
So the participants, we have a few different approaches just to keep it accessible.

496
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:05,050
So a community report, a hybrid townhall.

497
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:14,950
So by hybrid we mean like in-person and over Zoom and a social media campaign which will be paired with the town hall for the site managers and staff.

498
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:23,769
We will be using a data dashboard which was referenced earlier, as well as a feedback form for other community organizations.

499
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:27,790
We will be using a community report and an executive summary.

500
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:32,380
And then finally for the funders, we'll be utilizing a formal evaluation report.

501
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:39,850
All of these products, except for the formal reports and Google Form, will be translated to make available into different languages,

502
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:43,150
which again is just responsive to the specific population that we're serving.

503
00:57:54,890 --> 00:58:03,670
Yeah. I was experienced, curious. It's my understanding.

504
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:06,650
Five. The staff also attended.

505
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:21,410
Yeah, I definitely think we would try to like really work to kind of build that relationship with its distribution manager,

506
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:29,240
letting them know that the information quality is not, you know, hurt the arm or, you know, take away from their job.

507
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:35,149
We don't have to be far away from wages more. So we really want to improve like the outcome of the each individual side.

508
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:43,940
So we were really going and trying to set those standards and and try to build a relationships and letting them know the purpose of this evaluation.

509
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:51,170
Yeah, we're also anticipating having evaluation team staff rather than the grocery initiative staff facility, folks.

510
00:58:51,740 --> 00:59:04,510
It's a good question. Great work.

511
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:11,080
I have one question about the survey. I mentioned that it would be a self-administered Qualtrics survey.

512
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:15,950
Did you think about offering non-electronic? Or what were your.

513
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:42,620
So it was really more of. The cool decision that.

514
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:59,450
So my question. So you the MGI or MGI participants would be.

515
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:05,520
The strategy is simple, right? And so how did you.

516
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:11,230
Any consideration for how you would go about getting that information?

517
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:16,900
From the site. Given that some time.

518
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:25,060
They don't always collect all the. We don't think that it will.

519
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:35,260
Relying on existing organization in the. But we were trying to.

520
01:00:54,780 --> 01:01:06,460
Right. So with that, we have got to spend some time and we're all right.

521
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:26,330
Thank you. I mean, there was a bit to my recitations on Thursday that we'll be saying about joining him for the third sing song, I feel Thursday.

522
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:27,060
Thank you. Right.

523
01:02:35,590 --> 01:03:02,350
Where? I got a little bit paranormal, you know?

524
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:41,690
Yeah, true. But you know, she said the exact same thing, that I'm out of business, which I think is kind of the.

525
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:55,210
And things like that.

526
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:01,390
But the fact is that I really hope.

527
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:23,410
And that means that you can give the perception that's one of the anomalies is that at least that if they ever to do that.

528
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:34,330
So you can have change. I knew I worked with.

529
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:49,730
And I knew that he was real, which I thought that's why I was like, okay, we're going to do this for a living.

530
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:54,050
It's not the right things.

531
01:04:54,060 --> 01:05:02,300
Real important how we can.

532
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:12,440
So it's is because they.

533
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:17,910
You don't even know. Same person.

534
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:28,370
You have insurance. May I have your.

535
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:33,460
Emre Can they get to know the people? Ticky Fullerton From a data quality perspective.

536
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:43,730
I like that name.

537
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:50,740
So some people. Some. But they won't be able to attend.

538
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:54,140
I was invited, but not all the way.

539
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:59,700
So, you know, we have consistency across. Recognize.

540
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:07,970
But it's not all paradise. Be.

541
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:16,720
What was different between the parties that like that. And then there's just also.

542
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:25,090
You do that by observing like you have to see the.

543
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:36,680
It's kind of like organized chaos sometimes, which is not an insult in ways where you got like 2 hours.

544
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:41,050
People are lining up for hours before that just to get food.

545
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:47,650
Yes. But I'm sure that's going to be out there.

546
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:54,800
You just walk away from them. At least that is not right there, it looks like.

547
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:06,140
But I still want to live with them.

548
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:15,740
I never told you. So more or less on the outside.

549
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:22,740
But this year you spoke to them. So I thought it was over.

550
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:26,750
I'll go find a solution to my life.

551
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:31,670
I know that we. A lack of finishing up this all.

552
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:47,310
Yes, yes, yes. You have to get out of here.

553
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:57,140
I know that you do all that.

554
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:07,250
So you're not really looking for anything?

555
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:12,670
I was like, no one likes to push me off the ledge.

556
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:20,200
They were like, She might fit my bed.

557
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:28,170
You know, they're the same people. But yeah, this is a great thing.

558
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:38,220
And then I also got this, you know, they may not even be thinking.

559
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:52,210
Which I never considered. They say only rate this one, but the one they won't come next.

560
01:08:52,300 --> 01:09:02,770
Right. Or the Monday was yesterday when I get a little bit sick in this world.

561
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:12,020
Okay. Well, we know this territory you get out of all this one hour interview.

562
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:17,760
Yeah. So I think this is one of the in this one, we get upper hand in this one.

563
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:24,810
We do not want to fly out and the whip right now.

564
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:36,360
And he would be like, yeah, but that's all right.

565
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:42,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

566
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:49,410
And basically I feel like I don't care about anything else.

567
01:09:50,250 --> 01:10:05,820
It will just be there. And then I went and found out that you might have a job, I don't think.

568
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:16,000
They're looking for runners. Oh, you know, they were having problem with all the receivers.

569
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:33,600
So, you know, they got together and I felt like, you know, that I would just be like, man, I can't even do that.

570
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:42,950
But I but I tell you, you're afraid that the problem is I need to talk about.

571
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:54,910
Oh, yeah. Okay.

572
01:10:56,850 --> 01:11:02,340
Yeah, right. Yeah. You're just like, okay. Yeah. So actually, I'm to.

573
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:09,530
It was this guy. He's from Michigan or any worse a or anything.

574
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:13,800
Remember his name? Let's put a damper.

575
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:22,080
And again, this cocktail is basically like a he's asking about the.

576
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:26,799
Yeah. And it was still only available.

577
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,910
You have one case. All right.

578
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:39,430
So, you know, for the past few days, many dealmakers, namely Monday and Tuesday, they said that they were.

579
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:45,180
What was it like to wind down in a workshop?

580
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:49,860
Oh, it was full of all the trees.

581
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:53,440
You. Paul. Tracy.

582
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:54,660
Tracy was there.

583
01:11:55,460 --> 01:12:07,790
Um, there was a really funny like yeah, she left her if you don't have a date, if I did want to know how kind of a little girl they have to name.

584
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:17,370
All from. And. When she did, she looked like a little.

585
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:25,240
Sometimes I would do that. I'm trying to do the workshop.

586
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:31,480
So that part of. Well, Star.

587
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:37,950
So then you sort of go. So.

588
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:44,720
I work for Tracy. I don't recall in.

589
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:50,690
You. They throw you out their.

590
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:12,330
With somebody said, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

591
01:13:16,970 --> 01:13:21,290
Lived through. I never live out here. Can they open?

592
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:29,319
That proves it, everybody. We got to go right here at the University of Michigan.

593
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:32,830
Go straight to everything.

594
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:39,740
You know, outside of academics.

595
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:43,480
There's more in relation to you, as I was getting.

596
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:53,310
Okay. So what part of means tittering is.

597
01:13:54,110 --> 01:13:55,640
I don't know if enough people are doing it.

598
01:13:55,820 --> 01:14:02,900
That's why I'm curious, you know, all that kind of work with like corporations and companies and essentially you the valuation.

599
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:08,040
It's like the structure of the processes, but had some policies.

600
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:13,160
All that stuff. In relation to employee health.

601
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:25,890
Almost like. There are.

602
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:36,249
This. Associations. Email me and keep on.

603
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:42,110
Is the Michigan Primary Care Association the best? That's for the my house.

604
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:46,880
So if there's an association. It focuses.

605
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:57,560
But you're not telling us specifically about the health care. Now the photo makes sense of it.

606
01:14:57,630 --> 01:15:03,760
It is a thing. I just I can't think of an excuse. You probably know better than I do a lot of the best local.

607
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:07,790
And certainly because it's not a it's not how I'll tell the minister.

608
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:17,530
Yeah. So to give some background I kind of did like for I was designer director at the sports companies.

609
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:24,550
So I like work that go from there and I have this experience that every company I worked at was like.

610
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:29,550
Pretty much like a two year mark. Like burnout and social problems.

611
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:36,290
But a lot of it was like. Really like. The company itself and how it runs.

612
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:41,600
And so what they do like the wellness programs in place, but like.

613
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:51,480
God, I think this. But that in my employee health I feel like it's not really.

614
01:15:56,210 --> 01:16:00,860
I mean, there are people doing it. It's just not my specialty areas.

615
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:05,590
I can't think of anything. But if you email me.

616
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:13,710
Probably. I've also decided that if I want to go back into the world or if I want to work for.

617
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:21,180
So I'm kind of exploring. I keep telling my mom.

618
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:26,010
The one about. This was an employee.

619
01:16:26,270 --> 01:16:30,750
This was. But it wasn't a corporate foundation. In that corporate mindset.

620
01:16:36,870 --> 01:16:40,810
Project Spark had a fire. It was early and I tried to do.

621
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:47,690
Hear about that. And it just it built the tension built for like two years.

622
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:51,110
And then finally they were like, this isn't working out now.

623
01:16:51,110 --> 01:17:01,470
It's like you. He's definitely. They don't want to change.

624
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:10,890
They quote the status quo. So.

625
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:15,650
Yeah. Okay. Oh, Emilia. Yeah.

626
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:20,290
My other part. But I did a survey.

627
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:25,790
This semester like interviews with. I really.

628
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:34,670
And I decided it could be a parent. So a lot of the challenges they have.

629
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:45,910
I don't work here, but. We looked at what was the moment?

630
01:17:50,740 --> 01:18:02,870
It's positive. Center for causes organizations may have.

631
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:11,579
She's in metals and does some internal work around burnout. In analyzing drivers of burnout.

632
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:16,810
But I don't know. At its heart.

633
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:37,450
No, there are some. I know what you mean, but you can only say so much.

634
01:18:37,470 --> 01:18:46,870
I know. I know what? Your pals. I love all of you over here.

635
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:55,840
Captain. I do know that you've got an excellent job.

636
01:18:57,550 --> 01:19:09,160
It's like I just talked about a project. The follow up follow a follow up and.

637
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:15,150
Support for and. I would also consider.

638
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:36,590
For. Around the.

639
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:44,530
And then. But some of them don't even like to. He's.

640
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:51,580
I. Going to do the research.

641
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:55,720
Well. Or do you want to be?
