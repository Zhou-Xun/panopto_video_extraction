00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,640
After watching this video,

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,990
you will be able to use

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,500
the Poisson distribution
and robust variances

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,635
to overcome convergence issues
in log-binomial models.

5
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:24,150
One of the problems with
log-binomial models is

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,330
that sometimes they have
convergence problems.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,625
You may get an error
in your staff log

8
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:33,085
saying that the model
failed to converge.

9
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:35,390
What is convergence?

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,115
In a very loose way,

11
00:00:37,115 --> 00:00:39,710
models are fit by finding

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,735
the model that better
reflects the data you have,

13
00:00:42,735 --> 00:00:44,720
and that's usually done by

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,585
maximizing the log
likelihood function.

15
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:50,750
I'm finding the maximum
likelihood estimate.

16
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,820
Whenever this process cannot

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,995
find that maximum
likelihood estimate,

18
00:00:54,995 --> 00:00:58,315
then you will get that
convergence error.

19
00:00:58,315 --> 00:01:00,090
The reasons for fail to

20
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,600
converge are beyond the
scope of this course,

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,490
but although not able to provide

22
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,650
details on why models
don't converge,

23
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,180
at least I can give you

24
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,100
one potential solution to
make the model to converge.

25
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,110
There are different
options to deal with this,

26
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,300
but one of the most
popular ones is

27
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,180
to use a modified Poisson method.

28
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,220
If you think of a sample of

29
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,989
binomial data as being a
special case of a Poisson,

30
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:30,020
or the probability of a
value of two or greater is

31
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,090
low enough that you will not see

32
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,250
values greater than
one in the data,

33
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,070
in that case, you can
fit a Poisson model.

34
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,810
The only problem is that

35
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,000
the standard errors
will be too large.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,130
In that case, you can use
robust variance estimation.

37
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,470
Even though we didn't have
a convergence problem,

38
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,080
we're going to use the same
example as before with

39
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,480
hypertriglyceridemia
as the outcome

40
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,545
and the modern dietary
pattern as this portion.

41
00:01:56,545 --> 00:01:59,120
This is the code that we can use

42
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,535
to run this modified
Poisson method.

43
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:04,175
Once more, we will
use PROC GENMOD.

44
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:07,445
Since we're assuming an
underlying Poisson distribution,

45
00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:10,490
we will use the proper
distribution and link.

46
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,965
Poisson and log in
this situation.

47
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:15,080
Now we have a new statement,

48
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,900
the repeated statement
that is used to trick

49
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,320
SAS into calculating
robust variances.

50
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,540
It looks definitely weird because

51
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,495
we don't have repeated
measures, but it will work.

52
00:02:26,495 --> 00:02:28,220
In order for this to work,

53
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,540
also you have to declare

54
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,395
the ID variable in
the class statement.

55
00:02:32,395 --> 00:02:34,200
It will run that code.

56
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,895
Going straight to our estimates,

57
00:02:35,895 --> 00:02:39,120
we can see that we get the
same risk ratio than before.

58
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,265
Remember that we're still
calculating a risk ratio,

59
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:44,885
regardless of using a
Poisson distribution.

60
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:48,910
We interpret this as a
risk ratio same as before.

61
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,945
What online convergence issues

62
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:54,330
are common with
low-binomial models?

63
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,000
Using a modified
Poisson method with

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,500
robust variances can
overcome the problem.

65
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,290
The Poisson robust model
is just a trick to

66
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,050
run a low-binomial model
that does not converge.

67
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,120
You are still modeling
risks you still

68
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,365
interpret the measure of
association as a risk ratio.

69
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:13,335
In summary, in this video,

70
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:16,514
we used the Poisson distribution
and robust variances

71
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:20,075
to overcome convergence issues
in low-binomial models.

72
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,400
In the next video, we
will continue with

73
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,912
low-binomial models in the
context of a regression study.
