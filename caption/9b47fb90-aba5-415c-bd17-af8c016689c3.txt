00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,750
Good afternoon.

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:28,200
This is a retrospectively recorded lecture and I promised I'm recording this lecture retrospectively because it was not so successfully recorded.

3
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,760
So when I gave it on the first day of the class.

4
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:45,390
So the title of this lecture is Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Basic Concepts and Principles.

5
00:00:52,590 --> 00:01:07,200
Under this talk, I'm going to introduce you to some important terminology that captures some important concepts and principles of infectious disease.

6
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:16,200
And then I will introduce you to the classification systems that have four different utilities.

7
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,070
We are also where discuss transmission means and the characteristics.

8
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:30,450
These are essential for infectious disease research.

9
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:38,820
More specifically, we're discussing talk about infectivity, pathogenicity,

10
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:48,930
interference of three major characteristics in the description of three terminologies.

11
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:58,950
Use the form describing the characteristics pathogenesis of infectious agents.

12
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,210
The nature. History of the infection.

13
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,470
Key components in infectious disease epidemiology.

14
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,680
So why do we need to understand all the terminology?

15
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:32,210
Because they describe some important components in infectious disease, clinical and public health research.

16
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:48,160
First we have for some terms use generally some general terms about infectious diseases, which includes a host source risk for.
