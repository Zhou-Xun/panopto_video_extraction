1
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:22,939
Hey. Good morning, everybody. So we don't have a ton of content to get through today in terms of like number of slides,

2
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:30,349
but hopefully we'll have some good discussion and make sure that you guys feel comfortable with,

3
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:39,469
especially this first section of the facility where you do get the same doctor calls nutrition assessment class.

4
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,590
Have you guys taken that or are you taking it concurrently? No.

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,870
Next semester. So she will build on, you know, we do.

6
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,860
We do two days of laboratory data.

7
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:58,550
There could be like a whole class on a lot of these topics. So she'll get into a lot more of that as well.

8
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,680
But I want just like a basic understanding of of some of the topics today.

9
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:12,290
And then if we have time, which I anticipate we will, we'll just talk about the exam for next week, just so you know how that's going on.

10
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:19,509
Okay. So before we get started, does anybody have any questions, anything we covered last week,

11
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:27,669
I know we kind of went quickly through the estimating energy needs, but we can get plenty more practice on that.

12
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,150
But ah, how are you guys feeling so far? Yes.

13
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,360
So the exam is. Yes. And then you hear nothing about.

14
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,010
It will be through campus. Yeah. You'll access it through campus.

15
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,190
Yes, yes, yes, I'd say. Yeah.

16
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,810
So this is what I wanted to talk to you about. You have a class directly after this.

17
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:02,250
These days, some days I think it's a small number of students do.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,360
So we can just talk about it now.

19
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,270
So this first exam,

20
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:20,780
initially we just had two exams in this class and a midterm and a final and feedback I would get from every year like there's too much material.

21
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,950
And then the first exam, the midterm. So I've now chunked it into two exams.

22
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,640
The exam when it was in person has always been designed to be taken in the time allotted for class.

23
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,590
An hour and 20 minutes, maybe an hour and a half, and it would take a little bit longer.

24
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:45,150
Ever since it's moved to online, if I I've found if I give you more time, students take more time.

25
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,640
So you will. Whereas in the class it's critical sometimes.

26
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:59,250
So I've worked on trying to pare down like the calculations in the case just because I think a lot of time get spent on that.

27
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:07,680
Long story short, I will give you plenty of time, but it is intended to only take about an hour and 20 minutes.

28
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:16,950
Okay. So what I'm thinking is it'll be available starting at 8:00, but you can access it at any time during the day.

29
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,990
So you have to open it before midnight. That is close.

30
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,430
Once you open the exam, you do have to finish it like you have that one attempt.

31
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:34,440
But I'll give you like 3 hours or something to do it just because I've always debated whether I should do that.

32
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:45,620
But I think I'm just getting the emails like I didn't finish or, you know, even though it's designed for you to be able to finish well enough time.

33
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:54,900
But I just don't want you to stress about the time. That being said, just with the availability to have your lecture notes doing it at home,

34
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:01,409
I think it almost there's a lack of preparation because you think biologists have access to everything during the exam,

35
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:07,889
and that's what tends to take more time. You don't need looking everything up, just, you know, prepare yourself,

36
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:15,000
go into the exam knowing that you have access to your materials to seek it on your own, of course.

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,540
But try not to stress out too much.

38
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:28,020
Yeah, it's almost seems more stressful when you have access to everything, which is what I found, which has been an interesting finding.

39
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:37,140
So you'll have plenty of time to take it. You need to start the exam before midnight on Tuesday and you'll have to finish it once you start it.

40
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,230
Any questions on that? Yeah.

41
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,850
Start. Well, let's see.

42
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:59,800
I guess I can make it available starting very early. Yeah.

43
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,910
I don't want it to run into like if you have a plan set.

44
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:13,420
So I can make it. For those of you that you have a class at ten, I can make it so that it's like published and ready to go very early that morning.

45
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,690
Still have to drive home. In class.

46
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:26,470
Yeah. But so. But I anticipate that it should not take you 3 hours.

47
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,780
I know some of you are going to take the whole time. Just, that's just how.

48
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,870
It works, but it shouldn't take that long.

49
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,910
Okay. So I'll make it available very early. But you can access it any time during the day.

50
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:50,840
Yes. You know, so it'll be multiple choice, short answer and like a short case study.

51
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,420
So it's it's not going to be just all case studies. That's what tends to take a lot of time.

52
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:06,200
Okay. And if you have more questions on that, we can discuss either after class today or on Thursday as well.

53
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,399
All right. So let's start we're going to talk about laboratory data.

54
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,799
So biomarkers that we get on our patients, especially when they're hospitalized.

55
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:27,840
They do get a lot of lab strong for various reasons, usually every day, but definitely a lot of times when they first come in.

56
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:35,710
And so we need to understand how to interpret these in terms of nutrition.

57
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,840
It's not as straightforward as I think a lot of our patients think.

58
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:48,060
And also, you know, dietitians, we need to understand that the interpretation can be quite complex.

59
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:53,340
So we're going to start with the biochemical assessment of iron deficiency and nutritional anemia.

60
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,220
Today, we'll talk about water balance a little bit as well.

61
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:05,580
And then Thursday, we'll get a little bit more detail into various electrolytes and talk about those zero protein markers.

62
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,570
And then I'll have a little bit of a soapbox on vitamin D.

63
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,790
Okay. So the learning objective for this group of sites,

64
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:24,240
I want us to be able to identify components of a hematological test and describe the role of each in the diagnosis of anemia.

65
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:34,160
So let's start with just some basic. You watch like a short video and just some basic information on lab about things, but.

66
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,240
Most patients at some point will have to see a clinical chemistry panel.

67
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,560
So one of those may be something. Complete blood count.

68
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:52,110
I'm sure you've all heard of the term CBC. These are the components of a cbdc.

69
00:07:52,140 --> 00:08:00,910
Some might have even more detailed information. Really it's a broad screening test to determine an individual's general health status.

70
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,970
So there may be various reasons why they would draw CBC.

71
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,040
It can screen for a wide range of diseases and conditions.

72
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,990
It can help diagnose various conditions such as anemia, which we'll talk about today,

73
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:22,360
but also look for infection, inflammation, different bleeding disorders, or even help diagnose what cancers.

74
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:31,720
It is useful. It is a useful monitoring tool to assess the effectiveness of treatment, say, after a diagnosis has been established.

75
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,080
An example may be if somebody is on treatment known to affect blood cells,

76
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,050
they may be chemotherapy that's targeting certain blood cells or radiation therapy.

77
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:48,520
This can be used as a monitoring tool to see how they are responding to such treatment.

78
00:08:51,340 --> 00:09:00,790
So this might be an example of the CDC. This was taken out of out of my chart, which is the electronic medical record of the patient.

79
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:13,390
So any time labs are drawn will always see the reference range of course, and then it will flag whether something is outside of that reference range.

80
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:20,270
So. Sometimes things are just outside of a reference range and that's perfectly normal.

81
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:28,589
There's no reason of concern for that, but it'll still be like highlighting or have like a red exclamation point next to it.

82
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:34,590
So keep that in mind. Like, yes, it's going to be flagged that it's not within that reference range.

83
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:44,010
Sometimes that's it's it's not meaningless, but there's really no cause for concern if some labs are just false just outside that.

84
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:54,740
Okay. So we're going to spend some time on talking about a deficiency and just anemia in general.

85
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:05,409
So anemia is a condition in which a deficiency, which there's a deficiency in the deficiency in either the size or the number of red blood cells.

86
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:12,760
Sometimes this will be referred to as erythrocytes. Or it could be the amount of hemoglobin in the blood cells.

87
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,460
So this is the oxygen carrying pigment of the red blood cell.

88
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:24,920
So there could be a deficiency in the amount that the amount of hemoglobin that is the erythrocytes contain.

89
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:31,910
And this will limit the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the tissue cells.

90
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,000
So classification of anemia is often based on the cell size.

91
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,260
Okay. So how big that red blood cell is?

92
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:52,440
Okay. So I remember one of the anemia can involve the A deficiency in the size of the blood cell.

93
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,620
So classification sometimes is based on the size of the cells.

94
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:04,910
So they measure it in that blood sample. So you'll see the terms macro static, micro static, normal set.

95
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,110
You guys heard of these terms before? Great.

96
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:22,009
That's a head nodding classification may also be based on the hemoglobin content, so that can affect the color of the cells.

97
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:29,209
So there may be described as hypo chromate, which would be like a more pale color and normal chronic.

98
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:40,630
Which would be normal. Most Canadians globally are caused by a lack of nutrients required for normal synthesis of our red blood cells.

99
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,180
Principally, that's going to be iron, but it also could be other vitamins,

100
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:51,640
specifically vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiencies can lead to nutritional anemia as.

101
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,030
What are some other potential causes of anemia for?

102
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,150
Not if we're not talking about efficiency.

103
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,210
Yes. They are in the story for.

104
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:18,590
And that other nutrient deficiencies can affect how iron is utilized potentially.

105
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,950
What else should we think about?

106
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:32,780
So in this country, iron deficiency, although we do see it in our patients due to various reasons, it's not like super, super common.

107
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:40,310
We have usually adequate nutrients in the diet to get adequate iron,

108
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:48,350
but that may not be the case in more developed countries where there is maybe lack of access to nutrient rich foods,

109
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:54,860
animal proteins, things like that. So we're thinking about what might cause an anemia in someone in this country.

110
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,780
What could be another cause? It would not be nutrition related.

111
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:13,570
Injury like hemorrhage, blood loss. Right. We see a lot of people that if they have a degree of blood loss, that can lead to anemia.

112
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:24,550
Also genetic abnormalities, certain drug toxicities, but also chronic disease status, which we'll discuss briefly today.

113
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,879
Iron deficiency is characterized by the production of small blood cells.

114
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:40,890
So this would be considered microscopic in nature and a diminished level of circulating hemoglobin.

115
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:52,889
So microfluidic anemia most often is true iron deficiency, not all the time, but generally if it is a micro acidic anemia,

116
00:13:52,890 --> 00:14:00,510
that well could represent iron deficiency and it is actually the last stage of iron deficiency.

117
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,740
So it represents the end point of a long period of iron deprivation before we can really kind of.

118
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:16,980
See the laboratory evidence of that. So iron deficiency most often will be in my process.

119
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:24,660
We do need to classify what type of anemia that the patient is experiencing in order to best treat it.

120
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:30,480
So we are not always going to be the ones doing that, but we're going to help with that interpretation.

121
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,950
So it could be micro, silicon nature, macro center, maybe it's normal.

122
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:44,280
Silicon is completely unrelated to nutrition, but if we're talking about true iron deficiency that is most often micro acidic in nature,

123
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:52,110
some important discriminating features are low serum ferritin concentration, which we'll talk about a little bit later.

124
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:03,820
Increased total iron binding capacity, or this is like an indirect measure of transparency, which is a protein that helps.

125
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:12,270
Carry a transport iron, essentially, and a low serum iron concentration.

126
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:21,930
So the major causes of iron deficiency are decreased dietary intake, reduced absorption, but it also could be related to blood loss.

127
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:30,810
Okay. So in most adults in research resource rich countries, dietary intake is almost always adequate.

128
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,130
That's not quite true.

129
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:41,800
You know, in our patients with various diseases that may impact their ability to consume adequate iron or or utilize the iron that they do consume.

130
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:48,420
But it is usually reasonable to assume that the cause is bloodless until proven otherwise.

131
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:58,140
A reduced iron absorption isn't another uncommon cause of iron deficiency, but it is possible.

132
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:06,719
Iron is absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract and usually in the duodenum, as is the side of maximal absorption.

133
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:16,650
So we'll get into in a couple of weeks. Various diseases, conditions, surgeries that may impact the actual absorption sites and different.

134
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:32,360
Okay. So mechanistic anemia, this is generally due to utilization or due to deficient utilization of folate or B12 by the blood cells.

135
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:36,890
So these these blood cells will appear larger than normal.

136
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:45,480
So that's why we call it. So there's different kinds.

137
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,669
You may hear the term pernicious anemia. This could be enough red blood cells to do.

138
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:58,440
The lack of B12 may also hear the term mega load classic anemia, which is often due to fully deficiency.

139
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:05,850
So again, important to distinguish if it is a nutritional anemia, what is the main nutrient involved?

140
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,200
It's definitely possible to have both of these things happening.

141
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,870
So you could have true iron deficiency but also be deficient in B12 or folate deficiency.

142
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:22,590
So sometimes this just cell size as a discriminating feature may not be as helpful.

143
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:27,959
Things are happening concurrently. Okay.

144
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,560
So then there is anemia of inflammation and chronic disease.

145
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:39,050
The cells may be normal. So normal size, it possibly could be microfluidic.

146
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,530
The the importance of the importance of knowing whether it's true iron deficiency or a nutritional anemia

147
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:54,149
versus anemia of inflammation in chronic disease is that if somebody has anemia of chronic disease,

148
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,640
it's not going to respond to iron supplementation.

149
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:06,180
So the most common mechanism for this condition is a block in iron release from the macrophages back into circulation,

150
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,880
which can occur in the setting of inflammation.

151
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:17,640
So it's not an issue necessarily of insufficient iron, but more that the body cannot access its iron properly and therefore can't utilize it.

152
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:25,620
So if we can pump these patients full of iron and it's not going to make a difference in their their presentation of anemia.

153
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:33,730
Yes. What if you have a patient? That's right.

154
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,760
Do they become chronic? Yeah.

155
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:49,569
So both things can be true because we're going to see a lot of patients that have underlying inflammatory conditions that in addition,

156
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,479
maybe they're also have nutritional deficiencies.

157
00:18:52,480 --> 00:19:00,430
So they may be iron deficient, not consuming enough iron, and then also not able to properly utilize the iron that they have.

158
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:07,120
So in those patients, it would still be beneficial to address the iron deficiency as well.

159
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:21,149
Yes. You would still see a rise in a. Most likely, but also the underlying cause of the inflammation would have to be addressed,

160
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:28,030
which it would be to then allow the patient to properly utilize the idea of supplements.

161
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,480
So these don't occur in isolation, right? Our patients are often very complex.

162
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,680
That said. So a lot of this can be happening simultaneously.

163
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,490
So this is just kind of helping with the distinguishing features.

164
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,710
But again, there may be more than one thing happening.

165
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,000
Yes. What do you do for those that have the kitchen?

166
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:02,560
Yeah. So iron is a PDI stopper as we refer to it.

167
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:10,510
So a lot of times those patients will have to be on top or conversely if they're on oral or something.

168
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,500
That. Not necessarily.

169
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:32,310
I mean, we have to over supplement either in a supplementation form because it's not in the form that our body prefers.

170
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:41,550
And we usually say take it with food, although iron is better absorbed with our food, but it's so tough on the stomach.

171
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:49,500
So there's a lot of factors that even when we're supplementing, will prevent optimal utilization of that.

172
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,420
But iron is tough on that. So we haven't had a way that families so.

173
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:09,990
Some patients, if they're really not responsive to oral supplementation or if they have a reason why it would be too difficult to tolerate.

174
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:15,980
They like the idea. Supplementation. What you're saying.

175
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:28,540
I give. So that. Compared to some of the patients who I've had a lot of.

176
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,079
But. I don't know.

177
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,980
So how they respond. I'm not sure.

178
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:49,750
Like, I'm sure if somebody if the iron deficiency is due to blood loss and they got a blood transfusion, that would probably.

179
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,480
Yeah. That would that would mean that not hearing that would help.

180
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:08,610
And we'll get into more later in the semester in terms of supplementation, trying to get nutrients through food sometimes.

181
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:14,910
You know, we always want to get these nutrients replenished through foods. That's not always possible to the degree that our patients need.

182
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:22,020
So then on top of hopefully diet enhancement, we have to we have to supplement.

183
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,100
All right. So test for him deficiency.

184
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:38,959
We'll just go through some like key parts of that CVC hemoglobin in hematocrit these are going to and always part of the CBC again hemoglobin is

185
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:48,590
the protein in the red blood cells that carries oxygen and that really is a test of is testing the percentage of red blood cells in your blood.

186
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,830
So these will almost universally always be normal or below normal.

187
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:58,390
Sorry, these will be decreased in all nutritional anemia.

188
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:08,360
So you can't just distinguish what type of anemia a patient has based on low hemoglobin chromatograph.

189
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,430
These are also always blood. There is.

190
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:20,540
So it's not sensitive for other B12 or fully deficiencies and they are sensitive to hydration status.

191
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:32,150
So by themselves or by itself, hemoglobin concentration is unsuitable as a diagnostic tool in cases of suspected suspected iron deficiency.

192
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:37,850
And really for three reasons. It is affected only late in the disease.

193
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:46,400
It cannot distinguish iron deficiency from other anemia and hemoglobin values in normal individuals can vary widely.

194
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:54,660
So we say, you know, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are often below normal in all nutritional anemia.

195
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:06,950
They are sensitive to hydration status. So both hemoglobin and hematocrit are based on whole blood samples and therefore dependent on plasma volume.

196
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:18,440
So if a patient comes in severely dehydrated, the human hemoglobin in hematocrit may appear higher than if the patient had a normal volume level.

197
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:24,709
And if they come in fluid overloaded, they may actually be lower than the normal level.

198
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:34,640
So sometimes patients will come in, they'll get fluid rehydration from maybe they came in dehydrated and then you'll see that those tend to go down.

199
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:41,160
Or they can be falsely elevated or dehydrated.

200
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:50,270
Okay. So often these will be low, but we don't it doesn't really tell us much beyond that in terms of what type of anemia.

201
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:58,590
Okay. So serum ferritin. This is the primary intracellular storage of iron.

202
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,810
So the serum levels will parallel iron stores, which is important.

203
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,450
So this makes the plasma fare to level the most sensitive parameter of negative

204
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:15,130
ion balance because it decreases only in the presence of true iron deficiency.

205
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:26,450
So. Serum ferritin is a positive acute phase reactor.

206
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:30,830
So this is one of those positive acute phase proteins.

207
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,430
So if somebody is undergoing or has an inflammatory process happening,

208
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:43,280
serum paraffin will go up with the inflammatory response because it's a positive acute phase.

209
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,880
So it can increase during inflammatory response even when iron stores are not added to that.

210
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:58,250
Right. So serum ferritin is our most sensitive marker of true iron stores.

211
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:07,730
If somebody comes in sick with inflammation, it's going to be elevated because of that inflammatory process, even if they are truly iron deficient.

212
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,340
So that can make interpretation difficult.

213
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:26,020
So ferritin might not be super useful when somebody is coming in with anemia of chronic disease because of that inflammatory response.

214
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:37,240
Okay. Serum iron. Who thinks this is the most helpful test we have.

215
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:49,580
We're checking to our blood levels of iron. But no, this is probably the least helpful test for something like a deficiency,

216
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:54,350
even though you would think that would be the most helpful because it's just testing our theory.

217
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,190
This is the total iron that is bound to transparent.

218
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:07,010
So transparent again is the transport protein for iron, but it's really it really can reflect recent iron intake.

219
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,569
It's very insensitive index of our total iron stores.

220
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:20,740
So it is, you know, sensitive to recent dietary intake and it really doesn't give us an idea of our actual iron stores.

221
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,810
So it'll still be checked, but it's not.

222
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:30,210
The most useful tool. Okay.

223
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:36,550
Total iron binding capacity. This is where things I think get a little confusing, at least for me.

224
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:41,170
It took me a while to kind of understand what was going on with this test.

225
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:53,250
So this total iron binding capacity or this tieback measures the blood's ability to attach itself to iron and transport it around the body.

226
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:57,890
So it's kind of trying to measure the total amount of iron that can be bound.

227
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,980
Okay. So it's a direct measure of all proteins available to bind mobile iron.

228
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:15,000
And it's evaluating how well transparent kind of that transport protein carries iron through the blood.

229
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:20,790
So it's an indirect really an indirect measure of transparent.

230
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:29,580
Their total iron binding capacity will increase when iron stores are depleted.

231
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:34,860
So when this is elevated, that's signaling a sign of iron deficiency.

232
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:48,540
So in iron deficient conditions, the relative transparent, transparent content compared to iron content increases.

233
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:54,510
So there's more proteins available in the blood trying to bind to iron.

234
00:28:54,570 --> 00:29:00,660
So that's why increased levels would be reflective of iron deficiency.

235
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:06,420
So these proteins are circulating, searching for iron to bind to, but there's not enough out there.

236
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:13,470
Does that make sense? I think what throws students off is, well, why is it high if iron if they're iron deficient?

237
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:20,790
That's kind of. Why is that? It's it's measuring the amount of proteins available to attach to iron.

238
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:33,790
Yes. Also. That's how this this will measure what percent is back this next one.

239
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:44,510
This is predominantly measuring those proteins that are available to find, not necessarily the ones that are.

240
00:29:45,640 --> 00:30:04,880
Yes, I'm sorry. It is it is measuring proteins that can find to carry iron.

241
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:13,940
So it's not a direct measure of transparency, which is the main name for what we think of it as like an indirect measure of transparency.

242
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:22,310
We can directly measure transparency, but typically don't test and we'll look it up together,

243
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:31,620
but essentially it's in place if the body is producing more of these transport proteins, let's see your iron deficiency.

244
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:37,490
Your body is going to put out more of these transport proteins to try and get the available iron.

245
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,810
So then this will be high because it's releasing more to try and grab the iron that is available.

246
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:59,940
Okay. So total iron binding capacity declines and serum ferritin levels will rise in chronic disease unrelated to iron metabolism.

247
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:06,940
So this can be affected by an inflammatory response as well.

248
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,200
Transparent we're going to talk about a little bit more transparent is a circulating transport protein for iron.

249
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,229
We can measure it directly, but often you'll see this total iron binding capacity as the the lab that's ordered,

250
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:29,000
which is a indirect measure but transparent, will be increased in iron deficiency for the same reasons.

251
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:38,120
For iron deficient, our body is going to try to create more transparent in order to get at the available iron.

252
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,220
Therefore, the transparent levels will be high in this year when we are deficient in iron.

253
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,420
I really feel kind of okay with that. Okay.

254
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:04,139
Okay. Transparent is a negative acute phase reactor.

255
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:10,920
So this is another one of those acute phase proteins. Remember, ferritin is positive, so it will go up.

256
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:19,979
Even if iron is iron stores are poor, transparent is a negative acute phase respond.

257
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,990
And so remember transparent will be elevated in iron deficiency.

258
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:33,450
Let's say somebody is iron deficient, but they also have underlying inflammatory response that's going to make the transparent go down.

259
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:40,559
So that can make interpretation difficult, right? Oh, the transparent is normal, not high.

260
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,840
So we're thinking, okay, their iron source may be okay, but it will go down in response to.

261
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:52,400
So positive acute phase reacts with negative acute phase reactive.

262
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,030
Can you see how that would make interpretation difficult?

263
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:02,090
If a patient is is experiencing inflammation, which a lot of our patients are.

264
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:11,230
Okay. So let's talk about this transparent saturation. You may see that as well.

265
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:16,810
This is essentially the serum iron value divided by the total iron binding capacity.

266
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:24,620
Okay. So the serum iron is the iron that is the transparent, the total unrefined pasta.

267
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:29,150
It's essentially an indirect measure of how much transparent is available to bind iron.

268
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:35,270
So when we get this saturation, you end up with a proportion.

269
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,110
So it'll be a percentage and maybe we can look at this together.

270
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,800
So it's really saying what percentage of Transparent is bound to iron, which is normally around 30%.

271
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:53,300
So percent saturation values, less than 15% could be consistent with iron deficiency anemia.

272
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:58,490
So a low, transparent saturation would be consistent with iron deficiency.

273
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:04,600
It's telling us less than normal amounts of iron are actually bound to translate.

274
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,050
So this will be decreased when iron stores are depleted.

275
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:22,260
Also, low vitamin B6 can affect the transparent saturation and we see a low, transparent saturation.

276
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:30,030
People with aplastic anemia, which is a condition that occurs when the body stops producing enough blood cells, it's a very serious condition,

277
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:40,049
just like our patients with bone marrow transplant patients that have undergone extensive chemotherapy or radiation to the bone marrow.

278
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:44,680
So they're not producing red blood cells. Has something called a plastic.

279
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:48,430
Yeah. Yes.

280
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:57,290
Yes. So we have we will talk about this on Thursday.

281
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,350
We'll do a whole section of these dance here.

282
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,270
So the acute phase is what it's just saying. Inflammation is happening.

283
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:12,870
That acute response. Some proteins are considered a negative acute phase reaction.

284
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,100
So when inflammation is happening there, serum levels go down.

285
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:27,900
So negative meaning going down. There's also positive acute phase reactants where there's inflammation happening, the levels will go up.

286
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:36,329
So that's like CERP. We also talked about ferritin as an example of a positive acute phase reactive transfer.

287
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:44,790
It is a negative acute phase reactive. So although transparent levels are elevated when there is iron deficiency,

288
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:52,650
they may be if it's there's inflammation going on, their levels will be either falsely normal or falsely.

289
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:57,260
Well, because of that inflammatory response. Does that help?

290
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,710
Okay. I want to look at.

291
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:09,840
See if I can get something to show you guys. We'll look at this again on Thursday.

292
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:46,540
Okay. Let's look at. Total.

293
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:51,610
I am so this. This is a helpful tool.

294
00:36:51,690 --> 00:37:00,200
Like when you if you do your internship, what they do it to you, them or somewhere else that will have this is like a clinical test catalog.

295
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,540
So any lab value that can be ordered at the hospital, you can look up here.

296
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:11,020
So I find really helpful. So this is our iron binding capacity lab.

297
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:17,170
Okay. So if you look the it gives us a lot of information just like important for phlebotomy in the lab.

298
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:24,370
But it will tell you reference ranges and then like test usage,

299
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:31,450
evaluation of iron and iron binding capacity can help in the differential diagnosis of anemia.

300
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:41,020
And it tells you this test includes the total iron iron fighting capacity and prevent percent transfer and saturation.

301
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:49,200
So percent saturation values, less than 15% are associated or consistent with iron deficiency.

302
00:37:51,030 --> 00:38:01,259
And it goes on to give a little bit more detail. So sometimes this can be helpful just to see like if you see that your the doctors have

303
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,280
ordered some lab tests or maybe a nutritional lab that you're not as familiar with,

304
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,700
you could always look it up in a resource like this.

305
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:23,890
Let's see, I haven't looked at. So usually the serum iron, the binding capacity and the percent transparent saturation is all one test.

306
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:30,570
Even though our sides make it seem like they're done separately. Let's see if.

307
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:41,510
Like, Here's our ferritin test. It doesn't say much here to say in deficiency anemia.

308
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:48,999
Sometimes they give a little bit more information about the limitations or the interpretation.

309
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:56,380
This one set of a great example. Well, we'll look at this on Thursday when we talk about those.

310
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:04,950
Serum protein markers. We'll get into that a little bit more control, pain, maybe some of the language used in here.

311
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:24,250
But hopefully you'll find it interesting. Okay.

312
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,870
So that's those are helpful for iron deficiency.

313
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,209
I know we're talking about these like kind of in silos. Of course, these can all be happening concurrently.

314
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:38,920
But let's talk about macro acidic anemia for B vitamin deficiency.

315
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:46,720
Just kind of briefly again, I think, Dr. Coll, we'll get into this in little bit more detail next semester, but.

316
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:57,410
Interestingly or not, if you just check like a serum folate or a serum B12 level, which often that is what's done.

317
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:06,110
And then maybe as a dietitian, you can ask for more extensive tests, but those serum tests are not sensitive or specific to actual levels.

318
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:12,950
Hey. So they might be like an initial step, but you'd want to, like, investigate further.

319
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:18,530
So I think that's what gets in my experience.

320
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:23,570
Patients get frustrated by like, well, can't you just check my nutritional labs?

321
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,720
And it's like, well, it's not always that straightforward.

322
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:34,310
And so this would be an example of just a folate or B12 level and not really sensitive or specific to their actual level.

323
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,320
But we do have some better tests. So has anybody heard of methyl blahnik acid?

324
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:49,820
Okay. Couple. Sure. So make them a lot of acid or you'll hear this referred to as May is a substance produced in very small amounts.

325
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:53,780
It is necessary for human metabolism and energy production.

326
00:40:55,610 --> 00:41:01,820
In one step of metabolism. Vitamin B12 promotes the conversion of.

327
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:13,590
Essentially I don't want to get into too much of the pathophysiology, but B12 is part of the conversion of this to make it through the eyes of.

328
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:23,839
Okay. So the metal, a lot of acid level and then a level will be increased when somebody is B12 deficient.

329
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,830
So there's not enough B12 there for this conversion to happen.

330
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:36,560
So May will be high and that is a much more sensitive test to identify vitamin B12 deficiency.

331
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,480
Is this metabolic acid? Okay.

332
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:49,260
So if there's not enough B12 available, then the memory concentration begins to rise, resulting in an increase in the MMR in blood and urine.

333
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:55,030
So this is a sensitive and early indicator of declining tissue levels of vitamin B12.

334
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:05,580
So this would be like a bonus if you if your doctor says, you know, I suspect B12 deficiency or maybe you suspect B12 deficiency,

335
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:16,139
which there's going to be situations where you're going to kind of suspect that maybe your patient has had some type of gastrointestinal surgery,

336
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:24,320
maybe their diet history is like devoid of animal sources, which isn't like a huge problem.

337
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:28,559
You can work around that, but you have to do that carefully. I have a patient that I follow.

338
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:34,380
I see her every three weeks. She has had no B12 sources in her diet for a really long time.

339
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:38,219
It's also very resistant to trying any supplements.

340
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:48,230
So this has been like an ongoing issue, trying to find a way to get some B12 for her because clearly just doing a diet recall, she has no sources.

341
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:57,210
So you might suspect that. But if we were going to really castigate that, I'd rather have a MLA test than just like a serum B12.

342
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:08,850
Okay. So also this homocysteine level, you know, I'm not as familiar with this.

343
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:15,030
I don't see this checked a lot, but it might be utilized more in like the inpatient setting.

344
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:23,130
Homocysteine levels can denote vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.

345
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:28,530
So homocysteine is an intermediate metabolite in the in the finding pathway.

346
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:34,170
It's an amino acid. It's typically present very small amounts in all cells of the body.

347
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:39,810
And that's because the body normally converts homocysteine into other products very quickly.

348
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:48,020
And since vitamin B6, B12 and fully are necessary to metabolize homocysteine,

349
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:55,040
we will see increased levels of this amino acid as a potential sign of deficiency of those vitamin.

350
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:02,850
So that might be more sensitive tool for B12 deficiency.

351
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:07,100
And again, this will be elevated. This is happening.

352
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:14,070
Yeah, but you had a mild stroke.

353
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:24,830
The most esteemed ratio against the finding is the main indicator is also directly positive.

354
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:33,790
Sure. For me, I'm sure there's other clinical utility of the system that I would not be as familiar with.

355
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:41,240
But this can be more sensitive. More sensitive than to serve the light of B12 in this.

356
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,800
There's also a. Has anybody heard of Hollow Trans Cobalamin?

357
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:55,460
Yes, some of these have. I've never heard of this until, you know, a couple of years ago.

358
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:00,260
I don't know if this is used clinically yet.

359
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:05,479
I think maybe I know a couple of years ago it wasn't used in the U.S. as much.

360
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:14,870
But this the idea behind this would be that approximately a quarter of our circulating B12 binds

361
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:21,380
to trans cobalamin or this whole oats and is there by available for the cells for the body.

362
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:29,540
So for this reason, this whole of TSE or this whole low trans global mean is referred to as the active form of B12.

363
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:35,180
So this may be an even better test. I have never seen this from.

364
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,659
It's not in our lab handbook as far as I know.

365
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,800
So this this could be something up and coming medicine practice.

366
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:53,780
Okay. So I want you to really understand this next part.

367
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,460
The main Corpuscular volume will also be referred to as the main cell volume.

368
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:08,770
Either way, it's that massive. So when you see the NCBI in the CBC, this is the average volume of red blood cells.

369
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:12,510
So the size. Remember, we talked about the size of the blood cells.

370
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:21,660
So the MTV, the main cell volume will be small or decreased when it is iron deficiency.

371
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:25,320
Remember, that's microfluidic micro meaning smaller.

372
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:31,350
So a lower MCP would be potentially indicative of iron deficiency.

373
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:40,170
B12 and folate are macro acidic anemia, so the main cell volume would be bigger.

374
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:46,050
So the MCP would potentially be increased in the setting of the following folate deficiency.

375
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:53,300
So that is a very helpful biomarker as part of our CBC case.

376
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:59,760
So make sure you're looking for that when you're if somebody would say, I think this patient is iron deficient.

377
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:11,660
This is just, you know, if you're really interested in that may test the skills of what if you're into, you know, proper physiology and all that.

378
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:24,040
Why vitamin B12 deficiency leads to a serious buildup of the metabolic acid and then deficiency of B12 or folic acid going to increase levels.

379
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:31,350
So that's why those labs might be a little bit more sensitive. Okay.

380
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:46,150
This table. This is from a different book, but you can see that this is talking about iron deficiency in anemia and with different direction or,

381
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,300
you know, whether these levels would be making higher or lower.

382
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:56,110
This is anemia of information or chronic disease that fully deficiency, B12 deficiency.

383
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:02,290
So this is a helpful table in my opinion, but you can see a lot of them have similar features.

384
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:09,310
Hemoglobin in hematocrit universally decreased in all of these animals.

385
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:17,260
This mean corpuscular volume or that means cell volume decrease in iron deficiency anemia.

386
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:21,970
It could be decreased or normal in the community of inflammation, chronic disease.

387
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:27,670
And then this is increase in bullet and B12 because again, these are macro immediate.

388
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:36,660
And then you can kind of go through and just look at a lot of these are very similar within W and L is just within normal limits.

389
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:39,890
So a lot of these may be normal. Even if the patient is anemic.

390
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:47,929
So I would like create a table like this or like print something like this out just so you have it as a reference,

391
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:54,080
just like a clinical lab, kind of little tool to have on hand.

392
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:07,260
Okay. This was brought up earlier, but other nutrients can affect how we're able to utilize iron.

393
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:13,979
So popular it plays a role in iron metabolism and the effect could be inhibitory or enhancing.

394
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:24,400
So. Copper deficiency or copper toxicity can affect your metabolism and excess.

395
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,700
Zinc can also interfere with copper absorption, which can then.

396
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:40,900
All of these things can impact iron studies. So macro acidic anemia is again often this is due to deficiencies in B12 and folate and then.

397
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:49,639
Copper and zinc status could potentially affect those. But this is primarily conferencing plays a role in iron metabolism.

398
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:55,670
So we have our microfluidic anemia, which is most often true iron deficiency.

399
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:06,100
You can see copper deficiency can affect that, but also copper toxicity and too much zinc can affect your metabolism and lead to.

400
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:12,199
Or at least contribute to it. Okay.

401
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,550
So let's do a small, little case study.

402
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:22,160
This was a real situation I had like two years ago.

403
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:26,360
One of the doctors I work closely with sent me a message.

404
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,680
You know, one of our patients we see has a low hematocrit.

405
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:38,240
Can you provide recommendations basically for patients?

406
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:43,969
So just on a low hematocrit, this happens a lot like low hemoglobin, low hematocrit.

407
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:50,330
They send a referral to the dietician. So this is a pediatric patient with a lot of stuff going on.

408
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,490
But I'll just give you some some background.

409
00:50:53,300 --> 00:51:03,950
This was my 17 month old male patient who presents accompanied by his mother for initial consultation regarding feeding difficulties and reflux.

410
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:09,530
This patient has had a long history of feeding difficulties that started soon after birth.

411
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,050
He was born full term, no significant complications, exclusively breastfed,

412
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:21,350
soon developed projectile emesis associated with fussiness gassing as loose stools.

413
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:31,610
Around five months he was diagnosed with no protein allergy after developing body stools that resolved with mom eliminating dairy in her diet.

414
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:39,090
With Solid food. Introduction. At six months, he started having reactions to most new foods.

415
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:45,930
So vomiting, irritability, diarrhea, mucus like stools with anything that he ate.

416
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,530
He also had started having difficulties with weight gain.

417
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:59,400
He was evaluated by an allergist in pediatric GI who was diagnosed with a condition called F Pies and began eliminating other foods from her diet.

418
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:07,500
At seven months, he was trialed on Zantac, which is a reflux medication for two days without improvement.

419
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:14,970
And then he was started on a more, I'd say a stronger anti acid medication as well as a probiotic.

420
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:21,750
This seemed to be helpful. So by the time he was one year old, he was gaining weight appropriately.

421
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:28,950
So despite improvement in emesis and diarrhea, continued to struggle with tolerance to most new foods.

422
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,560
So this is like a lot to work through. This is the typical kind of patients that I see.

423
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:39,120
So this is this is a 17 month old and these are his only foods right now.

424
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:44,519
And I've just highlighted the ones that are potentially are your age or at least

425
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:50,069
would have on your so you've got salmon as a seafood or sorghum some butter.

426
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:58,500
And still there may be some other maybe some other iron sources, but these would be the ones that would be more iron rich.

427
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:04,020
And then he is breastfed in his mom avoids peanut dairy, soy, beef and avocado.

428
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:14,680
Okay. So what would we do next? Like, we know the clinical history, we know the current diet, and we have this low matter hematocrit.

429
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:28,220
What do you guys think would be the next step? Yeah.

430
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:33,730
Get some more consultants on board so we can see more of a picture.

431
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:39,350
And of course, we have the diet history. So that would also be we'd look at what the baby is eating.

432
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:45,980
We know that diarrhea and vomiting has improved, but that would also potentially affect absorption.

433
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:52,160
So when we get that full CBC, what do you guys see here?

434
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:57,710
That would be helpful. Yeah.

435
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,240
Right. So. Okay, hemoglobin hematocrit low.

436
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:08,640
Right. That's usually universally low when there's anemia. This is potentially helpful.

437
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:15,350
So the MCP of that cell volume is low and you can see the comment even on the labs as they come back.

438
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:22,260
That might be hard for you to see, but severe micro psychosis is seen most often in iron deficiency.

439
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,110
It may also be seen in other conditions as well.

440
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:31,770
So it's not just telling us this this patient is iron deficient, but please correlate with iron studies.

441
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:35,910
Patient history as well. Yes. So the.

442
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:47,520
Even a little longer. The lymphocytes are.

443
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:56,090
So there could be. Sure you could.

444
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:04,419
Yeah, I'm not as familiar with, like, lymphocyte percentage as it would be as it would pertain to iron deficiency.

445
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:10,190
Could that person have a role in this? Okay.

446
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:22,019
So this so if we look at this toddler baby's diet history limited limited iron sources in the diet this history throughout

447
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:32,250
infancy of really poor tolerance of foods and then these labs we could think this this patient could be truly iron deficient.

448
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:39,780
Okay. So we see this, the serum iron level here is low.

449
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:44,800
That's not the most helpful test mention.

450
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:50,590
The iron binding capacity number is this high or low in iron deficiency?

451
00:55:54,710 --> 00:56:00,680
Elevated, right? So we see that it's like it's normal, but it's at the higher end.

452
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:11,960
And then the 10% transparent saturation is what and you can see here, saturation level less than 50% efficiency.

453
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,680
So we don't have a zero imperative that, you know, that could be helpful, too.

454
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,460
But this is all kind of pointing to like true efficiency, in my opinion.

455
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:27,850
And then we have a B12 level. For good measure, this is normal, but all maybe on the lower end.

456
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:35,590
So if we thought, okay, we look back on the diet and maybe there's inadequate B12, we could ask maybe for an MRI test.

457
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:41,110
So this would help us kind of weed through and and really demonstrate.

458
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:43,390
Yeah, this patient is probably deficient.

459
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:52,270
Another thing which will kind of put together this semester is that proton pump inhibitors are the previous seven months of.

460
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:58,360
That reduces the production of acid in the gut.

461
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:03,170
Iron needs an acidic environment for for absorption.

462
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:07,720
So that that would also be like gluten to our our clinical assessment.

463
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:13,639
We haven't gotten that far. But when we put all those things together in addition to some specific labs,

464
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:21,230
then I think we can make that call that yes, this is true iron deficiency as opposed to just saying low hematocrit.

465
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:24,980
I'm concerned for iron deficiency. We want to really investigate.

466
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:35,630
Any questions on there? Yeah. The panel.

467
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:44,260
I know. More information.

468
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:49,240
Yes. Caused that diarrhea. Oh, good. Yeah.

469
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:54,440
So know for 25% of the population.

470
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:03,320
225. But what is critical?

471
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:08,790
So long. U.S.

472
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:14,200
It could be. There could be an infectious process.

473
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:23,560
These. These would require like other investigation beyond.

474
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:29,500
So when we look at the moments when we consider the time.

475
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:36,940
You could. To be honest, I wouldn't even look at this because I'm not.

476
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:47,920
These are this is a real case study. So that provided but I know you all want to know why this is happening, and I can't tell you why.

477
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:51,020
I don't know. So, Dr.

478
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,590
Consultation with the culture we talk to.

479
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:00,810
Because of that, she would just go straight to the.

480
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:06,090
I would swap. I mean, it's good to like look at the entire film.

481
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:13,470
There are going to be laughs that come back that I have no idea what went on, what it's about.

482
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:19,200
Yeah, absolutely. We'll talk about that when we do our section on cancer.

483
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:24,720
There is utility that would be helpful for us in prescribing certain items in this case.

484
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:31,590
I'm just being honest. I don't even I'm not even going to go there cause I don't know what what I would even say.

485
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:36,720
That's not, in my opinion, nutritionally relevant to what I'm going to prescribe.

486
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:40,920
But can we ask the person? Oh, yeah, you could always ask.

487
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,729
Yeah, I would. Especially early on. Like, what does this mean? Likewise.

488
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:50,460
And terms say I don't know. They'll want to ask the hematologist, probably.

489
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:56,490
Okay. So any questions on nutritional anemia?

490
00:59:56,660 --> 01:00:06,390
It's kind of like just a short intro course on that, and hopefully we'll kind of put them together in like cases like this throughout the semester.

491
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:11,500
Okay. I think we can start get through most of our.

492
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:16,370
Next session here. Okay.

493
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:20,460
Did you guys read the chapter on this?

494
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:25,540
It's. What did you think? It was this easy for you guys to understand?

495
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:30,810
I've always personally struggled with this stuff. The the who had been a little out of balance.

496
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:35,680
Now I feel much better. But it took me a while to really grasp what's happening.

497
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:41,170
So we're just going to do really simple introduction to this.

498
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:47,880
The chapter goes into much more of physiology, so if you're interested in that, definitely refer to the chapter meeting.

499
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:52,840
But for purposes of this class, the slides are what I want you to kind of focus on.

500
01:00:55,020 --> 01:01:00,180
So learning objective described the basic principles of fluid balance in fluid disorders.

501
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:03,270
This, again, will come more full circle.

502
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:11,160
In different disease conditions we talk about this semester, but also we do like parenteral nutrition concepts next next semester.

503
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:19,560
Okay. So assessment of hydration status, really? We'll start with the two main fluid compartments.

504
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:28,920
So we have this total body water. So this is all the fluid that occupies the intracellular and extracellular spaces.

505
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:32,760
So our bodies are a high percentage of our bodies are made up of water.

506
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:39,480
And so from our total body of water, we essentially have two compartments.

507
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:46,350
So we have the intracellular fluid compartment. So this is going to be the fluid within the cells of our body.

508
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:50,070
So that makes up about two thirds of our total body water.

509
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:58,470
So now we have this extracellular fluid compartment and that's the body's internal environment in the cell's external environment.

510
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,650
And that is about a third of our total body water.

511
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:11,550
Now, within this extracellular fluid compartment for this ECF, there are additional kind of compartments within that.

512
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:15,330
So there's the interstitial fluid in the plasma.

513
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:20,850
So the interstitial fluid is going to be fluid in the spaces between cells.

514
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:24,990
And then the plasma is the fluid portion of the blood.

515
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,499
Sometimes you'll also hear another compartment,

516
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:38,069
which is the trans cellular space that's really fluid in the and tissues that are lined with epithelial cells.

517
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:40,200
But this is a very small percentage.

518
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:47,879
I really just want you to understand, we have the intracellular fourth compartment in the extracellular fluid compartment,

519
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:53,730
and now within the ECM, there are interstitial space in the plasma.

520
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:02,560
Okay. So I feel like this is really helpful for me to go back.

521
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:06,630
So here's our intracellular fluid.

522
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:10,000
That's like one of the two main components of our total body water.

523
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,150
That's the fluid is within the cellular environment.

524
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:18,850
Two thirds of the body, our water is in our cells, which I think is pretty incredible.

525
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:22,540
Then these two are that is that extracellular fluid.

526
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:30,790
So we have the interstitial fluid, which is like the fluid between the cells and then the plasma, which is the intravascular space.

527
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:47,840
Yes. The third, third phase of the ECF would be like, let's say this was the GI track and there's this one, but I feel yourself.

528
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:51,750
It would be like. In that area.

529
01:03:52,800 --> 01:04:00,209
It's not necessarily within the cells, but it's just fluid in use like like the plural.

530
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:03,460
Have the various like some spots that have. So.

531
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:15,870
It's not something I would focus a lot of energy on, but know that there is another space that's not totally accounted for in.

532
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:21,160
Another question. Okay.

533
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:28,100
Okay. So this kind of breaks it down and we have our total body water.

534
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:36,380
Two thirds is inside our cells and then the other third is an ETF and then the ECF will have that.

535
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:39,950
This is all these. Yeah. So this is the interstitial fluid.

536
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:51,860
There is some fluid in the capillary wall. So here essentially that's still part of that extracellular fluid volume.

537
01:04:54,590 --> 01:05:01,410
And then the plan goes well. So this is this.

538
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:08,149
This is breaking that down for. All right.

539
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:13,010
So when we assess hydration status, really looking at the distribution of body water,

540
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:19,700
which will vary under different circumstances, but usually our bodies are again always fighting for homeostasis.

541
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:25,610
So it usually remains fairly constant water consumed during the day, whether it's through food,

542
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:33,200
drink will be balanced by water, loss of urination, perspiration to our stool through respiration.

543
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:44,639
Those would be ways we lose fluid. So just this is very general statements about highly complex processes,

544
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:52,320
but disorders of water balance and sodium balance are common but frequently misunderstood.

545
01:05:52,980 --> 01:06:01,950
So like a zero sodium or plasma sodium concentration is generally regulated by changes in water intake and excretion,

546
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:10,800
not by changes in sodium balance or control. So some comes in hyper naturally mix or high sodium level.

547
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:14,910
It's not because they eat too much salt in their diet.

548
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:21,060
So it's usually due to some issues with their water intake or excretion.

549
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:28,640
Okay. So hyponatremia, this is a low serum sodium.

550
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:35,480
We'll talk more about this. Thursday is primarily due to the intake of water that cannot be excreted.

551
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:39,590
So maybe there's too much water. The patient is over hydrated.

552
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:43,669
Probably too much water that doesn't have solid in it.

553
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:46,810
So just water out. So.

554
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:54,710
Hyper-V three is a high serum sodium, primarily due to the loss of water that has not been replaced.

555
01:06:54,740 --> 01:07:01,270
So can you give me an example what that would look like if a patient came in their Hyper-V treatment?

556
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:15,520
Yeah. Dehydration is a sign like, yes, you went on a really long run or really physically active.

557
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:22,960
It did not replace that fluid. You could come in hydrated and your serum sodium would likely be high.

558
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:36,590
Then once you rehydrate, you would probably come back down. Hypokalemia that low represents a loss of sodium and water.

559
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:41,320
So you're just kind of depleted. Your your blood volume is depleted and you're losing both.

560
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,490
Hyper volume is primarily due to sodium and water retention.

561
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:56,210
So different disease states can impact. Our body is predominantly blood pressure, which is regulated by many things, but also the kidneys.

562
01:07:56,330 --> 01:08:03,100
So. That's where we see that we can get some fluid retention and that's retaining sodium and fluid.

563
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:09,120
Okay. So we're talking about hydration, status, dehydration, as we think about it,

564
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:17,219
is really a reduction in that total body water so below the normal level without a proportional reduction in sodium and potassium.

565
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:23,100
So we're losing water and not necessarily losing volume.

566
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:27,360
So this will result in a rise in the plasma sodium concentration.

567
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:32,519
This is very simplistic. It is more complicated.

568
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:36,899
But essentially, like I fully know, hyponatremia.

569
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:40,350
So low sodium food and too much water.

570
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:45,870
Hyperlipidemia too little water. Hypokalemia.

571
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:57,959
So low volume, too little sodium. Also could be water as well, but too little sodium which is the main extracellular solution and then hyperkalemia.

572
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,750
So this is that sodium and water retention.

573
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:06,600
So too much sodium with associated water retention retention that can lead to edema, which we'll talk about.

574
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:13,270
Yeah. How much water in a cell? Oh, gosh, I don't know, like the volume.

575
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:17,890
It probably depends on the type of cell. Yeah, I'm not sure.

576
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:26,380
Question. How fulfilling?

577
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:40,210
Yes. We will talk. I'll give you an example. So, Hyperkalemia, let's say somebody has heart failure and they're not able to.

578
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:48,969
Circulate the blood volume as well that can trigger the kidneys to retain sodium and fluid.

579
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:57,880
And then that's where we see some people that have swollen parts of their periphery and then hypokalemia.

580
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:06,450
They could be like excessive diuretics or they're just excreting too much water and sodium.

581
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:10,860
And usually, like, you wouldn't physically be able to see that.

582
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:15,840
Like physically you can physically see some signs of hyperkalemia with patients that are feeling good.

583
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:21,710
This is more like laboratory evidence. Yeah.

584
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:28,280
I truly know where. Like too much.

585
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:33,260
I've been in your body. In the body?

586
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:37,340
Yeah. So it could be sick or.

587
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:43,040
Yes, like too little sodium in the Sierra Leone.

588
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:51,670
I mean, there's an imbalance in the country in a sense.

589
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:55,090
Yeah. I mean, I put too little too much pressure.

590
01:10:55,180 --> 01:11:00,309
Is that affected at all when you take first that it can be filled?

591
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:11,200
Like usually it could be due to like excessive amounts of sodium containing highly fluids or we're giving I.V. fluids that don't have enough sodium,

592
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:15,550
but not as much impacted by dietary sodium intake.

593
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:23,469
Um, but there, you know, our patients will talk later that have heart failure, that are prone to fluid retention.

594
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:29,740
And if, you know, they're on a very low sodium diet because we don't want to exacerbate the sodium retention.

595
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:42,040
Okay, so there is some dietary sodium implications, but on face value, it's not really, really that they would have to be disease specific.

596
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:53,270
Okay. So let's talk about these volumes. So excessive volume or low volume, flood volume occurs when there is a gain or loss influence.

597
01:11:53,270 --> 01:12:02,390
So this is both water and solids of water and sodium that's going to alter really that extracellular fluid volume is what we're talking about,

598
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:11,000
loss of the extracellular fluid volume we can see in circumstances of volume depletion.

599
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:17,569
So maybe a patient has excessive GI losses like they have a lot of diarrhea, maybe they're vomiting.

600
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:24,110
You lose sodium rich fluids to NSF, there are diuresis or maybe there was a hemorrhage.

601
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:28,729
That would be a more severe presentation. But loss of that volume.

602
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:32,810
So hypo v bulimia could be when our patients that have, you know,

603
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:37,370
really a lot of GI distress and they're losing a lot of fluid that way because

604
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:42,740
those sodium rich fluids in the GI tract and in the stomach is not just water.

605
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:46,100
We have potassium, sodium, all a lot of soluble there.

606
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:53,750
So excessive losses from the GI tract and abnormalities in kidney function are often found in BP.

607
01:12:53,750 --> 01:13:02,930
The primary contributors of electrolyte imbalances, slightly hypokalemia in the type of patients we'll see is usually do the G.I. losses.

608
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:12,060
Hyperkalemia is probably. Some type of alteration, kidney function that's causing them to retain fluid and sodium.

609
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:19,720
Okay. Let's talk about edema. Sometimes we'll be referred to as third spacing.

610
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:24,370
That's different then that third phase of the ECF.

611
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:27,999
We briefly touched on that. I don't want you to really worry about that.

612
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:38,590
We'll use edema as the term here. This is defined as a palpable swelling produced by expansion of the interstitial fluid volume.

613
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:45,910
Usually remember the interstitial fluid volume is part of the the ECF, the extracellular fluid compartment.

614
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:51,160
So a variety of clinical conditions are associated with the development of edema.

615
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:57,160
We'll talk about heart failure this semester. We'll talk about cirrhosis and kidney disease next semester.

616
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:05,639
Okay. So a team is not a normal occurrence, right?

617
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:13,290
So it doesn't occur when in most people because we have a very tight balance of

618
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:18,929
hemodynamic forces along that capillary wall and the function of the lymphatic vessels.

619
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:25,709
So this is all tightly regulated. So for generalized edema to occur, to occur, two factors have to be present.

620
01:14:25,710 --> 01:14:35,190
We usually see an alteration in capillary hemodynamic that favors movement of fluid from the vascular space into the interstitial fluid.

621
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:42,530
Okay, so. The intravascular space into the interstitial.

622
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:49,730
So there's something with the the dynamics of the capillary that's allowing that to happen.

623
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:59,350
That's not normal. And then retention of dietary or intravenous administrator administered sodium in water by the kidneys.

624
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:04,510
So the kidneys are also retaining sodium and fluid. Okay.

625
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:11,160
So it's really about the fluid moving from this space into this space.

626
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:14,160
And that's where we see that visible and palpable swelling.

627
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:21,340
Okay. Fluid moves from the intravascular space where it's contributing to cardiac output,

628
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:25,150
to the interstitial space where it cannot contribute to cardiac output.

629
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:31,870
So that's why we can see. Some difficulties with like blood pressure.

630
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:44,190
So if his patient has hypertension or poor kidney function, which can be due to hypertension or poor cardiac output because of heart failure,

631
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:55,150
we can see the manifestation of some some movement of the fluid into that space that you can, again, visually, visually assess on a patient.

632
01:15:56,510 --> 01:16:03,790
Anybody have questions on that? I know. That's just like a really brief introduction to sodium and fluid balance.

633
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:07,540
Yes. So we need to look at.

634
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:14,060
Ask the question again to when a patient is it has edema.

635
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:24,620
Usually hypertension is an underlying issue for them, but there could be situations where they're hypertensive.

636
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:35,509
But if you think about and we don't get into this quite yet, but the kidneys are big regulators of blood pressure as well as the heart.

637
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:41,749
So if there's heart failure, that will affect blood pressure, which then can affect kidney function.

638
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:49,399
And that's where we see a lot of the retention of the fluid and sodium that then contributes to edema and

639
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:56,120
that can require more work for the heart and kidneys to support tissues that are now kind of overloaded.

640
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:08,330
Any other questions? I noticed that. If you are.

641
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:18,590
Started to. Dr. Pepper.

642
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:30,860
So I think it's probably not a direct flight, just the shorter it's probably maybe.

643
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:43,860
Anything like refined sugars or high sugar. Helps improve blood sugar regulation, which then helps the kidneys function.

644
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:50,450
Thank you. All right. So that's a very brief and.

645
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:56,810
Kind of pared down information on water and fluid balance.

646
01:17:57,170 --> 01:18:00,470
This has never been my strong suit.

647
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:06,620
I now have much better grasp of this. But I think once you work politically and you understand the different IV fluids that

648
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:10,400
patients are getting their different presentations and then what their labs do.

649
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:12,139
It helps kind of put it together,

650
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:20,990
but I think it'll be helpful to get into specific disease conditions where we see alterations in fluid and so that we can connect it all.

651
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:24,770
Okay. All right. So that's all we have for today.

652
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:34,580
We will get more into electrolytes and serum proteins on Thursday and wrap up our biomarker section.

653
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:37,850
Thank you so much. I'll see you guys on Thursday.
