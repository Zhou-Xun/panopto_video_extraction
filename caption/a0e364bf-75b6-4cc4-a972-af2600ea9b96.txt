1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:05,280
Right. You got to be okay.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:12,300
Now we're ready to go. And I also am not distracted by the latter part of the time.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:22,080
Someone who's an alum has a goal to help the master's students in his program only show up

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,660
in suits when there's somebody in town who houses them for at least a good internship.

5
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,030
So who's in town every morning?

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:37,040
Oh, I've got to go. Well, I hope those of you are losing a lot of people.

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,080
So we have essentially three components today.

8
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,810
One is stuff of immediate interest about, say, policy memos, strategic analysis and so forth.

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:59,650
If you have questions about your specific paper that aren't answered in the sort of general comments I give today, come to your policy salon.

10
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,860
That's the primary one. Forget about the summer office hours of these things.

11
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,069
Like something else then. Kind of policy.

12
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,360
So I'm going to fight with this if you don't have a problem and your problem isn't covered by anything else.

13
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:19,080
But that's going to come after the strategic discussion. Also, we divided up the gradings.

14
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,820
So it's not like if they got drunk on power and decided to play with your lives.

15
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,500
She just uploaded all of the comments, so don't go clogging all over, please.

16
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:36,989
Okay, then we'll talk about the legislative process, which is one of these sort of races that the state begins its tail,

17
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,760
because power creates rules and rules, policies that will create power, policy create rules.

18
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,820
So we're going to try and talk through this as a way to understand a lot of those bad things about the entire

19
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,860
health care and public health systems you're going to be working because quite frequently when you say,

20
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,249
here's some absolutely insane thing in the American health care system,

21
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,720
the answer turns out to lie somewhere in the manipulation of Senate rules 15 years ago.

22
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,690
I'm going to talk about what this means for actual formulation creation of policies.

23
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,079
So what you want me to deliver and the drive, but I'm willing to bet.

24
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,639
Riveting conversation about the grades part to me, to living an animated conversation about things that only make no sense.

25
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,820
The atoms of you rules by which powerful people in our society live.

26
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:28,049
And then by the three you talk to each other about how to distort what you're actually trying to do further and further away from goodness and truth,

27
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,890
enlightened towards things that fit with the Senate rules that are understood by people.

28
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,140
Senator, let's go. I guess I didn't have any content on that point.

29
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:44,770
Yeah. So we'll give you an extra week. I've heard you all having a pretty miserable week that week.

30
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:50,980
So now you can sort of extend it out and come in for a gentle, miserable weekend as well.

31
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:57,250
We want you to. We want you to be able to balance out your obligations, but not enjoy the weekend after the midterms either.

32
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,240
So that was the key point, moving along the paper's top line.

33
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,980
Their good admissions committee, good, messed up, patriotic ones on the back years investigating.

34
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,800
But nobody ever wants to wants me to say that.

35
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:20,280
Instead, they want to know how to do that. These are things that came up in multiple papers.

36
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,740
Nobody had all of these problems until you had none of these problems then.

37
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:32,220
Nonetheless, because you accidentally failed to have one of these problems, but you wanted to have it on the policy memos was not okay.

38
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,000
So here are things that came on to watch. Ordered information will go back to grade school.

39
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,920
Topic sentence means a paragraph conclusion right started.

40
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:49,559
I can tell when people were really stressed and went straight from doing their research to writing because what

41
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,320
I get would be sort of things in a role in the of thing was actually really important and they weren't flagged.

42
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:00,110
So you know I did a discussion of how Medicaid's a state federal program then sort of six sentences down.

43
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,400
I find the actual policy that they were talking about.

44
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:12,209
So order in order to show to your reader that you understand the hierarchy of priorities that you really you're trying to formulate what matters most.

45
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,650
And you show them that you're a person worth talking to by showing them that you know what matters most.

46
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,890
Okay, so. Education is cumulative.

47
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,160
Stick with what they taught you in sixth grade on that one kid. Precision about actors and plausible policy options.

48
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:36,790
We explicitly said it's okay, for example, to have parents of gun violence victims or parents in general or patients in general,

49
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,000
or people who might become pregnant in general.

50
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,260
Those are groups in society.

51
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:50,140
But as you go forward, it's good to think that at this stage it's good to think through the impact and potential impact of unorganized people.

52
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,389
As we go forward. However, politics is about power.

53
00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:02,520
Power comes through organization, so be more precise about unorganized groups is going to be helpful in policy analysis, right?

54
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,169
So instead of people who have children, you want to refine it down to, for example,

55
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:11,760
parents of children who are victimized in captivity instead of people who might become pregnant.

56
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,170
You'd say, who are the groups that are engaged in thinking about parental mortality?

57
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:24,170
Likewise, unquestionably, state legislatures have ruled against a policy like that.

58
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,340
That's that cannot not be true.

59
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,760
But if you're doing a strategic analysis going forward with the policy memos, let's get a little more precise, you know,

60
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:39,209
sort of Democrats in the state legislature, Republicans in the state legislature or a committee at the state legislature.

61
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:45,630
Right. Because it's true that state legislatures or governors or Congress have a big role in health policy,

62
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,720
but that's not precise enough to take an actual action of the drought.

63
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,820
Classic look around. Clean up the writing.

64
00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:00,720
Typos. Grammar. Yeah. I too delivered slides to important people at the lower end point.

65
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,339
Clippings that appear on the spellcheck. Doesn't look good for professional building credibility.

66
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,370
When I do, it doesn't look good. Professional credibility when you do it.

67
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,570
So don't be like me that we ought to be.

68
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,200
When people read bibliographies remotely, they read the titles. They don't click on the link.

69
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,290
There's a long gap between how I wish to read what this person wrote and I wish to know what this person read.

70
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:28,889
Right. So here's the letter. So if I just have a dollar number or a citation to Giffords, what am I going to do?

71
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,850
Go on a different website, look around until I find something that I think validates the argument.

72
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:40,200
And if I had a DUI that told me you did read something inside of it, but I don't know what it was.

73
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:44,700
And if I was paying for a policymaker. I'm not impressed.

74
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:44,890
Right.

75
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:50,670
I want to know straight up, is this an article in a medical journal or is this an article somewhere in the great literature or is this an editorial?

76
00:06:51,750 --> 00:07:00,540
So all citations. All of this is solving backward, by the way, from intelligent, busy people whose patience you could very easily exhaust,

77
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:06,360
which is how you should assume all policy makers are is the fault of journalism, right?

78
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,950
So if USA Today writes an article about a study, click through inside the study.

79
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,970
If you can't for the life of you, figure out where the study is or whether it exists,

80
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,180
then that tells you USA Today might not be a great source in the first place.

81
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:25,959
One that was surprising to me, but I guess I should be pleased because it reflects the improved quality of the university.

82
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,000
Press relations is when I got an article on a university website about a study the faculty did.

83
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,030
I'm delighted. But on the other hand, that click through to the actual study, right?

84
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,900
Because the PR people's job is to make NYU or Michigan look good.

85
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,780
And I've dealt with plenty of them. And they frequently don't understand what they're talking about.

86
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,970
Well, you do. They're hired as press. They're not hired as scholars and researchers.

87
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:55,410
And just just one of the simplest tricks is read it out loud.

88
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,110
You start reading your own text out loud, you think, Who is this wordy person with no command of the English language?

89
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,850
Right. Another thing you can do, by the way,

90
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,909
this is an amazingly simple trick and I strongly recommend it if you're filling

91
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,970
out like a really high stakes form with some sort of supplement upside down,

92
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:18,990
because in particular, native speakers of any language have an extraordinary ability to compensate for typos in the spelling.

93
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:24,540
So if you get a chance, they have an entire thing on the wall that people who actually wait for your sandwich that makes this point.

94
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:30,870
As long as the person in the last letter accurate, most native speakers will feel it in their native language.

95
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:39,360
All the correct content regardless of what's actually there. My first book describes the United Kingdom compared to the perspective on the cover.

96
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:46,260
The many of the people involved in this knows it now. Some of their books are not happy about this to this day.

97
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,400
And so, you know, flip it upside down and read it upside down.

98
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,360
Read it out loud, put it away for the night, ask a friend to read it.

99
00:08:54,730 --> 00:09:01,200
And because looking professional and being very, very good at communicating is a lot of what we say when we say writing matters.

100
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,100
Now, one of the ones and this is kind of what's hard to articulate is the point in the bullet.

101
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:14,730
But if you, for example, said train doctors better instead, that's not a policy, right?

102
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,530
Because the government doesn't train doctors.

103
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:25,690
The government has an array of tools with which to incentivize people to train doctors differently and Medicare to some extent,

104
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:32,940
to influence over accrediting bodies and so forth and so forth. So last year, one of the policy challenges was on algorithmic racism.

105
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:40,710
I get the undergrads and I said, you know, you need to come up with policies that will prevent health care algorithms, inculcating racist assumptions.

106
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,200
And I got a bunch of undergrads in tears two weeks later saying that they were trying to learn the coding wasn't going well.

107
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,100
So now I want you to write an algorithm that's not racist.

108
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:55,680
I want you to write a public policy that will deter people who know what they're doing for writing algorithms that are racist.

109
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:01,500
Huge difference. Time for one. You hired political scientist and lawyers for the other coders.

110
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:07,830
Another for anything. Again, if you find yourself getting comments along those lines like come to office.

111
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,720
The final thing at the bottom when you do these, this isn't an academic term paper, right?

112
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:17,580
So that's the good news. You're done with that. At least in this class, it's about 25% research.

113
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,890
And coming up with a convincing rationale for what you're saying and know answers to counterarguments.

114
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:29,370
Then you write it, you write it well. And then 45% is editing, refining, making sure it fits.

115
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,960
It looks professional, it communicates.

116
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:38,010
That doesn't matter so much in this particular strategic analysis because we gave it a template and it was as beautiful as we chose to make it.

117
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,430
But going forward, pay a lot of attention to that. Right.

118
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:46,830
This is a communications and persuasive exercise as it is not as much as any kind of scientific exercise.

119
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:55,190
So this is partly a things that we saw, but it's primarily a things you want to think about as you go forward.

120
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:00,650
Because as you move into the policy levels and the policy challenge, these skills are more and more over evaluating.

121
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:08,970
Would this persuade the modal legislative director, who is probably very intelligent, very well versed in public policy,

122
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:14,930
very sleep deprived and very interested in getting an immediate sense of whether this thing's persuasive

123
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:20,120
at every level from good soundbites and good language through to a good underlying research base.

124
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,399
I also need to look at your point.

125
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:30,130
At this point, this is not that far from what a well-run organization of any description is going to want from policy.

126
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,730
Right. And people who try to do you down.

127
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:41,200
Somebody who doesn't like your ideal. There is a playbook for how to indirectly undermine it.

128
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:49,290
And guess what is? Point out, ask helpful little constructive queries about typos and bad footnotes and so forth.

129
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,020
Just slowly undermine your professionalism just a little bit. They never quite know what they're doing to.

130
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,790
Identify a specific fact and call a question on it.

131
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,860
And if you don't have a solid looking footnote or how to help you, if you get it wrong on the.

132
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,200
Point three find an ambiguous sentence. Query What exactly did you mean?

133
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,260
I repeat that maybe five times, which I could easily fit into the course of an interview.

134
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,310
I could make you look like a fool. The policies that. I've had this come to me.

135
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,960
I've done this to people. Basic skill. Your job is to be bulletproof against.

136
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:34,240
And that's what we're going to be looking for and that's why we're going to be complaining about things that in most ordinary forms of life,

137
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,010
whatever, you know. Okay, fine. The decimal point. Okay.

138
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,640
Individual questions, questions going forward, which disposal policy on, etc., etc.

139
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,000
So that was the riveting head. You all nodding and taking note section.

140
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,040
So now we get to the bit where I jump around an Afghan animated, you all gently drift off to sleep.

141
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:05,380
All right. Who cares? Steve Hamilton. Now the passing of time.

142
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:12,230
Okay. So as we know in Hamilton, it's misnamed.

143
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:21,550
Here was Aaron Burr, right? And it's a Broadway musical about the development of the rules of the Senate in the hands of Aaron Burr,

144
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,930
whose other major contribution to American life, of course, was shooting with Alexander Hamilton.

145
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,100
Aaron Burr, a strange fellow,

146
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:36,040
was in the Senate and very early in the history of the American Republic decided he was going to clean up the rules of the Senate.

147
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:42,020
Now, as you know, the Senate is elected on a rotating term, so it's been in continuous session since it began.

148
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:49,430
The House is completely realigned every two years, so every two years they meet like a bunch of kids on the first day of the new school.

149
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,180
And they set the rules. The Senate hasn't stopped having continuous rules for one or 200 years.

150
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,630
So Aaron Burr rewrites the rules because he thought they were messy and needed cleaning up.

151
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,220
And what he came up with contained a glitch.

152
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:14,769
If you go look at Robert's Rules of Order or any normal set of proceedings, you introduce a motion second,

153
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,910
a motion to confirm that, you know, people actually think this is worth talking about.

154
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:27,520
Discuss the motion when the motion has been discussed and if somebody puts their hand up and introduces a new motion to stop the discussion.

155
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,760
And what about if the motion to stop talking and start voting is passed?

156
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:37,390
Then you have a motion that you vote on. That's Robert Wildeboer.

157
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:45,860
That's any city council. Aaron Burr forgot to include provisions to stop talking and stop voting.

158
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,360
Meaning the Senate. If you just wanted to keep talking and no way to make yourself.

159
00:14:53,670 --> 00:15:00,370
This is why the filibuster is associated with long speeches. Now, this wasn't really used for most of American history.

160
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:06,820
In the 1960s, Southern racist senators used it to try to block civil rights legislation.

161
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,929
Which meant that the Senate had previously been using a sort of let's all agree unanimously that this is okay,

162
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,819
even though we don't have a rule to allow us to do it.

163
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:21,090
The Senate that has codify a rule, the rule that they codified was that you had a two thirds majority to stop the filibuster.

164
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:26,400
So if two thirds of us got to make you shut up, then you know, then you got to shut up.

165
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,889
This got pushed down to 60,

166
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:37,530
which was a number chosen partly because it was compatible with senators who wanted to be in a blocking minority but weren't raging Jim Crow racists.

167
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:45,370
That's where it stands now with exceptions, because what happens is it turned into a rule that the Senate probably has.

168
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,020
So they wanted to push the 60 votes. Now, the first thing I want underlines that.

169
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:55,929
Second point is not in the Constitution. Okay? What I just said is basically an antiquated interest.

170
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:02,260
The filibuster was ignored until the civil rights movement, when it was used to try to block some civil rights legislation and failed.

171
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:10,999
However. Democrats began to use it more in the last two years of the George W Bush administration,

172
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,990
when they had a Senate majority and they wanted to stop Bush privatizing Social Security and so forth.

173
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,510
But then it absolutely took off as Mitch McConnell's principal weapon against Barack Obama.

174
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,590
And so if you just count the number of the procedural motions on cloture votes,

175
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,280
which is an indicator of how often a filibuster is being used, it skyrocketed today.

176
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:35,210
Your basic assumption should be all legislation is being filibustered until a coalition has been assembled to do otherwise.

177
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,120
Anything on the floor, you should assume, is this legislation is subject to filibuster.

178
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:48,210
This is because McConnell and her simple strategy, which was to make sure Barack Obama failed and then ran against and prevailed.

179
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:54,180
This is exactly, by the way, what's in store for Joe Biden if the Republicans get control of the Senate in November.

180
00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:01,920
Just like in failure, followed by blaming the president because most voters don't distinguish the president from the whole federal system.

181
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,310
Democrats, by the way, don't do that because they like policy victories.

182
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:13,770
So they, for example, did not choose to vote against Trump's social policy provisions because they didn't want Trump to win.

183
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,720
They also wanted to deliver benefits to their constituents. So it's not symmetrical.

184
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:23,810
Now it's not in the Constitution. The framers knew how to write simple majority rules.

185
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:28,520
There's a two thirds rule to ratify the treaty. Okay. The framers knew what a supermajority was.

186
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:33,850
This is a Senate which, in the rules created by Aaron Burr that they had chosen to get rid of,

187
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,550
was not part of our nation's constitutional order in any sense.

188
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,990
And furthermore, it didn't exist in the form that we know it until the fairly recent Barack Obama presidency.

189
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:49,420
Mitch McConnell. Majority Leadership. But they create exceptions because the country is grinding to a halt.

190
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:54,800
So first they create exceptions to confirm judges because otherwise we would have about four people on Supreme Court.

191
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,540
Second, there's a much older one, which is that governments have got to budget.

192
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,740
One of the most fundamental things legislators do is pass budgets.

193
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:11,860
I mean, otherwise things grind to a halt. So there is a very specific procedure, which is one of the workarounds that will get you.

194
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,870
Now that's the filibuster. This is in the context of the Senate.

195
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,670
The Senate is one of the most structurally biased legislatures in the world.

196
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:26,540
It is extremely hard to find a worse constituted legislative body in the world.

197
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:31,000
And I'm not joking. Anyone here from California?

198
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,499
So what if you were to move your state or residency to Wyoming?

199
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,250
You become 68 times more powerful. California.

200
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,920
35 million people. World's 11th largest economy designers.

201
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:53,030
Wyoming. If you just project forward, Wyoming will have a smaller population than Washtenaw County in about three decades.

202
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,530
Half a million people. Sanders. Russia.

203
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,860
North Carolina. Two senators. Michigan, two senators.

204
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,990
Larger jurisdiction of L.A. County. No senators, right?

205
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,570
We get two senators, Los Angeles only gets one share and a share of two California senators.

206
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:18,690
Now, who lives in rural Americans? Who lives in the small states, small by population?

207
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,350
There's a couple that are quite democratic. Vermont, Rhode Island.

208
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,970
Most of them are out west. They are politically conservative.

209
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,120
They are far wider and less diverse in essentially every sense.

210
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:36,090
Better educated have lower rates of uninsurance than the rest of the country.

211
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,520
Not necessarily wealthier a little bit, but that's because. But they're sort of hovering around the median.

212
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,030
So you basically have a system in which a particular kind of person,

213
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:50,460
namely a rural white person with a reasonably high level of education and health insurance,

214
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,590
controls a very large blocking vote in the United States Senate.

215
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:05,700
Even if you were to add Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia as two states and assume that the new four senators would vote Democratic,

216
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,240
you still have a structural bias of 2 to 3 senators against the Democratic Party.

217
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:16,860
Democrats need to do extremely well to get to where they are today, which is 5050, with Kamala Harris as the tie breaking vote.

218
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,840
This is extremely structurally biased.

219
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:27,840
It has come to matter because of the very large shift of non-college white Americans towards the Republican Party over the last couple of decades.

220
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:34,770
Right. The extent to which rural and Republican have started to map onto each other has not been a thing until essentially the 21st century.

221
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,040
Which is why this map. Right, South Dakota elected Republicans.

222
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,150
South Dakota like the Democrats. Good luck finding elected Democrats in South Dakota now.

223
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,059
Okay, so we have this incredibly structurally biased legislature,

224
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,290
which for the first time in American history, maps really well on to the interests of one political party.

225
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:59,150
Which is how the Democrats represent about 40 million more people with exactly as many senators as the Republicans.

226
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:06,139
We're approaching the point where if you take a 60 vote rule plus population trends in the United States,

227
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,270
which is primarily people moving out of rural areas,

228
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:13,850
it'll still be about 14% of the population will be able to elect a blocking minority in the Senate, 14%.

229
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,400
I think we can question the validity of some democratic grounds.

230
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:24,010
I think we can also ask how long a country can have such a small portion of our house before we see some sort of a global crisis.

231
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:31,120
But any time we override a filibuster on traditional bipartisan budgets because we want the country to function.

232
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:36,040
Furthermore, you can build a coalition because Republicans want judges appointed.

233
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:42,180
Democrats want to disappoint. Republicans frequently prefer to make their policies through the tax code, so they love stuff.

234
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,700
It's about the budget. Democrats are much more likely to want to legislate, right?

235
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:50,050
You can pass the Trump tax cuts in the context of budgeting.

236
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,790
You can't codify rule versus wade in the context of budgeting.

237
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:58,420
That's a law that was subject to the filibuster. So the budget will be used as call reconciliation.

238
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:05,190
That requires 50 votes to end debate on legislation that follows these criteria.

239
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,570
It's about taxing and spending. It can't be legislation I wrote.

240
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,230
It's pre-planned in a spending resolution at the beginning of each term.

241
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:23,360
They put in a resolution essentially saying what their targets are for expenditure, and that creates the opportunity for one reconciliation bill.

242
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,120
The Republicans tried to do, too. In the first term, trumpet didn't work.

243
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,940
And it's projected by the Congressional Budget Office to reduce the deficit in a ten year time frame.

244
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:43,720
If your policy idea fits that framework, then it could be included in the one precious reconciliation bill that goes through.

245
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:49,000
So you ask yourself, why do we have to lump gigantic amounts of legislation together into one thing?

246
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,350
The answer is that we only get one shot at reconciliation in the typical Congress,

247
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,970
which is why we get these immense thousand page Christmas tree and pieces of legislation.

248
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:04,300
Thus, reconciliation, and please note, projected to reduce the deficit in a ten year time frame by CBO.

249
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:12,440
First of all, it's a lot of power receiving. Secondly, that's a very good way to think, right.

250
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:18,939
When the Trump tax cuts passed. Nobody anticipated the COVID 19 pandemic.

251
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:25,290
Right. So the CBO projections projects straightforward ones, right?

252
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:31,230
They don't have business cycles. Public policy doesn't have any effect. It's money in and money out, which the CBO does,

253
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,650
because they don't want to get into the politically contested business of debating whether

254
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,670
or not these deals are going to improve health care system efficiency or something.

255
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:43,400
So. Pay attention to this. Because you can't legislate.

256
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:51,489
Threw it under the Third Amendment, which it's called, and it has to be preplanned.

257
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,870
So it's basically one big bill that's got to contain it all and then get certain target numbers total.

258
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:03,340
And it's supposed to reduce the deficit to get air time for not a nine year time frame down below in, for example,

259
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:10,749
was when George W Bush passed the and abolished the inheritance tax because his way to get it through on a reconciliation

260
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:19,020
was a bill designed by the Republican leadership not to personally then gradually cut it down by 10% a year until zero,

261
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:27,750
ten years out from passage. And then in order to make sure that didn't mess up budgetary reductions, it shot back up to 100% of what it did.

262
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:36,220
And this got nicknamed the throw more from the trade provision because they created an enormous fiscal incentive to murder old people for one year.

263
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:43,569
It was like the purge or something. There's no evidence that anybody did actually draw the immigrants and shuffle their parent off their mortal coil.

264
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:47,200
But it was a fairly bizarre thing created by the need to pass the reconciliation,

265
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:52,749
not because anybody thought there was any possible public policy justification for changing the inheritance tax.

266
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:57,170
That was because it's nonsense. So.

267
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:04,220
What that means is because you have to do ten years as judged by the CBO,

268
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,870
you're going to care a lot about equal pay for us, which is what kind of a bias?

269
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,220
How do you pay for this thing? Where do you find someone? How do you prove that it saves the federal government money?

270
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:20,810
Or how do you come up with some kind of way of otherwise getting money and getting tax revenue or, you know,

271
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:26,270
or increasing some form of government efficiency that the CBO will believe in order to pay for what you want.

272
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:31,520
That's really important because this is like just like. Okay. So the two implications.

273
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,260
One, it's easy to put together a coalition of senators who want cuts.

274
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,270
They don't agree on the judges, but they want judges. So that's why we don't have a filibuster anymore with the courts.

275
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:47,909
Spending and taxing. Likewise, Republicans care deeply about the tax code and spending.

276
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:53,400
Democrats care deeply about the tax code and spending. Therefore, we have a procedure to work on tax code and spending.

277
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,179
Democrats care about a lot of other things Republicans don't find as interesting,

278
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:02,040
which is why the system has actually kind of worked well for Republicans. Legislation is what this is about.

279
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,079
So right now, if you wish to codify Roe versus Wade as a Democrat,

280
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:12,750
you either need to change the Senate rules or you just accept that it will be filibustered and there will

281
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:17,580
be no codification of Roe versus Wade because nobody can codify Roe versus Wade through the tax code,

282
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:23,580
which means that if you want to be smart, the district budgeting is the center of the game.

283
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:29,180
This is an incentive to frame whatever policy you want to the federal government in terms of the budget.

284
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,620
So if you're a Democrat or a Republican, either way,

285
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:38,629
you need to think about policies that we can work through the tax code because

286
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:43,340
that's the way you can get it rammed through in a once in a year shotgun trade.

287
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:49,280
Nearly as if you're not in that trend. It's because you're a legislative idea or because you're just unlucky something for that trend.

288
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:55,880
So this explains a number of questions.

289
00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:01,760
Why is it so easy to sue on the ACA? Partly because the federal courts to contain a number of conservatives hate the thing.

290
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:08,510
But also the ACA is a poorly written law. The ACA contains a number of things that are fundamentally just religious self-contradiction.

291
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:14,600
It's got a real rough draft. Like I said. What was the ACA mandate?

292
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,570
Honestly, what year did it end? That's not an easy question to answer.

293
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:29,000
What is the Inflation Reduction Act? Why is it so utterly important that the taxes that were changing the corporate tax rate be connected with?

294
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:35,840
Giving Medicare a right to negotiate on drug prices will be the classic trick.

295
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,120
This is first of all, we're going to listen a deafening volume to an ad for whatever this is.

296
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,680
But this is an honest to God, simple, concise and musical.

297
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:14,480
A lot of. Do you all know Schoolhouse Rock?

298
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:25,400
Is that we? Yeah.

299
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,560
It's cool.

300
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,710
All right. This might blow your ears off. Definitely.

301
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:49,850
That's just for your microphone. I think that maybe some of us got one desktop feeling a little ahead of your life.

302
00:28:50,700 --> 00:29:00,160
Yeah. Better late than never.

303
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:15,490
Well, there you go. Huh? No.

304
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:52,500
It was. Advocate, foreign policy champion and introduced.

305
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:11,170
The other guest referred to committee. Most things die.

306
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:30,700
They. Remember, most people died here on the political theater.

307
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:35,110
Right. You see what this introduced a lot of the time is totally not here.

308
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:51,120
In here. Okay. But how is there?

309
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,760
And so now you get introduced to the Senate, you get voted.

310
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:22,300
An actual signature. One of the reasons I do this.

311
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:38,350
But. It is jury to override both houses.

312
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:52,640
Okay.

313
00:31:54,230 --> 00:32:00,320
I show this to you partly because I've learned that whenever I allow presentations in any other class at the University of Michigan, I have shown it.

314
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,670
So I thought I might as well get the jump on you, since clearly this thing has lived through the ages very successfully.

315
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,890
Second, it's accurate. Like that's the American political process as it's supposed to work.

316
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:36,520
So here's what I'm going to present. Schoolhouse Rock.

317
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,650
Introduction. Many, many, many things get introduced.

318
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,690
A lot of the time to get a bill introduced, simply that it's in the debate at all.

319
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:50,620
It's a way of agenda setting. It's a way of building credibility as a way of getting something going.

320
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:54,160
I know once you're doing single payer advocates in a bunch of different states,

321
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:59,920
they all introduce their bill because the best they could hope for was to get a hearing so they could get their issue onto the map.

322
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,510
Like they didn't expect Pennsylvania to pass single payer health care in 2008.

323
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:10,780
What they expected was that they could keep this conversation alive and get here and maybe pick up a few supporters,

324
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,700
you know, persuade interest groups that you get introduced, you get referred to committee.

325
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:21,500
If you're a big bill like the Affordable Care Act or something, you get referred to multiple committees, right?

326
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,559
So the Clinton health plan, real, real history here, gathered for divorce house committees.

327
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,640
They all squabble. They all want to do it differently. We got four versions of the Clinton health plan.

328
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:37,819
This is one of the many ways you could tell the Clinton health plan was in deep trouble. Pelosi is a very good congressional leaders.

329
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:43,310
So she made sure that three key committees in the House actually worked together to markup one version of the Affordable Care Act.

330
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,650
It goes to the Senate committees as well, that very powerful Senate committees.

331
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,399
Bear in mind that because there's only a hundred people in the Senate,

332
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,350
most senators who want to have their fingerprints on any significant piece of legislation before it hits the floor.

333
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:05,020
Passes out of committee as marked up by the committee as amended by the committee goes to player in the house query got passed the Senate.

334
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:10,830
The Senate has the 60 vote supermajority that was going on about the House doesn't

335
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,470
the House is a much more regimented go a lot to get one kind of organization.

336
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:21,010
Now you had two different versions of the bill, even if you initially introduced exactly the same language in the House of the Senate,

337
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:25,660
by the time the committees and potentially the plenaries are covered and it's been amended so that they're not the same thing.

338
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,000
How do you solve a problem in what we call a conference committee?

339
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,540
The conference committee is where a representative is chosen by the leadership of the two

340
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:37,610
legislative chambers get together and they write a bill that fits both Chambers preferences.

341
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:42,360
Who cares about a result? What does it do to.

342
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,860
Like an employer like this.

343
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,210
It basically provides insurance for people who lose their jobs.

344
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,500
It was caused by the demise of the Studebaker Corporation.

345
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:04,390
It was it was caused by an amazing Studebaker corporation which stuffed all of its pensioners.

346
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:16,510
What is a recipe for health insurance? But you get you are allowed to have insurance for up to one year.

347
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,040
That's Cobra. Oh, okay.

348
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:26,709
This matters, guys, quite a lot. Health insurers under the sun, there's a provision in Arizona is mostly as the native title.

349
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:31,210
The title Retirement Employer Retirement Income Security Act, 1974.

350
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:36,510
As I'd suggest, it's basically a law of pensions, and you don't need to think about it once you're running the whole H.R. division.

351
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:45,080
But it says that multistate, self-funded plans cannot be regulated by state insurers, insurance regulators.

352
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:49,959
So the Fortune 500, an increasingly large number of other multi-state companies that aren't necessarily that big.

353
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,640
But self-insure can't be regulated by still not the state health insurance regulators.

354
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,980
If they are to be regulated, it has to be under a federal mandate that explicitly amends the risk.

355
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,310
Right. So when the federal government regulates the Fortune 500 health insurance offerings, that's the whole game.

356
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:13,790
You can't get out of Montana or Michigan or Missouri, come in and impose additional regulations on a self funded,

357
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:24,349
multi-state plan with no law because it cut off states abilities to make really significant changes to their health insurance markets because,

358
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,500
you know, you can do anything to your biggest employer when you do, right.

359
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:31,700
Maryland trying to use its tax code to make Wal-Mart offer better benefits.

360
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,900
Wal-Mart sued and said under Arisa, you're touching our health insurance plan.

361
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,770
We have a federal right under 1974 law to run one benefits plan for the whole country.

362
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,920
We found the federal courts agree. So much for Maryland's efforts to improve benefits.

363
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:49,520
There is still an ad at 3:00 in the morning and conference committee and we have no idea why.

364
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:58,519
In other words, we completely change the face of health insurance regulation in the United States at an hour when,

365
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,350
honestly, nobody should be making legislation.

366
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:08,920
You know, most things it has been at 6 a.m. in politics is generally about ideals in that tend I have probably anyway.

367
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:14,170
So the conference committee decides this and in this case some bright sparks said we're

368
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:18,430
going to mess up health insurance plans with this law unless we put in this provision.

369
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:23,350
Apparently not thinking it was going to happen or thinking through very, very cleverly what was going to happen.

370
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:27,250
We don't know either. Deliver really smart answers, what they're trying to achieve.

371
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:32,320
If that goes an up or down, you can't imagine anymore. So it comes out of conference.

372
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:38,459
If you either vote yes or no, there's no opportunity to forward it, so it probably pass both.

373
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,290
The president can veto a two thirds override in both houses to override a presidential veto.

374
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:48,449
The last time that happened was when George W Bush inexplicably vetoed expansion of check right

375
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:54,000
at the end of his presidency because it involved a tobacco tax and some nonsense about product.

376
00:37:55,050 --> 00:38:00,750
And then a bill becomes law. This is basically the American legislative procedure has worked for 100 years.

377
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:07,810
It is unfortunately not the way things work now. And so.

378
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:17,270
Let's talk to him a couple of examples. ACA bill introduced House and Senate.

379
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:24,920
Not quite the same bill. Senate wanted to get to work. And under the Constitution, spending bills have to start in the House of the Senate.

380
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,499
So they grabbed a vehicle which happened to be sitting there, which already passed the House and has two national implications.

381
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,760
It was student loan reform.

382
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:38,090
So under title of Affordable Care Act actually is about making sure that your student loans have much more sensible interest rates than

383
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:45,530
they otherwise would stick around that vehicle and also a tax deduction vehicle for members of the armed forces who want to buy houses.

384
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:51,770
Which is why for a long time, the Affordable Care Act's legislative history is actually the serviceman's tax credit bill.

385
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,330
But the ground had to work. And this is very, very tightly engineered by the top leadership of the party.

386
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:03,250
The Democrats are not interested in repeating the experience of Bill Clinton's presidency when everybody got through this.

387
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:09,810
They knock it out of the committees and what rapidly emerges in the House is extremely disappointed.

388
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:13,120
More left wing right. So the House writes a really coherent,

389
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:22,029
well-structured bill and the Senate writes a much more loosey goosey bill because you have individual senators with individual hobby versus co-ops.

390
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:26,400
This co-ops because Kent Conrad of North Dakota liked co-ops because they're very good at something.

391
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:32,410
Right. And nobody ever managed to explain, Senator Conrad, the great health insurance of substantially different products.

392
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:38,010
And so we have this provision for co-ops, as everybody at the time said they didn't working out again.

393
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,720
But you get this kind of looser Senate bill and it's more ideologically right wing.

394
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:47,610
For example, it doesn't have the same nationwide marketplaces, you know,

395
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,120
because you have to please more senators as Democrats in places like Nebraska.

396
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,580
That's the last Democrat addresses everything. Right?

397
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:02,380
It was declaring it passed in the House and House version, which is more exciting and more lesbian.

398
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:07,570
It passes the query in the Senate. At the time, Democrats had 60 votes for about six months.

399
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,380
It's more loosely written and ideologically conservative.

400
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:22,800
Senator Ted Kennedy does. Scott Brown becomes the senator from Massachusetts, their home and his victory party.

401
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:29,639
He's up on stage, rather mysteriously bringing forth his daughters to suggest that if there's any eligible,

402
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,190
that they should have a look at his daughters and see if they're interested,

403
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:38,480
which is really not normal Massachusetts political culture, and that is supporters are much more on the ball.

404
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:41,760
They're chanting 41, 41, 41.

405
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:51,640
Why the fact that. As you may know, they now have a 41 vote blocking majority against the ACA.

406
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:56,720
White House initial reaction is we're doomed. The Obama presidency is over.

407
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:04,780
Rahm Emanuel says maybe we can do something on children's health insurance. What they realize, though there seems to be jealousy again.

408
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:09,850
Is that there is a past version of the law from the Senate.

409
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:15,130
It is technically less government and it is well to the right of your average Democrat in the House.

410
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,320
But it is a version of the law to pass the Senate.

411
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:25,870
So what they do is they have the House pass the Senate word for word, including typos and send it to the president for signature.

412
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:29,740
They've been planning on cleaning up the language in conference committee.

413
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,570
They've been planning on taking the Senate version and pushing it to the left in a conference committee.

414
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:40,180
But instead of that, they did what we call ping pong, in which the House literally passed the Senate,

415
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:47,080
took the exact text and passed it again, because that's why you need to pass both houses to go to the president for signature,

416
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:55,050
which is how we ended up with an accidental Senate draft of the Affordable Care Act to become the law instead of what the leadership planned,

417
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:01,600
which was a full version. Then you pass everything that you expect to get into the law.

418
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,110
The Democrats in the House. Which could be done through reconciliation.

419
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,870
Because then Scott Brown's election doesn't matter.

420
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:14,770
So the Democrats then proceed to bash through as many additional members of the House provisions feel reconciliation as they can.

421
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:19,330
A public option would require legislation. What is in the Senate version?

422
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:25,240
That's why we don't have a public option today. Fast forward to the Trump administration.

423
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,530
Republicans had passed legislation in the House to repeal the ACA,

424
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:37,089
which they knew Obama would veto something like 150 times by the time Trump came into office with Republican control of the White House,

425
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:46,749
the Senate and the House. Now they had an effort to repeal and I guess gesture in the direction of replacing the Affordable Care Act,

426
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:50,950
which failed because John McCain voted against overriding the filibuster.

427
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:52,150
Just yesterday.

428
00:42:54,360 --> 00:43:00,780
But one thing that they could do is go after the mandate, which was the most disliked provision of the ACA in essentially every poll ever done.

429
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:05,250
And what they said, that mandate was what they did, they simply zeroed it out for reconciliation.

430
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:13,919
So, yes, a tax penalty remains. The penalty is zero. So for a weird while, you had to prove your health insurance status.

431
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,770
And then if you said now violating the Affordable Care Act is a great penalty, is zero, correct?

432
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:25,270
Because they used reconciliation instead of amending law, because the Democrats would let them have the law.

433
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:38,530
So. That's what happened to the Affordable Care Act, where the filibuster meant that the Democrats had had 60 votes,

434
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:42,950
they lost one vote, and so they ended up passing essentially a bad drafted in law.

435
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:48,350
Like I said, you should be added again and again and again. The Democrats didn't get to edit because they plan to do that constantly.

436
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:54,440
The Republicans then want to get rid of the law entirely, and all they managed to do was zero out many of the fiscal effects of the laws.

437
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,930
They can't because they have to use reconciliation. Well.

438
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:04,400
So we fast forward to the Inflation Reduction Act, which is possibly one of the most important pieces of legislation in your life,

439
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,030
with enormous implications for the healthcare sector. But the direct implications are people.

440
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,890
First of all, it was a ban on $35 a month.

441
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:23,990
I say that is a mandate covering essentially everybody, which is the caps the caps, insulin expenditures out of pocket at $35,000 a month.

442
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:37,760
Why did the Democrats do this? Politically popular, politically popular wise and politically popular.

443
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,610
There's lots of deserving cases out there of these kids because of the markup charge

444
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:50,960
on an obscene to your average individual who realizes it's an unavoidable necessity.

445
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:56,660
And the profit margins are not in line with what people should be paying bigger.

446
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:01,669
Insulin is a thing that people need. And the only thing I didn't think they needed.

447
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:08,389
The markups are enormous. The industry has not convinced anybody that they're actually delivering anything beneficial for these markups in any way,

448
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:15,620
even if they are like, for heaven's sake, pig, insulin is better than no insulin, I think insulin being the original technology.

449
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,770
Furthermore, most Americans know people with diabetes, right?

450
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:23,270
You need to live a very special existence to not know somebody requires insulin.

451
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:26,809
I don't know if it's possible. So this is a very, very wide ranging thing.

452
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:32,450
So a lot of people know somebody who, even if they have, can't afford it or say how much, say $500 a month for insulin.

453
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:40,910
So the the cap on be we charge of $35 please note because this is a reconciliation, how does that work?

454
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:48,780
Well. It looks like legislation to me doesn't that's telling private insurance companies what to do.

455
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,860
This is the wonderful joke about the Senate. They simply overruled the parliamentarian, pretended they didn't hear the passage,

456
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:03,390
so they basically pushed legislation through against what looked like the Senate rules by simply ignoring publicans

457
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:07,200
who have a different technique to fire the parliamentarian until they get a parliamentary system they want.

458
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:18,590
The Democrats just ignore the volunteer handing over. The other thing in the IRA that matters in a very direct way for health care is the.

459
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:25,170
Nothing amounts to the IRA in a very direct way is the Medicare now gets to negotiate prices.

460
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:31,770
The attention to that group. Anyone want a job?

461
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,780
Where do I talk? Like our country.

462
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,870
And then over the next couple of years, then it expanded from an additional 20 to 30.

463
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:50,490
Yeah. So over the next two years, the top ten, we identify the ten most expensive thing Medicare buys that they're authorized to negotiate prices.

464
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,050
Please consider what NC Medicare discounts look like to the drug companies the world.

465
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,680
Literally, they just inform you of the price and you pay it.

466
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,600
And that's currently how the United States buys drugs. You can see what industry thinks.

467
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,200
This is an absolutely fabulous way to promote innovation and the development of life saving

468
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,339
cures by incentivizing strong private dedication to researching innovative technologies.

469
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:15,750
Right. You can also see how everybody else thinks this got to be the biggest joke on the planet.

470
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:25,480
So immediate effects. It's not that big Red's ten drugs and it get to negotiate and it becomes a long list of drugs over time.

471
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:26,709
Partly since.

472
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:34,280
And exactly one drug, which is the one I mentioned already, which is the same expensive hepatitis drug which could literally bankrupt Medicare.

473
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:39,429
If you take the number of people who are on Medicare and have hepatitis times the cost of that drug,

474
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:43,060
you can literally wipe out the Medicare trust fund you're getting literally wipe out the Medicare budget.

475
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:49,000
So ten drugs is not that long list, long list of drugs if that drug is on it.

476
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:59,160
Furthermore, it was enough that the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, the what we call pharma, actually fired their top Democrat.

477
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:02,940
Because as a rule of thumb in Washington, the pharmaceutical industry does not lose.

478
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:09,150
So the pharmaceutical industry did not get what they wanted. The Republican lobbyists delivered.

479
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:12,750
The Republicans all voted against it. The Republican lobbyist is still in her office.

480
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:14,909
The Democratic lobbyist is currently unemployed.

481
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:20,280
We have a new Democrat because clearly they're losing control of the Democratic Party influence that they got and they want it back.

482
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:27,780
So the pharmaceutical industry tampered. Those are the two direct health care provisions of the IRA.

483
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,640
Notice that the one went in because it saved a lot of money. Right.

484
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:34,320
So why do you vote against the pharmaceutical industry, the Democrat?

485
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:39,720
Because it unlocks all sorts of other benefits, all the money you save by the projected savings on medicines.

486
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:43,830
You can play with whatever else you care about subsidizing electric cars, for example.

487
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,800
So Medicare, drug price negotiation, reimburse it paid for is really important.

488
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:53,430
Medicare prescription is a pay for for all sorts of other things.

489
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:59,750
So if I'm an ordinary Democrat, I like the idea of saving Medicare money in the abstract,

490
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:06,480
but I like it enough to vote against the pharmaceutical lobby because it means, for example, I can subsidize electric cars.

491
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,310
I have to do that. Right.

492
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:15,479
So if I'm a senator from Michigan, I don't have to have any strong opinion about medicines, but I have a strong opinion about the automobile industry.

493
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:22,469
And this is this is gold. This is great. And that's why the pharmaceutical industry sometimes because it's a precedent, it shows they can lose.

494
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:25,710
And in politics, if you've lost, once people draw the conclusion, you could lose again.

495
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:31,320
And B, because if you structure it as how do we take money out of the pharmaceutical

496
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,830
budget in order to achieve every single other social goal of the country?

497
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:38,550
You want to be the pharmaceutical industry in that transcript, do you?

498
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:46,680
So the irony passes passes under reconciliation so that if we had our legislation, we're done.

499
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:51,450
Everything else has to be able to pass a 60 vote supermajority until we have the elections.

500
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:53,220
We find out who's running the Senate and the country.

501
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,940
This is a blizzard information type of information, despite my jumping around and making snarky remarks and seeing the body language that I predicted.

502
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:08,310
So let's try and apply it. So for Paris, I hope.

503
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:18,570
Yeah, sure. So how did the. Any reform that.

504
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:30,850
Well, I did the mandate here qualified for this reconciliation because they didn't repeal it.

505
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:34,970
They zero it out that same model over ten years.

506
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:42,620
They found some other paperwork. Okay. I don't know what a Roth IRA is.

507
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:49,970
Okay. Anyway, here to Iraq, conversion is going to be, like, rolling.

508
00:50:51,210 --> 00:51:00,680
All right. Yes. Whoever said that? Has anyone ever looked at what it means in terms of retirement planning to do a Roth conversion?

509
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:09,800
Right. Because what happens to your income from 41k when you get the disbursements is that it's passed, it's your income.

510
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:16,280
What happens to this from a Roth IRA is completely tax free.

511
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,810
It's an extraordinary giveaway.

512
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:29,300
So rollover involves taking your 41k now, taxing it now, converting it into a Roth which will not be taxed in the future.

513
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,430
So for the next ten years,

514
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:40,220
you substantially increase federal tax revenue in that area because everybody's paying taxes on their for one case during the conversion process.

515
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:47,170
After ten years. It's an absolute fiscal disaster because all the wealthiest people in the United States

516
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:52,030
now a gigantic investments that will never see another tax levy that's paid for.

517
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,870
All right. So that was actually another day for Bush tax cuts.

518
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:01,750
And it's a ton of money, right? It's not just some little money magazine, how it optimizes your income.

519
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,300
This actually adds up to a whole lot of money,

520
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:11,110
which pays off in tax revenue for the first ten years and ends up in a huge fall for essentially the rest of history.

521
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:20,510
So they urinate and they found a different table. All that matters is they hit the top targets so individual items don't have to pay themselves.

522
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:23,389
Right. So subsidies to electric cars.

523
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:29,260
And by the way, the policy advice from Washington is if you don't have to buy iron out because electric cars are going to be amazing.

524
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:33,440
But for years, those subsidies obviously cost money, their subsidies.

525
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:40,340
But you can pay for most of those subsidies by avoiding the projected expenditures on the other side of the law.

526
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:47,590
So I'm going to give the money to car companies to build electric cars instead of to drug companies to make hepatitis drugs.

527
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:55,700
All of that is if you get the top line, unstoppable. So when you see how these things are calculated,

528
00:52:55,700 --> 00:53:00,139
I love the Roth conversion point because it always gets handled in the press as

529
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:04,720
being sort of advice to people have to have large amounts of money in one case,

530
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:12,530
like to think about tax efficiency, but it's actually a huge amount of money which enables a whole lot of other policies to happen under Bush.

531
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:17,890
And you get the same thing here. Medicare is a big story for us because we're in a public school.

532
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:22,480
The actual story is it's paying for a bunch of other things, most of which are to do with clean energy.

533
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:29,760
So basically go to the bank of pharmaceuticals, pull out a few billion dollars and give it to the bank of electric cars.

534
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:42,110
So in the spirit of that, as. Here's the question is a topic you know well your policy memoir, ideas, analysis paper.

535
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:49,980
You do not need to write your policy memo in this vein, but I want you to think about what happens to policy when they play through the strainer.

536
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:59,640
Okay. So chat with each other and reconfigure whatever it is you want to be attractive for inclusion in a bill and passing the reconciliation.

537
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:07,570
New Senate, what's under the rules of this current Senate, which means every single Democrat has to like it.

538
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,150
If you get Republicans, that's great, right?

539
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:16,790
So you need to come up with a bill or a version of your policy that would apparently reduce the deficit over ten years.

540
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:20,440
And that's good. It is tax code or spending, not legislation.

541
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:27,430
If you unavoidably have to spend money, like, for example, zeroing out the revenue from the issue of a mandate,

542
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:33,610
well, what's something you compare it with that makes money for the tax cuts and every single Democrat likes it.

543
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,730
Just do the thought experiment for five, 10 minutes and try to talk through what your policy looks like when you do it that way.

544
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:47,670
How do you provide for leaders education without legislating in a way that pays for itself?

545
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:56,130
Go under. Is that there where you have to find something that makes money?

546
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:04,710
Yes. It's not easy to pay for because if you say I want to spread the next $2 billion, everybody says $150 million.

547
00:55:08,010 --> 00:57:24,419
So you're going to look absolutely 010300001500000000000, yes, yes, yes, yes.

548
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:39,410
Wi-Fi Standards Supported.

549
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:58,950
802.00.

550
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:11,550
Yeah. I guess you could say.

551
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:32,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right, right, right, right, exactly.

552
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:43,240
So what do you do?

553
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:53,060
Coming up next?

554
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:21,670
We have a lot.

555
00:59:36,830 --> 01:01:32,370
It's like, you know, it was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

556
01:01:32,370 --> 01:02:40,700
This is something that I think that's something that I think that makes it easier to say.

557
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:32,630
Yeah. Okay.

558
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:49,370
Okay. So involved in having a hard time, so we all have problems like what happens to your nice policy idea, what we click through.

559
01:03:49,370 --> 01:04:01,880
The strange word has to be taxing or spending. In all, 50 Democrats passed like this and you think your policy you got you do to change it to survive.

560
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:08,530
Oh. I think.

561
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:24,820
Got it. And if we don't write it down, then we'll have to do so and figure out a way or gender or you care in a reconciliation package.

562
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:33,530
So we have some good ideas about what do you and your guys do.

563
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:37,840
Like you have to sit here and things that might be decriminalized.

564
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:51,280
It's troublesome because the testing environment, but I don't know, that might be one of the results.

565
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:58,029
So I find a huge difference. The data is available for work for the same customer.

566
01:04:58,030 --> 01:05:02,760
Okay, so we start with gender affirming care and filling out the tax credits,

567
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:06,820
potential matching almost all, always so much money somehow that you like it.

568
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,570
But any other ideas perhaps is what is lacking in this.

569
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:21,670
So this is one of those. So it's like a minor thing.

570
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:23,550
I, I didn't even start.

571
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:35,079
But, but for a gun licensing bill passed on a federal level, I guess we get to push some of the what we need to go in with a licensing bill.

572
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:39,370
It has less gaps. And I heard you writing a great long letter.

573
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:43,620
I'm sorry. I'm writing law. I'm writing law.

574
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:53,110
Yeah. So I can I can assure that I have the right to be.

575
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:59,450
This is a very, very specific way of thinking, which is created by a political conjuncture.

576
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:07,540
Right. Just be close. We have the Senate and the Senate has the filibuster and a one have policy as it gets appoint judges under

577
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:13,810
the rules of the filibuster in the structural in the Democratic Senate is to do it through reconciliation,

578
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:24,610
which means you have to take whatever you're actually trying to do that fit into this weird for the taxing or spending policy making money is better

579
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:32,320
than losing money because a deficit reduction over ten years getting into that ten year window persuade the parliamentarian is not a solution.

580
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:37,330
Persuade the CBO that the numbers check out and then persuade all 50 Democratic senators.

581
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:46,550
That's the only place you can actually expect. And if this doesn't look a lot like the rules of the policy design, then welcome to the United States.

582
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:52,470
Not to try to. Now they are all in the blue there.

583
01:06:52,500 --> 01:07:00,450
And then you go in Astrakhan. Remember, we had to change up the apartment yet, but we had a week long policy.

584
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,570
So, yes, it's like everything else we do here.

585
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:21,720
So I was doing it in Spanish.
