1
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,480
All right. Good morning, everyone. Welcome back to your new favorite class.

2
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:27,099
Last time we had a little bit of an introduction to environmental health and some of the very

3
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,990
basic concepts are topic the brain toxins happening in this class and exposure science.

4
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:41,620
I went through those examples of questions identifying biological, physical, chemical stressors and so forth with the focus outcomes model.

5
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:48,070
And that was setting the stage to actually jump in today into exposure science.

6
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:56,680
What we're going to do today is define some of the key terms that we're going to use that

7
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,230
the broader community uses and that we'll be using in this class related to exposure,

8
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:12,310
exposure, assessment, exposure science. We'll start to dig in a little bit more to that, that conceptual model, that exposure to outcomes model,

9
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:18,610
and then begin to understand some of the different parameters of exposure.

10
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,770
It gets pretty complicated pretty quickly,

11
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:30,580
but to help provide some insight as to why we might take different approaches to consider different things as we evaluate exposures.

12
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:38,680
Before I launch into today's material, I felt like we were kind of rushed at the end of the class period on Tuesday,

13
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,950
and I didn't feel like I had a chance to just take any questions about anything

14
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,790
related to kind of the introduction of the course framework of the course.

15
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:57,520
But in this day, maybe even the recording from Tuesday, any questions that have come to mind since Tuesday?

16
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:09,060
Okay. Fair enough. I guess I prefer to be called.

17
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,910
You can call me whatever you want. Actually. And I've got.

18
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,370
I already have a story. So.

19
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,920
Yeah, I know that. I prefer, like, I don't know people in my life all day long.

20
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,600
Call me Tim. That's my name. So please don't hesitate to call me Tim.

21
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,010
I know people have issues with, you know, like formalities.

22
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,650
If you want to call me Professor Divine, Dr. Divine, Professor Tim, I'll answer to pretty much anything.

23
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,489
The funny story is that some of you might have noticed somewhere on Wolverine Access where this information is.

24
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,620
My full name is Joseph Timothy Grant.

25
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:56,220
My father's name was also Joseph. So for as long as I can remember, being very, very young, I was called Tim.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,160
So probably until I was like five or six when I went to kindergarten, I think is when I realized my first name is Joseph.

27
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:09,980
So all through elementary school, you know, the first day of class was this very stressful situation because the teacher takes attendance, right?

28
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,930
And they see Joseph, you know, and I like looking around and they look right.

29
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,330
Oh, yeah, they're referring to me. So for this reason, I'll pretty much answer to anything.

30
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,389
So whenever you want to, you know, address me as is totally fine.

31
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:28,850
No worries. Good question. Any. Any others? All right.

32
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,430
Don't hesitate to interrupt me at any point during class to ask questions.

33
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,810
So exposure science is predominantly observational.

34
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,450
Okay, so what is what does that mean?

35
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:54,290
In a fair contrast to a very related and important and connected field is toxicology, which is highly experimental in nature.

36
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,970
Most of toxicology occurs in a laboratory. Right.

37
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,460
Assessing how toxic different chemicals are.

38
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:11,030
Exposure, understanding, measuring, quantifying, assessing exposures primarily takes place in the field.

39
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,640
Right. Because this is where most of us are in our day. We don't spend that much time.

40
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:22,820
Maybe some of us do. But on a population base, that's a very small percentage of people spend time in a laboratory during the day.

41
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,790
We're off in our workplace. We're here at school, we're out having fun somewhere.

42
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:37,640
And this is where the exposures are primarily taking place. So when we talk about exposure assessment being being done in the field.

43
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:45,440
And the basic concept for assessing exposures is to try to obtain knowledge,

44
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:52,970
try to data on exposures that we can then use to build models of exposure,

45
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:02,180
that we can then apply to a much broader population to be able to assess and especially people that are at higher risk.

46
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,620
It's very expensive, whether you're talking about time, resources, supplies,

47
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,360
equipment and make exposure assessment methods, at least in the present age.

48
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:22,790
So there are limited opportunities to do that. We can't measure exposures on everyone all the time, 24 seven for their whole lifetime.

49
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:35,540
What we can do is design very specific and strategic studies to assess exposures, gain knowledge, and then build models to say, okay,

50
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:44,690
we have a person who lives in this location of this age with these risk factors based on the model, we can estimate what their exposure might be.

51
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,220
And then you have the last bullet. There is basically what I just said.

52
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:56,270
So conclusions for those studies allow us to evaluate public health and environmental policy

53
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,070
options so that we can effectively reduce those exposures or prevent them altogether.

54
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:14,129
His widow, Proclean exposure science has typically addressed very, very discrete or acute exposures.

55
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:20,459
The focus on either external or internal environments and either effects of sources

56
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,890
or effects on biologic systems and where it's it's really not the future anymore.

57
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,510
It's kind of now we're already there.

58
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:36,600
But this is where exposure science has moved very quickly over the last maybe decade or so, is looking across the entire spectrum.

59
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,960
So it considers from source, right?

60
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:47,520
So the emission release, whatever it is, a source of stress or understanding all the way to that quantified dose.

61
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:55,710
Right. That a person can post about what it says on Tuesday and on multiple levels of integration.

62
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:03,840
Right. And this is this is the complexity part of it. We live and breathe 24, seven, seven days a week for our whole lives.

63
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:11,340
Right. So it's not just that we have to quantify exposures for an hour every other Tuesday on odd number of years.

64
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,970
Right. So that time and that space and the biological scale is quite complex.

65
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:24,420
But this is exposure. Science is trying to address these things and it's acknowledging that's multiple stressors.

66
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,780
Right. You probably see studies that I'm going to show an example of an exposure science in the news.

67
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:41,219
Looking forward to our next class period. You see news stories, results of studies shows that whatever lead exposure results in this health effect.

68
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:50,610
Right. And that study did a great job of assessing exposure to lead and assessing what the health effects might be from that exposure to lead.

69
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:58,200
But the reality is those those that person or those people were exposed along that pathway to so many more things than what.

70
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:05,220
Right. This is this is the reality of our life, what we eat for breakfast this morning, the air that we breathe,

71
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,719
you know, walking across campus, the quality of the water that we use to make our coffee this morning.

72
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,120
I mean, all of these things are sources of exposure to us, you know,

73
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:25,920
literally 24 seven So acknowledging that we're not just looking very singularly at the issue from an exposure perspective.

74
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:39,030
And then scale from very small molecular systems all the way up through individuals, through populations and more broadly to ecosystems.

75
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:45,390
So this is this is the goal and what exposure science is, is attempting in terms of the current community.

76
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,599
All right. So we actually we introduced this model. Here it is again today.

77
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:58,250
I mentioned that we'll be referring to it quite often over the course and referencing the material that we're covering.

78
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,950
And where does it fit into this model.

79
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:16,790
So through this model, we're acknowledging that there are upstream human related and natural factors that may release stressors into our environment,

80
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:21,799
whether it's our home environment or community environment, our workplace environment,

81
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:29,960
etc. Those stressors can accumulate in the environment to some level of intensity, right?

82
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,470
Like perhaps a concentration. Along the way.

83
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,820
We have requirements in our life.

84
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,470
We have choices in our life.

85
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:52,440
So how we behave, what our time and activity patterns are to a large extent dictate whether we come into contact with this environmental intensity,

86
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,620
with this concentration of a stressor. Right. And this is where exposure either takes place or not.

87
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:05,160
We actually have to come into contact with that stressor in order to actually receive a dose.

88
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:13,540
And then this perhaps leads to if that exposure or stressor is harmful and not some sort of out.

89
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,780
All right, so let's go through some definitions. We'll be using different terms over the course of this semester.

90
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,630
Some of them are almost interchangeable, and that's okay. It's a little bit confusing, but but no, that's the case.

91
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,390
But some have distinct differences. So I just got done using the word stressors.

92
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,650
Right? Another word that's common in this field is a hazard.

93
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:51,130
And so we can define a hazard as well as a chemical, biological or chemical agent that's capable of causing some sort of adverse biological response.

94
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,800
And the examples here are listed on the slide are very similar to what we discussed in class on Tuesday.

95
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,569
Right. In terms of chemical hazards, you know, these are chemical substances.

96
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:10,540
I think on Tuesday, you all mentioned when someone mentioned one four dioxane in terms of the biological hazards.

97
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,610
These are different agents. I know we talked about Kobe two as one.

98
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:22,930
I think I actually mentioned shark bites, even though it's a very small percent chance of that happening to any of us.

99
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:33,010
And then physical hazards, which is basically enter energy transfer into or somewhere within our bodies.

100
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:43,930
And I know we talked about someone mentioned radiation, someone mentioned noise and even some of the ergonomic issues that can cause adverse impacts.

101
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,280
All right. So source, right.

102
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:56,680
This is one of our key factors on our exposure science model.

103
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,400
So what do we actually mean when we say source?

104
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:08,740
So it's basically a point or an area of origin of a toxic agent or hazard.

105
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:16,530
And the community, uh, classifies these sources in a couple of different ways.

106
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,270
They can be sources versus area sources.

107
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:27,210
So I'm going to ask for some examples. What is somebody think might be an example of a point source?

108
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,120
The drain from, like a factory. They, again, like a drain pipe from a factory.

109
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:42,000
Sure. So a pipe that has some sort of discharge.

110
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:47,860
Right. And it's coming from one, one single point, perhaps into a water body or some ecosystem.

111
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,630
Excellent. What about an area source? What would be an example of an area source?

112
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:08,030
Yes. Air pollution in places that have high traffic.

113
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:17,470
People are constantly driving. So, yes. So I'm going to say yes, but that one can be further defined.

114
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:28,070
So if you look at pollution, air being I'm sorry, emissions from individual cars that collectively cover an entire area like an urban area.

115
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,550
Sure, that can be an area and the concept is true.

116
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:41,060
The reason that I hesitated is some people actually in this community because cars travel on roads that are very defined.

117
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:48,380
They even they use a different term and call them light sources because a road actually looks like a line right on a map.

118
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:57,620
But yes, collectively, that would be a good example of an area like a sun with UV radiation on the sun.

119
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,660
I'm going to call that one at point source, actually, because it's coming from a single defined.

120
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:11,930
If we were if we had able to be subjected to radiation from all thousands of stars or something throughout the universe,

121
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,180
then yes, I would I would go with an area source because that's it's coming from one defined star.

122
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,440
Yes. Like an urban or agricultural runoff?

123
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,390
Yes. Great. So agricultural runoff. Right. So it's a it's a wide area.

124
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:38,000
Perhaps there's fertilizers. Right. Nutrients or pesticides applied and with rain or over irrigation that that washes off kind of a large area.

125
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,690
So that's great. So yeah, so I had some built in examples here.

126
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,329
A waste incinerator would also be an example of a point source.

127
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:56,930
So kind of your traditional, you know, smokestacks that are sitting there, one single point coming out of the stack and an area source.

128
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,860
Yes, urban urban runoff would be another example.

129
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:07,760
Okay. So another classification and I started to talk about this a little bit is a stationary source versus a mobile source,

130
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:17,940
so it would be examples of a stationary source. Yes.

131
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,500
A farm. They got a farm. A farm.

132
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,680
Okay. The farm is generally not moving. It's stationary.

133
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,140
So we can call it farm a source of any number of contaminants or stressors or hazards.

134
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,310
Any others? Yeah. A factory.

135
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,989
Factory? Sure. And actually, you know, the same example for our our incinerator.

136
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,460
That's classified as a point source. You know, that incinerator is not going anywhere.

137
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,310
So it can also be considered a stationary source.

138
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:52,650
Right. So. Manufacturing factory, incinerator power plant, etc.

139
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,940
So contrasting that what would be considered mobile sources?

140
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:07,530
Yeah. Cars and planes. Yeah. Cars, planes, trucks, trains, you name it.

141
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:14,309
So those are the most common. Yeah. So my examples here was a an oil refinery as a stationary source.

142
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:21,420
And certainly automobiles are mobile. And then when we talk about anthropogenic and non anthropogenic.

143
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:28,590
Right, or those caused from human activities versus those that come from naturally occurring source.

144
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:45,150
And so what would the example of anthropogenic sources? That's like a like a landfill.

145
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,900
Sure. Landfill. I mean, you can take your pick.

146
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:56,579
Unfortunately, there are a lot of choices here. This is basically anything that we build or construct or do on purpose.

147
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,540
Right. As as people are released into the environment.

148
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,840
Landfill is actually the example I have here on the slide.

149
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:13,350
Again, you know, this this factory, this power plant, this incinerator that's also going to be in that anthropogenic category.

150
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,850
What about non anthropogenic? Yes.

151
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,990
She said, like the sun. Sure, absolutely.

152
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:27,180
So we talked about those ultraviolet rays of the sun would be a natural source.

153
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:36,690
Yes. Like a volcano. Volcano, absolutely. Major eruption for release of lots of contaminants into the atmosphere.

154
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:43,260
And the other. Yes. With something like a natural oils and such.

155
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,280
Yes. If it's if it's happening without human intervention.

156
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:56,890
Absolutely. I think I have as my example. Yes, the volcano or not anthropogenic on it, and perhaps if could give away grounding in it.

157
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:02,860
Okay. So moving on, continuing with definitions.

158
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:09,190
So we're using this term exposure and just so we're all on the same page, what do we actually mean by that?

159
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:17,530
So an exposure is an event that a person comes into contact with that has or toxic agent.

160
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:25,510
And you know, as we were kind of alluding to on an earlier slide, it's a highly dynamic process that can vary greatly.

161
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:36,160
It's going to vary from person to person depending on where we live, where we spend our time, our personal behaviors or lifestyle, etc.

162
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:43,990
And the process is going to vary dramatically based on the toxic substance and the nature of it, right?

163
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,040
And the combination of our ability to come into contact with that.

164
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:56,380
And then just for clarification, determining that degree of toxicity,

165
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:02,950
how toxic something is versus something else isn't really the focus of this course.

166
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:09,580
We're basically getting to the point of understanding and quantifying exposures and quantifying dose.

167
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:16,750
I know that some of you are in either now or perhaps next year will be DHS exposure, which is, of course,

168
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:23,079
that focuses the kind of the handoff of the task where this course ends and goes into bulk,

169
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,610
assuming that exposure has taken place and a dose has been received.

170
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,610
Now let's understand how this agent is toxic within the human body.

171
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:39,820
So for those of you that are either taking it or planning to take it, awesome.

172
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:47,769
For those of you that it wasn't on your radar. But as this course moves forward, you know, you might consider that as a as a course.

173
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,920
That would be kind of a natural next step after this portion.

174
00:19:54,650 --> 00:20:02,810
So exposure can be relatively simple. So you might think of it as a medical x ray, right?

175
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:14,330
It's defined. You go in as an appointment person, patient in most cases, understand the physician and boom, the X-ray is taken.

176
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:23,840
And it's a single, very short duration, very known, well documented and easily quantifiable exposure.

177
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:31,370
That's that's probably one of the most simple examples of an exposure in reality.

178
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,390
And in most cases, those exposures are really complex.

179
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:41,720
So if we say urban air pollution over the course of a year.

180
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:48,260
Right. There are dozens, if not hundreds of pollutants in the air that we're concerned about.

181
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,250
And they come from many, many different types of sources.

182
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:58,460
So kind of looking across this matrix, we're going to have numerous sources of that urban air pollution,

183
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:05,719
many different pathways that that pollution once emitted is going to follow in

184
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:11,300
the environment before we potentially come into contact with it as a receptor.

185
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:21,140
The exposed and received results are where do exposures occur.

186
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,990
These are some some examples, and we've already touched on some of these just through our discussion.

187
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:36,290
We manufacture many things. We as a society on purpose, right, to meet kind of consumer demands.

188
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:41,550
And as part of that process, exposures can take place within the workplace.

189
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:49,970
Right. So the workers at manufacturing facilities are able to be exposed as part of that manufacturing.

190
00:21:50,510 --> 00:22:00,440
It might result in emissions to the air purposefully that are permitted through regulatory processes as well as wastewater effluents.

191
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:05,660
So the example of the discharge from the pipe into a river, for example.

192
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:15,460
There are also opportunities for exposures to occur once that perhaps chemical substance has been manufactured,

193
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:21,820
it's been stored someplace and were transported to another place.

194
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:29,900
This provides other opportunities for exposures to occur and in storing it and in transporting it.

195
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,370
There are opportunities for various leagues spills.

196
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:39,190
These are generally accidents that aren't that aren't planned or intended that can be released into the soil,

197
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,630
get into the air, get into the water, get into the biota, etc.

198
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:50,030
And then through it actually intended uses of what was manufactured.

199
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,970
Right? It's been stored, it's been transported, it's been distributed.

200
00:22:54,390 --> 00:23:00,960
And now basically and it's either its application or it's consumption or opportunities for exposure.

201
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:07,530
So so someone we talked about farms, the application of pesticides as part of that process.

202
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,720
Certainly from an occupational perspective, whoever is applying those pesticides can be exposed,

203
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:19,110
but also as they're being applied, whichever way the wind's blowing, it's going to drift.

204
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,290
Right. Some perhaps nearby neighborhoods or communities can be exposed to those pesticides.

205
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,970
There's also the consumption of pesticide residues.

206
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:39,420
Right. So, you know, crops that are being grown, pesticides that are being applied and through the harvesting of the maybe fruits,

207
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,959
vegetables, whatever it is, there's still a residue of the pesticide.

208
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,160
So when we consume it as people, there's another opportunity for exposure.

209
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:52,889
Consumption of food additives, right? Food additives are manufactured on purpose or transported.

210
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,310
They're stored, they're applied into foods.

211
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:03,690
We then consume that dermal exposure to all types of personal care products.

212
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,220
Right. Hair care, skin care, you name it.

213
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,480
Inhalation of gasoline vapors. Right.

214
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:24,240
Opportunities, certainly for a computational perspective, when gasoline is is refined, when it's stored, transported.

215
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:28,860
And then here is the actual use, right. So there are gasoline filled stations.

216
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:33,870
We go to fill up our cars, we put the nozzle in.

217
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:42,240
And, you know, during those those times that we're standing there at the station, gasoline vapors are in our immediate vicinity.

218
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:52,650
And then kind of the end cycle of these manufactured products is it presents another opportunity through through disposal.

219
00:24:53,020 --> 00:25:01,709
Right. We talked about waste incinerators. This is a way that a lot of waste is managed, is through either landfill.

220
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:11,190
So burying it or through burning it right through incineration, especially things that are identified as hazardous waste that are then burned.

221
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:19,590
Things can evaporate into the air surface runoff, leaching to groundwater, all of these things.

222
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:26,490
And in the case of disposal, sometimes it's through intended disposal that they happen, right?

223
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:33,360
Like in the case of a landfill. Other times it's through, you know, poor disposal practices.

224
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,169
This is the case with a lot of the previous contamination.

225
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:45,450
Right, that we learned about where prior to even, you know, knowing publicly what these chemicals were and how they were managed,

226
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,359
there weren't regulations in place and there's, you know,

227
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:55,230
55 gallon drums of waste products that are sitting in a wooded environment seeping into into groundwater.

228
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,870
Right. So those are a few more kind of examples where exposures can take place.

229
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,330
So then we also use the term exposure assessment, right?

230
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:13,290
So what does this mean? So this is when we actually go out and try to quantify what exposure has taken place.

231
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:21,660
So it's a measurement or an estimate of exposure to generally people,

232
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:30,840
but for obvious reasons can include animals and materials as well as ecosystems, any number of hazards.

233
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,060
And this is important.

234
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:48,900
There are four key components when it comes to exposure assessment and being able to quantify or estimate what the exposure was or one is magnitude.

235
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:57,540
So how much of this agent or toxic substance is there the frequency?

236
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,360
So how often does contact occur? Right.

237
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:09,060
Remember, it can exist in an environmental intensity, but an exposure can only take place if we actually come into contact with it.

238
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,980
How often do we come into contact with it? The duration.

239
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:18,480
How long were we in contact with his agent?

240
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,770
And then also, very importantly, is the route of exposure.

241
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,430
How does that agent enter our bodies? Is it through inhalation?

242
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,410
Is it your suggestion? Is it through skin contact, etc.?

243
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:42,580
So these four factors, these four components basically dictate and result in what quantified exposure.

244
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:50,760
So exposure is a function of the magnitude of the agent, the frequency of contact that we come into the agent,

245
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,660
and the duration of the contact that we come with the agent.

246
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:04,549
Question right on that last one. Is the reason the route is not is not like I know it's not like a real equation but

247
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:10,700
the reason it's not in there is because it probably modifies magnitude of explosion.

248
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,520
It does. And it also is important.

249
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,230
And we're going to talk actually, I think the next class period is all about exposure pathways and rates of exposure.

250
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,620
So look, I'm very deeply into this, but a really quick example.

251
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,890
If you take a small amount of something toxic,

252
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:40,580
whether you inhale it or ingested or rub it on your skin has very, very different impacts in terms of toxicity.

253
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:47,180
Our skin, for the most part, it has to absorb indoor skin for it to cause a problem.

254
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:54,770
It might agitate our skin surface, but if it can be removed after the for a certain amount of time, maybe it's not an issue.

255
00:28:55,550 --> 00:29:00,530
If we ingest it, uh, it's going through our entire gastrointestinal tract.

256
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:07,550
And our body is basically, generally speaking, designed to kind of filter out good stuff from bad stuff.

257
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:12,680
The bad stuff still goes somewhere, but there's an opportunity for it to be excreted and not be retained.

258
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:21,860
In terms of inhalation, our lungs are pretty much designed to inhale oxygen and not much else.

259
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:28,040
So it doesn't take very much of a contaminant inhaled into our lungs to cause big problems.

260
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:33,140
So it would be kind of the primary route of concern for people.

261
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:41,450
So, yeah, this is why it's in there. And yes, I think your your characterization is correct that it's a very important kind of modifying factor.

262
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:49,610
Does that answer your question? But I just wondering, why wasn't it that much, much more to come on en route to this closure?

263
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:56,149
Any other questions? Yes. So what, like the worst way to be exposed?

264
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,640
Be like, intravenously? Like, would that be?

265
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:07,610
I'm just curious, like, how that would be like or it really would depend on like how people would, uh, different agents, different modes of toxicity.

266
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:15,950
So it's going to be highly variable and we'll, we'll be talking more about it for sure.

267
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:25,940
All right. So we'll define some of these concepts, right? So we kind of step through magnitude, frequency, duration, etc.

268
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,049
So magnitude and we talk about the term magnitude.

269
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:34,100
What does that mean? So it really means how much of that is there.

270
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:39,220
So very often it's measured as a concentration, right.

271
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:48,410
I think we use this example on on Tuesday with regards to air pollution, a certain mass per unit area of the media.

272
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:53,490
That is so for carbon dioxide in this room.

273
00:30:53,510 --> 00:31:00,290
Right. It's in micrograms per cubic meter per million for dealing in something like that.

274
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:09,760
That might be a total amount that we are quantifying for radiation and the measurement unit of Pico Curry's.

275
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:15,950
It might be just simply a mass of a chemical that's present and then for things

276
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:24,860
like noise and that seeing levels of decibels when we talk about concentration,

277
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:33,260
it can be in different units depending on the media that that contaminant exists within.

278
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:42,170
So often it's a mass of the of the hazard or agent in say micrograms is the common unit.

279
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:46,879
If it's a of a pollutant in the air, it's going to be per volume of air.

280
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,100
So it might be micrograms per cubic meter of air is the definition of the concentration.

281
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,770
If it's a stressor or agent in water, it might be in micrograms per liter of water.

282
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:09,240
If it's in food or soil, it might simply be mass per minute, like a microgram of the hazard per microgram of soil or micrograms.

283
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:18,620
Similarly for blood, right? We just mentioned intravenous microgram per liter of blood.

284
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:25,490
And then also the the terms of parts per million in parts per billion.

285
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:34,060
And again, that's a unit of contaminant or agent per unit of the media that it's within.

286
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:43,290
Dose is another important term that we need to define.

287
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:52,920
So dose is measuring or estimating how much of that agent actually gets into our body, right?

288
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:57,700
So the environmental intensity is there, the potential for exposure is there.

289
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,440
Our behavior, our time activity pattern puts us into contact with that agent.

290
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:11,600
The exposure takes place and then the dose is quantifying how much we've actually been,

291
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:18,270
how much is entered our body, how much dose that we received out of that agent or different types of doses.

292
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:30,150
We'll talk about that in a moment. But a couple of things to kind of think about is that a dose comes after exposure, right?

293
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:34,230
So we can't receive a dose if there hasn't been an exposure in the first place.

294
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:46,920
And we can't equate magnitude with exposure or dose because of those important factors along the way.

295
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:53,700
Right. There might be a very large magnitude of the of the toxic agent or substance presence.

296
00:33:54,330 --> 00:34:01,290
But if we don't come into contact with it, exposure can't take place or it gets a large concentration,

297
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,610
but we're in contact with it for a very, very short, very brief time.

298
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,820
And therefore, the exposure is still relatively small.

299
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:18,030
And then similarly for dose, right, the dose is dependent on the magnitude in the first place, us coming into a contact and being exposed.

300
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,740
And in order for us to even discuss or try to quantify how much of a dose has been.

301
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,209
Okay. So, yeah, so this is I should jump to this slide as I was discussing that.

302
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:37,640
But right now our magnitude is primarily just environmental intensity.

303
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:42,890
Exposure can actually take place when we come into contact with that.

304
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:50,270
And then following that, we're quantifying what it is, how many people actually received it in our body.

305
00:34:54,170 --> 00:35:04,970
So contact boundary. So the outer boundary includes our skin and openings into the body eyes, our nose or mouth.

306
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:16,640
And these are boundaries. But that agent or toxic substance needs to be able to cross in order to be absorbed into our body.

307
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:25,940
Right. So we talked about skin, eyes, our lungs through inhalation, our gastrointestinal tract through ingestion.

308
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,870
So so we're going to talk about sources here for a moment,

309
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:45,310
but in a little bit more detail and some of the possibilities or examples of sources within that model here.

310
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:52,070
So we talked about the different type of agents that might be stressors,

311
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:58,730
hazards or similar terminology physical agents, biological agents, chemical agents.

312
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,829
We've talked about what some of these different types are for physical agents,

313
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:12,590
radon for biological agents in coal II, for chemical agents, hydrogen peroxide.

314
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:22,430
And then the origin of the agent, right. Can either be anthropogenic from human activities or perhaps synthetic another term.

315
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,570
These are things that tend to be a little bit confusing within this exposure.

316
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:31,010
Science community is being able to recognize a lot of terms that are used interchangeably.

317
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:41,840
And again, perhaps sulfur dioxide from the combustion of sulfur containing fuels that are generated in activities.

318
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:49,520
Then there's also natural sources or origins of an agent like arsenic that's

319
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,110
naturally present in groundwater that's used as a source of drinking water.

320
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,550
And then the settings for exposure to the agent.

321
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,940
And in this course,

322
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:08,450
that kind of defined things so that they're that they're classified as one or the other and they can actually cross and happen in both.

323
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:14,480
But for the most part, we're looking at approaches and identifying exposures at risk of exposure,

324
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:22,159
whether they happen in a community right in our neighborhood or whether they happen occupationally.

325
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,150
So more formally within a within a defined workspace or workplace.

326
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:38,950
All right. So now looking at that component of the exposure outcomes model that focuses on time activity and behavior,

327
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:47,230
so what are some reasons that an individual's exposure to a particular hazard might very over time?

328
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,270
Yes. They could move throughout their lives. Yeah. So where are they lived?

329
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:59,050
Right. Maybe they grew up in Michigan. He moved to California.

330
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,230
It's been three years in Thailand. Absolutely.

331
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:10,090
So that large extent of spatial variation and certainly impact exposure to particular hazards over time.

332
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:14,500
What else comes to mind? A behavior change.

333
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,309
So someone stop smoking? Absolutely. So, behavior.

334
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:28,750
Lifestyle. Um. Cigaret smoking. If you smoked from, you know, age 16 to 30, but then you stopped right from 32 the rest of your life.

335
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:37,440
This would have a huge impact on your exposure to your particular hazard, certainly for whatever reason.

336
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,530
Yes. Idealistically, policy changes.

337
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,950
Yes, absolutely. So. So policy and regulation,

338
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:56,410
which impact to a large extent the magnitude of that environmental intensity of the agents that exist in our community or in our workplace,

339
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,760
and impact how our exposure to us as individuals.

340
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,809
Any other these are great. Like occupationally.

341
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:11,320
How long your shift is and how often it is? Absolutely.

342
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:18,610
So, you know, if you get stuck doing that really nasty job that put you in contact with this particular hazard,

343
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:25,970
and that's your job 8 hours a day, every day, or you're lucky enough to have to do it on Monday or, you know,

344
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:33,010
you get to rotate on Mondays and it's a different worker assigned to that task has a huge impact on what your potential exposure is.

345
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:41,650
Great, great examples. Thanks for those. So related to this and we're already sort of talking about this are patterns of exposure.

346
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:48,310
Right. Some of them are continuous. This might be let's say we talked about urban air pollution.

347
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:54,220
If you live in an urban city and you don't leave the city very much,

348
00:39:54,430 --> 00:40:00,839
and especially if you spend most of your time outdoors, you might be exposed to kind of a constant level of pollution.

349
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,060
It's always there. Right. The sources of the pollution are always there.

350
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:09,730
Your exposure to it might be relatively continuous. It might be pretty intermittent.

351
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:19,090
Perhaps the occupational example that we just had where if someone works only on Mondays doing this nasty task,

352
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:23,070
their exposure might be quite intermittent. And it's only every Monday.

353
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,040
But then, you know, Tuesday through Sunday, the exposure is low.

354
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:36,330
It might be sick, like in the case of commuting.

355
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:46,780
Right. So you're in a car with the windows down and you drive on the highway in the morning and you drive on the highway in the evening.

356
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:54,669
You might have relatively large exposures. Right. Every morning and every evening during the day and during the night, perhaps less so.

357
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,820
That would be an example of a cyclic random.

358
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:05,170
And one of the best examples, there's lots of examples, but the one that comes to mind for me is just changes in wind,

359
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,880
right, to whether you're upwind or downwind of an emission source.

360
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:16,060
It's not dangerous or it's not random as far as Mother Nature is concerned.

361
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,810
Right. And meteorological meteorological patterns and wind and so forth.

362
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:26,110
But from an individual perspective. Right. Which way? The wind blowing tends to be somewhat random to most of us.

363
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:31,180
And so it's going to dictate whether we're potentially downwind and exposed to something.

364
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:36,340
And then down here at the bottom is concentrated. So there might be an initial release.

365
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:42,399
Right. And you're exposed to a high level, but it was just like a single puff, but in a high level.

366
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:49,270
And it slowly dissipates over time. And so that exposure is going to just kind of slowly decrease.

367
00:41:53,860 --> 00:42:01,250
Here is a more specific example of of temporal variability and actually fits in

368
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:06,510
with the with the comment about policy or regulation of being able to impact.

369
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:13,180
And so there's many things that drive what we're exposed to as people that are completely beyond our control.

370
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:20,620
But this was an example of a good one, is the way that used to be purposely added to gasoline.

371
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:31,090
It improved engine performance. And so this was the reason that it was added to gasoline until some very smart people realized this was a bad idea,

372
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:40,720
because we're basically purposely distributing LED throughout our entire environment relating resulting in exposures along many pathways.

373
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:47,590
So led back in the 1970s was banned from gasoline.

374
00:42:48,940 --> 00:43:02,260
And so this is looking at mostly measurement in California of measuring led in the air looking from the mid 1970s coming through to the mid 1990s.

375
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:12,280
And as you can see, massive reductions in the amounts of lead present in the air over that couple a decade period as it was being phased out.

376
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:19,870
The resulting exposures rate of people in those communities went down dramatically and it was beyond their control,

377
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:26,770
perhaps who they voted for in office, I don't know, maybe had something, some effect, but for the most part it was beyond their control.

378
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:32,740
But a huge impact on a driver of temporal variability of exposure.

379
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,049
What are some. So that was looking at temporal variability.

380
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:45,350
Now let's look at spatial variability. What are some reasons that individual exposure might vary over space?

381
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:51,380
And we already had one one good example where somebody moves from one location to another over the course of their life.

382
00:43:51,950 --> 00:44:00,080
What's another example that comes to mind? Yes.

383
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:04,760
I think there's something like a wall that you stand behind at a workplace where you're taking x rays.

384
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:08,450
So like physical barriers to me from being exposed.

385
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:15,680
So. That's a very specific example, but I'm going to have to agree with you.

386
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:28,080
How do we how do we quantify that? Reclassify that. So if you're if you're in a space that has some sort of, you know,

387
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:37,410
purposeful barrier to the source of the substance, it would certainly dictate whether we're exposed or not.

388
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:42,560
Yes. We'd like if a pipeline for your water has blood in it.

389
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:46,740
Like if you have old pipes, but your neighbor has new pipes that don't have blood on them.

390
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:59,910
Sure. So if you if you if you live in an area that has the presence of certain contaminants versus areas that that don't like,

391
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:05,370
we're at some point I don't think it's like directly, but sometime soon.

392
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:11,280
Radon is another big one that came to mind when you were listing your example.

393
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:21,330
It's naturally occurring in soil and there are certain regions of the country, especially where basements are present,

394
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:33,210
where radon gas is a huge physical hazard exposure, and it's totally dictated by just, you know, where you live.

395
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:42,000
That would be one example. What else comes to mind? What would it be like if you could be exposed to something through inhaling it?

396
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,970
If you're in a room that like all the windows are closed, but then if you're in a room in the same building where there's airflow.

397
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:52,470
Sure. So ventilation rates within a specific space, right?

398
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:59,909
Absolutely. That's that's was a big focus of a lot of COVID mitigation efforts.

399
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:03,000
Right. Was increasing ventilation for that exact reason.

400
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:09,239
All right. Great job with those examples. And then, yeah, I'm a little bit biased, if you haven't noticed yet.

401
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,900
Right. Most of my examples tend to relate to air quality because that is kind of my thing.

402
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,690
But, you know, similar to the radon or contaminants in groundwater, you know,

403
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:26,790
where people live, this is looking at air quality, generally speaking across the US.

404
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:30,990
The areas in red are worse. Air quality, right?

405
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:35,100
Green is better and you can pick these out.

406
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:43,350
Most of the red or represent, you know, big cities or big urban areas, much of southern California is is red.

407
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:50,400
Here's a zoom in. So it's not just that like, oh, gosh, everyone in Southern California is in bad shape with regard to exposure.

408
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:58,530
If you drill down to a much more smaller spatial scale, you still see very large gradations.

409
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:08,490
Right. So just within, you know, kind of metropolitan Los Angeles going a few miles in one direction on this particular day along the coast.

410
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:18,000
The pollution is not so bad. It's only those that live further inland that are being exposed to high levels of pollution.

411
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:23,370
So yeah, so another example of spatial variability could be air quality.

412
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:33,959
We're going to talk a little bit more about not only that, but what the relative exposure but exposure pathways more in the next lecture.

413
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,910
But just to very briefly introduce it. So we have a source, right?

414
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:44,640
And then we have some resulting environmental intensity within that exposure outcomes model.

415
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:58,530
And the agents basically either are transported or reside follow specific pathways of exposure pathways through media.

416
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:04,220
One of them this this example is looking at a chemical exposure,

417
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:11,639
but chemical disposal site there might be reaching over that like we talked about the p FOS,

418
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:22,680
for example, or perhaps a direct surface runoff maybe within an urban area, or if these chemicals are volatile, they might evaporate up into the air.

419
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:32,310
So some of the exposure pathways in this particular example would be okay, water and gets into groundwater.

420
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:40,020
That might be the exposure pathway. When people are in the drink, ingest the water evaporates into the air, right.

421
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:48,120
So the atmosphere could be an exposure pathway in this case. And then when we breathe the air, right, that's how the exposure takes place.

422
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:51,089
So this is it's pretty busy. Don't focus too much on the detail,

423
00:48:51,090 --> 00:49:02,940
but just to kind of understand the concept and then depending on those pathways helps to dictate what's possible in terms of those routes of exposure,

424
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:07,200
whether we inhale it, ingest it, come into contact with it, etc.

425
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:11,520
So I've alluded to these exposure routes. What are they?

426
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:16,860
Again, this is an introduction. We'll talk very specifically about them next week, on Tuesday.

427
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:23,100
But for the most part, it's ages that we ingest right through eating or drinking.

428
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:29,480
Or in the case of children, you know, on the floor and in the living room or on the playground.

429
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:38,720
You know, through soil, hand-to-mouth contact, things that we inhale right through breathing are things related to our skin,

430
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:45,229
whether it's things that that come into contact with the surface of our skin or whether they're agents

431
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:52,100
that are actually absorbed into our body through this can easily be the four primary routes of exposure.

432
00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:03,020
And then when we talk about exposed populations, we talk a lot about who's vulnerable, right?

433
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:12,050
Who's who's at risk and what does that mean? And what are the some of the factors that define who those people or populations are?

434
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:15,980
There are a very large number of susceptibility factors.

435
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:22,700
They might be related to our activities that we've talked about today.

436
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:32,630
The age or life stage of a person certainly impacts how susceptible they might be to be exposed.

437
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:43,910
Cultures and lifestyle specific activities which your occupation can play a huge role in your susceptibility to being exposed.

438
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:50,540
We've talked about kind of geographic distribution where you spend your time geographically.

439
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:56,720
We also had some examples of low income being more susceptible or at higher risk.

440
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,080
There's also aspects of biological factors.

441
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:07,040
Again, age or life stage. We're going to introduce on Tuesday.

442
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:14,750
Right. Infants, children or perhaps elderly, gender, certain differences.

443
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:19,489
Genetics plays a role in this overall health status.

444
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:24,290
Right. This was one that we all learned more than we wanted to find during the pandemic.

445
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:31,340
All right. So people that had no preexisting or co-morbidities were more susceptible or higher risk.

446
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:36,020
The adverse impact from exposure to the virus.

447
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:43,779
And then previous exposures, right? If you've been exposed to things previously and this also kind of relates into

448
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:49,570
health status can impact how susceptible you are to to a future exposure.

449
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:54,400
I won't spend too much time on these, but this one over here on the right is a little bit interesting.

450
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:59,260
You know, we talk about socio economic status and I think it's easy.

451
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:03,640
I remember the first thing that comes to mind is that, you know, low income, for example,

452
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:11,440
you know, there's documented higher exposures to lead, cadmium, lead more historically.

453
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,170
We talked about, you know, gasoline as an additive, but was also used in paint.

454
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:25,870
Right. So low income residents who live in older housing stock is still has already paint on the walls in flakes and chips.

455
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:33,220
As it gets older, kind of falls to the ground. Kids are the most at risk, right, that this is mixing at either late stage.

456
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:36,940
So low income associated with lead.

457
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:45,010
But there are also some some exposures where higher income folks are at a higher susceptibility or at a higher risk.

458
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:52,420
Some of those are like the the perfluorinated substances that we've talked about.

459
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:56,020
These are in manufactured consumer products.

460
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:05,220
So people that can afford new flooring, carpet, new furniture, new nice shoes, nice new range,

461
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:12,820
all of these things that have like water resistance built into them have higher levels of the performance oriented substances.

462
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:21,810
Right. So these this is generally speaking, higher income status is associated with exposure to performance.

463
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:28,240
Another one is Mercury, right? So mercury bio accumulates in our environment.

464
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:36,430
It's primarily our biggest of exposure globally is through high concentrations of mercury that have accumulated fish.

465
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:41,980
For the most part, seafood is a little bit more expensive than other protein sources.

466
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:49,630
So again, a higher socioeconomic status is associated with, generally speaking, higher exposures to mercury.

467
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:59,170
All right. I told you we would come back to dose some concepts in terms around those.

468
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:08,000
On a skin surface. For example, here's our agent and there's a potential dose, right?

469
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:13,360
It's come into contact with our skin if it's absorbed.

470
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:18,520
Right. This is the applied dose. It can get into our bloodstream.

471
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:27,310
It can be it delivered dose when it results and resides in a target organ with antibodies.

472
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:38,710
And then the biologically effective dose is defined as how much of that agent is actually residing in those target cells.

473
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:42,130
So that's taking a diagram. When I get into some words here.

474
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:45,360
So we have a potential dose to the body.

475
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:58,000
So the amount of the chemical that's ingested or inhaled or maybe possibly particles and some chemicals are inert or or not very reactive.

476
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:04,870
So we can get lucky, we might breathe them in, or we might exhale them right back out.

477
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:09,970
So we've been exposed, but the dose might be very small.

478
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:17,230
And then the applied dose. Right. That's actually how much it that's absorbed.

479
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:28,180
So if it's not inert, if it is reactive, we breathe it in and it's taken up by our lung surface, whether it's the elderly and so forth.

480
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:37,780
And so we received a dose. The absorbed dose would be the amount of a chemical generally that's available for

481
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:43,780
interaction with those significant and different receptors within our body or target organs.

482
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:52,450
The delivered dose would be the amount transported to an individual organ, the tissue or the fluid of interest.

483
00:55:53,440 --> 00:56:03,700
And the biologically effective dose is the amount that reaches the specific cells, sites or membranes where the adverse effect actually occurs.

484
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,300
Again, this is getting more into the domain of toxicology.

485
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:16,480
We won't spend a ton of time on it in this class, but that's kind of where they hand off the baton, goes from exposure assessment to toxicology.

486
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:30,920
So exposure and dose rate. So recognizing that exposures occur pretty frequently.

487
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:37,220
And again, we live and breathe 24/7, seven days a week for our whole lives.

488
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:43,370
And we might think about exposure as being integrated over time.

489
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:52,940
Right. So kind of the sum total of that exposure to an agent through all of the possible routes of exposure, what we breathe and what we eat,

490
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:58,750
what we come into contact with all of our boundaries over in all media,

491
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:04,880
right in the air, in the water, food and so forth, over a specified period of time.

492
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:11,870
And that basically gets integrated as kind of an area under the curve, total exposure profile.

493
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:23,360
And the units of that integrated exposures are reflected as the concentration excuse me, multiplied by the period of time.

494
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:41,810
So how long was that time period? And then the dose rate would be the total dose divided by the time period of the dosing.

495
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:51,980
We have some units here at the bottom, so it's usually expressed in units of mass for a time or normalized to body weight.

496
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:56,930
So it might be milligrams per kilogram per day.

497
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:05,340
Right. So in this case, D, within a period of time, a little bit more,

498
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:11,090
just kind of conceptually to understand what would go into exposure and dose rate calculations.

499
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:16,160
Right. So here's this, you know, exposure profile.

500
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:22,580
We're kind of basically integrating the total area under this trace.

501
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:33,550
Excuse me. So that our exposure then is up as a function of both what the concentration is and over the time.

502
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:38,360
So we can calculate basically a time weighted average concentration.

503
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:44,240
This is very typical, an exposure assessment. A worker ship is for 8 hours.

504
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:51,230
Many monitoring devices basically are integrating over the course of that ship and saying, okay,

505
00:58:51,530 --> 00:59:00,790
the average time weighted average, the average period being 8 hours was the concentration of this exposure for a time period.

506
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:07,550
Stosur, you know, might be expressed as something like milligrams per cubic meter of air breathing on average.

507
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:15,860
And then the dose rate, we would take that as it's the total dose divided by the time period of the dose.

508
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:21,860
So again, it's it's a specific amount of time, perhaps it's the eight hour workday in this example.

509
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:27,110
So we end up with a dose rate of mass per body weight per time.

510
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:34,420
And that's how we kind of get to that example unit of milligrams per kilogram per day or per work shift or whatever.

511
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:41,940
Yes. Can you remind me what? Yeah.

512
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,639
So good question. And I should have to find it out in the slides.

513
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:49,930
So apologies for that. So TWD is time weighted average.

514
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:58,630
So if we follow this trace and we put some units, let's say this is a scale of 0 to 10,

515
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:07,750
the maximum here is probably about just eyeballing it here, let's say eight, and we're using these units mg per cubic meter.

516
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:17,080
Here it was eight, but only instantaneously. At the end of the time period it was pretty low or a low were let's say it was about three and a half.

517
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:21,670
So instead of saying after 5 hours, it was eight.

518
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:26,170
After 6 hours it was five. After 8 hours, it was three and a half.

519
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:31,000
You basically take an average over this eight hour period, so that would be our time.

520
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,120
We were waiting it by time, time weighted average.

521
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:41,140
And again, just eyeballing it, I'm going to guess that it's probably right around five hour scale on this part of zero.

522
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:47,720
So would you have to express what the time is like?

523
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:52,390
That was 8 hours or 12 hours? Yes. Would that go in your unit?

524
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:58,000
Would it be mg per two meters cubed for 8 hours? Yeah, absolutely.

525
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:04,510
Good question. And I again apologize for that. I would like to find it on the slide and the other questions.

526
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:10,719
And again, apologies if it's if it feels like a lot.

527
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,110
This lecture is this kind of I mean, this is the introduction to exposure science.

528
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:17,709
So it's kind of like laying it all out there, right? And then over the course of the semester,

529
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:23,920
we're going to be drilling in on individual components of these and kind of building the details of that picture.

530
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:33,610
So. Right. So kind of a little bit related to your question of classifying exposures based on duration.

531
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:41,290
Duration is a really important component of this. So right, the duration is the period of time over which we can be exposed.

532
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:47,670
And there are some this is getting back to defining terms. People talk about acute exposures.

533
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,660
What does that mean exactly?

534
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:58,480
It's not exactly, generally speaking, involves coming into contact with with an agent for usually for a time period of less than a day.

535
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:02,140
Right. That would be considered acute exposure. That's September 12.

536
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:06,730
There was, if I was exposed, an acute exposure of ten micrograms per cubic meter.

537
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:13,780
A chronic exposure, conversely, is something that takes place over a long time period.

538
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:17,800
Right. That that urban air pollution. I lived in a big city my whole life.

539
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:25,300
I was chronically exposed to a concentration of ten microscopic meteorites for most of the years of my life.

540
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:30,580
Some chronic is pretty wishy washy for the most part.

541
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:35,800
It's somewhere between a day and, you know, years.

542
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:45,430
So for the most part, when you talk about some chronic exposure, you know, maybe that's only for a few weeks or months, something like that.

543
01:02:49,180 --> 01:03:00,040
In terms of timing of exposure assessment in related to in relation to exposure, we can approach it in different ways.

544
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:07,120
A lot of exposure assessment is historical or retrospective, right?

545
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:14,590
So someone presents, hey, I have this problem, I have these symptoms, I have these, this condition.

546
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:24,129
What could it be from? So trying to reconstruct what that person's exposures were in the past would

547
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:30,160
help us to to perhaps inform what is causing the problem in the first place.

548
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:41,110
So we might actually try to reconstruct a lifetime exposure to say something like ionizing radiation estimation of what's cancer risk.

549
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:49,730
There's also the current time, right? We might be monitoring right now.

550
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:58,890
I talked about the pilot project that I've been involved in, monitoring classrooms for presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus.

551
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:04,920
That's kind of present day monitoring or monitoring in real time what we're exposed to.

552
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:10,500
The shift worker at the chemical factory who is wearing that personal monitoring device,

553
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:15,990
measuring it in real time to obtain some some pretty relevant information.

554
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:23,160
There's also prospective estimation of exposure or exposure assessment.

555
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:29,309
The example listed here is for some for some future facility.

556
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:38,430
Right. The example here is a proposed way. Want to build this waste incinerator 20 miles upwind of this community.

557
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:44,850
And the natural question as well, what would be the potential harm of building that waste incinerator in that facility?

558
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:51,840
This is where the modeling comes into play, right. We know information about other waste incinerators that exist.

559
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:57,389
We can populate our model with with as much known information as we can and we can

560
01:04:57,390 --> 01:05:03,480
estimate what exposures might be if this project went ahead in this facility was built.

561
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:07,500
So that'd be an example of prospective exposure assessment.

562
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:16,820
The way that we assess exposures is also pretty well classified.

563
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,630
There's a number of different types of exposure assessment approaches.

564
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:27,860
They're basically broken down by those that are characterized as direct methods and those that are indirect methods.

565
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:38,540
So direct methods which the community would consider kind of the gold standard would be, uh, personal monitoring.

566
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:47,389
Right. So the example of the person carrying around that monitor on their body and in the inlet of the monitor is in their breathing zone,

567
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:50,780
for example, for air pollutants and measuring.

568
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:58,070
Right. It's a very accurate characterization of what the person is possibly being exposed to during the time that they're wearing this monitor.

569
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:02,670
There's also biological monitoring. So there are biomarkers, right.

570
01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:10,940
So we might have a saliva sample or a urine sample that can estimate what our exposure was to a specific contained.

571
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:19,260
On the other side here, there are indirect methods. I talked about the modeling that that prospective exposure assessment,

572
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:26,790
building a model and trying to estimate exposures of the indirect methods and also might be questionnaires or diaries.

573
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:35,550
So when we reconstruct a previous exposure, right, the person that presents with the particular condition, what might that be from?

574
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:39,320
It's going through a long list of questions.

575
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:42,600
Where did you where you lived, where have you worked?

576
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:49,800
What are your activities? And trying to build and assess exposures through asking questions.

577
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,999
This is kind of filling out the model a little bit.

578
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,150
But just to give you an example of some of the things that come into play here.

579
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:11,700
We can utilize geolocation to help fill in information about people's time, activity and behavior.

580
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:18,870
Similarly, using this system map environmental and city agents.

581
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:22,680
Remote sensing is very beneficial in this regard.

582
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:37,650
And knowing both, you know, having geolocation and gas mapping helps us to estimate stressors and receptors actually coming into contact.

583
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:41,670
Right. So we have a better handle on whether exposures are taking place or not.

584
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:51,720
Bio monitoring is also very effective at helping our assessment of outcomes as well as things like nano sensor technology.

585
01:07:52,020 --> 01:08:01,989
It's also coming into play. And then we're going to have a whole lecture, actually a couple of lectures on exposure assessment.

586
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:08,620
So again, this is just kind of an introduction, but this would be kind of the hierarchy of exposure data.

587
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:12,820
From a preference perspective, we are exposure assessment scientists, right?

588
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:17,740
We have a choice of what type of data we'd like to rely upon for assessing exposures.

589
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:21,580
This is kind of our our hierarchy.

590
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:29,110
So quantified personal exposure would absolutely be the best data that we can get our hands on.

591
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:41,290
We might have an area measurement, so the quantified measurements in the vicinity of a resident or a site of activity,

592
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:45,910
the example of monitoring the virus in classrooms.

593
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:49,810
If all of us were wearing a personal monitor, right, that would be great.

594
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:53,500
That would be up here, number one, quantified personal data.

595
01:08:54,190 --> 01:09:01,329
But all we had available was one single monitor and we kind of located it like at the center

596
01:09:01,330 --> 01:09:06,159
of the room and then collected a sample that would be represented in an area monitor.

597
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:16,150
It's in the vicinity of all of us. It would be a relatively good estimation of our exposure within the classroom, but it's not as good as that.

598
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:25,690
Each of us has a personal monitor and then we kind of go down the list and it gets less preferred, quantified surrogates of exposure.

599
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:30,490
Just knowing how much water someone drank, right?

600
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:37,840
We might be able to estimate, assume what concentrations were present and just multiply out based on their water consumption.

601
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:47,229
One exposure might be the distance from a site and duration of exposure, distance or duration of residence.

602
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:50,860
So I lived in this location from other records.

603
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:58,450
We know that these were emission sources present in that in that vicinity, in that city, we can estimate what someone's exposure might be,

604
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:08,560
residence or employment in specific geographical areas or residence or employment in a defined pretty broad area like a county.

605
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:14,070
At worst, this is generally information that can be available to us.

606
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:20,860
And again, we'll come back around to that quite a bit, a little bit later in the semester.

607
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:28,590
So how do we describe exposures? There's many possible types.

608
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:33,660
These are a few. We often focus on what's what's typical.

609
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:39,000
What's a typical exposure. So we use measures of central tendency.

610
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:43,030
So, you know, what was the median exposure? What was the average exposure?

611
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:48,600
Right. So our example of the time weighted average is where a lot of the focus is.

612
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:55,469
But it's also important and relevant to connect, to characterize the high end, what are the maximum exposures?

613
01:10:55,470 --> 01:11:00,780
This helps to kind of parameter some of those models that we then rely on going forward.

614
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:09,280
Other exposure parameters you might be interested in is yeah,

615
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:19,310
it might be the average exposure that might be relevant information to know, but in some cases that might be the peak exposure, right?

616
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,630
Like, who cares? In the case, there's a threshold.

617
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:33,220
So if there's some threshold and it's only if you get above the threshold that it can cause harm because of the nature of that toxic substance.

618
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:36,640
Maybe knowing the average concentration isn't so useful.

619
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:44,050
It's knowing what the peak, the peak level is over that measurement time period and whether that threshold has been breached.

620
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:54,980
Okay. So this is where things start to get pretty choppy with acronyms and abbreviations and so forth.

621
01:11:54,990 --> 01:12:02,220
So bear with me, we will have a couple of lectures later in the semester that talk about regulatory agencies and so forth,

622
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:09,980
but there are a few consensus through regulatory actions in guide,

623
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:21,150
various guideline levels are available for exposure, defining exposure limits and what they might be within occupational settings.

624
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:33,450
The ACG H has something called a threshold limit value, which will talk about later OSHA as something called the permissible exposure limit,

625
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:40,950
which will define and talk about the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as recommended

626
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:48,930
exposure elevens that also are incorporated into workplaces in terms of community standards.

627
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:54,330
The Environmental Protection Agency has national and international standards, right?

628
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:58,230
We talked about some examples of that on Tuesday with contaminants in the air.

629
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:06,179
Similarly, for contaminants in drinking water, the FDA also defines acceptable daily intake.

630
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:14,670
Really internationally, the World Health Organization issues guidelines for contaminants in various media.

631
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:20,740
Really briefly here. We're getting close to the end of the class period.

632
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:24,370
I'm going to ask you all a couple of minutes. Not long, but 2 minutes.

633
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:30,879
On a poor air quality, this airborne premium 2.5.

634
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:37,150
So this is particulate matter of two and a half microns is 50 micrograms per cubic meter.

635
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:45,220
And then just to let you know, a thousand milligrams equals one or a thousand micrograms equals one mg.

636
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:56,890
If people inhale one cubic meter of air per hour right through their lungs over a day, a 24 hour period.

637
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:01,749
Two questions for you. What's the concentration of the PM?

638
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:05,980
2.5. What would be the PM 2.5 dose?

639
01:14:07,990 --> 01:15:55,350
Think about that for 2 minutes and we'll reconvene with some answers. All right.

640
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:59,040
What did folks come up with? Yes. Who has an answer?

641
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:02,850
For what? The concentration of 2.5.

642
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:14,500
Remember. No wrong answers. Engaged participation.

643
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:20,280
Yeah. Is the concentration just. Yes, absolutely.

644
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:27,210
So here it is. It's defined in the in the question of 50 micrograms per cubic meter is the concentration of 2.5.

645
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:37,130
So what's the PM? 3.5 dose. I got 1.2 milligrams per day.

646
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:49,100
Fantastic. So if you recall, exposure is a function of the magnitude or in this case, the concentration, the frequency, how long?

647
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:54,890
The total duration? Sorry. How often is the frequency?

648
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:58,700
So how much and how often and for how long?

649
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:02,930
Our our magnitude is 50 micrograms of cubic meter.

650
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:09,440
We breathe one cubic meter of power. And for how long?

651
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:13,650
For 24 hours. So multiply that out.

652
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:17,880
That gives us 1200 micrograms of PM 2.5.

653
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:23,190
Or if you convert it into two milligrams. 1.2 milligrams of pm.

654
01:17:23,190 --> 01:17:28,440
3.5 would be the quantified dose in this case.

655
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:37,380
Yeah. Sorry, I was messing around and this is what we were talking on Tuesday on Q&A on how many mosquitoes would that be?

656
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:40,920
1.5 milligrams, right? It's a very small amount. I Googled it.

657
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:46,409
It's about one actually goes way more than one point, 2.5 milligrams.

658
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:49,770
But I know that we're almost out of time.

659
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:51,270
We won't go through this example.

660
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:58,320
But just to kind of walk it through, you know, we could do these types of calculations for for drinking water and levels of well,

661
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:05,940
we can estimate how much might be absorbed from different pieces of information.

662
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:15,750
There's something called the EPA Exposure Factors Handbook that generates data on drinking water intake rates based on age and other factors.

663
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:20,850
We can get information on generally what our chemical concentrations in water.

664
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:28,740
And there's also information on the chemical bioavailability within the GI tract that can help us to to come up with some estimates.

665
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:36,120
Here's the example of that EPA Factors Handbook that summarizes data on behaviors

666
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:40,260
of people and characteristics that can affect exposure to various contaminants.

667
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:48,210
We use the example here for lead for drinking water consumption rates, breast milk consumption rates, food intake,

668
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:54,630
breathing rates, body weights, all of these things that are relevant for the field of exposure assessment.

669
01:18:54,640 --> 01:19:00,900
We can't go out and make a direct measurement, right? We have to utilize some of the best data that's out there.

670
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:05,490
This is what a particular table looks like. All of the Exposure Factors handbook.

671
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:12,510
So based on age, going to like less than a month up to, you know, more than 65 years,

672
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:25,379
you know what our combined direct and indirect water ingestion we can yeah, I'll finish with this one.

673
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:31,830
So to estimate the average daily dose of a toxic substance via direct ingestion of drinking water,

674
01:19:32,730 --> 01:19:36,600
in this case, it would be a function of that ingestion rate.

675
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:42,150
How much per day the concentration of the chemical in the water.

676
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,910
Right. So mass per volume of water.

677
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:55,470
And then knowing something about the bioavailability in the body, I think it's out the door and we're just about out of time.

678
01:19:57,290 --> 01:20:02,100
We can pick up with this and kind of wrap this up at the beginning of our class period on Tuesday.

679
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:06,750
And similarly, I will hang out outside the classroom if anybody has any follow up.

680
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:10,710
Thank you guys so much for your time. Have a great holiday weekend coming up.
