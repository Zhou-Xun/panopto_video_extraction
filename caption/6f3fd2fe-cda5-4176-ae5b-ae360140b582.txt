1
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,510
All right, let's go ahead and see how offensive we can be in the few minutes that we have left.

2
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:37,960
So first off, yeah, I apologize that we didn't have in-classroom presenters that seemed to go OK.

3
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,860
I kind of felt bad. They couldn't see us. But I think you all did a great job in terms of just managing being the whatever the

4
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:51,730
ghost voice that nobody can see with the with the dialog and the questions and exchanges.

5
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,110
Thanks so much for that.

6
00:00:53,110 --> 00:01:10,320
Any any kind of follow up questions that you want to raise or comments that you want to make just based on the presentation or any of the discussion.

7
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,140
All right. It's actually it's a really cool facility, I might even Malcolm offered like, I think four times,

8
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,270
right, like in a future, you know, a couple of weeks, we'll get you over here to see it.

9
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,580
You know, maybe if we're lucky sometime in April or something,

10
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:31,680
we can try to schedule something and whoever is available or interested can can take it to or through and check it all out.

11
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:41,390
All right. So going forward, a couple of things this one to make sure we're coordinated, I'm actually going to skip to the exam really quickly.

12
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:55,170
Uh, I posted on an announcement, uh, yesterday about the exam just kind of spelling it out, and I think we're all set.

13
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:01,860
So we'll take it within canvas using Zoom, right?

14
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,660
So you log in to Zoom, you log in to canvas. There's the exam.

15
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:16,960
You don't access anything else on your computer. Um, and you have the choice to take the exam here in class or to to take it remotely.

16
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,340
Um, I was mentioning during the five minute break,

17
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,790
I'm never going to ask people right now just because whatever you think you're going to do now might completely change by next week.

18
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:34,140
So maybe I'll send out an announcement Sunday and just ask people to maybe send me their preference.

19
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,710
At least, you know, maybe the Sunday evening or something like that.

20
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:46,170
What your intention is. Just so I have an idea of what to expect and make sure that everyone is is all set for that.

21
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:52,830
Are there any questions about about the format or the preparation or expectations for the exam?

22
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,130
Two questions yet?

23
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:02,340
Well, I guess preparation wise, obviously look over the lecture slides, recordings and guess we have any particular recommendations.

24
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:10,410
Uh, no. I think what you what you mentioned definitely a focus on what we presented and discussed in class.

25
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:18,240
The readings are supplemental and there's lots of good material there to help you understand what we've presented and discussed in class.

26
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:29,370
I do want to clarify that today's presentation and discussion is not part of the exam, so you can, uh, ignore this in terms of exam prep.

27
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,260
Yes, for logistical questions, we decided to come into the classroom to take the exam.

28
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:40,080
Are we still going to join on Zoom as well? Yeah, I think that's going to be the easiest way to manage it all.

29
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:47,730
So I will be here in the classroom just so folks know that. Um, and we'll just ask everyone to join on Zoom.

30
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:53,940
Um, it shouldn't actually make any difference after that. It's just one more step in the process.

31
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,920
But that way, whatever information I'm sharing to people like in chat or whatever it might be,

32
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,860
you know, everyone has kind of equal access to the dialog and information.

33
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:13,970
That doesn't mean that if you're in the classroom that you can't come up and ask me a question verbally as well, not totally fine.

34
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:20,540
Any other questions about the exam? Okay, so keep an eye out on Sunday,

35
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:30,650
I'll prompt you all for kind of what you're thinking is your preference for either in class or removed for taking the exam.

36
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:39,410
All right. So for this project and we'll go ahead and do this and a couple of minutes I posted here.

37
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:50,150
Student group assignments, they're actually the same, uh, groups as the student led discussions.

38
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,420
I thought that might be actually beneficial.

39
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:03,240
Right. Give you guys a chance to work together a little bit around this power plant project and then you'll, whatever,

40
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,980
have a little bit of practice working together for it, for the student led discussions that come later in the semester.

41
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:18,770
So for this power plant project, I just have a group number one, number two or three or four and a couple of minutes we can actually go ahead.

42
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:24,560
And those of you that are here in the classroom will separate by groups and you can have a little bit of chance to start to discuss things.

43
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:36,260
But what what are you aiming to do? Go back to another announcement that kind of described what it is.

44
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,490
So today we had the presentation from Malcolm and Melissa.

45
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:47,810
That's a ton of background. That's only part of this. What you're actually up to, uh, we want to focus on the policy aspect of it.

46
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,340
And there were some good questions, right?

47
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:55,970
I just asked one about what kind of communication and what was the, you know, I guess in the context of MSU?

48
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:01,850
Um, that was relevant a lot of the files that I provided,

49
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:08,570
which I also included it in an announcement because it was kind of tricky, but they're all here.

50
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:14,060
There have names that don't make any sense, but just kind of peruse through some of those files.

51
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:20,960
It kind of just some historical, um, information around two different projects.

52
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,080
One is this power plant project that, as you might imagine, started several years ago in terms of the planning,

53
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,230
getting approvals right, having dialog and exchange with the campus community.

54
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,030
Even the Ann Arbor community are on a similar timeframe.

55
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:42,560
There was also a transportation operations complex with like at the basis sounded really good.

56
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,020
It was moving to electric busses, articulated busses, right?

57
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:57,050
The long ones that are like the accordion in the middle. So you have increased efficiencies, energy savings, reducing carbon and so forth.

58
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:06,770
And while you know Malcolm and Melissa basically give you the message that this power plant project went well in terms of community engagement,

59
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:17,120
getting people on board to implement this policy going forward and fund the infrastructure project, the transportation operations complex did not.

60
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:24,800
So I'm going to ask you to the files and providing are just a starting point to kind of familiarize yourself with what what were these projects,

61
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,860
but go ahead and dig in. There's there's on campus information.

62
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:35,330
You probably have dual things and there's going to be like local news, stories and things that had coverage of it as well.

63
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,530
So you kind of get some lay person perspective of what the context was.

64
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:46,120
I thought you were going to ask the question, Bridget. I don't know if anyone else can, but I can't access any of the No.

65
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,930
Darn it. So what does it say? Authorization to get there?

66
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,890
So you said you're not authorized to do that action? All right.

67
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:59,030
I will fix it. I'm sorry about that. Thank you for telling me.

68
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:04,550
That's very important, right? Um, so yeah.

69
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,480
So just to kind of walk through it.

70
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,490
And I told you when we switched the exam date to accommodate their availability was gonna throw a wrench into this.

71
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,560
This was supposed to be on back to back weeks and it's not going to be right. You can take the exam next week.

72
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:28,460
We're going to come back on the 22nd and we're going to have, uh, the first half of the class period just to kind of continue to work into groups,

73
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:34,970
uh, come together with, uh, what, what you want to present, what you kind of found.

74
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:42,710
And again, think like an applied sense where we talked about in class some of these models, some of these statutes, right?

75
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:49,220
They put it into lay terms. They just kept using the term like communication, communication, communication or lack of communication, right?

76
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:55,070
But from a policy analysis standpoint, what actually happened for these two projects?

77
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,570
Where were there opportunities that were effectively utilized?

78
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,130
Where were there challenges that were effectively met and overcome?

79
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:11,930
And conversely, where were the missed opportunities and where were the challenges? Uh, too big to overcome and kind of why?

80
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:21,540
Uh, and then will? Use the second part of that. Each group of four will have a chance to give it like a brief presentation.

81
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,460
I put the method at eight minutes.

82
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:30,780
It's not supposed to be anything lengthy, but what is what's going to be your analysis and what are recommendations right?

83
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,310
Not just around campus sustainability goals?

84
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:47,550
There's been a lot of issues right with with engagement of various communities across the campus and achieving policies pushed back and so forth.

85
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:55,470
And so what would be, you know, if you guys are going to emerging as these environmental, health and policy experts, you know,

86
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,280
what's going to be some of your recommendations or suggestions, you know,

87
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:06,720
back to university leadership on on more effective ways to do this moving forward into the future.

88
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:15,120
And that's kind of where we would leave things. What I'm going to encourage you to do is not stress too much about it.

89
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,560
This is it's not really graded, right? It's kind of part of your class participation.

90
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:26,380
It's an opportunity to kind of learn about something here that's close to home, but very, very important, very relevant.

91
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:32,070
I know many of you are quite passionate about these issues as part of the university community.

92
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:41,310
So a ton of relevance there and being able to apply some of these aspects and concepts that we're learning about in class.

93
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:46,470
But yeah, when we do those presentations, you know, they're not supposed to have like wax and cool,

94
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:53,640
impressive graphics or anything going on just, you know, black and white bullets to highlight your points or whatever is completely fine.

95
00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:01,830
So don't go nuts and bolts. Don't worry about trying to impress anyone esthetically with that kind of stuff.

96
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:10,690
Any questions other than how do we access the file? That's going to be my job to figure out very soon.

97
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:14,530
All right, so we've only got 12 minutes left.

98
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:23,140
I'm going to suggest go ahead and physically try to move into groups at this point, not so much to have in-depth discussion,

99
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,620
but maybe just to kind of organize yourselves for how you want to go,

100
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:36,520
how to coordinate and work together going forward over these next two weeks and back to this war doc.

101
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,820
I included, you know, in addition to each person's name, your unique name, right?

102
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:48,380
So you in terms of email and so forth and how to contact each other, that word doc is on campus.

103
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:53,390
Any questions before we go ahead and break into those groups?

104
00:11:53,390 --> 00:12:01,280
All right, so I'm going to is going to go kind of like clockwise from my standpoint around the room, let's say group one up in this front corner.

105
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:09,380
Group two in the back corner. Group three in the corner by the door in Group four up here in this front corner.

106
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:16,750
Go for it. But some.
