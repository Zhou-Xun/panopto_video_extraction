1
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,790
Recording in progress. Okay.

2
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:36,920
Good morning, everyone. So we've spent the previous lecture trying to get some intuition.

3
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:52,840
Behind conditional expectations. And in order to build this intention, we linked them to the concept of approximation or projection, which is.

4
00:00:54,070 --> 00:01:00,280
So when we have some kind of a space or functions, we have an element of that space,

5
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:08,469
let's say an X, and we have the more primitive generally space of functions.

6
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,700
So this is. Yes. Staff.

7
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,110
That's a space of functions measurable with respect to Sigma Algebra.

8
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:26,650
Now this line here is an example of a space of functions measurable with some.

9
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,879
Uh, generally smaller sigma algebra.

10
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:40,370
You. And then we were considering an approximation in the space of a few.

11
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:48,800
So we were looking for variables that belonged to s u and we wanted to minimize

12
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:56,570
the distance between the element of a big the space X and the element of.

13
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,820
The smallest piece is you.

14
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,690
The minimum was taken over all possible functions and that.

15
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:21,080
Space. As you write down geometrically, it's clear that the minimal distance will be an element right here.

16
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:36,610
So that was called the why and why it was said to be a conditional expectation of it's given the sigma algebra you.

17
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,389
Right. And the tradition was built not in the most general case.

18
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:50,130
So we can say that as you generated.

19
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,180
Yes. You being a space of discrete random variables.

20
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:20,940
Right. And so the discrete random variables we were able to verify that y is actually the, uh.

21
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,500
A discrete random variable. So those random variables have a form.

22
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:39,670
So they are functions of the. And the Psalms from one to end and end could be infinitely large for that matter.

23
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,400
Some values. Z. I.

24
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:53,080
Time's the indicator of some sense. Let's say I write in the sigma algebra.

25
00:03:53,090 --> 00:04:01,270
You in that scenario was the sigma algebra generated by the partition e.

26
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:06,470
I. So there is a tension of omega.

27
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,290
So they are disjoint.

28
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:28,020
The reunion is on the right and we found by considering Omega within those sets A.I. So we had an argument that in order to minimize that.

29
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,080
And minimizing within the space as you.

30
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,750
Of whatever right is.

31
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,750
So it was about. Minimizing.

32
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:07,910
Of. The values are right because the age was fixed, this algebra was fixed.

33
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:18,800
So then we discussed the question of how do the functions look like when they are measurable with respect to the same discrete sigma algebra.

34
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:28,670
And we found that these functions are all essentially they can be specified by choosing the vector values.

35
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,340
So it's essentially the space of art and.

36
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,410
Of those vectors that defines the classes you write.

37
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:52,970
So if we want to minimize with, uh, something, uh, within this class, then we need to minimize over the values.

38
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,790
And we found that. So those values can be minimized independently of each other.

39
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:13,730
Uh, in that we can consider Z of Omega when on again belongs to a I to a specific a I, then the value only depends on the value of Z.

40
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,830
I write a minimizing over it. We've found that such values actually.

41
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:31,130
So the values. At that point.

42
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:42,060
Minimal distance between X, Y and Z.

43
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,620
Uh. So why to.

44
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:54,010
Why? And. Well.

45
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,290
Why is a conditional expectation.

46
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,990
So this is from 600.

47
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,240
It's all right. So we did this exercise.

48
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:19,989
And these connected. The problem of approximations to the problem of finding conditions of exploitation.

49
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:29,110
Because motivated by this example, we said that we could define the conditional expectation.

50
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:39,090
Of its. Given any specific z or sigma algebra you.

51
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:52,960
Z. Whatever. Right. These is equivalent. Just use the sigma algebra generated by random variable z on the one hand.

52
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,280
On the other hand, it's generated by the sets a.

53
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:10,750
That's this is can be defined if we believe in the approximation theory is is.

54
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,810
A similar sum. Uh, from one to.

55
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:32,460
Then the values y which are the expected values events, given the AI that we find using, uh, calculus.

56
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,930
As an integral. Yeah.

57
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:51,060
It's over the area I divided by the probability of a I love calculus the 601 this is how expectations were defined.

58
00:08:52,100 --> 00:09:00,440
Right. So for those of you, I did get some questions on this notation because it was somewhat unconventional.

59
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,599
So what that means, the way we defined it,

60
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:18,200
is that this is an integral over the said e i of it's a for me to the p of omega divided by integral or sets the i d

61
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:35,240
right that makes the probability of e right and we can write this integral is integral over e e i x e and here we have,

62
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,940
uh, d of the integral.

63
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,770
Of a deep. Right.

64
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:58,109
And this notation is a bit more familiar, at least to some of you, because what we have here is the six or one defines conditional probability, right?

65
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,110
So this is a probability of a certain event given the high rate that.

66
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,360
That's too bad because it's deep. Doesn't have to be a density.

67
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,610
Right?

68
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:24,250
So we can think of deep as being a differential in the steel sense as well as uh, uh, for continuous, um, absolutely continuous probability measures.

69
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,570
Right. So in the steel sense, that could be a jump.

70
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:34,300
So deep is not necessarily arbitrary. Small. In such a situation.

71
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:42,690
But anyway. Right. So this is what the conditional expectations were in the six one.

72
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:55,290
And by the way, the unpleasant thing about this definition is that we can freely, uh, use it is p of of uh is p in the denominator is zero.

73
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,720
Okay. So that's one of the deficiencies.

74
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:12,260
But that said, some coming back to the definition of the conditional expectation that we suggest that the end of the lecture last time.

75
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:19,160
And it was like this. And we still have indicators of the.

76
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,580
Right. Now.

77
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,330
So coming back to the spaces of functions, right.

78
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:41,820
So at some point we discussed how do functions measurable with respect to a given sigma algebra look like?

79
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,710
Right. And this is where we link them to our and the set of values.

80
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,170
Right. So whenever we see an animal like this.

81
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:02,620
Speaking of this specific case where the sigma algebra is actually serving a discrete random variable, right?

82
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:10,990
So for such a space, if we see an animal like this and it is certainly a vulnerable.

83
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:24,650
So this would be a function from that space and it would be a function measurable with respect to that sigma algebra you.

84
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:39,290
Right. So now if we look at the random variable Y that we suggested as a definition for conditional expectation based on the approximation theory.

85
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,459
So there are immediate observations about this variable.

86
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:51,210
So. Now.

87
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:55,770
First, why is you measurable?

88
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,520
Because this animal looks.

89
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,800
So this animal looks exactly like this one.

90
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,190
Right. Except for the set of values.

91
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,710
But the Z in that scenario is just an arbitrary set of values that defines a form of a function that's measurable with respect to you.

92
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:35,160
And so I see that this is one particular function with one specific set of values.

93
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:42,450
So and because it has this form, I can say that Y is measurable with respect to you.

94
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:50,490
Now, the second observation is that if I actually take an expectation.

95
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,730
Um of an expectation of x given e.

96
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:06,030
I. So now it's again it's six one thing. Take it conditional on a.

97
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:14,790
So what's what's going to happen is that the so it won't change.

98
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:22,040
So it would still be equal to an additional expectation of X given the odds.

99
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:38,680
That's that's another observation. Right. Some observation would be that for any, you know, the sigma algebra, you.

100
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:56,220
I have the. An additional expectation was given to being the same as a conditional expectation of x given e when.

101
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:08,190
When Y is defined the way we did it. Right now, of course it's not general yet because we are only looking at spaces of discrete random variables.

102
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,560
In defining the condition. Right.

103
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:25,500
But these two observations are actually used in probability theory to define the conditional expectation in general, with the exception that.

104
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:34,710
So the conditional expectations in the last line, they are interpreted in the six or one sense because they are with respect to a specific event.

105
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,310
Right. They are not random variables in that sense.

106
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:46,810
And then they have. So both have this kind of form and they have a common denominator.

107
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,270
Right. That's the probability of the event. E.

108
00:15:50,520 --> 00:16:01,050
So it's enough, uh, for that equality to consider an equivalent world, namely that expectation of y over the year a.

109
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,960
Is the same as the expectation of X. All the area.

110
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:24,620
Okay. And this basically means that I multiplied both sides of the equation by the poverty rate to get this.

111
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:30,719
Now the last line here is a bit more general than the previous,

112
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,720
because I don't care whether Pova is equal to zero or not, but at least it doesn't throw me off.

113
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,030
If I have an event, one that's equal to zero.

114
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:48,230
Okay. So, um. And notes that.

115
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,340
We may, in fact, need. Expectations that.

116
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,970
Where the probability of event is equal to zero.

117
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:11,510
So let's say I have X and Y independent.

118
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:23,960
Absolutely continuous when the variables. Right.

119
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:37,480
And let's say I have. And because of that, the probability that, let's say y is equal to a specific value, that's going to be a zero, right?

120
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:52,480
Think of Y having a normal distribution, for example. Let's say I'm taking in the expected value of the random variable z where z is x plus y.

121
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:00,790
And I'm taking it conditional on Y equals to that specific value.

122
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:09,580
And I'm sure you have done this intuitively in your six or one or any other courses, right?

123
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:21,610
I mean, I think linear regression when you have a continuous absolutely continuous covariance and you conditioned on it rates on a specific value,

124
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:31,280
then you say that this is. The mean of Discovery at Valence or better Times the two variants plus.

125
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:43,440
Amsellem Right. So that formulation of a linear regression model, conditions on a query of having a specific value,

126
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,740
even though there is a distribution and you are not bothered by the fact that if your covariance is normally distributed,

127
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,700
that the probability that Y is equal to y is equal to zero.

128
00:18:53,710 --> 00:19:04,530
Right? Uh, so you are already using conditional expectations where p of a zero and you are not bothered by it.

129
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,790
And it's clear what this actually is intuitively right.

130
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,170
So this is just x plus y y.

131
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:26,700
And in that sense, you are not bothered either by the fact that the resultant conditional expectation is actually around the variable, right?

132
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:37,900
And since I'm just adding a number to random variable X, it's measurable with respect to the same sigma algebra that X is measurable was back to.

133
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:44,580
Right. So it's sigma of x measurable random variable.

134
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:53,690
Now we're not quite ready to consider this example because we haven't considered conditional

135
00:19:53,690 --> 00:20:00,170
expectations and all of the generality and we haven't defined what they are when you have a zero.

136
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:07,850
But this is just kind of an appetizer, and it's a reminder that you already used all of this elsewhere.

137
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,120
Okay. So we're just working on the theory to justify it.

138
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:24,620
Okay. So let's. Give a formal definition to the conditional expectation.

139
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,760
So motivated by the intuition we built.

140
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:44,290
So namely, by this thing. These observations.

141
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,250
That's actually emerged out of the approximation theory.

142
00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:05,670
So just for money. So let x. Uh, be a random variable measurable with respect to some sigma algebra f.

143
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,450
And lets you be another sigma algebra.

144
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,750
Now we will generally think that you will use a subset of apps,

145
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:38,299
but that requires some additional clarifications that I will postpone until later when we consider multivariate,

146
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,650
when the variables and sigma algebras that are built out of project sets.

147
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,760
Right. So for now, I'm just bypassing this issue.

148
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:53,730
And it doesn't preclude me from defining the conditional expectation.

149
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,720
So then why use called.

150
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:08,370
A conditional expectation. Of X given you?

151
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,690
When two conditions are satisfied.

152
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,370
So first of all, why is you measurable?

153
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:31,540
And secondly. The integrals in the back end.

154
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:44,530
The goal of the function y over the area e is the same as the integral of X over the same area.

155
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,480
So that for any e in.

156
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:59,190
The Sigma algebra you. Now only in the U.S. So that's essential, right?

157
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:04,710
Because acts may be defined outside of the U.S. for some events that don't belong to you.

158
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,650
Right. And therefore, this equality does not have to be satisfied.

159
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:21,480
But as long as I am within the sigma algebra that's essentially generated by the variable Y, then.

160
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:27,720
So this these two need to be equal. We'll consider an example to clarify that.

161
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:35,560
Okay. So that's that's a formal definition. So I'm simply motivated by the two observations made.

162
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:42,460
And so you can tell, just imagine if I just gave you this definition without.

163
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:52,150
Building the intuition or trying to do it first. So this would be a fairly transparent definition for you.

164
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,970
Okay. So let's look at the example, how this works.

165
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:13,220
An example will be a discrete random variable and even simply a binary random variable.

166
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,550
Right. So let's say I'm taking X.

167
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:26,560
That has a uniform distribution. On zero one.

168
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,290
Okay then.

169
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:44,229
So either way, either you formulates a probability space for x first and then say that x is let's say that this is a sample space, for example.

170
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:51,250
Or you say, well. Reconstruct the probabilities phrase from a random variable.

171
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:57,760
So either way you have the omega that's.

172
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,710
Equal to the zero one.

173
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:15,240
Right. So it's a subset of our you have a sigma algebra defined on that interval, which is a Burrell's Sigma algebra and defined as.

174
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,360
On a subset of only the. Right.

175
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:27,480
And then there is a probability that's essentially in the bag measure.

176
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:36,090
So that's length. Right.

177
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,690
But it only works within the only guide within the interval zero one.

178
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:51,490
Right. So if I have any other interval like 0 to 2, I would have to normalize the length to make the probability measure normalized.

179
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,150
But since in zero one intimate words, just length straight up.

180
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,380
Right. So that's the probability space where X lives.

181
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:11,530
Okay. And the sigma algebra F as well defines. So let's now take the random variable Z, the it's binary.

182
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:18,590
Uh. With, uh. Uh, probability of their nuclear.

183
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:28,100
Let's call it their newly. We values.

184
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:38,890
Uh, zero and one. And with the probability of success being, let's say, one half, it doesn't matter.

185
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:52,520
Right. So regardless of my definition for the P, so the P here doesn't change the sigma algebra in any way.

186
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:07,970
Well, it depends how we build it, right? So now I need to furnish a probability space for the Z, right?

187
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,890
So somehow related to the one for the X and I'm going to take two intervals.

188
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,260
Right. Let's say I'll take 0 to 1 half.

189
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:33,490
I'd say exclude one half and I'll take, uh, from one half to one, and I'm going to build the sigma algebra out of these two sets.

190
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:43,960
Generated by these two sets. And that would be a sigma algebra that will serve.

191
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:56,970
Binary random variables. Variables with taking specific values.

192
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,309
On. Those sets. So this one.

193
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:23,310
And this one. Right. And so our common procedure to characterize those random variables was to build tables.

194
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:28,010
Right. So we say we have 0 to 1 half.

195
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,090
So we have since. Right. A's, there are two of those.

196
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,710
0 to 1 half and one half to one.

197
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:57,720
So that's sets. Then we have values of Z, Z eyes and let's say take zero value on the first one and one half on the second one.

198
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:06,660
Now I have probabilities that are attached to those cells.

199
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:16,590
And like I said, I mean, I took the same measure because I'm trying to build that similar to the way I did with the random variable X.

200
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:21,990
But at this point, I could assign any probability to zero one half, right?

201
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:28,640
But so if I use the length of that interval, that would be one half and another one half.

202
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:49,490
Take them. So I now have what's a sigma algebra you that's by definition going to be this one.

203
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:59,990
And I want to find the conditional expectation of random variable X given random variable z,

204
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:07,250
which is the same thing as conditional expectation of x given the sigma algebra you.

205
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:14,530
And we know from the previous considerations.

206
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:20,080
Right. With all these intuitions that this is going to have this form.

207
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:34,170
Right. Where I goes from 1 to 2, because there are only two sets where a binary variable takes its values.

208
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,209
Right. And it's clear what the indicators are.

209
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,990
That's an indicator of 0 to 1 half and one half to one.

210
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:54,000
So what remains to be specified to find this conditional expectation is the values of the random variable Y on those sets,

211
00:30:54,300 --> 00:31:05,910
and these are the conditional expectations of x given that X is either within zero one half or within one half to one.

212
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,180
So let's do that. So no.

213
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,640
Yeah. This is going to be equal to some.

214
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:24,270
I want you to. Uh, some y one times.

215
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:30,380
Uh. The indicator of the interval zero one half.

216
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:35,569
And for me, the bright and only day is anyway.

217
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:39,070
In zero one it was saved.

218
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,780
This is the Omega. They are one.

219
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,040
That's the. Okay.

220
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:50,170
We did say that. You don't have to repeat it.

221
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,470
Okay. And, uh. Plus. Yeah.

222
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,690
Drop the submarines. You know that I have started reading the.

223
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,700
Specific members of its. So then why?

224
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:09,850
Two times indicator? From one half to one.

225
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,400
I mean, the. Right.

226
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:25,840
So that simply is turning into a one if if my omega falls in zero one half for the first indicator in a similar fashion for the second one,

227
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:44,380
and we know that y one is expected value of my uniform random variable given that this x belongs to zero one half and I'm using sample space here.

228
00:32:49,670 --> 00:33:08,050
So seven isn't going to limit itself. And my way too is a similar thing.

229
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,910
It's an expected value of x given.

230
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:19,170
The fog is into. Four one half to one.

231
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:33,460
I could just drop the x belongs to and just leave the set here because I have the probability space well defined.

232
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:39,670
I know what those events are and what those probabilities are, so I don't have to go with a sample space.

233
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:54,760
Uh, so it's. It's just the fact that I said that I'm considering a sample space for the X, uh, allows me to write X belongs to a one.

234
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:02,910
An X belongs to a two in the condition. So had I not said that, I would have to do something else with the conditions.

235
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:06,030
But that's just. Okay.

236
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:11,780
So it remains to find what those values are. So for the why one.

237
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,170
So we are looking at the definitions.

238
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,070
And you can already tell me that it's intuitively clear.

239
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,870
Right. So if my ex.

240
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:36,319
So remember we also consider the intervals in the range of x and asking the questions what's the best function that averages X over those intervals?

241
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,420
Right. So I have my probability measures length right up there.

242
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:48,320
So uh, that's the one linked to the distribution of X because we said X is uniform, right.

243
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:55,760
So what is the best constant that approximate approximates X between zero and one half.

244
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:02,390
If if every point this kind of X we probable because we have a uniform distribution.

245
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:08,390
So the guess would be that it's one fourth, right? Right in the middle.

246
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,750
So that's at this point is a guess, right?

247
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:19,800
And why Q is what, three quarters, right?

248
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:25,440
It's right in the middle of 1001. So that's also a guess.

249
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:33,260
And what is it, I guess for for a constant that best approximates.

250
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,160
Tax on. The intervals zero one half.

251
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:51,180
And one half and one respectively.

252
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,100
Right. In other words, if.

253
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:17,800
If instead of the reach read the variable x that has a uniform distribution, I got a leaf with a constant on one interval and a constant on another.

254
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:24,200
What's the best thing I can replace X with if I'm coarsening it like that?

255
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,290
So that would be the meta value of the interval intuitively.

256
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:35,130
Right. And I can write those values now according to the definition.

257
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:47,100
So they are conditional expectations. So it's and then to grow that integral 0 to 1 half of my X of omega.

258
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:58,040
Deep of Omega. Over the integral 0 to 1 half.

259
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:04,200
Deep down. Right. So this is of.

260
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:11,010
I'm just going back to. These things were designed for it.

261
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:16,260
So I'm going back to this expression that defines those values.

262
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:24,690
Now I need to specify it a little bit better.

263
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,550
So that's going to be an integral from 0 to 1 half.

264
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:35,070
Right. X of omega is omega itself and omega is a number.

265
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:46,860
So let's say, uh, so for the integral, it doesn't matter what my notation for that number is and the DPI of X is, uh, dpi of omega is length.

266
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:52,310
So that's just X. So if you prefer, we can write Gandhi on the.

267
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:59,560
But there is now a calculus number. That's the integral.

268
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:03,610
You need to divide it by integral. 0 to 1 half on.

269
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:23,850
So that is so the thing in the denominator is just going to be one half and the thing in the numerator is integral 0 to 1 half.

270
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:30,740
Um. I'll just write what it is.

271
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:40,250
Right. So the integral is x squared over two and that's taken between zero and one half.

272
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,660
So that's one over eight, maybe zero, right?

273
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,910
Divided by one half. So that gives me one over four.

274
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,360
Right. Then I compare it to the gas we had.

275
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:07,440
And so. I'm comforted by the coincidence there.

276
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:15,640
So I guess it. I was correct in that sense, and intuition meets a theoretical derivation.

277
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:24,340
Then in a similar way, my way to too is going to be equal to in the grow from one 5 to 1.

278
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,810
Now, speaking of those integrals. So you have in the homework problem.

279
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:45,590
I don't remember which problem it is that's related to what are the bad integrals or stilts integrals or Riemann integrals.

280
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:56,020
Of the function. If you change this function on a set of measure zero and somehow select, isolate the points,

281
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:02,230
for example, and change the function to arbitrary values at those points, finite values.

282
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:08,559
So that won't change the integral, right? So yeah, and here we see same thing happening.

283
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:15,640
So the fact that one half is an open end of the interval, so one half is not included.

284
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:23,500
It doesn't matter for the value of this integral, right? Because it's the same as the integral as if one half were closed.

285
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:37,090
Okay. So this is the same thing on the de omega and then divided by integral from one half to one.

286
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:48,140
Uh. The Almeida. The. And this is still on the square, though, over two.

287
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:58,290
So I'm using momentum, not X. Uh, but this time is for one, two one half.

288
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:09,330
And divided by one half. That's one half minus one eight.

289
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:17,650
Divided by. Half. And that's three quarters.

290
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,950
So this is also a correct. Yes.

291
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:37,540
Right. So the values why I would be one quarter to three quarters.

292
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:40,209
Right.

293
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:50,050
But like we said, the conditional expectation is around the variable measurable with respect to the sigma algebra that's sitting in the condition.

294
00:41:51,340 --> 00:42:01,020
And we know that all measurable functions with respect to the same sigma algebra, if they're discrete, they're different than the values, right?

295
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:04,200
So we have the same sets here.

296
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:15,130
And so Z doesn't matter. The only thing that matters here is the sigma algebra and a different set of values actually gives the best approximation.

297
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:24,220
Um, when we are looking for alternative values of Z that actually minimize the distance between random variable X,

298
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:28,530
that's uniform and the random variable. Z.

299
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:32,110
That's that's binary. And those values are one fourth and three fourth.

300
00:42:50,670 --> 00:43:04,659
Okay, then. We already mentioned this fact in a slightly general context.

301
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:11,690
But let's right now restate that there's a theorem. Any any questions?

302
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:22,150
Yeah. I spent quite some time going over this example because I will probably use something similar elsewhere, either homework or exam.

303
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,740
So make sure you understand it and ask any questions. If anything is unclear here.

304
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:41,950
Yeah. That's just my choice.

305
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:47,860
It won't change anything in the example except the column of Z values.

306
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:59,450
Oh, I see. I see. It's a it's a one that's that's just the spirit.

307
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,140
But you could you could have with one time as well. Right.

308
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,250
That won't change anything.

309
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:15,970
It's just that because I said it's it's it's barely on zero one rates, then I have to keep the zero one values in the table.

310
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:22,980
Any other questions? Okay.

311
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:32,680
So. So let's say I again have the probability space.

312
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:37,240
So that's the army. The the F and the P.

313
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:46,240
And I have a the variable x. Sitting on that probability space.

314
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:54,220
Who is p being its distribution? And suppose.

315
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,920
And X is measurable.

316
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:21,359
With respect to our. It doesn't matter which letter I use to denote the sigma algebra I because I'm considering

317
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:26,660
a conditional expectation I will consider it a conditional on the sigma algebra.

318
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:32,180
If, uh, if it bothers you, it can write you instead of.

319
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:37,740
So there. So that's the statement of the theory.

320
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:42,120
So I'm trying to find what this guy is.

321
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:52,920
Right. So it's conditional expectation of X taken with respect to the Sigma algebra that X is measurable with respect to.

322
00:45:56,270 --> 00:46:00,739
Okay. Uh, we already discussed what that is.

323
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:06,370
Do you remember? That's that's the X itself.

324
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:18,250
Right. And to see that. So this theorem is actually little more than a restatement of the definition.

325
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:24,290
So we have it in the following context.

326
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:27,409
So when we considered our intuition, right?

327
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:35,150
So we had the s f and we had s you.

328
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,230
And we ask the question, So what if we are trying to find.

329
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,430
So my element. What if my ex is actually part of as you.

330
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:58,800
Right. Then the best, uh, elements of you that approximate x is x itself.

331
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,120
So in that case, uh, why?

332
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:08,620
That's the best approximation of it's.

333
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:13,060
In the sigma algebra. You.

334
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:23,410
Is the X itself. So that's the projection type intuition for that statement.

335
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:33,090
But we don't want to be intuitive. We just want to look really carefully on the way we defined the conditional expectation.

336
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:45,480
So first of all, if I look at the property and number two, I'm just replacing Y by an X, that property is going to be trivially true, right?

337
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:50,920
So. We would say that.

338
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:16,049
So just formally for Y being x the integral of y of the area, e is going to be the same as integral of X over the area.

339
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:19,610
A Because why is same as x, right?

340
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:30,210
So this is so property. Uh. I'll put you to statement to in the definition.

341
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:42,050
Conditional expectation. It's given you.

342
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,510
Even if. Doesn't matter what the notation is.

343
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:56,660
Who would be? Truly the true one.

344
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:11,060
Right. So then the crux of the matter is whether I can really take Y equal to X to satisfy this equation.

345
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:17,440
Generally I can not because they are from different sigmoid algebras.

346
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,150
And the one for the Y.

347
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:32,120
So if I if if the sigma algebra that's generated by random variable x and the sigma algebra generated by the round the variable y if they

348
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:47,480
are not the same and if A is from outside of the u right then well I can't even consider this equality and it doesn't have to be fulfilled.

349
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:56,110
Uh, but. So it's the first it's the first property that's that's a limitation here.

350
00:49:56,290 --> 00:50:07,229
That's a restriction. And this property defines where I am required to look for the best approximation of X and I need to do it in the sigma algebra.

351
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:11,280
You right. And you may not serve all of x, right?

352
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:18,600
But in the example that we're considering in this theorem,

353
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:26,340
the Sigma Algebra F is actually the one generated by X because X was defined on from the very beginning.

354
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:33,180
Right. And that's why according to the probability one, in the probability one,

355
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:43,680
I can actually take X because it's a legitimate candidate for the best variable that approximates X on the space as if it.

356
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:54,470
So because. AX actually belongs to our staff.

357
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:10,260
By the condition of the theorem. It is a legitimate.

358
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:21,340
Candidates. The why.

359
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:28,710
That's by definition the conditional expectation of X given if.

360
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:47,410
So. There is nothing prevents me.

361
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:07,350
I'm taking. Y equals X because of that.

362
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:10,590
Because Y is required to be f measurable. Right.

363
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:17,890
So property one. The definition of conditional expectation.

364
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:29,830
Thanksgiving this. So it requires.

365
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:37,400
Why? To be. Yes, measurable.

366
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:53,470
And because X is F measurable by the statement of the theorem, I can actually take y equals to X by the first property,

367
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:57,200
and the second one will be trivially true, as we know earlier.

368
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:14,910
Right. So that's it. Okay.

369
00:53:15,090 --> 00:54:52,370
Let's have a five minute break. It could be a measure used by CBS.

370
00:54:55,420 --> 00:55:00,250
Right. It's almost exchangeable, right?

371
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,470
Because you know that CDM defines the other way around.

372
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:08,010
And this is you. And then when?

373
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:23,380
The. So things will be like this.

374
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:26,880
These will be right back to you. That's right.

375
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:43,280
Right. And actually there can be more complicated cases where you have discrete, continuous, mixed.

376
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:50,740
Then. Then the message is mixed a mixture of a PDF and then some delta function side.

377
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:31,670
Okay. Shall we continue? So, based on the questions that you're asking me.

378
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:39,050
You're in the break. So let's let's do a further note to the example.

379
00:59:55,470 --> 01:00:01,860
So in the example I took X to be uniformly distributed on zero one.

380
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:12,990
Yeah. And this simplified a lot of my derivation, uh, because my integrals were all with respect to the X that's, that's length, right?

381
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:32,430
So what if I modify my X? And let's say X is going to be uniform, except that there will be, uh, three probability masses.

382
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:45,030
So this is the distribution of X. So it's going to be uniform.

383
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:55,830
Last discrete. With Mass.

384
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:07,100
Let's say one third and zero one half and, uh, one.

385
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:27,340
And so the kind of the generalized pdf rights or stilts like thing will be that I have a delta function here with a mass one thirds sitting at zero.

386
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:37,499
Okay. Then I will have a uniform until one five and one half is not included.

387
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,420
So that's like this.

388
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:54,640
Now it's the point where I'm half I will have another, uh, delta function sitting with an integral over just that impulse being one third.

389
01:01:55,910 --> 01:02:01,720
Then again, I will have a uniform distribution all the way to one,

390
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:11,170
and then at one I will have yet another delta function sitting with the mass one third.

391
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:18,450
Now the p in my probability space is no longer the length.

392
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:31,600
It's a combination of length and discrete miles. So it's mixed.

393
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:43,540
This group continues. And the continuous path is uniform.

394
01:02:50,750 --> 01:03:00,420
Now. Can you quickly give me the. The answer to the same problem with with now this type of distribution.

395
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:10,220
Well, probably you can't. Let me modified.

396
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:24,850
Delete this one. It's going to go to zero.

397
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:30,530
And this is going to be. No.

398
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:36,140
I'll delete the first one. Delete the one and zero. So this is a point zero.

399
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:41,570
This is one third. This is another one third.

400
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:46,880
Like this. Right. So I'm trying to make it so that you can give me the answer right away.

401
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:57,959
Without even trying to figure out what the level of this pdf is.

402
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:06,120
Right. Um. So it's clear what this is because you need to subtract.

403
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:11,399
So you take one minus two thirds. That's the math for the continuous path.

404
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:18,150
Right. And it needs to. So it needs to integrate to one third.

405
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:23,820
Right. So the level in here will be one third, but it doesn't matter.

406
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:30,690
Did anybody tell you what the meaning of the physical meaning of the expectation is?

407
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:38,660
I usually do it when I teach a course for a kidney ologist or something.

408
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:49,370
I'm trying to explain what the new value is. So if I have my PDF, it's like a pile of sand on the bottom like this, right?

409
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:57,959
Said some uniform substance. Right here, right in.

410
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,890
I have a bar and I'm trying to put.

411
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:10,520
To balance. It's using something sharp right here and moving it left and right.

412
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:17,200
So if I'm too far to the left, that's going to tip to the right. If I'm too far to the right with this thing, it's going to tip to the left.

413
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:28,710
So can you tell me where the is? So the mean is, when I put this thing exactly where the balance is.

414
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:46,250
Right. So the physical meaning of the mean. Of the mean value.

415
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:55,480
These are points. Of balance.

416
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:06,610
For. PDF and generalized PDF file.

417
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:12,850
Or how they would call it in physics. It's the center of mass.

418
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:28,950
Okay. So when I had a uniform distribution that was from 0 to 1 half.

419
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:37,960
So there was a break like this. And in order to balance it, I need to put it at the point one fourth.

420
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:45,170
Right. So if I have another break from one half to one.

421
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:54,310
Right. Just the uniform brick they need to put it. So to make it imbalanced to the point of three fourths.

422
01:06:56,370 --> 01:07:01,440
So now if I have a break. The way I specified right here.

423
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:07,710
So for the first one, I have a break. Right. And it takes the point.

424
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:20,080
Uh. So to balance it from a conditional expectation, restricting myself to the interval that is conditioned on as a as an event.

425
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:25,330
Right. So I still need to put it at one third to balance it.

426
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:31,800
Right. So the way one is still one third one above the way to.

427
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:43,050
So by the way, I tampered with those masses I was arranging in my head where to put that balance right.

428
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:48,959
It's a magic, right. So put one third right here, one third.

429
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,590
Wait right here. And then I have a brick in between.

430
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:59,090
So where is my center of mass? That's still three fourths, right?

431
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:04,440
Still in the middle. If I raised one of them, that would shift left.

432
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:10,170
Right. The point of balance, if I raised the first mass, that would shift to the right.

433
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:15,479
But to balance a symmetric thing, I need to put it right in the middle.

434
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,280
So it's still three fourths.

435
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:30,140
So if the problem is such that you can use the center of mass intuition to quickly find what the conditionals excitations are,

436
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:41,030
you spare yourself a lot of job. Uh, a lot of effort, uh, taking integrals and dividing by another integrals to find those values.

437
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:45,200
And there's always room for small mistakes when you do that.

438
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:49,880
Right. So if there is information like that, you can write it right away.

439
01:08:49,940 --> 01:09:00,720
Yeah. What would what?

440
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:09,660
Uh huh. Oh, not one third one one quarter rate.

441
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:22,700
That's. See, I'm very prone to small mistakes, so I prefer quick arguments to a longer one because that raises the risk.

442
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:28,940
I will be wrong somewhere. That's one voice.

443
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:34,110
That's right. Okay.

444
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:49,270
Okay. So another theorem. A very useful one for modeling.

445
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:59,180
It's a formula. Of total expectation.

446
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:14,990
So you probably know the formula of total expectations.

447
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:27,980
Is another one as a formula of total probability, just so that you don't wonder how these two are linked.

448
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:32,150
I will give a definition of conditional probability.

449
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:57,240
So conditional probability. Of an event e given some sigma algebra u is going to be the expectation.

450
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:18,230
Indicator of a given year. So you can see here that all I need to build the whole probability theory is not the probability, but the expectation.

451
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:27,890
It does make it a little circular because we define the conditional expectations using probability spaces and we define probabilities before them.

452
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:35,659
But at least with a conditional probability, I can just refer to the conditional expectation that would justify.

453
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:43,170
And so it's an expectation of a specific indicator variable that's going to be a conditional probability in a search.

454
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:50,670
It's generally a random variable. Right.

455
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:56,010
Whenever you is non-trivial, the general rate does not correspond to an honorable thing.

456
01:11:56,890 --> 01:12:02,320
So when you is a sigma algebra that has more than two uh sets in its.

457
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:09,540
More than just an army guy in an empty set. Uh, that's going to be around the variable.

458
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:15,580
So if you has four sets and that's a binary random variable.

459
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:27,730
Okay. So in the formula later on, we'll show that the formula of total expectation will also have a corollary.

460
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:32,530
As a corollary, the formula of total probability that you know, from six or one.

461
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:38,080
I don't remember if six or one gives you a formula of total expectation.

462
01:12:38,090 --> 01:12:43,940
Did you have it? Okay. So we're just generalizing it.

463
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:48,650
So the expected value of X.

464
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:55,130
We can write. It is an integrated expectation.

465
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:03,540
So it's given you and then the expectation on top of that.

466
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:17,780
Now the meaning. Here is another intuition how you can think about conditional expectations.

467
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:24,200
They are around the variables and if you take a very rich sigma algebra and put

468
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:29,150
it in the condition and the richest one would be the one generated by X itself.

469
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:36,140
So you are not restricting X in any way. That's the intuition right there.

470
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:41,480
The conditional expectation is going to be X itself. As we found in the previous theorem.

471
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:51,820
Right. So the conditional expectation basically does not alter any randomness of X because it just spits out the acts itself.

472
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:56,040
When this guy is rich. Right.

473
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:03,820
But when you use a sigma algebra for a more primitive random variable, this is going to be less random than x.

474
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,480
This is my intuitive, sloppy language, right?

475
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:19,030
All the way to. If I take a non random thing that's behind the U, then my expectation is going to be non random.

476
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:27,380
Which is the conventional one. Right. Not the. So what would be the variable in that case?

477
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:44,180
Right. So you can think of the spirit of taking conditional expectation is depriving eggs of some randomness and you being the protected

478
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:52,380
randomness that would still be leftover after that and will endow the conditional expectation with a random variable meaning to it.

479
01:14:53,780 --> 01:15:02,630
Okay. So what this says, following this intuition is that I took away some randomness.

480
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:09,680
So if I take the full expectation, given you go right on, you get an empty sense that would be the degenerate sigma algebra.

481
01:15:10,190 --> 01:15:13,550
The thing inside would be not random already. Right.

482
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:21,530
So if I'm taking one with respect to some generic sigma algebra here, I'm taking away some of the randomness in X.

483
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:26,179
But the expectation is still random and it's measurable with respect to you.

484
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:29,719
And that's this you defines the richness of this.

485
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:37,940
You defines how random this guy is. If I take another expectation of this, the variable rate.

486
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:42,920
So this is like an expectation given that the generator in the variable would give

487
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:48,260
an Omega that eats the remaining randomness in here and it gives you a number,

488
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:57,440
which is this thing great. That's the six of one expectation. So what it tells you, that's to take away all the randomness in the X.

489
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:05,810
And this is by the way, if you think of the usual expectation as a particular case of conditional expectation,

490
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:15,020
taking over on the right, you are basically looking for the best way to approximate random variable X by a constant everywhere.

491
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:26,180
And that's the mean value, right? So you're just eating all of the random in the X by steps, right?

492
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:30,140
By chewable pieces. Right? This is one time you took away.

493
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:39,880
The randomness that's between the you and the alpha. That's a more general segment of your brain that due to the remaining randomness.

494
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:51,269
So that's the intuitive meaning of this. Okay.

495
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:52,590
I'll prove it next time.
