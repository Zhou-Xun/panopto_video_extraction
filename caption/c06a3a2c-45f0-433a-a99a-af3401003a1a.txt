1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:08,730
All right. So any announcements from anyone in the back?

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:14,240
Yeah, just Saturday, again, good jazz band will be playing cool.

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,110
Anyone else? People have a good fall break.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:33,130
I see a thumbs up. Thank you. It's nice to work out.

5
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,719
We're great. So that was a break from one kind of work to do.

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,760
Another kind of work. So we can remember what we talked about last time.

7
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:50,220
And remember we had that cliffhanger of the pictures, and I'm sure you all were like obsessing over the whole wall break.

8
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,200
And I was like, Oh, my God, what is the next picture? What does it all mean?

9
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:03,149
Why? Why are we showing these pictures? In and we remember part of it.

10
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,809
But I think we were trying to talk about like how when we see these pictures,

11
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:13,240
we often see like physical illness or some sort of physical sickness, whereas it could be some sort of mental illness as well.

12
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,920
Not like perceiving cool. That was one part of it. Excellent.

13
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:28,110
Well. Brains all praise them all.

14
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,580
Very well. All right.

15
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:41,019
Well, we were were I was asking you questions about what do you think is going on in the different pitches?

16
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,429
You we talking about the first person we didn't bring up the you know,

17
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:52,220
all the we tend to zone in on different characteristics that may indicate physical health outcomes.

18
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:57,190
It could be mental health outcomes. We were talking about this do but we didn't come to any resolution.

19
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:01,710
I didn't tell you there was a cliffhanger with him, which we'll discuss later on.

20
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:09,179
I really don't keep you activated for the class. What's going on with this little one at the end?

21
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,560
What do you think's happening with her? He's kind of got a fever, right?

22
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,480
How do you know that? She's got her forehead and she has a thermometer in her mouth.

23
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,319
Okay. And she looks sexy. Okay. And you say she looks like.

24
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,520
What does that mean? Like, what are you picking up on? I'm picking up on.

25
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,050
She just generally does not look the most happy about your robe.

26
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,170
So she might be cold and she's got the thermometer in her mouth, which says Sick to me.

27
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:42,080
And you mentioned not being happy. And that's like when, when we did the responses where you wrote in about different things related,

28
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:51,090
like how a lot of people talk about happiness, being connected with wellness or health and sadness being connected with not such good health.

29
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:58,910
Anything else you see with this little girl? We don't want to miss them.

30
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,490
All right. Does everyone pretty much think that she's not feeling well or they're not feeling well?

31
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,640
Okay. I think they're trying to fake it so they can get Arizona's law.

32
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:16,010
They didn't finish their homework. And I'm sure none of you did that.

33
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,860
I did not start doing this last round. You're a slow starter.

34
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,420
All right. What about these women? Take any woman and tell me her story.

35
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,330
Or tell me what you think is going on healthwise with them.

36
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,020
Amelia Earhart, the one on the left, looks like she's been dancing or doing something similar.

37
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,550
So I would imagine that maybe she's feeling good enough to be moving around. Okay, good.

38
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:54,840
So there you go. Like the association between certain behaviors you may engage in and those connected with more positive health or well-being.

39
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,810
What else? Who else?

40
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,810
Anybody. I really did today.

41
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,340
I'm kind of going off of that. Like, maybe she's trying to dance to cheer herself up.

42
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,650
She wasn't feeling the best, so she's, like, trying to do some sort of physical activity to make yourself feel better.

43
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:21,010
That's true. Yeah, because if she's engaging in some type of mood regulation behavior.

44
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,200
That's pretty nerdy solving for trying to make yourself feel better. But it could be.

45
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:32,299
What else? Or one of these other themes. Yeah, I know.

46
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,280
The press in the middle. It looks like they're smiling, but they also look really tired. Like you can see that through, like, her eyes.

47
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:42,260
And so I feel like it's like a smile that she's putting on for everyone. She's actually, like, really tired or not feeling well.

48
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,040
Okay. So smiles.

49
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,649
We typically associated with feeling better, being happy,

50
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,990
but sometimes we wear a smile because that's what socially acceptable or what's expected of us.

51
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,800
But. What about this person here?

52
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,030
What's going on there? Yeah.

53
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:13,570
So, like, the two people on the left are wearing, like, brighter colors, and I kind of associate that with, like, happiness and joy.

54
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,050
So, like, better health. Right. Okay.

55
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:23,650
And not so much this last one, huh? Anyone have any ideas about what's going on here?

56
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,530
You can make up mark hundred wild stories, whatever, whenever you see.

57
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:37,980
So if you were working in a public health program and she came in for one of your group sessions,

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,490
what would you think is going on with her that she's like really excited to be there and can't wait to jump in to start learning about sexual health?

59
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,390
Yeah, she looks super annoyed at whoever's taking the picture.

60
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,600
Right? Yeah. And how do you know? She's super annoyed. Just like the way her eyebrows were raised and like her.

61
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:08,029
What else is going on? Anything with her? Yeah, but I wouldn't describe, like, if I saw this picture, I wouldn't.

62
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,349
This is like the first thought that comes to mind isn't probably something, like, healthy.

63
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:20,960
Like, I think she's got dark marks or her eyes and her face looks a little like pretty upset to be there to him and like,

64
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:28,940
upset and then like physical symptoms. I like even like she's in the slide with the pictures of other people enjoying themselves.

65
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,780
Uh huh, yeah. So. So it could be emotional and physical.

66
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:39,350
Right. And do you think your opinion of the third person is influenced by being next to the other two people?

67
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,180
I think you would have the same assumptions. Yeah.

68
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,440
I mean, I'm not like. Yeah, that's what you're supposed to do.

69
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:54,020
I do a creative exercise. I mean, I don't know, like, maybe, like weekly people this.

70
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,380
My passions are like, I don't know, just like being themselves.

71
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,670
Maybe. Maybe she's for taking it, like gossip. Like. Exactly right.

72
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,850
She's wearing black and she's eyeliner on. It looks like that.

73
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,170
Or someone that maybe just prefers to be like this. And I think if.

74
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,390
If she wants to be that way, she. Right, exactly.

75
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,420
Right. Yeah. Because I mean, we do make a lot of assumptions.

76
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:19,460
Again, like I said, if she came into a program, you might assume that she really does want to be there.

77
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,080
But that may be her persona.

78
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,960
You know, that may be her, you know, the mask as she wears or the kind of guard she puts off to make it through the world.

79
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,100
Yeah. I mean, I, I would think that, like, if we saw the picture of just like isolated,

80
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:36,229
like some people have kind of like resting [INAUDIBLE] face, like, oh yeah, we're like, maybe she's not actually mad.

81
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,450
Maybe she's just kind of like neutral.

82
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,420
But I think putting her next, like, one who's, like, clearly smiling, like, makes her seem a lot, like, grumpy or angry or.

83
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:52,790
Right. So context matters, right? So if we saw her, if all of your participants walked in, you know, like that, I don't know.

84
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,429
You may be like, Oh, [INAUDIBLE], it's going to be a rough session.

85
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,020
Or you may be like, Oh, they're adolescent and you know, they're not gonna be there.

86
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:14,660
Now, the the cliffhanger story that one of my students made up a while ago is that she is actually pissed off at her boyfriend,

87
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:21,320
who's in the middle, who came over to her house and went to the bathroom and went through her medicine cabinet.

88
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,960
And she walked in on him.

89
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:31,940
And she was really pissed off because they just started dating and they want to know what the [INAUDIBLE] he's doing in her medicine cabinet.

90
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:38,380
So I don't know if that's true or not. Obviously they're just dumb pictures. But anyway, that was the story that someone made up one year.

91
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:46,650
They got very into it too. When I asked, you know, that person went on and on about their connection and how they had been dating.

92
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:56,510
And I was like, okay, well, you create a writer and now let's look at this group of people what you think is going on with these guys.

93
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:19,729
I got my transcripts and I retired about six years ago, so it's not always easy, but no, hard to compare them.

94
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,870
Like the first and the last one. They seem a bit more active just by like they're built.

95
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,640
Like the first one, it seems like they're doing some type of like boxing or sports.

96
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:34,520
Know the last one just looks muscular. So I'm just assuming that maybe they do work out, maybe they're just genetics, but.

97
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:43,910
Right. Yeah. And then in comparison for the one in the middle, was this a couch potato eating and drinking, binge drinking?

98
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,160
Or maybe he's on a break from his Pilates class. I was really hungry.

99
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:56,150
I didn't. So he grabbed some French fries. What else do you think about any of them?

100
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:09,110
Yeah, yeah. Some say this guy looks like he's ready to fight when I'm currently a boxer street about the fight on different sides to fight.

101
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,390
So. So what does that say about his health, do you think?

102
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,420
Can you make any assumptions or I mean, yeah, that he's I think he probably knows how to fight.

103
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,600
I wouldn't I wouldn't say he's healthy or not healthy.

104
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,740
It just looks like it's very high. Okay. And do we usually connect the actor with healthy?

105
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,729
Yeah, right. So I mean, even though I mean, it's hard to say exactly.

106
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,460
But we often equate, you know,

107
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:45,960
people who are very active as being healthy and people who are maybe a little bit larger or look more sedentary is not doing something.

108
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,679
Yeah, honestly, with how expressive the guy on the left faces,

109
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,419
it kind of makes me wonder if he's deaf and is using sign language because sign language is just really exaggerated

110
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,590
facial features and that just isn't the kind of face we would make when they're using words or something.

111
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:05,220
Yeah, it's going to do a great job again.

112
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:17,220
Also, like you can tell is like a lot of energy and like he's hyping other people up and like I equated energy with health in our activity.

113
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:22,890
So just like even looking across the board, like the middle guy looks very low energy.

114
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,890
Right. And that's like, yeah, it gives him excited as his health.

115
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,900
Okay, good. Yeah. An energy is definitely just like activity.

116
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:38,170
Something we often associate other thoughts about these guys, but not the guy in the in the middle.

117
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,670
We haven't had a chance to kind of talk about him all day in comparison to the other people.

118
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,100
What do you think's going on with him? Do you think it's subject matter? I was gonna answer that last.

119
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,940
Oh, go ahead. Answer anything you want. I'm having days.

120
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,990
I'm right now. So.

121
00:11:53,910 --> 00:12:03,960
But I think like an interesting choice for I guess on your part is that for the middle picture we're seeing context first and last picture,

122
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,580
we're only seeing like the individual themselves and not the context around them.

123
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:17,370
And I think since there's like looks like, like some built up magazines or, um, maybe some like old mail or calculator.

124
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:27,120
And I think that we sort of equate like messiness or lack thereof with like health with it, like maybe not that direct connection,

125
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,699
but if we were to put either like the first or last in context of like a really messy house or something,

126
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,490
I think we would acquire them to maybe having poor health or,

127
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:44,549
or like I guess on the flipside that could be having like less time to like figure out some of those other things.

128
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:48,420
So I think that's just like an interesting factor that the middle person has more that

129
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:55,950
context that was actually purposeful because the three have varying degrees of contact.

130
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:00,200
So the guy on the far right, you see the least of him than him, than him.

131
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:05,760
So when you pull in context and sometimes we inserted even like this, you know,

132
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,510
a lot of people are talking about him like fighting, but it's like it could be sign language, could be something.

133
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,669
I was just going to agree with her because something I was going to bring up at some point was

134
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,900
that I'm sure that those other two people have been in situations like the guy in the middle.

135
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,060
I think if you picture them eating in a messy way, like I'm sure that that's happened before.

136
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,840
Right. And you might have thought something else about their health where like you can't see the guy on the right side,

137
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,200
so you can't see that the guy on the left is about to start fighting somebody, you know? Right.

138
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:38,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was just going to say, like, it looks like the guy in the middle is kind of like disassociating from everything that's

139
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,180
around him compared to the other two that are kind of like looking straight forward.

140
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:46,820
But at the end, yes.

141
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:54,239
So eye contact is something we often use as an assessment also of someone's health or wellbeing or connectedness.

142
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,280
Like you said, you know, if someone and again,

143
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,080
if someone came to a group that you're running and they're just kind of putting their head down and that really looking at you,

144
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:06,090
you might make assumptions that they don't want to be there.

145
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:11,310
They're sad, other things like that. Maybe they decide, you know, because they, they don't feel comfortable.

146
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:19,950
Yeah, guess I was also think that like perceived age, like I feel like the guy in the middle to me looks like the opposite and maybe he's not.

147
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:29,339
But I think like that also kind of affects how I view their health and maybe how healthy they are because I feel like the two guys on the outside,

148
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,700
it's much more youthful, right? Yeah.

149
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,030
Yeah. And again, youth is something that we don't connect with, though.

150
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,770
Yeah. I mean, the center guy could be a power lifter for all, you know.

151
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:45,330
I mean, we can't totally see, you know, you see a little bit of our stomach, but you see a lot of power lifters.

152
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,620
They're like big dudes. I mean, he could actually be the healthiest of all of them.

153
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,520
We just don't really comment on these folks.

154
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,200
So why do you think I did this exercise? I mean, we talked a little bit at the beginning, but, you know,

155
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:08,690
there is actually a thought process that went into like the selection of the pictures and and why we're talking about this now,

156
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:16,960
especially coming after talking about culture, humility and those different issues is not an either or.

157
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:21,260
And I think it's a drone. Yeah. Yeah.

158
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:27,910
Um, I think. The purpose is that health looks like wine.

159
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:36,190
It's like you can't even look at someone to say, like, Oh yeah, they're healthy because you just don't.

160
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:51,020
No. Yeah, but I would just like to. Just like how you're saying culture humility is that like people are different in different

161
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:57,230
contexts and like that bodies are different and health is presented in different ways.

162
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:06,560
And that the way the society like say what health is and have one standard for health is not like for everyone.

163
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,530
Right. Right. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

164
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:20,120
And especially, you know, if you're working cross-culturally either within a U.S. context or in a mobile context because things that are seen,

165
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,830
you know, as healthy here may be seen as very unhealthy in other places.

166
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:32,350
I think I shared before, like when I go to Kenya, you know, if I gain weight, that's a good thing.

167
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:38,120
So they say you've expanded and that means you're you're healthy, you have enough to eat.

168
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,590
You're not having to work for something. But if you lose weight, you're reduced.

169
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:52,520
And then they worry because that's a bad thing. That could mean you have HIV, malaria, you know, any kinds of negative health outcomes.

170
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:59,860
What else is is important. I'm sorry.

171
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,700
I'm so sorry.

172
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:11,740
Yeah, like, it's, like, for so long, you know, and stuff like that.

173
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:18,280
It made me really think about the art gallery and.

174
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:28,440
It was Princeton professor who was pro infanticide and how she was arguing that like you can with the depth

175
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:35,460
of definition and have like good health is not in being like able bodied and exercising being active.

176
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,760
It's always changing depending on, like, who you are in the context of the culture.

177
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,380
Mm hmm. Yeah, that's an extra point. I think a lot of definitions of health.

178
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:51,330
Assume able bodied or associate everybody that's with health.

179
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,370
But that's not always the case. You know, and there are things called genetics.

180
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,890
So someone race, you know, bodies are going to look different depending on their genetics.

181
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:09,000
And in different countries and different cultures, people celebrate bodies looking very differently.

182
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:14,160
And some of that is just cultural constructions and some of it's just a cultural reality.

183
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,110
You know that. And I think it's more so for women than men.

184
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:26,760
I think men are not critiqued for their bodies as much across cultures, but women are constantly critiqued for their bodies.

185
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,370
You know how big their hips are, their breasts that are, you know, other parts of that.

186
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,400
And that's something I noticed from like the selection of pictures that you paint.

187
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:42,569
Like there was like a variety of like races and genders and ages and like I think that it's like important to acknowledge that,

188
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,250
like, while there's like not one way,

189
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:51,809
like look healthy or be healthy, like there's also like very gendered and like racialized, like, expectations for what it means to be healthy.

190
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:56,310
Like, yeah, like look like a healthy woman or a healthy old person.

191
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:01,620
And like, I think that's just like something, it's like how it can differ for different entities.

192
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,599
Yeah. And then throw intersectionality on top of that, you know, it gets a lot more complex, you know.

193
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:14,130
So if you're a, you know, Puerto Rican older man who has Parkinson's,

194
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:22,290
your presentation is going to be very different than someone who has another subject in their sexual identities and and how we even perceive,

195
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,640
you know, what that what healthy should look like. But it's not just I mean,

196
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:36,180
I have something in regards to like men and like exercising and working out and it isn't necessarily like applying to those photos,

197
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:41,309
but kind of like a frame of reference in my eating disorders, prevention and treatment class.

198
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:49,379
And we're talking about different like compensatory behaviors and how they differ between genders and

199
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:57,600
how for studies usually like intensive exercise isn't labeled as basically behavior for a lot of men.

200
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:05,759
Use that and like I know that generally in society we define healthy as like being active, like exercising,

201
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:13,110
but there is a degree to which that can be a very unhealthy behavior, is doing that for like the wrong reasons or cause.

202
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:18,309
I know like a lot of people like feel more like energetic, really makes them happy to work out.

203
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:22,620
But some people are doing it like as a compensatory behavior, more like eating.

204
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:33,840
And I think if we just judge everyone, I think society judges everyone who works out or who has like an athletic lifestyle in a positive light and,

205
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:42,090
and like some people, like we're talking about on social media, how like comments would be like, oh, like drop the workout routine or stuff like that.

206
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:48,299
If someone looks fit, even if they aren't like any type of like exercise influencer.

207
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,260
I know. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's a really excellent point.

208
00:20:52,260 --> 00:21:03,309
I think the. You know, because we equate exercise with health and, you know, going to the gym and all these other kind of things.

209
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:10,200
And even if you think about it too, it also is connected to clothing as well.

210
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:20,020
So if you look at, you know, a lot of clothing that is more popular in different kind of circles and has that more athletic look or,

211
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:27,820
you know, wearing jerseys, other things like that. So we do put a lot of privilege in that, going to the gym, working out things like that.

212
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:32,770
And, you know, like you said, I think, well, it happens with men and women both.

213
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:38,319
But I think there are a lot of men that are praised for that behavior because we do

214
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,360
value muscles and muscle tone and all that when actually it can be very detrimental.

215
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:51,070
You know, there's a lot of especially in the gay community, a lot of men that have body dysmorphic disorder who are really,

216
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:59,470
you know, engaging in a lot of kind of compulsive exercising behavior and even,

217
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:08,010
you know, restricting of diet or, you know, loading with protein or carbs or whatever, depending on how they try to manipulate their body.

218
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:14,830
So, yes, I think that is a really, really good point because we are an exercise society, you know, and we really focus on that.

219
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:22,420
And again, if you look at other countries, not so much, but, you know, our U.S. values are creeping, you know, into other cultures.

220
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:29,139
So, again, just in the work that I do and and Kenya, when I first started working there back in oh four,

221
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,250
you never saw gyms like that something people you don't go to a gym.

222
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,580
Usually you're working so hard that you don't need to go to a gym.

223
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:46,810
And there's really been a proliferation, especially in more urban areas of gyms opening up now and following more of us kind of mainstream.

224
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,380
And now that's like a sign of not only helping wealth.

225
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,270
So if you can say, Oh, I go to the gym, you know, you must have money.

226
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:00,010
So there's so many different things connected to that.

227
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,100
Yeah. So I think all of you are right. I think that, you know, again,

228
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:13,419
why I wanted to do this with pictures as I was just talking about it is because I want you all to also examine

229
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:18,310
your own reactions to these pictures and to really think about why did you think X or why did you think that?

230
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,030
You know, even if you didn't say anything, I'm sure you have reactions.

231
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:27,310
And we do have to be really careful in our work not to make those assumptions.

232
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,120
So I can give you a we're a real world example.

233
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:43,120
We were doing some focus groups in Los Angeles with young gay men around who were living

234
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,999
with HIV around how we could help promote adherence to meds and better mental health,

235
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:58,719
things like that. So we had one guy that came in and he came into the group actually a little bit earlier than some of the other guys.

236
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,680
And, you know, we got sucked into the concerns stuff and then he was sitting there and he was, Oh God, I get to sit in the chair.

237
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:14,360
I'm glad to see examples today. So he was sitting there, kind of like slides like this with his arms folded and, you know, the cap on.

238
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:21,100
And then it kind of hold his cap, though. So what kind of message do you think I'm sending if I do that?

239
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,250
Yeah, I'm excited to be here now.

240
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:32,770
Yeah. So the message then we check is, oh, maybe he's not really thrilled to be here.

241
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,910
Maybe he doesn't want to, you know, open up so much.

242
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:51,190
And so that is the that group started I was co facilitating with someone else and he said something about kind of like whispering to me,

243
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:56,349
is it okay to, you know, bring the, this person's name into the discussion?

244
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:08,110
I'm like, of course. But he was kind of so intimidated by his look that he wasn't initially kind of trying to pull him into the discussion.

245
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:14,290
And when we did, he ended up giving us more information than anyone in the whole group.

246
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:21,309
But my co facility made an assumption from the very beginning that, Oh, this person,

247
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:26,440
I'm not going to call them, you know, I'm not going to engage them because of their bodily presentation.

248
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:34,390
Part of it was that he was new to the area and didn't really know anyone and a lot of the other guys in the group had been coming to this clinic,

249
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:39,130
you know, for several months together and they all knew each other.

250
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,219
So it was just his own defense mechanism, you know, he was just kind of not really comfortable in that setting.

251
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:50,740
So again, when we're developing programs, implementing programs, we have to be really careful not to make those assumptions.

252
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,830
I'm going to go through these real quick.

253
00:25:54,910 --> 00:26:02,230
Hopefully you've talked about, you know, different definitions of health from a World Health Organization CDC.

254
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:11,019
You know, one thing that I want to point out here is that one here.

255
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:16,030
So and W.H.O. and CDC, they use the same one as a state of complete physical,

256
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:20,470
mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.

257
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,930
Now, you know, one of the things with the physical part is.

258
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:32,040
How do you define physical well-being? So if you have physical limitations, is that well-being?

259
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,229
So if you do have some kind of mobility issue, some people might say, Oh, well,

260
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:42,640
then you don't have physical well-being because you're limited in terms of mobility.

261
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:53,290
So that's that's one issue. I think the with mental health is where I have concerns, which is the way W.H.O. and CDC define it,

262
00:26:53,830 --> 00:27:02,950
is that mental health is a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential can cope with the normal stresses of life,

263
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:08,200
can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her, is committed.

264
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:12,370
And first of all, we need to get rid of the pronouns, so be a lot easier.

265
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:20,960
Say there. But what other challenges do you see with this definition when it comes to mental health?

266
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:27,160
Just given our conversation earlier, really focus on like, being able to do it later.

267
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:34,380
Mm hmm. That's true. Yeah. What else? And then there was what I was going to say, I.

268
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:41,870
What else? Well, yeah, I guess just like the can cope with the normal stresses of life.

269
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:47,560
Like, what does that mean? Because it's like everybody has different things going on in a different degree.

270
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,360
Mm hmm. You know, might seem like a lot more than someone knows, right?

271
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:59,409
Yeah. I mean, that the word normal is so incredibly subjective, so who knows?

272
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:05,440
I mean, for some people, a normal stressor might be finding out where I'm going to sleep or what I'm going to eat.

273
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,610
And another it may be, can I just class on time, you know, so a lot of variability.

274
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,950
What else is a challenge with? That's where we define that. Yeah.

275
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:20,610
I feel like you can contribute to your community and be productive while still having challenges with your mental health.

276
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:24,330
I think that's a defining aspect, right.

277
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:34,230
And I wouldn't say the other way, too, that you can be mentally healthy, but because of societal restrictions or systemic,

278
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:40,060
you know, limitations, you may not be able to contribute to society in the way that others would define it.

279
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:47,580
So I agree with 100%. I think that people who are having mental health challenges can still do all these things and vice versa.

280
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:51,059
Yeah, it's really similar to what everyone else is saying, but I feel like at least for me,

281
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:55,470
one of the biggest stressors on my mental health is feeling like I always have to be productive,

282
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,900
making a difference in my community and stuff, and then being like, Oh yeah, mental health is doing that is really annoying.

283
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,560
Yeah. And I think again, that is, you know, we've talked about this, you know,

284
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:10,280
in the past about how we do have this like productivity kind of pressure that we're supposed to be doing everything.

285
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:15,210
And again, I think especially we talk about a lot of messaging for women that you have to be able to do it all.

286
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:23,310
You know, have have kids, have a family, have a job, go to the gym and, you know, do all these 10 million other things.

287
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:27,660
And then that's seen as something that's a goal.

288
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:35,900
You know, when we use the word well-being, there's not a whole lot of agreement to around around this.

289
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:45,180
People use well-being differently. Some people use it as just kind of a positive mental health, you know, state of positive mental health.

290
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:55,500
And I think a lot of times people do talk about it as having more positive emotions, not having a negative affect or negative emotions.

291
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:07,260
And the I think in the field of public health, we we don't talk about it as much because it's harder to measure to.

292
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:13,380
It's like, how do you measure well-being? Because it's so contextually determined, you know?

293
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:19,950
And, you know, I think there's a second born says, you know, for public health purposes, physical well-being,

294
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:26,429
which is often equated with feeling healthy and full of energy, is also viewed as critical to overall well-being.

295
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:31,450
But you may still have positive well-being and that feel very healthy and full of energy.

296
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:39,090
And then you may have a chronic illness that zaps your energy level, but you're functioning well, you're content, you're managing.

297
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:42,650
You know that you can still have a high level of well-being.

298
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:52,409
Again, it's it's hard to determine that. And your other concerns, do you talk about well-being that much or is that in other mental health classes,

299
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:57,630
or is it mostly just using the term health or even the opposite of ill or.

300
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:05,940
Sick disease. You're talking about well-being while I'm in mental health.

301
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:12,630
Oh, okay. I hope you like this. Any other classes.

302
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:22,160
Do you think do you think in public health we should be talking about well-being more? Why or why not?

303
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:34,470
Why should we? In the back, in my public 400 class in public health as a behavioral social science, I think we talk a lot about well-being.

304
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:44,150
And like we, we really been reading like a lot of like sort of how like these like psych theories of, you know,

305
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:52,040
like affirming transcendent values and like self assessment and believing that you purpose in life like

306
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:59,690
translates to much better outcomes and like extension and life expectancy and all these different things.

307
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,809
So yeah, I think it is like weird that there is all this like evidence that is coming out and yet

308
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:11,180
like we don't talk about wellbeing like in a holistic sense when we talk about like.

309
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:22,879
General Grant Yeah, I think it's important to incorporate wellbeing within like the public health field within public health learning.

310
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:30,050
But also wellbeing is such a subjective thing actually with like, I mean there's physical wellbeing, there's mental wellbeing, there's.

311
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,570
Economic well-being. There's so many different types of well-being that money,

312
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,560
it's difficult to kind of just like define well-being and incorporate it within public

313
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,370
health when well-being can look so entirely different for different individuals.

314
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:50,600
Right. So like, I think it's important to really consider that in like realize that we can teach

315
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,669
about well-being but we shouldn't define it or like make individuals feel like,

316
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:59,300
oh, this, this is right. This is what well-being should be like.

317
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:05,540
Like people. I think it's important to encourage, one to find their own well-being and, like, in their own way.

318
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:11,210
Mm hmm. Yeah. Like you said, you know, in those last four, there's, you know, physical well-being, economic, social.

319
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,559
You know, there's all different types of well-being as well.

320
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:22,160
So it is hard to say, oh, I have, you know, a high degree of well-being or I'm going to move to a place of well-being,

321
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,270
because a lot of times, you know, again, we're not all defining this the same way.

322
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:32,239
I I'm going to say, I do think we talk about well-being without using those words a lot when we talk about social determinants of health,

323
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,660
like access to parks, access to social support, all of those things tie in to physical well-being, emotional well-being.

324
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,140
But I don't think we ever talk about the after aspect of rights.

325
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,520
We just say they affect us, but not all. Yeah. Yeah.

326
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,230
And I think it's interesting because it really fits in with kind of the public health overall deficit model.

327
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:57,559
Right? So we love to talk about illness or death or disease or, you know, negative health outcomes,

328
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:07,220
but it's a lot harder to kind of all agree upon what what wellness is or what well-being is or what even unhealthy is.

329
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:12,709
And I think, you know, again, a lot of that is because in order to get, you know,

330
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:16,090
to develop programs, you want to develop programs where there is a deficit, right.

331
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:20,990
Where there's a need. But then how do you determine what that endpoint is?

332
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,930
So how do you determine what you should be working toward?

333
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:31,760
And that's where it's really important for you to really understand the population you're working with, what their desired outcome is.

334
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:40,940
So if you go to a community and you've got money for obesity research and you're trying to get people to lower their BMI,

335
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:49,070
that may be something that's totally against what they want. And it's really not a health issue or you're doing a mental health intervention.

336
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:55,760
And let's say you want people at the end to report on some scale how happy they are.

337
00:34:55,970 --> 00:35:02,240
Well, culturally, to talk about your degree of happiness may not be something that's culturally appropriate.

338
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,000
And so you have to think about that.

339
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:14,690
I know when I first started working in Kenya with doing school based programs around sexual health and gender based violence,

340
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,880
we were using and adapting some elements that had been developed or programs that had been developed in the U.S.

341
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:31,429
And one of the things that some of the programs would do is like after people would do an activity and would say,

342
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,730
you know, great job, you know, and some kind of affirmation.

343
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,710
Well, the teacher was like, oh, we can't say that. And we're like, why can't you say that?

344
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:44,870
Like, well, that's being boastful. And so that's not really appropriate.

345
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:54,170
That's not something we would do. So if you would give someone a measure about how happy they are, you have to think about in that culture,

346
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,290
how do they define it and what is it that they're really looking for?

347
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:04,700
Because we have a very specific way that we think about what wellness and well-being is,

348
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:10,760
even though, like Coach said, we don't necessarily have a set definition.

349
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:18,260
But I think a lot of times people have this idea of what it is and we have to make sure that that really aligns with the community.

350
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:24,300
You know, we may think having a job is a positive thing, but maybe in certain communities it's not.

351
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,740
There's other ways to get money. It doesn't have to be a set job.

352
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:36,080
You know, we've even in some of our global work, moved away from saying, are you employed to do you have a source of income?

353
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:43,160
Because that source of income could be through casual labor, it could be through sex work, it could be through something else.

354
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,990
That is, it may be considered by us or other sense as a job or employment.

355
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:56,060
So it's really important for us to think about our health outcomes, to make sure that they're really culturally tailored,

356
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:00,740
which is all part of cultural humility, is really understanding for that population.

357
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:09,930
What is health that don't make sense? Right now does those high.

358
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,130
So I have a real quick question. I want you to not use your brain again.

359
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:20,380
I know this is really tough right now. Where am I going to blast any pictures?

360
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:25,150
But I'm going, oh, I want to put your heads down for this.

361
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:31,930
Actually, do you mind doing that? And then with thumbs up, if you think that's positive and thumbs down.

362
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:36,940
If you think it's negative and sideways, if you think it's neutral.

363
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:43,890
All right. Asparagus. Know we have some asparagus lovers.

364
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,410
All right. Exercise.

365
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,570
Okay. Healthy eating.

366
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:02,330
Okay. Um. Reading.

367
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:12,100
Okay. Mental health. All right.

368
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,600
Physical health. All right.

369
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:22,980
You can put your hands up here. It didn't work. What I'm trying to get at, and that was really clear.

370
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:32,190
But I just made this up. And, you know, sometimes you fail. Is that when when we use the word mental health,

371
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:40,050
typically it's thought about when we talk about mental health now it's like we want to have positive mental health.

372
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:46,410
But a lot of times if you just hear the word mental help, people think about psychological disorders or distress.

373
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:55,050
So there's often people often equate to saying or saying, okay, this is going to be a chapter on mental health.

374
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,090
A lot of times people think, oh, we're going to talk about disorders or we're going to talk about negative mental health.

375
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:06,810
Whereas if we just say we're going to talk about health, people typically think more positive.

376
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:17,170
Would you agree disagree with that? You can totally disagree and say that's stupid.

377
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,580
Probably don't. I think maybe just because we just have. Yeah.

378
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:36,090
Yeah. It was, it was bad timing on my part. Yeah I would agree I think in my yeah we did like ah save class like a word cloud kind of thing.

379
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:42,450
That's like I was like right x number of words that come to mind about mental health and a lot of them were negative.

380
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:49,420
Right. Kind of turn that towards like, how would this be different for like she's like for cancer specifically.

381
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:58,060
Right. You know, a lot more like strength of not survivor as opposed to the words that might have automatically come up.

382
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,920
Right. Yeah, much better exercise.

383
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:08,399
And then when I did, yeah, I was like, I simply use mental health as like a euphemism for mental illness.

384
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,960
Like a lot as it don't like people say like, oh, like this versus having like a mental health crisis.

385
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:19,199
Right? And it's like, well, that's like, yeah, health crisis, but like more of like a crisis in their illness.

386
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:28,020
Like, right. Like I think sometimes like the phrasing that is used colloquially like constructs mental health as like meaning mental illness.

387
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,860
Right. Yeah. Because I mean, yeah, I like mental health awareness.

388
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,180
You know, it's usually not awareness of being mentally healthy.

389
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:41,640
It's more related to stress or the job.

390
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:47,700
All right. Just to raise that attempt at an activity from your mind.

391
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,840
So I didn't want to spend some time talking about your next assignment.

392
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:59,100
Um, so it's scheduled to be due on November 1st.

393
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:12,270
I change the due date to November 3rd because we're a little bit farther behind and people need a little more time.

394
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:15,870
Talk to me and Akilah and and we'll see what we're doing.

395
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,210
Are you able to see what's going on?

396
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,960
But for this next assignment, what you're going to do is you're going to develop the outline for a public health intervention.

397
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:35,910
Now, again, similar to the first exercise you are going to, your assignment is going to be in bullets.

398
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:42,870
So bullet points. So at this point, you're not getting to like, you know, having to create full paragraphs and things like that.

399
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:48,180
Again, we want to get at what you're thinking and get rid of the fly.

400
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,840
So I want you like just hit to the point in this.

401
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:59,700
You get to pick whatever public health issue you want and also what other population so that the public health issue

402
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:11,490
can be any type of health related concern or issue that would warrant an intervention to improve health and wellbeing.

403
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:16,020
And again, any population. So when you develop this,

404
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:25,950
you need to really apply what you've learned so far in class discussions and readings and you have to incorporate two components.

405
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:37,080
So one is power related processes, so oppression, power, privilege, liberation, and then the other is some kind of critical strategies.

406
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,770
So like critical thinking, critical reflection, critical consciousness, critical pedagogy.

407
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,680
And we did this a little bit in one of the classes.

408
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:54,000
So that was to kind of give you a taste and get you to just start getting used to how to actually incorporate things.

409
00:42:54,690 --> 00:43:00,580
So. In each section, there's five sections and I'll show you the outline in a second.

410
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:05,650
This is on canvas, too. So it's been up there for a while.

411
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,759
We just haven't brought it up in class. The first is the description.

412
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,490
So that's where you give us enough detail that we understand what it is you're you're proposing.

413
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:23,500
The second is the rationale. So in the rationale, you provide a strong rationale for your choice when when applicable.

414
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,740
So when writing the rationale, be sure to again integrate power and critical strategies.

415
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:39,910
Again, here, where we're more interested in what you're doing and why you're doing it than fully developing all the nuanced aspects of it.

416
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:46,389
So if you're going to maybe we've been talking a little bit about eating today.

417
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:54,550
If you're going to do a group related to food and take one of the activities,

418
00:43:54,820 --> 00:44:04,420
maybe something where you critically analyze why there might be less access to healthy fruits and vegetables in their neighborhood.

419
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:13,660
So looking at what are the structural forces, what are the oppressive forces that may be leading to a lack of access to healthy foods?

420
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:19,210
Part of the intervention could also be with the critical strategies working with

421
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:27,909
leaders and City Council to try and get more markets in their geographical

422
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:37,870
area to get access or to change bus lines so that people have public transportation from their home to places where they can get healthy food.

423
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:44,229
All right. So it's not just basic health education where we're saying you should eat fruits

424
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:49,060
and vegetables and they should be these colors and shapes and things like that.

425
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:57,750
But we want you to go deeper. So this is basically what it'll look like, the public health issue.

426
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:06,880
So the description and the rationale about 1 to 2 bullets, the population focus again, 1 to 2 bullets.

427
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:14,920
Those seems to be relatively easy. You're just explaining your population and why you're choosing them, the intervention objectives.

428
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:22,790
And we're going to talk about smart objectives today and then the intervention activities.

429
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:28,270
So what you're actually going to be doing the intervention objectives about is about what you hope to accomplish.

430
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:35,170
And I'll show you what I'm what we mean by objectives. And then the activities would be what you would actually do with the participants.

431
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:39,939
And then the last is limitations. Additional comments. This can be in following text.

432
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,069
So if when you were putting this together,

433
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:47,500
you were really struggling with some aspect or you think that even though you developed a pretty good intervention,

434
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:56,410
there's still some limitations with this. Your budget is the sky so you can spend as much money as you want.

435
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,600
We know that's never going to happen in real life, so enjoy it now.

436
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:10,480
So some intervention objectives. I mean, I feel like, you know, I'm always hustling in public health to try and get money.

437
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,000
I was just doing it this morning trying to get money for a living.

438
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:19,150
You women in Kenya just like always feel like, oh, money let me to you about.

439
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:22,570
But it's kind of the reality of how we can get our funding.

440
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:26,980
So an intervention objective might be after the intervention,

441
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:36,430
95% of diabetic participants will be able to create healthy meal plans with their family that reduce their intake of salt, sugar and fats.

442
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:45,579
Another one might be one month after the intervention. 50% of participants who are recovering from a stroke have participated in at least

443
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,900
three organized recreational activities at their local neighborhood center.

444
00:46:51,310 --> 00:47:00,010
Another By December 15, 2022, 75% of participants who scored below a ten on the 60 that's a measure that assesses

445
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:04,480
depression will continue to be free of any major depressive symptomatology.

446
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:08,500
And these represent primary, secondary, tertiary prevention.

447
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:16,930
Some of these represent just attendance at things, and some represent the actual changes.

448
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:25,360
Like here you're actually changing your meals, so you're learning how to create the meals.

449
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:34,810
The second part is about the second objective is about people who are recovering from a stroke actually going and getting services.

450
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:39,280
And then the last one is more about maintaining positive mental health.

451
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:46,960
So a score below ten on the CAC would indicate well-being and positive mental health.

452
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:51,490
And so this one is about making sure that those people maintain that level.

453
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:55,090
Any questions about those? I'm going to go into more detail about how to construct.

454
00:47:55,870 --> 00:48:01,460
As well. And then this is from the assignment.

455
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:06,110
From the assignment guidelines. The assignment guidelines are pretty long if you haven't looked at them.

456
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:15,140
And I give you a lot a lot of detail. And so before you ask questions, I would look at all the detail because a lot of it is there.

457
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:20,360
So this is just an example of what you might write for your intervention activities.

458
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:24,229
So here's one objective.

459
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:31,129
So one month after the HPV vaccination intervention, 75% of prayer community, social justice,

460
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:36,200
school students between the ages of 11 and 14 who had not previously vaccinated

461
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,330
been vaccinated for HPV will have received their first dose of the vaccine.

462
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:47,629
Another objective for these activities would be eight months following the HPV vaccination intervention.

463
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:57,200
60% of CSJ students between 1114 to not been previously vaccinated will receive two doses of the vaccine.

464
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:04,790
So their very detail again will go through what a smart objective is in terms of intervention activities.

465
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:11,630
So this is just one example because you want your objectives and your activities need to match each other.

466
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:15,980
So you have your activity should address your objective.

467
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:19,520
So they should always be in alignment. And again, don't freak out.

468
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:25,070
We're going to continue to talk about this process. So for the first one,

469
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:31,700
two group based intervention sessions for adolescents aged 11 to 14 and their parents will be held after school on the grounds of FC.

470
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:39,590
That's yes and will be facilitated by a health care provider and an older adolescent who's received the HPV vaccine.

471
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:45,710
And that's an example of counseling and education. So the first session will be held with the parents and adolescents separately,

472
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:51,229
and the second session one week later will be held with the parents of adolescents together.

473
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:56,959
During the first issues of power and parent, adolescent relationships will be explored and parents will be encouraged to

474
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,010
engage in power sharing in order to facilitate collaborative decision making.

475
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:05,870
These sessions will be focused on critical reflection regarding parents, adolescents,

476
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:12,530
conceptualizations of HPV, including information, misinformation about its causes and consequences.

477
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:17,629
Through critical group dialog, participants will learn about the HPV vaccine and its health,

478
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:20,600
promoting benefits with an overall goal of encouraging parents and adolescents

479
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,800
to come to a collective decision to have the adolescent receive the vaccine.

480
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:30,950
These sessions will include interactive activities that will credibly examine societal messages

481
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:36,740
about HPV and other activities and promote dialog between parents adolescents about the issues.

482
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:41,600
Sessions want to promote a greater understand the need for the HPV vaccine, the increase in motivation to receive.

483
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:48,950
At the end of the second session, health care providers will be available to offer the HPV vaccine.

484
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:52,670
For those parents and adolescents who do not wish to have the vaccine,

485
00:50:52,820 --> 00:51:01,700
they will receive a free voucher to visit and agree to receive a free voucher for a visit to receive the vaccine.

486
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:08,090
And then six months after the intervention, one of the group facilitators will call all the parents who participated to assess whether

487
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:12,980
or not they received their first dose and to remind them to receive the second dose.

488
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:23,780
So this goes through and gives you very detailed information about what would be in this intervention right now.

489
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:31,610
You may be looking at me like, Oh, [INAUDIBLE], I can't do that. Just you can. And it doesn't have to be as super, super detailed as this.

490
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:42,139
But this is I mean, this would be an example of an A. So, you know, if we got something like that, that would be, I think, an exemplary one.

491
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:47,330
But there's also different ways that it could look how many people have done smart objectives before.

492
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:59,389
All right. Cool. So smart objectives are very integral and public health and something that are you don't

493
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:04,370
need to be you are you will use for if you stay in this field for the rest of your career.

494
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:12,560
So the SE stands for specific. So you need to talk about the who and the what are the activities.

495
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:18,620
Use action verbs, avoid verbs and have vague meaning.

496
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:22,790
So as much as you can get all the detail in there, that's important.

497
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:32,570
So as you saw in some of the other ones, when I gave very specific detail about who, what age group, all those details, they should be measurable.

498
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:42,410
So if you notice in the objectives too, we talked about 75% of participants or 10% of participants,

499
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:52,639
and then also being able to measure certain things like did they did they go to get services three or more times?

500
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,750
That's measurable or a score on a measure like the CAC.

501
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:04,420
Achievable, so they should be attainable given the timeframe and the available resources.

502
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,889
This is hard because you haven't done public health interventions there.

503
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:14,080
Most of you haven't. So it's not always easy to know what is attainable.

504
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:20,680
So do your best. And just thinking about this logically and knowing what you know about humans.

505
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:29,049
So if you have an intervention where you're you're meeting with people like two times, let's say,

506
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:36,130
after some type of religious service to have a discussion about a particular health issue,

507
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,990
you're probably not going to see life altering changes from two meetings.

508
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:45,670
Right? Whereas if you are spending a lot of time with the person,

509
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:55,630
let's say you have 14 sessions over the course of three months and phone follow ups, you can expect a bigger change.

510
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:58,990
So make sure it's achievable. Also realistic.

511
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:07,510
You want to make sure that you're accurately addressing the scope of the problem and what you're going to do.

512
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:16,269
Also, you want to think about what is the goal of your intervention so that the goal of your intervention is to maintain

513
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:23,110
a particular level of health and functioning that is very different than if your goal is to change something.

514
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:28,600
You know, in public health, we often either increase something, decrease it or maintain it.

515
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:39,800
So think about what your goal is. Are you trying to increase some things or are you trying to improve on patterns of substance?

516
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,840
Well, something's missing now. You don't know, okay?

517
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:50,590
You're going to improve abstinence from certain substances in different situations or you're going to improve,

518
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:55,120
exercise, improve, maybe positive thoughts,

519
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:03,430
things like that decrease things like problematic substance use, decrease, maybe self-destructive behaviors, other things like that.

520
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:09,639
And maintain is, again, if you're at a state of positive functioning,

521
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:16,379
however that is defined by the community, you may want to that may be your goal and then also time phase.

522
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:21,360
So that's why in the objectives too, you want to say by a certain time.

523
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:27,430
So it could be after the intervention because you don't know when you're going to necessarily deliver the intervention,

524
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:36,430
or it could be three months after the intervention if it takes a while for that fact, or you can give specific dates like some of them had as well.

525
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:47,990
Any questions on what the smart means? And then I have a little diagram that helps make it all easy for you to reference.

526
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:51,549
Okay, so this is I don't even remember.

527
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:59,920
I found this a long time ago, but it's it's a really nice structure for creating smart objectives.

528
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:07,570
So the first one is when. So by December 2022, after the intervention, one month, one year.

529
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:14,200
Now, people, you can write smart objectives in different ways, just as long as all those components are there.

530
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:20,800
So some people will start off their smart objectives with a date of completion.

531
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:26,290
So by this time, others will put it at the end. But this is just a, I think, a useful framework.

532
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:30,940
So the second is how much? So let's hope so.

533
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:38,380
By December 22nd, let's say 10% and then ten, 10% of who?

534
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:42,499
So 10% of the participants or people enrolled employees.

535
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:47,950
And obviously students will do what? Be able to demonstrate how to prepare low fat meals.

536
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:53,800
They will explain the difference between the exercise of physical activity and stop smoking, be able to list of risk factors for skin cancers.

537
00:56:54,400 --> 00:57:03,700
So to me, this helps break it down a lot easier about when, how much, who and what are they going to do?

538
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:13,180
Is that simple, easy? Right. And then up here again, just.

539
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:19,370
You want to make sure what specific who and what how much change is expected?

540
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:28,130
Can it be accomplished given the resources constraints? Does it address the scope of the health problem and proposes reasonable steps?

541
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,520
And does it provide a timeline indicating when the objective will be met?

542
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:36,800
So that is it? Yes.

543
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:41,450
So, of course, we'll be making an intervention.

544
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:45,440
Mm hmm. You know, like that pyramid from the first.

545
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:50,720
Yes. So, like, the first three are less specifically mentioned base.

546
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:54,170
But if we want to use the bottom two, that count.

547
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,060
Yeah. Yeah. It's always going to be measurable. That's always the tough thing for those.

548
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:08,059
Yeah. I mean, you know, sometimes you can do like probability sampling where you go out in a specific area,

549
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:13,430
like let's say you're trying to change your attitude toward depression and

550
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:19,339
there are sampling strategies where you can do is like do what's called random

551
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:30,320
digit dial calls where they randomly call a certain percent of a population and then try and make an assumption changes and attitudes based on that.

552
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:39,180
So you can get at some of the higher level factors by measuring them with some different strategies, but it's really hard to change.

553
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:44,070
So how do you change a whole community's views? How do you, you know, get rid of racism?

554
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:48,770
But how do you get rid of poverty? Things like that. But yeah, I'd say go for it if you want to.

555
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:55,370
You can you can do it in any part of the pyramid, any part you want, and you can bring in different parts too.

556
00:58:55,880 --> 00:59:00,230
So there could be one component that is higher in the pyramid and one in front of this.

557
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:07,820
Lower the pyramid. Yeah. Well, would it still be an intervention if it's a policy change?

558
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:13,250
Yeah. So that's always a tricky thing. So policy is an intervention now.

559
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:20,600
Policy change is harder to bring about and it's not usually time limited like what we typically think about in public health interventions.

560
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:29,479
So with that, what it could be is let's say that you have a group that is learning how to do policy change and

561
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:35,720
maybe working with elected officials on creating the policy so the measurable things could be,

562
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,270
you know, had they met with elected officials,

563
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:47,360
how they created policy, brief materials, things like that, actually measuring whether or not the policy change that may be three years down the road,

564
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:52,940
but whether you could do is measure the activities that would then result in a policy change.

565
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:59,080
Sure. Yeah. Because a lot of two with a lot of different health outcomes, it's really hard to measure them.

566
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:04,490
You know, like in general, you know, feel that I spent my life in HIV.

567
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:10,660
We very rarely are able to measure. Do our interventions change HIV transmission?

568
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:20,030
We can look at indicators of that like unprotected sex, or we can look at like within communities what what the rates look like.

569
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:24,550
But it's hard to know, like with that one person, did we did we change that?

570
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,220
Yeah. It was focus within the U.S. and it could be global, too.

571
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:31,820
Yeah. It'd be great to see some global projects as well.

572
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:35,600
Yeah. I mean, we want you to pick something that you're going to get jazzed about.

573
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,110
So, you know, something that for you, it's going to be interesting.

574
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:44,780
I know in some other classes you're kind of assigned, you know, either areas or health issues.

575
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:46,350
This is totally up to you.

576
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:54,200
Yeah, I guess like do we need to do any or how much background research to support, like the reason why we're bringing this intervention.

577
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:57,440
Like if you need to show anything like this is why the issues important, right?

578
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:01,350
Yeah. So in the first part when you do the.

579
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:12,280
So in the public health issue, in the population focus, you should give some rationale there.

580
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:21,980
So, you know, it would be good if you're talking about, you know, increasing birth outcomes by using doulas in an intervention.

581
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:27,620
Give the data first on why you picked this population and what those rates are or things like that.

582
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:36,380
And then in the intervention activities, it's not necessarily required,

583
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:42,500
but it's a good idea to see what already exists out there so that you're not, you know, replicating.

584
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:50,060
So we're not asking you to do like a full review, but it's good to check out what has been done so that you're not just,

585
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:56,360
you know, kind of, you know, proposing to redo what's been done forever and ever.

586
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:05,660
And also, it's good to find out what exists and then use that to go to the next level.

587
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:16,310
So I think that with that, it's good to spend a little bit of time at least doing some cursory reviews of what's out there.

588
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:24,250
And I don't remember on the guidelines like how many references or citations.

589
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:29,690
So I don't have that in my brain, but it's all in the the, the guidelines.

590
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:34,850
Any other questions? This should be kind of fun, hopefully.

591
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:45,260
I know your work is never fun by the near the wrong field and you know we're here for you.

592
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:58,850
So if you're kind of struggling with any aspects of the assignment, then come to office hours, shoot us emails, whatever you need to do.

593
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:05,000
So we're not doing a typical CRC today. So sorry, I didn't mean to.

594
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:12,590
And for your girls, if you weren't here last class, we're doing it all back next week.

595
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:17,300
So there's no journals for this at all. So the questions.

596
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:23,270
All right. So I do want to now that you know what the assignment is now,

597
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:28,070
we're going to dig a little bit deeper into some aspects of developing interventions and then do some.

598
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:36,140
You probably won't get to it today, but I'm going to have you do some doing work in place of these areas.

599
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:43,580
So here's a quote from Zainab Salbi.

600
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:50,180
I'm probably pronouncing that very wrong, but being a leader for me is about having the courage to speak the truth and live the truth,

601
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:54,380
despite attempts to silence our thoughts, feelings and past experiences.

602
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:01,980
Right. So just to remind you all, we went through this at the beginning of the semester.

603
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:07,560
So creating a health promotion intervention, we have to think about what needs to be changed.

604
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:16,230
Levels of prevention, levels of influence. Look what exists and think about at what different levels.

605
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:24,960
And then plan the intervention. So you'll be doing all of this as you're developing your intervention for the assignment.

606
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:35,070
We also talk about the the pyramid. So, Camille, thanks for setting this up that we've got the health impact pyramid.

607
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:43,980
When you're thinking about your intervention and again, you can have components at multiple levels.

608
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:50,370
But keep in mind that it's not always realistic to work across multiple levels.

609
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:54,450
You may work across a couple of the levels, but, you know,

610
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:59,760
if you're trying to have a component of your intervention that's at each level, you're going to really be struggling.

611
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:07,409
I know you have an unlimited budget, but it's got to be doable within a particular time frame.

612
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:10,500
So you don't want to have an intervention. It's going to take 50 years.

613
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:17,970
So that's something to consider. We also talked about this before, too, about levels of prevention.

614
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:24,840
So primary prevention is preventing the onset of health issues.

615
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:33,920
Secondary is after there's some presents and tertiary is really more about rehabilitation and literally death,

616
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:39,720
disease, disability can explain what the health problem analysis worksheet is.

617
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:44,580
So we did talk about this. I know people said they hadn't talked about this in other classes.

618
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:50,910
Anyone remember anything about this? I know you have nothing else in your brain because it's the only class you think about.

619
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:59,500
So I expect complete retrieval of all information that was said in a very sarcastically.

620
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:06,120
I think it's even if maybe the the old people didn't get that anyone remember anything about it.

621
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:09,150
It's okay. If you had doubt, we'll go through it again.

622
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:14,390
It was there and all of that. So I guess I know your point to the outcome.

623
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:19,560
And I remember oh, yes, one brave soul on the left side,

624
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:26,220
like the main health problem that you're trying to get and then you put like kind of contributing factors to that.

625
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:29,850
Could you reading that and you kind of can get to the underlying root problems

626
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:33,929
that are more easy to target for interventions to then reach the health program.

627
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:45,750
Yeah, yeah, right. Yeah. It's there is this process to some people using in public health called a root cause analysis which is similar to this.

628
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:51,270
So it's like, well, you know what causes this, what causes that, what causes that?

629
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,850
And then you get to, like you said, like the root causes.

630
01:06:53,850 --> 01:07:00,469
So it's really taking whatever your health problem, health issue is and then looking at direct risk factors.

631
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:08,880
So those are things that are scientifically directly related to the health challenge or health problem.

632
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:18,600
And then the direct contributing factors are things that are established, factors that contribute to the risk factors.

633
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:24,209
And then of the indirect, those are things that are usually more at the community level.

634
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:27,270
So those are usually at the bottom of the pyramid.

635
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:35,970
Those are things that impact the direct contributing factors, which then direct the impact of risk factors.

636
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:42,390
So an example is that we're talking about adolescent HIV infection.

637
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:47,880
A determinant or risk factor would be a medical sex without a condom or prep.

638
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:58,200
So one thing that can contribute to that is substance use, prior sex, and then there is availability of condoms or prep in terms of substance use,

639
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:03,509
prior sex and indirect factor might be easy availability for alcohol.

640
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:07,290
So if alcohol is something it easy to get and lots of people are drinking,

641
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:11,519
it increases the likelihood that people are going to be using that before sex.

642
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:18,299
Also media images glamorizing alcohol and sex and then the indirect for the

643
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:22,200
availability is lack of adolescent friendly prep and or kind of distribution venues.

644
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:28,290
So you may have condoms and prep available, but they're not youth friendly, so people are not going to go visit them.

645
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:35,880
And then mandated abstinence only programs in school, which we have had at different times in the US, depending on who's in power.

646
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:43,990
And then this was just another example with diabetes to show you how complex it can be.

647
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:53,140
And then to sometimes when people do these analysis, they'll include some factors that you may not be able to impact, like genetics.

648
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:58,719
So typically with that, you just stop it there. We're not talking about like, you know, manipulating genetics.

649
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:05,320
So this just shows you, again, how complex things get that we were going to break in two groups that we only have 10 minutes.

650
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:08,530
So I'm going to change it up.

651
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:24,370
So with this, I want you to think about interventions and both the direct contributing factor level and the indirect contributing factor level.

652
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:29,300
Who can come up with a potential intervention activity.

653
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:34,280
What is something that could either like here?

654
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:38,190
Well, that's actually a really easy question. Was substance use prior sex?

655
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:42,490
Do we want to increase, decrease or keep it the same or is right.

656
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:50,150
Decrease good. So what would be? Can you think of an activity that can help to decrease substance use prior to sex for adolescents?

657
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:56,520
Yeah. And one of my other classes we talked a lot about like dissonance based intervention.

658
01:09:56,540 --> 01:10:05,389
So like, you show them like a bunch of media images and then they will like maybe write a letter to a younger teenager and say,

659
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:09,910
like, these are the health consequences that can happen if you engage in this.

660
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:17,000
So they, like associate these images with sort of the negative consequences of engaging in risky behavior.

661
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:24,020
Okay. What's another idea? Something that would help to directly decrease substance use prior to sex.

662
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:37,170
The real simple one. Yeah. Cracking down on fake items.

663
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:42,540
Right. And it's interesting because that's that comes down to here, you know,

664
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:48,340
so it's hard to like just look at this directly without thinking of some of these others.

665
01:10:48,730 --> 01:10:59,740
What is this basic education? Because sometimes adolescents may not realize that when they're using substances that their inhibitions are altered.

666
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:06,670
And so with this, yeah, thinking about the developmental age of our population,

667
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:13,060
they may not really know of all the physiological and and psychological effects of substance use.

668
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:20,260
So helping them understand that association, um, because especially depending on what age of adolescence,

669
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:23,829
there's still maybe a little bit more concrete thinkers.

670
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:27,639
So they may not be able to draw those associations between those.

671
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:32,020
So that's one basic thing that would hit this direct contributing factor.

672
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:37,330
Now, what about easy availability of our adolescents?

673
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:42,430
So we've had one on one intervention. Well, might be another way to decrease that.

674
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:52,330
Well, I'm assuming you want to decrease that. Right? What would be a way to decrease easily easy accessibility of alcohol for adolescents?

675
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:06,310
Yeah, I like that. In some states, like I live in Indiana, they have like a law in place where it's like you're not allowed to,

676
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:13,240
like, touch and stuff like that for like, oh, I don't know.

677
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:23,050
I think like. Probably like. Just looking at some of the accessibility in specific places adolescents might be.

678
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:28,989
Yeah, exactly. So look at where adolescents are getting their alcohol limit accessibility,

679
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:32,980
put it behind the counter, have it in lock cabinets, you know, things like that.

680
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:36,760
Um, another thing that they've done in. Oh, yeah, go ahead.

681
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:40,180
I don't know too much about this, okay.

682
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:54,279
Or if this would be feasible, but I know, like some parents say, that they would rather have their children drink in their house in other places.

683
01:12:54,280 --> 01:13:03,969
So they'll like, I don't know, I had this where it's like give alcohol to their kids or like maybe talk to those parents and like keep them.

684
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:07,540
And maybe that could be a type of intervention. That is true.

685
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:13,299
Yeah. Because yeah. Again, and that's why I like formative work is so important because you need to find out where adolescents

686
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:18,160
getting the alcohol and if it's through these like parent regulated kind of events or things like that,

687
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:22,629
that can definitely be performed. Yeah, it's kind of related to that too.

688
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:35,080
I think that like there's like, you know, that there's like especially with like side of things more so like sometimes people will like,

689
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:43,370
I don't know, children and sex, but like I'll provide the clubs.

690
01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:52,110
Yeah, exactly. But also like being like teach me like responsible practices, you know,

691
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:58,210
that is like also tricky with some parents and people like especially in terms of alcohol.

692
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:01,480
Right. Like like environment and content.

693
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:06,470
Yeah. And I think with a number of different kind of health related behaviors, you know,

694
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:13,719
you also have to decide to are you going to take a risk reduction approach or harm reduction, or are you going to go with an abstinence approach?

695
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:18,580
Because some of those may work for some populations and not others.

696
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:24,490
So I think we often think about abstinence as like absence from sex, but we can talk about absence from a whole lot of things.

697
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:36,700
Yeah, another thing for the easy availability that I had colleagues that did this with alcohol where we were smoking, where they did sting programs.

698
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:47,499
So they worked with the police actually, and they would have research assistants that were under age that would go in and purchase alcohol.

699
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:57,250
And then if they actually sold it to them, the police were right there and then wrote the shop like a fine or, you know, whatever.

700
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,100
But that was actually really effective in some areas with shutting it down.

701
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,689
Yeah, this has more to do with the media images.

702
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:10,360
Yeah. Rising alcohol and sex. The first thing that popped into my mind was euphoria.

703
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:15,010
And if it was up to me, I would just ban euphoria. I think it's terrible.

704
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:25,120
But I think the a really big thing with euphoria especially is like casting like 32 year olds to play high schoolers.

705
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:32,229
And I feel like if you actually casted actual minors, they wouldn't be so comfortable showing like all these,

706
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:37,690
like, sex scenes and like especially with like substance use directly tied to those.

707
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:42,040
So I feel like if they I don't know how you would like regulate that,

708
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:49,060
but just like actually casting people like pretty close to their age so that you're not like so comfortable,

709
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:54,580
like showing these scenes just so, like, out there, you know?

710
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:58,270
Yeah. I've never seen it before. I, I've heard a lot about it.

711
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:04,929
The reason I'm not watching it, because I get really pissed off when I and I feel the same way.

712
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:10,620
Like, you see these shows about adolescence, you've got like a 30 year old, you know, there's playing that well.

713
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:16,299
But I do think that that, you know, that definitely falls in the, you know, the media image is glamorizing this.

714
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:21,610
And, you know, there are ways and we don't do it as much in public health, I think, as we should.

715
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:26,140
But there are ways to work with media industries on these issues.

716
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:36,280
So like, for instance, when, you know, the HIV epidemic was really hitting hard among gay men,

717
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:46,180
the adult film industry regulated so that banning acts of anal sex had to be protected by condoms.

718
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:49,930
And so that was something that the adult film industry regulated.

719
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:54,940
And there's no reason why other industries couldn't do that as well.

720
01:16:55,360 --> 01:17:00,520
You know, because I think that, again, people might say, oh, well, that's just ah, that's just media.

721
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,770
But no, the reality is that people are learning about sex through the media.

722
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:16,660
And there's been a number of studies that documented that adolescents learn more about sex through media than they do from knowledgeable adults.

723
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:23,010
And so this is where people are going. And even with certain groups, they're learning it through form.

724
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:33,250
And so that's why to the erotic film industry, there's been so many attempts for regulation there as well because it's so easily accessible.

725
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:40,060
You know, that's that's people's teacher now, which is kind of a sad statement about society, but it good at this.

726
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:50,140
But I think that we could do a lot more collaborating with different film industries, music, stuff like that.

727
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:58,000
And so we'll stop there, the job and we'll finish talking about this and do the activity on Tuesday.

728
01:17:58,490 --> 01:18:04,420
So no cliffhangers today you rest of the week and not have to worry about what's going to happen.

729
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:13,230
So I think that's really important.

730
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:21,000
You know, our own time. I'm like, Oh, my God.

731
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:27,850
It's like, yeah, every day I was like, What?

732
01:18:27,850 --> 01:18:38,990
It's like it's like, I know what to think.

733
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:45,308
You know what's in it for me? I'm actually.
