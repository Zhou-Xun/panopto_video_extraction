1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:05,340
So today, asked me to speak about some of my work on health disparities and

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,375
health equity.

3
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:09,355
And how that relates to the broader concepts of quality of care,

4
00:00:09,355 --> 00:00:13,289
which is something that I've been working on for a number of years with colleagues.

5
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:17,615
And I think that's a very important part of the movement to improve quality of care

6
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:21,516
in the United States is how do we do that in a way that also achieved equity?

7
00:00:21,516 --> 00:00:25,590
Cuz we know whenever we look at quality across different socioeconomic or

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,252
racial or ethnic groups within the United States, there can be wide differences and

9
00:00:30,252 --> 00:00:32,042
variations in quality of care.

10
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:36,302
And it's important to understand and try to eliminate those differences and

11
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:39,986
raise the quality of care for everybody in our healthcare system.

12
00:00:39,986 --> 00:00:43,333
So what I'd like to do is start out with a few questions that are based on some of

13
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,395
the research that colleagues might have done,

14
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:47,627
looking at disparities in the health care system.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,941
What do you think it's too out?

16
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:57,161
>> [INAUDIBLE].

17
00:00:57,161 --> 00:00:57,953
>> Can you hear me?

18
00:00:57,953 --> 00:01:01,058
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> Okay, we can do without like.

19
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:03,428
So, starting off with some questions.

20
00:01:03,428 --> 00:01:06,940
What I'd like to do is, these are some fairly simple multiple choice questions.

21
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,635
I'll present the question and four possible answers.

22
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:11,932
With each question, take 20 or 30 seconds,

23
00:01:11,932 --> 00:01:14,125
just to sort of form an answer in your own mind.

24
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,074
What you think is the most likely answer.

25
00:01:16,074 --> 00:01:21,089
Turn to the person sitting next to you and just compare notes about whether you have

26
00:01:21,089 --> 00:01:26,117
similar ideas about this or were different and why you may have the answer for you.

27
00:01:26,117 --> 00:01:27,838
And then we'll come back and

28
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:31,141
talk about what the evidence is in each of these cases.

29
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:34,821
The first question is, when we look at the quality of cancer care in

30
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:39,425
the United States, which racial or ethnic group is least likely to rate the quality

31
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:41,679
of their care as excellent or very good?

32
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:45,890
This is from the patient's perspective, [INAUDIBLE] the white patients A,

33
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,852
B Asian American patients, C, Hispanic patients, or D, African American patients.

34
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:53,822
So, take a moment to think about that.

35
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,439
Pick an answer turn to the person next to you, compare notes and

36
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,951
then come back together.
