1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:14,420
OK. We have a little bit more information here to try and get it.

2
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:29,270
For some reason, I'm not getting the whole screen. My helper.

3
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,130
Thank you. There we go. OK.

4
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:43,680
OK, so this is how you get some more information on how you screen respiratory specimens diagrams.

5
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:53,010
So, Gram stain smears a lower respiratory tract specimens can provide, they don't always,

6
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,740
but they can provide rapid presumptive information and you can act or the physician can act

7
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:04,230
on that information as an infection prevention if you may need to act on that information.

8
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,390
Also, they can guide presumptive antimicrobial therapy.

9
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,370
We can identify superficially contaminated specimens,

10
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:20,670
and that also includes the ability to discriminate between those with organisms likely to cause infections and those which are

11
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:29,820
just members of the normal or respiratory oral pharyngeal for the resident flora in the world pharyngeal cavity and the trachea.

12
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:39,930
But bronchial tree are a great challenge to interpreting gram stay and reporting gram stain smears.

13
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:48,060
So if you're for brand news, the strong points of grandstand smears are you get valuable information about host cell types,

14
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:57,120
as I've just been talking about the presence of palm over nuclear leukocytes, the presence of superficial cells.

15
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:06,510
And you also get information about predominant organisms. You can also do an early diagnosis of Senator Barack Obama.

16
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:16,500
Presumptive diagnosis of Acinetobacter baumannii with a gram saying it is a sensitive and specific indicator of nuclear pneumococcal pneumonia.

17
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,170
In one study of community acquired pneumonia,

18
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:25,680
gram stain religious grinstein had a sensitivity of 57 percent and the specificity of ninety seven percent,

19
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,920
which are great numbers for a diagnosis of new streptococcal pneumonia pneumonia.

20
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,600
In the same study, though,

21
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:43,680
the grandstand had a sensitivity of 82 percent and a specificity of ninety nine percent for diagnosing pneumonia due to Haemophilus influenzae.

22
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,730
Once again, great numbers.

23
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:55,820
The authors concluded that the gram stain was highly specific and beneficial in guiding pathogen specific antimicrobial therapy.

24
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:02,840
The grandstand can also be very useful with specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis.

25
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,300
But when you need to assess the quality of the specimen and the workup of potential pathogens.

26
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:15,020
So our cystic fibrosis patients have many more organisms in their respiratory tract.

27
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:25,070
They produce a lot of fluid, build up a lot of white blood cells, epithelial cells, and they're very hard to determine what's going on with them.

28
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:29,000
So, but gram stains are not perfect, they may have some problems.

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,950
So I think I mentioned this on the previous presentation tracheal aspirate for mechanically ventilated,

30
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:45,410
very low birth weight babies, the kind that we see in the ICU may have perilous secretions from the intubation, not from infection.

31
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:51,920
That doesn't mean that you shouldn't aspirate the the fluid and send it down to the laboratory.

32
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,430
But it just means they may not need long.

33
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:04,130
Porcelain and microbial therapy in many other conditions can cause proliferation of leukocytes both in the upper and the lower airways.

34
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:09,260
The gram stain should not be used to diagnose the presence of pneumonia.

35
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:14,300
There are other ways to diagnose the presence of pneumonia. Yes, you can see epithelial cells.

36
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:22,670
Yes, you can see white blood cells. Yes, you may be able to see multiple kinds of bacteria, but you cannot diagnose pneumonia that way.

37
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:28,910
Once then the clinical diagnosis. And there's a lot of other things that go into blood chemistries, X-rays and so on.

38
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:34,070
What the clinical diagnosis has been determined based on clinical parameters for that patient.

39
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:42,740
The grandstand can help to determine the eventual probable eventual etiologic, agent and probable therapeutic interventions.

40
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:52,430
So just because a patient has strep pneumo growing out of their sputum or respiratory fluids, many organisms,

41
00:04:52,430 --> 00:05:01,110
as you know, are resistant to antimicrobial agents and it is necessary to do susceptibility testing.

42
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:09,330
Well, there's as usual, there's some additional issues if you use the sputum culture as a reference standard to which the gram stain,

43
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,280
this compared the sensitivity and specificity will drop.

44
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,670
You cannot compare them. They're not the same thing. Culture is an imperfect standard.

45
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:32,090
They can be compromised by delays in transporting the specimen to the laboratory or, more importantly, prior antimicrobial therapy.

46
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:45,530
One study showed that half the information from sputum cultures is clinically misleading in the absence of correlation with direct gram stain results.

47
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:51,920
So we still need to do screening gram stains, and we have specific criteria for them.

48
00:05:51,920 --> 00:06:02,180
We there are standardized criteria to achieve consistent smear interpretation and establish the quality of assessments submitted for analysis.

49
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,970
But fundamental to this is the premise that an abundance of squamous epithelial cells is

50
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:14,480
suggestive of superficial oropharyngeal contamination requiring specimen collection.

51
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:21,590
However, that's pretty much always true unless it's legionella.

52
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:29,930
So just because there's a lot of squamous epithelial cells, you can't tell this 80 year old man that you've got to request this.

53
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:38,640
It could be a legionella. OK, so you have to proceed on with both recollect and let the current specimen continue.

54
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:46,740
It's also helpful to add an interpretive comment, such as squamous cells in the specimen indicate the presence of superficial material

55
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,060
that may contain contaminating or colonizing bacteria unrelated to infection.

56
00:06:51,060 --> 00:07:01,390
Collection of another specimen suggested avoiding superficial sources of contamination and I would say if possible.

57
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:10,960
So here are criteria for assessing specimen quality by microscopic screening of lower respiratory tract secretions.

58
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:20,680
And there are a number of different authors here. These are all published articles and for example,

59
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:33,190
Marine in Washington in 1975 said enumerates squid squamous epithelial over the lure of pneumonia flora.

60
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:41,420
So enumerates next one innumerate neutrophils in numerous squamous epithelial cells.

61
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:49,840
So there's a whole different list of ways to evaluate lower respiratory tract secretions.

62
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,130
And there's not only one. That's correct.

63
00:07:54,130 --> 00:08:03,100
So whichever institution you're working with, whichever laboratory methods the laboratory is using, you need to know what the method is.

64
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,760
OK. And that's what I mean when I was at Beaumont or when I was with the state,

65
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,920
we sit down on a weekly or monthly or every other week basis and talk about the specimens and problems.

66
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:21,200
And what are we seeing and what can we do to help each other? And that's one of the topics that came up frequently.

67
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:28,180
So going on. Here we have the Q school system and I think are ready.

68
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,280
OK, so the key is zero is no cells, one is one to nine.

69
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,530
LPF, two is 10 to 20 for three is greater than 25.

70
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:45,100
LPF is per a little low power field and so squamous cells versus neutrophils.

71
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:54,850
You have the three number of potential pathogens to work up when you have zero squamous cells and zero neutrophils,

72
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,490
one plus neutrophils and zero squamous cell.

73
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:04,330
You still work up three in the same thing going on down here as you go across to the right for the top two rows,

74
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:09,100
you don't work up any potential pathogens.

75
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:15,370
However, when you get down here where you have two plus neutrophils or three plus neutrophils,

76
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,060
you start in a small number of squamous epithelial cells.

77
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:27,770
You start working them up and this is the Q score system.

78
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:33,440
So if a potential pathogens are less than for you with greater than or equal to moderate normal flora,

79
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,320
potential pathogen work is limited to spot and rabbits with no susceptibility testing.

80
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:48,090
So that would be this area right here. OK.

81
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:58,280
And then, um, another. The laboratory may choose one of these could criteria A, B or C,

82
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:04,630
any one of these to judge the acceptability of sputum specimens depending on local patient demographics.

83
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:09,180
Is a patient from a nursing home. There's a patient, a 16 year old football player.

84
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:15,410
What are the patient demographics? Sputum specimens not meeting any of acceptability criteria should be rejected,

85
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:20,390
so grade them 25 probably more for nucleosomes, less than 10 epithelial cells.

86
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:28,910
Pretty good specimen in my mind. But if you have greater than 25 Poly's and in less than 25 epithelial cells, maybe a good specimen can't really tell.

87
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,170
But if you have less than greater than only greater than 10 Polley's per epithelial cells,

88
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:37,280
or a ratio of 10 to one of a few little cell, that's pretty good.

89
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:44,120
Also so acceptable specimens are observed under a thousand x to twelve hundred and ification.

90
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,100
This is all oil immersion.

91
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:52,730
Blechman all evaluated the following gram stain interpretations and accepted associate them with appropriate clinical conditions.

92
00:10:52,730 --> 00:11:00,320
And here you would report no organism c mixed flora. No one more of a type with greater than 10 organisms per oil field mixed four in which

93
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,760
there are two or more or more four types of greater than 10 organisms per oilfield.

94
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:12,740
One more for type in concentrations of less than 10 organisms for oil field or a one month type in concentrations of greater than 10.

95
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:22,520
I think this type of reporting is confusing to everyone, not only the laboratory staff, but the physicians and the nursing staff epidemiologists.

96
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:28,010
The whole bit. I think, is there are too many ifs here. I think it's.

97
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:34,520
Much more useful to say we have greater than 25 less than 10 if in the middle some

98
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:39,680
place to make a call because the staff of the micro lab don't know the patient,

99
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:50,670
as do the physicians, the nursing staff and so on. So let's get back to the ground saying things are very important.

100
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,420
We review the slides for the predominant bacterial more four types that are

101
00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:00,060
associated with white blood cells and not adhering to the epithelial cells,

102
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:11,500
but a CO pathogen may be present. The stealth stealth organisms, stealth organisms may be fungi could be tbie, could be legionella.

103
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,900
They don't grandstand very well with underwater noise, but not the mold.

104
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:23,050
And there might be multiple microorganisms in a good specimen that may indicate aspiration and aspiration.

105
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:33,240
No more pneumonia. We would not see a lot of polyps, we would see a lot of that fuel cells and a lot of different types of bacteria.

106
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:40,980
And once again, interpretation may be very difficult if the patient has been starved on antibiotics prior to specimen collection,

107
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,030
and the lab may need to put disclaimers on.

108
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:54,250
This type of situation may result in variability in specimen sampling and quantitation should now be reported if the patient has received antibiotics.

109
00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:04,300
But we do report white blood cells. It's very difficult I'd like to have a micro lab.

110
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:17,800
In the U.S. and maybe near, and I see you could do the gram stains, you look at the specimens right away and say this is good, it's not going to reflect.

111
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:26,860
And that is it for this lecture is a lot to think about on the grass stains, on the respiratory specimens.

112
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:32,200
A lot to think. Please, please read those chapters in the textbook.

113
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:45,450
And there have been some people who have asked me about extra credit.

114
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:50,490
And I came up with some guidance, I'm just trying to find it here.

115
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:55,020
Hold on a second. You're right.

116
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:01,830
Oh, they're over there. Oh yeah, OK. Please take one of these extra credit.

117
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:06,700
Thank you so much. I figure I'd put them over here. These are personal topics for extra credit.

118
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:12,160
OK, no more than three pages typewritten or computer written because I won't have that much time.

119
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,730
Dan Dan won't have that much time to be reading these. Well, there's some ideas here for other ideas along the same way.

120
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:27,180
Please ensure that if you have a question about it, email me. OK, I'm grateful for one thing.

121
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:32,460
Any questions? Yes, ma'am.

122
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:39,280
Yes, you are. I just happen to have some exams here.

123
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:49,770
If I look in the right step, step.

124
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:55,830
These are exam to we should have exam three back on Wednesday.

125
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:12,640
Genevieve Genevieve. Mallika.

126
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:23,550
Here. Amina.

127
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:37,150
I mean, again, I mean, it gave me.

128
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:44,170
Maybe you. Are almost identical.

129
00:15:44,170 --> 00:16:09,350
Yeah. Carter.

130
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:22,260
Mohammed. Sarah?

131
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:36,420
Lena. Really?

132
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,140
And that's what you want to find. That's for sure.

133
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:56,180
Sorry, brother. In of. Bruce?

134
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:33,190
Scarlett. And, Tamara.

135
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:46,080
Any other questions, issues? Yes.

136
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:56,550
I think I have it with me and then hold on, let me look. I do not have a key with me, but we can next time.

137
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:15,650
OK. What is?

138
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:30,810
He. I think.

139
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:47,780
Any other questions? OK.

140
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:59,670
As far one. Yeah, we just thought, yes. I just.

141
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:03,940
Yeah. Because look it up.

142
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,410
Yeah. Oh, I just looked it up, but factors even.

143
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,730
OK. Did I do wrong? We can fix that.

144
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:20,860
If you missed one, if you missed that one, that's specific one.

145
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:31,050
Will you throw me an email or come up after class and I can make a list of people needs one point at it and.

146
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:45,670
I don't like this the. Are the questions that you circled include ones that you threw out?

147
00:19:45,670 --> 00:20:16,860
You are the ones that. And those that don't know.

148
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:43,800
Yeah. And that's what I was trying to hear and the questions.

149
00:20:43,800 --> 00:21:08,610
So. So.

150
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:14,478
Virulence factors that.
