1
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:16,000
So imagine you wanted to conduct a study on your friend group to see how exercise relates to how much your friends weigh.

2
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,590
You can imagine that some of your friends are in there willing to participate.

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,950
Some are never going to be in. They're never going to be willing to participate.

4
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,280
And some might say yes, but back out at the last second.

5
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,220
Now to get an accurate picture of the real relationship between exercise and weight among your friends,

6
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,930
you'd really need some good tricks up your sleeve to boost participation and

7
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,400
make sure that whatever sample you get is representative of the full group.

8
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:50,740
Alternatively, if you were able to sample some subset which you know enough about them in order

9
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,660
to estimate what you would have seen if only all people had participated.

10
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,560
In this particular video,

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:06,390
I'm going to walk through different methods that we often use as epidemiologists in order to minimize selection bias in the design phase.

12
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,660
So thinking about those tricks to make sure that people are both participating and not being lost over time.

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,180
So in order to think about this question,

14
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:25,150
we really should remind ourselves of how we get the right answer in a study population when we're sampling some subset of the full population.

15
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:34,120
The way that we do that, as we must recruit and retain people without respect to their outcomes and their exposures,

16
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,860
if we're able to do that, then we will introduce no bias.

17
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:47,060
Now thinking about that helps us to frame what types of activities we can do in order to prevent

18
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:52,850
loss at the end of the study or differential participation at the beginning of the study.

19
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:04,159
So let's start first with recruitment. The first place and most obvious place to start is that we really need to use the same inclusion

20
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:11,330
and exclusion criteria or the rules for how people get into the study among our different groups.

21
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:17,299
So in a cohort study, it's critically important that we don't change the way in which we recruit,

22
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:27,870
are exposed and our unexposed population and we certainly don't have that recruitment related to their risk of the outcome in a case control study.

23
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:33,290
Recall that the recruitment of cases and controls must not vary by exposure.

24
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,760
Now let's start by thinking again about the case control design.

25
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:44,340
Remember, there are certain populations that are known to often introduce bias.

26
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,049
So, for example,

27
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:53,970
you may recall this notion of a Berkson bias where you recruit hospital based controls to another population that's being hospitalized.

28
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:01,140
As your cases. And the trouble comes out is because often hospitalized people have different

29
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,430
exposures than the general population that likely gave rise to the cases.

30
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:12,870
And in that way, you're introducing selection bias by sampling your controls based on their exposure status.

31
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:22,580
Now what other strategy that's very nice for pretty much all designs is to try and keep the barriers to participation low.

32
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,620
And what do I mean by that?

33
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:34,070
Well, I mean, either making it easier for them to come to the clinic, you know, making the office hours open on weekends and nights.

34
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:40,220
If you have working people in your population offering people rides to get to where you need them to be,

35
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,400
it can also be just making it much more fun for people to participate so that they want to be part of the study.

36
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:55,700
The main goal there on either way you look at it is really just to make sure that you're not only recruiting the most motivated

37
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:02,930
individuals either because they're exposed or because they're at higher risk of the outcome from participating in your design.

38
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:09,980
Now, sometimes when we're worried that it's hard to figure out if we have the right control population,

39
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,180
you know, when you're doing a case control study, it can be very challenging to think,

40
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,589
you know, is this group really representative of the population that gave rise to the

41
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:22,310
cases or is there something else about them that might track with exposure?

42
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:31,610
We will sometimes use more than one comparison group in order to understand the associations between exposure and our outcome.

43
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,960
So the idea effectively is let's say you were worried about your control population with respect to their exposure.

44
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,240
You know, you had hospital based controls.

45
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:48,200
You might then go out and recruit controls from a different setting to make sure that you had two different groups.

46
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,180
You know, hopefully both of which you're expecting are unrelated to their exposure.

47
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:58,550
If you get the same answer between those two comparison groups in your cases, for example,

48
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,600
then it might give you greater confidence that there's no selection bias present.

49
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:09,980
Now, of course, this is not a fail proof solution because it's possible that both of your control populations were selected with bias.

50
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,590
But hopefully, you know, you're able to at least get one that makes good sense.

51
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:25,420
Now on the flipside of selection bias due to biased recruitment is the bias that we can occur due to loss to follow up.

52
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:26,620
In other words,

53
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:34,630
are there certain people who are more or less likely to be exposed and more or less likely to get disease who are just not returning to our study?

54
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,779
Now, in order to prevent loss to follow up, there's a lot of fun techniques that you can make.

55
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,160
Effectively, what you're trying to do is to lower the bar for participation,

56
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:52,000
make it easy for your participants to continue to participate and also to really make them happy to do so.

57
00:05:52,540 --> 00:06:00,940
So, for example, when I was doing my dissertation research, I was working in a population of 45 older adults in St Louis,

58
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:08,260
and part of our study meant that we were recruiting people to sit on busses while we drove around and traffic in and of itself.

59
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:14,680
Not all that much fun, but what we did as we drove them to lunch, we took them out to lunch, we would socialize with them,

60
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:21,820
you know, we bought them special jackets that had logos of the study on it really to help foster,

61
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,509
you know, a group mentality and,

62
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:34,570
and really show them our gratitude for their contributions and make them feel like participation was important and valued over time.

63
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:42,340
Similarly, just like with recruitment, you know, it can be that over long periods of time,

64
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:50,140
it becomes more and more challenging for people to stay involved because their health is starting to decline or they're moving around.

65
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:57,640
And so we can use similar techniques that we use for recruitment in terms of helping people get to the clinic or moving

66
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:06,250
our surveys into phone or online settings so that really people are able to participate over the long term more easily.

67
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:15,280
So in conclusion, selection bias is a critically important concept that we must really be keeping track of from the start of a study.

68
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,780
When we recruit people into our population all the way through the end, when we're trying to retain them through the end of the study.
