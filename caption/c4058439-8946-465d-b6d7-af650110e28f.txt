1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,990
It should be good now. Okay, great.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,989
So I hope that you remember that I am Carol Shinn and I am your information as IEEE librarian at the Travel and Health Sciences Library.

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:21,510
So if you have any questions about library resources, databases, anything that's on this guide and beyond,

4
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,050
if you're doing research and you're having problems finding stuff,

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,780
just let me know there so that there's a lot of information on this guide,

6
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:38,280
which I hope you also familiar with, but what you going to be talking about today?

7
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:50,510
It's like this. So as anybody actually started looking for seriously or and or applying for where if you're willing to share, you don't have to.

8
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,710
But I don't have a consulting company. Okay. Sounds like they would probably pay you.

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,780
Well, you never know, because some do and some don't.

10
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:10,570
I was I have an MPH from Michigan and I was offered a fellowship at.

11
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,980
Um. What is it? The way the White House Office of Public Health.

12
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,920
But it was unpaid. And so I couldn't take it up because I just couldn't afford to go to D.C.

13
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,150
You know, my friends who actually lived in D.C. but were with State Department,

14
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,890
did over in Japan or someplace, had been home then I would have been sick.

15
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:37,240
So yeah. So sometimes there are these wonderful opportunities that you just can't make work.

16
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,430
So if you think that might be in your horizon, you just want to be prepared.

17
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:58,300
There are several places that you can look for money and the school has a very good page here for where you can get some help.

18
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:04,150
Um, let's see if this is still the same. I looked at this yesterday, you know, financial aid.

19
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,030
So, yes. Um, contact your department.

20
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:15,879
This is especially. You might just want to see if they have anything had.

21
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:22,150
Sometimes they'll just be able to give you a few hundred dollars. But that can be the difference between taking and not taking something.

22
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:30,550
There is also, um, I don't think if we have rec, we do have rec him here,

23
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:40,080
but the overall admin for most graduate schools actually does have some funding.

24
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,110
So you can just do it. See?

25
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:54,100
Yes. I come?

26
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:06,109
No, they don't have a lot. But it is worth looking at.

27
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,410
And this changes, um, it can change year to year.

28
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:26,480
But I actually found funding for a student, I think either in HSR or effort, who, whose internship was one part of their master's thesis.

29
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,540
And in that case, there was funding for that she could apply for whether she got it.

30
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,099
Of course, there's always another question. So there are a couple of things that you can look for.

31
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:44,030
I, I, it's good to just, um, see funding.

32
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:53,210
Yes, you can filter in different ways and I hope you know that there are emergency funds because sometimes things happen.

33
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,530
This happened to me, actually.

34
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:02,239
I got money from the Center for the Education of Women because a job fell through, um, unexpectedly, and then it came back up.

35
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:09,800
But there were, there was about a month in between there that as a student you don't always have a lot of money there.

36
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:18,440
So if you have an emergency need for cash, um, yeah, I just went there, got my couple of hundred dollars in for so much better for that.

37
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:23,330
Rackham also has a graduate student emergency funds.

38
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:35,889
But look through here and just look to see if there is yes, if there is anything that is useful so we can say,

39
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:46,850
if nothing else, we take a master's and then internship if it will let you link to that.

40
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,020
Let's see if we take that off. He said happier. Okay.

41
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,590
It is not hap here. So. Um.

42
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:02,490
Masters and see if there is anything here.

43
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:11,620
And it's really willing it's it's really good to just be willing to look at everything that is available.

44
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,479
Now, if you're not going to study in France, you can tell right away that that is probably not for you.

45
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,080
But perhaps that will also encourage you to look for an internship in France.

46
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,100
It all depends. But you can.

47
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,500
See, for example, if you want to go outside the U.S.

48
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,270
International Research Awards, go into learn more.

49
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,579
You see the date that things are. Do you want to get your application in right away?

50
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,730
Because there are all sorts of other people who want to get this same money.

51
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:56,240
Yes. Yeah. So I thought that we weren't eligible for our master's program.

52
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,440
They have huge programs in public health, and we must do that.

53
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:10,060
Hmm. Right. Right. That. I don't know. Um, because I know that when I applied, it was through record.

54
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:17,500
So it's. It's worth checking out. I personally interesting, weird overlap.

55
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,930
And sometimes they're really strict about them and other times they're not.

56
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:27,879
So if you see something, it's always worth sending the email to be like, I'm an unpaid student at the School of Public Health.

57
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,890
I know we don't typically, but is there any way I could apply?

58
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,690
Yeah. It is always worth sending that email because all they can say is no.

59
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,900
And then you know for sure and you're not beating yourself up for not at least trying something else.

60
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,610
So the standard places to get funding are we've got this very nice.

61
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,140
Database called Pivot and we've got some others as well.

62
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:02,500
But this is where I would go because it's it's really the easiest one to navigate.

63
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,240
Let's hope it still is. Um, databases change.

64
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:14,600
It interfaces a lot and it's not always for the oh, this is this is so much better than it used to be.

65
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:23,300
Uh huh. Uh. Yeah. Sometimes they change it for the worse because I don't know why, but there it is.

66
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:30,920
So as with databases and other things,

67
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,920
it's always worth if you're interested in more than a one time dip into this because maybe you're

68
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:45,080
planning to get a Ph.D. or you don't know it's worth setting up an account just so that you can save,

69
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,640
as it says, track and share opportunities, save searches, get automatic alerts.

70
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,480
And unfortunately, I can't remember what my.

71
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:06,030
Login information is specifically my password, but it's always worth doing that because it takes a minute and you've got many more options.

72
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:14,700
So. So my brain being sort of, um.

73
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,810
And I'm not even like I'm going to start off with a single word.

74
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,620
So you get to see that there are a lot of options.

75
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,730
A lot of them, let's see, are not going to be useful for you.

76
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:41,430
But again, if you're planning on continuing academic career, whether it's here or elsewhere, it can be useful just to know about these things.

77
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:48,240
Yes. Stockholm Water Prize. So you can look at recently added um,

78
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:55,110
limited submission that has to do with the number of people from an organization who can apply for that particular category.

79
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:06,300
Um, but yes, you might go for scholarships, training or bursaries, and that gives you much fewer.

80
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:14,600
And just again, click. It can do.

81
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:23,660
So there are these options from the Canadian Water Resources Association, so there might not be a lot of Canadians in the room.

82
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,330
But you look to see, yes, your applicant needs to be in Canada.

83
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,790
Citizenship needs to be Canada. But reads a read the details that is important.

84
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,050
So Canadian citizens are turning to Canadian universities.

85
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:48,180
So that's not good for us. But there are a lot of things here that and you just won't know until.

86
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,640
You look. Unspecified.

87
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,970
This is one water institute conducting research in water science field.

88
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:11,530
So if this sounds like you look more into what it can do for you, the deadline is almost here, 20th of December.

89
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,520
And. There's your first one.

90
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:23,280
I was once able to find for $500, which is all somebody needed to conduct a focus group.

91
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:30,810
So there were these and it was the organization was headquartered in Ireland,

92
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,180
but they funded anyone around the world and they had a number of these $500 going.

93
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:43,370
Pools of money. And that came at the end of an hour of searching for things.

94
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,020
And so that was great news. But.

95
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:55,850
So you want to do is just look and see if any of these you can either just keep looking and looking to see what they say.

96
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:05,560
A lot of them have upcoming deadlines. You can also use individual graduate students.

97
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,980
Because you want to be able to be a graduate student instead of moving again.

98
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,760
There are. Probably not. Foundation procurement and inland waterways traffic.

99
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:29,560
You can also do it. See what happens when you click on this.

100
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:35,570
Okay. That's just the same for new search results. They used to have.

101
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,080
An advanced search. And you can also do language currency.

102
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,390
Go by like water pollution if that's what you want.

103
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:53,530
Or check more these language.

104
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,470
Thunder. Okay. Um. Interesting that I'm not seeing the.

105
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:09,730
Home. Got it.

106
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,350
There it is. Yes. Okay. So. Yeah, that's nice.

107
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:28,250
Okay. So you can do a lot of things and you could ex ask it to match all of the fields or any fields.

108
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:39,280
And then you could just all rise and let's see, what are the options?

109
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:45,940
Abstract Title Thunder. Um, and it could be noise or.

110
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:55,180
And in this case, you would probably want synonyms of noise or if you were noise and something else that was the main topic.

111
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:03,760
Um, and it also helps if you can yes.

112
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,330
Type I can spell but I, my typing is getting really bad.

113
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:16,280
Hurt. Purchases.

114
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,500
So let's see if. I generally like to do the.

115
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:33,050
Okay. Yeah, I'm not surprised about that. But I generally try to do a very basic search and then use the filters because that is.

116
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:42,110
Um. Yes. Yes. Very, very helpful. Okay. So if you're interested in noise, then there are 29 results.

117
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:49,100
Again, you want to see. Oh.

118
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,330
Ships or, um.

119
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,390
Graduate student. And the end result.

120
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:03,350
But again, look at each one and see.

121
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:12,230
Yeah. If there's a ton of money in it and it sounds like it's gonna work for just that, then you're probably not in the right doing the right thing.

122
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes, $30,000. But anyway, if you're interested in architectural acoustics and noise control, there is a $30,000 reward available for that.

123
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:32,240
It is, however, not public health. Um, let me go back and see if we can do.

124
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:42,790
Public health. And see if this helps now.

125
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,770
Okay. That's really interesting.

126
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,180
Public program with public employee. Yeah. Yes.

127
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,219
That's it. So. And know that you can also use quotation marks.

128
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,240
And this is probably just to see what's going on.

129
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:14,590
Yeah. What? This does not do a really sophisticated search.

130
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:22,239
You can in addition to searching by those fields, if you're looking for particular funder amount deadlines.

131
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,719
So you can't you feel you just can't put an application together until January.

132
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,920
So you're going to be looking for deadlines that are past December applicant institution.

133
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,170
So you can find all sorts of things that way.

134
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,929
Going to be a good one. Yeah. Yes.

135
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:53,390
Because if. If you don't have your U.S. citizenship, that can be really an interesting problem.

136
00:15:53,870 --> 00:16:00,140
So you can say unrestricted or despite or actually put a country in.

137
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:07,399
So, yes, the nice extensive list, if you're from Albania, I sort of doubt that anything will be there.

138
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:14,450
But yes, you can. And you can add more than one item of funding type.

139
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,490
Again, you can look right here for artistic pursuit, clinical trials.

140
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,610
Fellowships and post-doctoral awards. Let's just make sure.

141
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:39,510
Okay. That's good for scholarships. So you can put a lot of the filters that are on the main page, um, right here if you want to.

142
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,850
So I put one filter on. Okay.

143
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:48,960
That's it. Yes. Uh, you can also just try public health.

144
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:02,130
And that gets you a lot of things. And again, we learned probably this.

145
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,220
And it gives you 54 so you can see a variety of options.

146
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:20,720
University of Toronto. And again, it gives you everything that you can you can do, if not more.

147
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:28,040
And it also has a link to the website so that you can find even more information, which is really useful.

148
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:33,150
And again. See, we've already got full details.

149
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:41,190
There are other databases that you can use.

150
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,620
There is internship opportunities for students.

151
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:58,020
From this particular organization. I haven't looked at this.

152
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:07,110
I think that's one thing that. Yeah, you say that that is I meant to ask my colleagues if they had done that.

153
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:14,550
They've gone through. Yes. Um, so I will try to do that so you can look at these other databases.

154
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:25,540
And look for all federal funding. But any time you're looking for grants, it really is slow, steady.

155
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:34,520
Um, and you have to take, take the time to, to search and search in multiple places so you can look.

156
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,110
By agencies. Oh, they also have YouTube videos now.

157
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:45,139
Um. Get started. Okay. So, um, how to apply for grants?

158
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:54,530
Make sure you're eligible before applying. Yes. Um, then you can search for professional federal funds, which is useful.

159
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,240
But this is grants don't give is only federal funding.

160
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:06,980
If you want to see more broadly based, pivot is really the best place to go.

161
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:17,840
Uh, again, foundation directory online is going to be going through a rather, a somewhat painful list of organizations.

162
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:32,650
Okay. Okay. Um. Okay.

163
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:51,850
Okay. And so you can see where you can find money, who who's giving out money.

164
00:19:51,850 --> 00:20:01,299
And then you you can then you have to go to the websites to actually apply for them.

165
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,910
And you can see recipients, which is can be nice. Let's see.

166
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,800
Let me see if they still. This changes so often.

167
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:25,000
You can look at their tax forms if you want to. So you have more information than you probably want to see.

168
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,690
And we probably don't want any of the tax forms. Okay.

169
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:39,790
Um, and indeed, the foundation directory, in my experience, doesn't have a lot of information or see.

170
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,920
Yes. Let's see. Just looking broadly.

171
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:07,060
For anyone who funds graduate student internships, you can look at this list and again,

172
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,330
then go to their website and see if this is where you want to go.

173
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,230
Looking for money is not fun or very interesting.

174
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,100
In fact, it is a slog.

175
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,840
If you are interested in continuing in research.

176
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,950
This is just a taste of what you get to do. But it's not.

177
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:38,160
Not all day. Every day. But you will have to spend quality time with these databases of so again, associations and organizations.

178
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,890
Does Robert Wood Johnson do anything for you?

179
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,590
You can always go and say. And they also.

180
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,770
Program. History of this program. Yeah.

181
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:06,630
Okay. Yeah, I need to. I need to see. This was created by colleagues of mine, I think with covered a lot of things.

182
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:15,420
Stop. But you can always go to the main page because the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has.

183
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,390
If I can. Okay. Poor.

184
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:38,850
Okay. And yes. And just see.

185
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:47,980
Funding opportunities. Yeah.

186
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,870
Pretty active or closed.

187
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:59,250
So if you want to see what they have done, the reason you might want to see closed funding opportunities is if you see what they've done in the past,

188
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:04,300
see if there's anything that you're doing that they might. Um.

189
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,090
We'll do it in the future. So right now, not a lot.

190
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,550
Um, it's. It's, you know.

191
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,890
And. Okay. Compound fellowship.

192
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:25,460
Scholarships and internships. Okay.

193
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,660
So this is a list of.

194
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,670
These fellowships. And again.

195
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,830
A variety of things, including the February International Center.

196
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:51,300
Okay. I want to I will have to have a talk with Kate and Judy about this.

197
00:23:51,630 --> 00:24:00,420
But if you think of an organization that you know is interested in the same things that you're interested in,

198
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,600
it's always worth looking to see if they have any funding.

199
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:09,580
Is anyone thinking of doing international research? Okay.

200
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:17,590
Um, there. There can be funding. Um, so again, uh.

201
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:23,070
This. Fogerty, Philbrick. Fogerty Blues Foundation.

202
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,240
So here's a listing to see if this is working.

203
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,590
Yes. Okay. This is from our colleagues up at MSU.

204
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,010
It has a list of things and you can search.

205
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:46,689
So there we go. So this lets, you know, look for the terms here that will be useful for you.

206
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:54,350
And then you can go back to their database source and. And actually search by that.

207
00:24:54,910 --> 00:25:03,350
So, yes. If anyone is doing global health, global health people can have funding.

208
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:10,730
And this is particularly. Focused on international funding.

209
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:18,300
We have some tutorials. Do we still have spin?

210
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,680
I don't think we should have a, um. Yeah.

211
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:30,190
Ignore spin. I think that's something that we've dropped. It was even harder than, um.

212
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,240
Pivot once in the tapes. To. To work. Work on.

213
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:38,020
And didn't it bring you anything that was any better? Um.

214
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:45,399
Networking is always good because you don't know who will be able to show you the way to find money.

215
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:53,590
Because thing it's not just finding an internship, it's actually finding somebody who might have some money for you.

216
00:25:54,670 --> 00:26:02,800
And then what's really important is writing resources because you really do have to think carefully about if you're going to apply for funding,

217
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:08,110
you have to think very carefully and apply and be as professional as possible.

218
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:17,290
And if you haven't done this before, and I'm assuming that's many of you, then, um, take advantage of the speech letter writing lab.

219
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,340
Um, and.

220
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,389
Here we go. So there are different resources for that.

221
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:40,129
But I would just get an appointment with Kirsten and in the early on and just say, this is what I'm trying to do, this is my topic.

222
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:47,810
This is where I'm trying to apply for money. Can you give me any ideas on what to do?

223
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,010
And it's much better to get some help sooner rather than later.

224
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:59,840
Do not wait until the last minute. Um, we also have some information on, just, on just formatting here, but that's up to you.

225
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:05,810
But this, um, we've got books, links to books that help with that.

226
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:11,930
Um huh. And some of them are even online, which is even better.

227
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:17,540
And, yes, you don't have to be getting, um, you might not need to look at the huge,

228
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:23,960
um, grand writing, but like the foundation center and grant writing application.

229
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:29,840
Um, and successful grant writing are some books that may be very, very helpful for you.

230
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:38,190
So here in the School of Public Health, we're really lucky to have our own writing center.

231
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:42,560
Yes, I think some of the larger Grantham resources don't apply to MPH.

232
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:49,790
So please, you know, you guys, you can help with anything that they are writing.

233
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,490
Yes, yes. Absolutely anything. You can use the Sweetland writing center.

234
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:03,770
They don't they don't mind. They don't they don't seem to look at exactly where you're coming from.

235
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:09,560
But when you've got somebody right here in the building, you might as well go and use them.

236
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,870
So and as I say, really get help sooner rather than later.

237
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:20,360
And if you find writing of any kind difficult.

238
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,960
She may have some help. I have some ideas for how you can make that easier.

239
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:32,410
One thing is to just practice writing. If you don't keep a journal, this might be a good time to do it.

240
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:37,390
Because part one of the things that makes you a better writer or a more fluent writer is practice.

241
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,880
And this would be a journal that you actually go back the next day and do something.

242
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:46,120
Oh, I would edit and edit what you wrote.

243
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:52,060
It's not just so you can make it better, so you can get into the habit of doing that.

244
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:59,020
It's also good if you've got a writing buddy or have have a writing group where you could all get together

245
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:05,530
on occasion and either just share your writing and where you think you're having problems and get feedback.

246
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:11,770
Or it can be a way of saying, if you're having trouble writing, you just want to put it off.

247
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:17,080
It can be a way to make sure you get at least some writing done because you've got this meeting at

248
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:23,860
8:00 because that's before any of your other classes or 5:00 because it's after your other classes.

249
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:32,649
And yeah, I have done that when I've gone up for promotion and there is a lot of writing involved in that.

250
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:43,300
And it was just very handy to have that time always on my calendar and sometimes we just talked about how hard things were.

251
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,680
But most of the time it was a really good way to find help.

252
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,570
And actually talking about how hard things were at that point was really a way of.

253
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:57,610
When you tell somebody else, that is better than just telling yourself things are really hard.

254
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:03,380
It just makes a difference and can be very helpful in getting you started writing.

255
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:13,450
The props program, which is from this part of effort and a really is focused on international folks.

256
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,620
Has some interesting videos on writing.

257
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:26,160
And how did you get started writing? Uh, let's see.

258
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:50,510
There is a lot. I don't know if anything is going to be here.

259
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:57,710
I know. Just actually go to Twitter because this is where this is where I see things.

260
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:11,760
Yeah. But yeah, there there are a lot of helpful videos on writing and just because it's really focused we're at an international.

261
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:18,630
Audience whose native language is not English doesn't mean it's also not helpful for you.

262
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,230
And if English is not your native language, it will be especially helpful.

263
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,980
Um. Yes. Do not.

264
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:34,560
I do not do what? One of my professors in which he he told his international students to write it first in your native language and then translators.

265
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,179
No, no, no. One thing you get from being in a foreign country is fluency in writing,

266
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:45,640
which means as painful as it is, you start writing in that language and then get better.

267
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:53,100
Yes. Because when one person actually did that. He spent 24 hours on his his exams, which is the normal 8 hours.

268
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,330
And I saw him the morning after he stumbled into the building.

269
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:01,830
He really looked like he'd been up for 24 hours. So don't ever do that.

270
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:07,920
And if you ever have the opportunity to work in another country, in another language,

271
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:16,410
take that opportunity to actually get your speaking and your writing up in that language better.

272
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:28,079
So, yes. And if you're not on Twitter, um, yeah, just search for a lot of August writing Twitter and you will see her,

273
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,370
her videos and her tips and I highly recommend them.

274
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:37,159
Does anybody have any questions? I know this is a lot of it's it's sort of a lot,

275
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:43,580
but it's sort of a lot of mushy stuff saying that here are some places to go and they are not easy to search.

276
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:58,069
And, and it's not fun. And, uh, but it, and I know that it is challenging as a master's student if you're looking for,

277
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:05,270
if you actually have to get funding but get it sooner rather than later, apply sooner rather than later.

278
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:17,090
Um, on the other hand, I know people who've gotten internships in May, so if all else fails, something, things do pop up at the last minute.

279
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:23,270
So that's what you need. Um, you need to secure an internship first.

280
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:27,070
Or can you just be like, I'm applying for something and.

281
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,350
You at least have to know about the internship.

282
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:41,080
You can't just apply saying I am a master's student in this area and I want to get an internship in this area.

283
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:45,360
Please give me money. You at least have to have looked.

284
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:53,129
So you've done enough work that you can say you applied and so that you can say that with confidence because you've gone through the

285
00:33:53,130 --> 00:34:02,790
organization's website enough so that you know what they what they need and want and that the funder will match what that organization is.

286
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:13,700
Because that's the important thing, is that the opportunity, the funding opportunity and the organization that gives you the internship have to match.

287
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:17,190
It can't just be sort of in general I would like to get funding for.

288
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:27,420
I mean, it's very it's very rare that you get something like work study where if you're eligible for work study and can find a job, you get the money.

289
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:34,450
It's not that straightforward, which is unfortunate. Yeah.

290
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,960
Um. So I don't have anything else to say.

291
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,040
I am. If you ever get lost,

292
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:59,380
feel that you're lost and just would like to have me go through one or more of these with you on your topic and see if we can find anything.

293
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:04,270
Um, just let me know, because I do that for people, because it just.

294
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:09,550
It just seems like a lot, and it's always more bearable if somebody else is helping you.

295
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:14,530
Um, even if the answer is is no, it's still you.

296
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,720
You feel confident that you've. You've tried.

297
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:27,070
Um, and I know it's hard having to do your school coursework and apply for these things at the same time.

298
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:31,719
But yeah, again, I think that's something to just acknowledge because it is.

299
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,870
But that's just how life works at the moment.

300
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:44,210
If you don't have any other questions, even other questions about anything related to libraries.

301
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:52,820
Um. We can stop and I'll give you.

302
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:59,590
10 minutes. Ten. 11. Ten. 11 minutes for coming in.

303
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:07,360
Prime Minister and Library Services.

304
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,900
You want to come talk to her more? Thank you so much.

305
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,790
Please do. I.
