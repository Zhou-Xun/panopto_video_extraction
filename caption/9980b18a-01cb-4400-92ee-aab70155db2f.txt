00:00:09,293 --> 00:00:12,304
Hello, welcome to this lecture
on inference of binary and

2
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,100
categorical outcomes.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,900
In this lecture,
we'll focus upon on odds ratio and

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,200
how it is used to compare two proportions.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,100
Now discovering new risk factors for
disease always entails comparing the risk

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,100
of disease between those groups who have
the risk factor and those who don't.

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,200
Now when we have a value
such as the sample mean or

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,000
a sample proportion for
each group, often we're

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,400
used to comparing those two numbers by
subtracting their values from each other.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,942
And we call this an absolute difference.

11
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:44,378
However, proportions are more
commonly compared to

12
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:49,900
each other through their ratio,
which is known as a relative difference.

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,100
And it is this ratio that we use to
quantify how different the two groups

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,200
are from each other.

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,500
So our learning objectives are first to
understand what odds are in relation to

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,000
a probability.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,400
To understand correctly interpret an odds
ratio, to then understand how a chi square

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,000
test of association can be
expressed using an odds ratio.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,400
And then to apply the concept
of a 95% confidence interval

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,900
to a population odds ratio.

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,319
Now recall in our prior example,
we had two populations of infants.

22
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,300
We had a control population and
an intervention population.

23
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,100
We had samples of data
from each population.

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,563
And in the control sample, we have 36
infants, ten of whom developed carries for

25
00:01:30,563 --> 00:01:32,243
an observed rate of 0.28.

26
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:36,010
And in the intervention sample,
we had 68 infants and

27
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:40,352
six of them developed carries for
an observed rate of 0.09.

28
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,095
Now each of these rates can also be
transformed into a quantity we call odds,

29
00:01:46,095 --> 00:01:52,000
and odds is the ratio of any probability
to 1 minus their probability.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,976
So for the control sample,
we have an odds of 0.39,

31
00:01:55,976 --> 00:01:59,456
which is 0.28 divided by 1 minus 0.28.

32
00:01:59,456 --> 00:02:06,200
Again, we say that the control sample had
an odds of 0.39 of developing carries.

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,179
This number is not a probability.

34
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:11,900
It is a ratio of two probabilities.

35
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,126
Likewise, the odds of carries in
the intervention sample was 0.1,

36
00:02:17,126 --> 00:02:23,672
which is the ratio of 0.09, the observed
probability divided by 1 minus 0.09.

37
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:30,169
Again, this number is not a probability
but is a ratio of two probabilities.

38
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:35,069
It is these numbers 0.39 and
0.10 that we compare to each

39
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:40,700
other when looking for
a difference between the two samples.

40
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,900
We take the ratio of these two odds,

41
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,400
creating a quantity
known as an odds ratio.

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,300
And it's through this odds
ratio that we make inference

43
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,100
to describe a difference
in the two samples.

44
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,000
Again, the data from
the study can be summarized

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,900
in a two-by-two contingency table.

46
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,600
Each row represents who
belongs to which group and

47
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,600
each column represents who had
the outcome and who did not.

48
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,025
The second row in the table describes
the control sample, and in that sample,

49
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:14,900
ten out of 36 or
0.28 of the sample head carries.

50
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,868
So the odds of carries is
0.28 divided by 1 minus 0.28.

51
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:23,494
Again, giving us an odds of 0.39,
and the first row corresponds to

52
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:29,000
the intervention sample, which had
a rate of 0.09 which was 6 over 68.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We take this rate of 0.09,
divided by 1 minus 0.09,

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,400
giving me an odds of carries of 0.1.

55
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,981
We then take these two odds for the two
groups, and we compute their ratio.

56
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:46,170
And first we can take the ratio of
the intervention odds to the control odds,

57
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:51,400
which is 0.1 divided by 0.39,
and that is 0.25 or one-fourth.

58
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,700
And again, this describes the odds of
carries in the intervention arm relative

59
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,600
to the control arm.

60
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,501
So we could say that the odds in
the intervention arm is one-fourth or

61
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:06,700
25% of the odds in the control arm.

62
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,800
Now just as we can subtract
two numbers in either order.

63
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,672
We can also divide
the numbers in either order.

64
00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:18,220
So we could also compute an odds
ratio with 0.39 in the numerator,

65
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,500
0.1 in the denominator,
which leads to in odds ratio of four.

66
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,050
However, this odds ratio
is interpreted differently.

67
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,908
It is the odds of carries in the control
arm relative to the intervention arm.

68
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:34,700
Again, 0.25 and
4 are reciprocals of each other.

69
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,400
Regardless, both odds ratios

70
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,200
tell us that the control arm is
more likely to develop carries.

71
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,300
They have four times the odds
than the intervention arm.

72
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,200
Now we can also do inference
using these odds ratios and

73
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,600
go back to our chi square
test of association.

74
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,100
And we have the following
hypotheses in this test.

75
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,900
The null again stated that developing
carries is independent of receiving

76
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,300
the intervention.

77
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,100
And we saw that if the null is true, that
means if the two populations have the same

78
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,800
probability of carries, so
that P1 is equal to P2.

79
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,720
If they have the same probability,
they must have the same odds and

80
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,103
therefore their odds ratio must be one.

81
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:17,951
So the null hypothesis in the chi-square
test of association states

82
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,754
that the odds ratio must be one.

83
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:21,302
Likewise, in the alternative,

84
00:05:21,302 --> 00:05:24,800
we said that carries has
an association with the intervention.

85
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,561
If that's true,

86
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:28,720
both populations have different
probabilities of developing carries.

87
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,200
And therefore they must
have different odds.

88
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,721
And therefore the ratio of their odds
must be something other than one.

89
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:39,467
And if you recall from a previous
lecture from the data we had,

90
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:46,200
we did a chi-square test of association,
and we got a p-value of 0.009.

91
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,400
And because this number is less
than our threshold of 0.05.

92
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,379
We reject the null hypothesis, and because
we've rejected the null hypothesis.

93
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:58,900
We've stated that the odds
ratio is not one.

94
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,900
And therefore, there must be
an association between carries and

95
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,200
whether they receive the intervention.

96
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,700
Now, corresponding to any p-value,
there is a 95% confidence interval for

97
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,900
a population quantity.

98
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,100
And this case we can compute a 95%
confidence interval for the odds ratio.

99
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,200
Now, the formula for the 95% confidence
interval is not some estimate plus or

100
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,400
minus two standard errors,
like it was in previous lectures.

101
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,400
The formula is more complicated and
is not presented to you.

102
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,600
In any case, the 95% confidence
interval corresponding to these data

103
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,200
is an interval from 0.08 to 0.78.

104
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,144
Again, the null hypothesis for
the odds ratio is one, and

105
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:47,213
one is not inside this
confidence interval.

106
00:06:47,213 --> 00:06:51,400
All of the values in the confidence
interval are to the left of one.

107
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,716
Therefore, I would reject
the null hypothesis.

108
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:59,414
Now, what if we wish to compare more
than two populations with respect to

109
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:01,888
the probability of a binary outcome?

110
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:05,952
If you recall in previous lectures
when we had continuous outcomes,

111
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:07,423
we went from a t-test for

112
00:07:07,423 --> 00:07:12,800
two populations to a nova when comparing
the means of more than two populations.

113
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,339
We can also extend the chi-square test of
association that we have just covered to

114
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:19,395
compare more than two populations.

115
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:24,202
However, the test is still called
the chi-square test of association.

116
00:07:24,202 --> 00:07:29,849
The computations are slightly different
and will be covered in a future lecture.
