1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,600
Okay, so today in this module, we're going to be talking about self-care.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,570
And I want to point us back to our four different dimensions, and we're going to talk about how they all fit together.

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:24,140
So the biggest piece that overlaps here, is that our self-care is going to be specifically based on what we learned about ourself and self-awareness.

4
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:32,150
So everything we talk about in this module depends on being checked in with yourself, and what you need in the moment.

5
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,790
And we'll see more of how that works.

6
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:43,290
So when you think about self-care, my guess is that something along the lines of this picture pops up in your mind.

7
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:53,260
Things like spa days, and mani pedis, and facials, long vacation somewhere, maybe tropical and sunny and

8
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,540
you might be, I don't know, pleasantly surprised or disappointed that that's not exactly what we're talking about.

9
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:03,620
We're talking about something kind of more practical, more daily,

10
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:11,280
and more effective. Let's talk a little bit about this idea of self-care and maybe what some of the limitations are.

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,200
A lot of people, when they think about this idea of self-care, they think well that's not for me, because I don't have money for that,

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,390
I don't have time for that. And they also tend to think, I don't know how that really helps with things I've been experiencing day-to-day.

13
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:31,560
You know, if you think back to the module on collective trauma, you know, if you're struggling through dealing with COVID,

14
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:41,890
struggling through academic challenges, struggling through dealing with racism in the world.

15
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,210
And so we're going to talk about self-care

16
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:52,600
that is kind of more robust in what it can do for us on a day-to-day basis,

17
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:59,740
and that is accessible to everybody. One of the things with self-care is that I think why some people don't feel like it's for

18
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:05,320
them is because self care existed before it kind of got taken over by the wellness industry,

19
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,420
that's a big money making industry.

20
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:18,100
So we're not trying to make our self-care look like something out of a commercial or something that requires an expensive yoga subscription.

21
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,170
Those practices may not even be things that you see people that look like us, doing.

22
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:30,860
And so we're going to figure out self-care that it's for us specifically.

23
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:39,060
Part of this in figuring out how to make it fit for you, you may have to kind of ask yourself, what did I learn

24
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:46,880
by my role models, by my family members, people in my cultural group about self care.

25
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,560
A lot of us have ideas like, well, I haven't done enough to earn it yet,

26
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:58,400
so I can't take a break yet or, you know, I've had to work twice as hard to get just as much,

27
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,550
so I can't take breaks or that's just like that's not for me.

28
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:09,320
That's like other people, people with money or things like that.

29
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:20,090
And so what can be useful if you've inherited, absorbed some of those ideas, is looking to both your culture or some of your

30
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:27,860
role models and seeing who is talking about this in a way that is consistent with my values and that looks like me,

31
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,970
so I can kind of begin to get ideas of how to do it and also know that it makes

32
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:37,680
sense and that it's valid for my own value system from my own perspective.

33
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:45,150
So when was doing some of this for myself, some of the people that I think of, Serena Williams has talked about this,

34
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,650
how important it is to take care of yourself and to take time off.

35
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:55,590
And a lot of high level athletes take their rest days in their off-days as serious,

36
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,270
if not more than the times when they're working out because they understand the two go

37
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:07,680
together, that being successful consistently means having ways to care for yourself as well.

38
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,850
This is a quote from Audre Lorde, one of my heroes saying, caring for myself is not self-indulgence.

39
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:20,440
It is self-preservation, an act of survival. She also talks about it as resistance.

40
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:27,390
So for a lot of activists, even like when we want to change the world, like a lot of people in public health do, it can get really busy in that work,

41
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:38,070
and we can't forget that caring for ourself is a part of actually making that work effective over the long haul.

42
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:48,590
Another quote from somebody that I really look up to, Maya Angelou. She says each of us needs to withdraw from the cares which will not withdraw from us.

43
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:56,110
We need hours of aimless wandering or spates of time sitting on park benches, observing the mysterious world of ants

44
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:11,320
and the canopy of treetops. So both of these women put out there for us that self-care is essential, that it is needed.

45
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,080
Now what it looks like for each of us is going to vary, and we'll talk more about that.

46
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,650
Here you hear her talking about, what I would call mindfulness,

47
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:28,970
and we'll talk more about what that means. But basically, just being in the moment, having time that feels unrushed, having time out in nature,

48
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:35,420
having time when we're not thinking at a really analytical level, that we're able to just relax and be.

49
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:41,740
And Maya Angelou, most of us know her and was very successful.

50
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:51,650
So I think we need to, if we have the myth that we can't push ourselves hard, achieve a lot, produce a lot and engage in self-care and take breaks,

51
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,590
I think we've got to look at some of these, like if Serena Williams can take breaks and have self-care,

52
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:08,780
then I think any of us can. So here are some of the things that make the self-care that I'm talking about distinct from kind of that, what

53
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:14,780
I sometimes call a luxury Band-Aid like the like I mean, I'm all for vacations and spa days when you can get them,

54
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:20,350
but they're not the same purpose as what we're talking about here. Here are some of the things that distinguish.

55
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:30,580
The self-care that we're talking about is embedded in social support and collective care, we exist in a really individualistic culture.

56
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,980
That is like if you're tired, work harder. And self-care can become another task

57
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:42,600
item, like ugh I didn't go for a walk today, I didn't drink water today, and none of us need

58
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:50,130
more to-dos that make us feel bad about ourself. Oftentimes, we need more support from our social support system.

59
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:58,950
So if you think back to when I talked about the idea of a hammock and we'll talk more about this when we get that section,

60
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:03,210
we need people who we can say like, hey, can you go on a walk with me?

61
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,450
I need an accountability buddy. Like if I don't have somebody doing it with me,

62
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm not going to get it done. Can we cook together? Can we do things together?

63
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,650
And sometimes we're literally at a place where we need somebody to kind of help and do some things for us.

64
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:31,160
And so the idea of self-care, is not that it by itself is enough, our self-care needs to be embedded in social support.

65
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,420
By itself, individualistic self-care will be insufficient. We'll be

66
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,600
on E and like not even interested in trying to do that

67
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:45,270
one more thing. The other thing about this type of self care is that, like we just talked it out,

68
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:57,020
we want to find how people with our value systems and culture have been doing self-care forever, long before it ever became a whole wellness system.

69
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:04,080
So this should feel like just everyday practices that make sense to you.

70
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:11,440
And so that could be, crafting, that could be singing or listening to music, that could be being out in nature,

71
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,170
it should be things that don't cost a lot of money that are accessible to everyone.

72
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:25,570
I often think of self-care sometimes like what's the everyday size and then what's the VIP package, like every now and then you can do it.

73
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:33,380
It's also, it includes cultural practices. So that's why it's not just a one size fits all.

74
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,360
Think about what do you do in your family that restores you, refuels you?

75
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,990
What do you do when your friend groups? What do you do that makes sense for you?

76
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,870
Even within maybe your, if you have a faith system, what do you do there

77
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:57,190
that refuels you and restores you? So your self-care plan is going to be specific to your needs.

78
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:03,200
Back in the area where we talked about self-awareness, once you've checked in with yourself and you see what you're carrying,

79
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:10,190
what you're holding, what you need, you're gonna want to come up with self-care strategies that specifically help with that.

80
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:17,880
And we'll talk a little bit more about what that looks like. You're also going to want to say, okay, in this moment,

81
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:26,170
what can I do? Because right now you might be in the middle of a really busy week, and there may not be time to take a whole day off.

82
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,690
So how can you take mini breaks throughout your day? How can you take breaks throughout your week?

83
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:36,160
And what do you need to do in the time that you're taking those little breaks that are going to be helpful.

84
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,770
I sometimes tell people, if you've got to push through a week,

85
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,090
and have really minimal self care, sometimes

86
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:55,260
that makes sense. In a finals week, our self-care is going to look different, than if we're on a spring break or on a summer vacation.

87
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:00,110
But you still need to figure out what are the bite sized pieces we can do at that moment,

88
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:07,190
and during that busy season? We can't put it off for months, because our system will be too run down and defeated.

89
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:15,200
And it almost won't even matter if we have two weeks off, because we'll just be trying to get back to zero and then start running again.

90
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:23,340
So just, you know, I've used the example of flossing a lot. This has got to be a consistent practice, just like that.

91
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:29,040
The thing, too, is that we often think if I take time off, I'm going to be more behind.

92
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:40,440
And what the research has shown is that taking breaks, naps, sleeping, all of those things actually help our brain to integrate information.

93
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,280
It restores our energy so we're more efficient.

94
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:49,540
Like in other countries where there's a four day work week, as opposed to a five day workweek, they actually produce just as much.

95
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,920
So time that we're working is more efficient,

96
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:59,160
when we're practicing self-care, and we're actually decreasing the likelihood that we're gonna get sick or

97
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:05,460
just get burned out because those things can really put us off track for productivity for a while.

98
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:12,270
So this is a kind of maintenance that decreases how often we're having that kind of interference.

99
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:25,210
So we do it because we're human beings and we need it, and we deserve it. There is the added bonus that it actually, usually makes us more productive.

100
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:30,230
So the last thing that we'll kind of emphasize here, is that self-care is multidimensional.

101
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:36,250
That's another reason why it's not just bubble baths and mani pedis.

102
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:41,290
You can see here the main dimensions that have been identified.

103
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,470
So if you think about emotional self-care,

104
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:53,650
this may be where you're talking with friends about your day, where you're journaling, where you might be meditating,

105
00:11:53,650 --> 00:12:00,580
where you might be going to YouTube to watch funny videos or TicTok to watch funny videos just to kind of cheer you up,

106
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:07,350
get some laughter in your day. Physical self-care, this is getting your body moving,

107
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:12,010
dancing, just doing things that feel good in your body.

108
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:18,480
But also things like making sure you have annual physicals.

109
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,520
The intellectual and the professional are probably really overlapped right now in your life.

110
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:30,330
The professional is just kind of having a sense of what you want to do and making sure that you have a plan and are moving in that direction,

111
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:38,880
that you're showing up in those spaces, and that you're making sure that your career goals actually fit for you and are motivating.

112
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:45,080
And, because it's harder when we feel like we're doing something for other people, for reasons that are not our own.

113
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,050
So we want to check in on that, the intellectual piece though, sometimes has nothing to do with your academics.

114
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,940
There may be just things that really you geek out on, comic books,

115
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:03,270
or the things that you want to know more about, reading fiction novels, things like that.

116
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:10,150
The spiritual dimension. I want to be clear with this one that this actually has no requirements of any kind of religious affiliation.

117
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:19,930
A lot of people define spirituality as our sense of connectedness to each other globally, to nature, to anything

118
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,480
that's kind of bigger than us, that gives us a sense of purpose, hope, meaning.

119
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,570
So sometimes just sitting down and thinking about what that is for us,

120
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:36,260
can help in this dimension. And sometimes engaging in different practices, like meditation, or religious

121
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:46,030
events, or just even book clubs that are about growth and hope and meaning can be really useful.

122
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:58,350
Even some things like music that feel really transcendent. A podcast can also be a way to kind of get into this and even the intellectual domain.

123
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,670
Financial.

124
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:06,600
So this can be a big one, especially young adulthood, and especially when people are trying to figure out like why should I take this student loan.

125
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,900
And once I get it, how do I budget it and make sure that it lasts? What grants are available?

126
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:20,190
But it's often a time where people are starting to learn about how to begin to take care of the money that

127
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:25,890
they have and set themselves up so that they have a little bit of a buffer when difficulties come up.

128
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:34,440
And this is often a place where talking with your local bank or even some of the universities have people who can

129
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,900
kind of advise in this domain or credit unions to just give more information that we might not have had available.

130
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,600
So we can have plans that make us feel secure and like we know what we're doing.

131
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:51,030
So social is I mean, it probably sounds straightforward.

132
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,860
Make sure that we're taking care of our friend groups, our family groups,

133
00:14:53,860 --> 00:15:00,240
so that we feel connected and we have places to show up and connect with people that make us feel good,

134
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,360
heard, seen, valued. Again, we are not meant to be an island.

135
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,510
Some of us only need one or two really good friends.

136
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:16,620
But we want to make sure that we're showing up in spaces that feel nourishing and good to us, and that we have enough of that.

137
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:23,300
And the last one is enviromental. And this can be things like how cluttered is your your room and your desk?

138
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:29,180
And is that helping you feel full, whole, nourished?

139
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:34,470
Do you need pops of color in the room that helped boost your mood? What's the lighting like?

140
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:40,900
Is there windows? But it can also be about do we feel safe in the space that we're in?

141
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:47,710
And if not, are there ways that we can get more time in spaces that do feel good to us?

142
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:54,970
So, you'll see that there's going to be a self-care questionnaire that you can fill out.

143
00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:00,900
And again, you can follow different people online, you know, just hashtag self-care, and

144
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:07,840
you'll get lots of different ideas about what to do. But it's important not to just try to have a smorgasbord.

145
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:14,020
It's important to go back, like we talked about, checking in with yourself twice a day for two minutes.

146
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,680
What do I need right now? Which of these domains do you feel like,

147
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,160
oh, these are going really well for me right now, I don't necessarily need to focus on them, I just need to maintain?

148
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:32,010
And what one or two dimensions are you like, yeah, I really need to kind of boost this area, because I feel like it would help my wellbeing a lot?

149
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:38,060
And once you identify the area, then figure out a few bite sized strategies

150
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:47,870
to add in so that you're intentional. Keep in mind, you want to have some regular things, but you also want to sometimes think in the moment,

151
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:53,230
what do I need right now? Continue to work on this,

152
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,986
think about this. We want this part to become second nature.
