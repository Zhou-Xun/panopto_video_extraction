1
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,290
So those are some really interesting points that you make about how jazz fits into the health care

2
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:19,150
system and then also the public health infrastructure that exists here in the United States.

3
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,700
I wonder if, as we kind of transition into a discussion about finance and budgets,

4
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,460
we can explore a little bit more about how jazz as an organization is structured.

5
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,870
Every part of the health care system is, in fact, an organization.

6
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,429
And I imagine in your role overseeing the stewardship of the organization's

7
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:45,050
resources and financing is really a key part of what you have to do day to day.

8
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,400
So maybe share with us a little bit more about how some of that works. Sure.

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,579
So Chaz's $11 million budget,

10
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:57,490
a little over $11 million is primarily financed through a grant that comes from the Health Resources Services Administration,

11
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:03,670
the federal government, down through the Bureau of Primary Health Care, which is about 30% of the overall funding.

12
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:11,920
And that grant allows us to provide services primarily to our uninsured population, of which I think we've mentioned almost 50%.

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,210
Then the perspective payment system that allows us to get extra funding for Medicaid patients that we see,

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,990
Medicaid patients are roughly 32% of the population.

15
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,680
So we get the same Medicaid reimbursement that a private doc would get.

16
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,459
Then on top of that,

17
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:38,410
the prospective payment allows us to provide all of the comprehensive services that we don't get reimbursed from the insurance companies for.

18
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:43,640
And so the challenge continues to be because have for our populations uninsured.

19
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,450
And we do get some help from the federal government doesn't cover everything.

20
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:58,420
So we have to strategically use efficiencies and strategies to maximize our Medicaid

21
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:07,660
dollars as well as perspective payment so that we can continue to operate.

22
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:22,120
It's been a challenge, but 50 years now we've learned how to how to kind of manage the economic challenges and then continuing to push and

23
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:31,419
advocate at the state at the federal level to make sure that the over $5 billion that the federal government provides

24
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:41,140
for community health centers continues continues to be reauthorized and continues to grow because the goal is to

25
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:49,390
continue to expand services either through those new centers or through added services in the current centers.

26
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,810
So when we're talking about financing and budgeting,

27
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:59,740
I think one of the really important pieces of that is, of course, assets and what Chaz's assets are.

28
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:08,410
So maybe we can talk a little bit more about Chaz's assets, what some of those strengths are, and how they play a part in Jazz's operations.

29
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,720
Sure. So our most important asset is this building that we're in today. It's seven years that we've been here now.

30
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:22,420
It's a 48,000 square foot, $17 million state of the art facility that was funded through new market tax credits and brownfield tax credits,

31
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:31,960
which had us bring about $10 million to the table of which the first 3 million were given or donated by Henry Ford Health System.

32
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:42,850
The building is almost paid off. We have a little over a year and a half left and we're down to less than $350,000 that we have to pay,

33
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,620
which includes not just the building structure, but includes all the equipment inside of the building.

34
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:57,069
And the community has really taken the initiative, as well as us, to make sure that the building is here for the next.

35
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,730
It was put up around 40 years for the next 40 years.

36
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:08,980
And so if you as you're going to see when we go through the building, the building looks almost as it did when when it was opened in May of 2012.

37
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:16,150
So that being our main asset, the next very important asset is our human resources.

38
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,980
So all of the 118 individuals that are working for the center right now,

39
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:30,640
of which is a challenge based on the fact that about 70% of our population prefers Spanish over English.

40
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:40,660
So we have to make sure that we're able to communicate, at least if not communicate as well as know the culture when we're interacting with patients.

41
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:48,610
So human resources is a very important asset to the center and sometimes a challenge

42
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,530
in identifying different positions individuals that are at least bilingual,

43
00:04:53,530 --> 00:05:01,600
if not bilingual and by cultural. So building then on some of these areas related to finance, you mentioned human resources.

44
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,330
That's another really important part of some of the things that we'll be covering throughout our course.

45
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,900
Maybe share with us a little bit about some of the different areas related to human

46
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,990
resources that jazz has to contend with and work on throughout its day to day.

47
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,430
So at a point in its life, Chaz was part of the Detroit Health Department.

48
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:28,550
So there were Detroit Health Department employees in the center of which they belong to a union.

49
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,420
And so throughout the years, that union has stayed.

50
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,870
And approximately 30% of Chaz staff is union staff.

51
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:45,919
And so a challenge from from an administrative standpoint is how do we make sure that we that

52
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:53,780
I am and the center is providing benefits and compensation that is comparable for everybody,

53
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,740
not just those individuals that are in the union.

54
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:14,870
But it's something that working through our mission and our vision and training, we're able to manage very efficiently and without without any issue.

55
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:25,460
So inside of human resources, one of the things that we're going to be talking a lot about is some of the issues related to principles of negotiation.

56
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:31,399
And I imagine there's some negotiation that goes on from an H.R. perspective with employees.

57
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,370
But there are also areas of negotiation that are taking place between Chaz and perhaps other entities,

58
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,550
other organizations, other parts of the health care system.

59
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:49,460
Maybe you can comment a little bit about what areas of negotiation you're engaged in and Chaz is engaged in all throughout its day.

60
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,370
Sure. So all of our partners that are outside of the center,

61
00:06:52,370 --> 00:07:01,069
we would either have a business agreement or a memorandum of understanding that is created

62
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:09,050
to make sure that what each entity needs to put into the initiative is is being met.

63
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:16,250
Example with Henry Ford Health System. All of the medical providers are actually employees of the Henry Ford Medical Group.

64
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:25,640
So we have a contract with Henry Ford for which we pay for their time and they are assigned once they're hired to work at chess.

65
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:35,120
Some of our our community partners that we refer to, whether it's for immigration services, for physical therapy in the community,

66
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:43,430
we also manage through business agreements as well as memorandums of understanding to

67
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:51,350
make sure that everything is clear into as to what even if money isn't being transacted,

68
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:58,310
that everything is clear into what entity is going to put into the agreement or put into

69
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,080
the service that's going to be provided for the individuals that that are being cared for.

70
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,270
We have relationships with the University of Michigan, actually with the School of Public Health,

71
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,469
with the School of Social Work, School of Medicine, School of nursing, school of Pharmacy.

72
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,620
Now, and those are more in the research arm.

73
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:28,309
And so we've also put in agreements on how, you know, making sure that all of the hip requirements are being met so that patient health information,

74
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:38,629
private information is being managed in a way that is sensitive and acknowledged by patients as as being used for improving their

75
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:45,890
care and and moving research forward that is going to impact their health as well as the community's health moving forward.

76
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,870
So are there areas where you find it's difficult to negotiate in your role?

77
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:59,120
You know, anytime you're interacting with another individual, whether it's in the exam room,

78
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:07,700
whether it is in a business agreement, whether it is in an interview, it's important to know where people are coming from.

79
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,399
Important to know what their goals are as well as our goals.

80
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,290
And negotiation is something that that we do at every level of our lives,

81
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,650
whether it's at home with your family, whether it's at work, whether it's at school.

82
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,140
And so it's it's you know, negotiation can always be a challenge.

83
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,570
Negotiation can always be a challenge.

84
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:39,470
But I think if we're focused on what the goals are and that the the the stated goals for each entity is or each individual is being met,

85
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:47,329
then, you know, it's a give and take. And if it if it's, you know, those goals aren't attainable based on negotiation,

86
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:54,380
then there's someone else that will partner with you and be able to to move initiatives forward.

87
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:04,700
So that's very interesting about negotiation. And I think it leads also into one of the other core pieces of our course, which is advocacy.

88
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,790
And I imagine chess is engaged in.

89
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:18,380
A lot of advocacy related to its funding, related to its ability to sustain itself, related to issues inside of the community.

90
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,600
And I imagine also across the different regions that it is engaged in.

91
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:33,110
I mean, we're right here next to the new bridge that's being built here between Detroit and Canada, which is an international crossing.

92
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:40,280
And so maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the advocacy issues that Chaz is engaged in and that you're most excited about.

93
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:46,550
Yeah. So advocacy is extremely important in the equity space, and that starts at the federal level.

94
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:54,530
We have an association, the National Association of Community Health Centers, that is front and center in Congress at the White House,

95
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:00,769
making sure that the work that is being done in federally qualified health centers for

96
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:06,230
29 million people across the country is being highlighted not only for the quality,

97
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,910
but for the savings.

98
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:16,220
So those that are managing federal dollars want to know that the money that's being invested is being invested most efficiently and low cost.

99
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:22,130
And so advocacy is a very integral part at a federal level.

100
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:28,430
All of our employees, all of our board members and many of our patients are signed up as advocates and are reaching

101
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:36,739
out to our legislators in Washington to make sure that when reauthorization cycles come around,

102
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:44,630
that we're front and center and that they're hearing the importance and the benefits that they've received from that federal funding.

103
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:50,570
At the state level, we have the Michigan Primary Care Association, which is our advocate in Lansing,

104
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,799
and they are working with the governor's office, with the Medicaid office,

105
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,780
the Michigan Department of Health and Services,

106
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:08,390
and bringing all of our quality work together through the Michigan Community Health Network for negotiating and advocating with insurance companies.

107
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:17,460
So we're getting close to having community health worker services being reimbursed, and that is because we are strong advocates.

108
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,520
We've done research around it. We're still doing research around the the benefit of community health workers.

109
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:29,690
And the insurance companies are starting to see that that investment, which is some money,

110
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:40,190
actually brings back a significant positive return on the care and quality of services provided for their members.

111
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:48,379
So at the state level, the Michigan Primary Care Association is is our advocate in Lansing, in the community.

112
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,610
Our employees are our advocates. Our patients are advocates.

113
00:12:53,060 --> 00:13:04,490
To have the community continue to understand that CHASS is their Patient-centered medical home,

114
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:17,900
their Center for Health and wellness and new individuals that come into town are by word of mouth, are very readily introduced to what we're doing.

115
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,720
So our employees, our patients are serving and serving as advocates.

116
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:30,799
And the fact that we have a community education center that you're going to see that is hosting community events,

117
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:42,620
including events and gatherings that the mayor of the city holds, allows us to have advocacy done at a city level, at a community level.

118
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:52,220
And when we do national host national events here elevates it to that to that national level.

119
00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:03,049
This has been so helpful in understanding all the different parts of Chaz and how it intersects with the principles of the health care system finance,

120
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,740
budgeting, negotiation, human resources, advocacy.

121
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:12,890
And I think the most important part of understanding all of this is to have

122
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:17,610
an opportunity to see right here inside of the Chaz Center what's going on.

123
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,850
So why don't we go take a look? Excellent.
