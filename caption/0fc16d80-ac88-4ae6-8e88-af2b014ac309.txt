1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:17,880
And he said he's open to feedback. And I'm like, You know what? People think that description and I don't think I know everything about this.

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:34,650
I do think think that's what I'm going to play because this is one.

3
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,540
Okay. All right. Here we are with back. Well, welcome.

4
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:48,570
Um, look, why don't you do your thing?

5
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,210
So I want to talk about assignment two, which will be due November 8th.

6
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:02,160
We'll talk about the SWOT analysis, current events, and a couple times of content to cover.

7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,830
And then we'll do our case. It's midway through the term, though, and I know I ask often, but I just wanted to give open the floor up.

8
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,870
Anything that we are not getting out of class that we want to try to.

9
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,879
Of course. Correct. Change. I, I know your grades.

10
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,930
I will get them out as quickly as we can so you have a sense of them.

11
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,540
But I'm not concerned about anybody's performance.

12
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,010
I don't think you'll find that there's anything surprising on on your presentations in terms of that.

13
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:41,750
Everybody's been excellent. I am aware about the Panopto recordings, so we'll try to get those set.

14
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,630
They're recording, but apparently they're not there, so I'll fix that.

15
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,260
Um, anything else? Structure wise?

16
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,209
Class wise. How's it going on?

17
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,440
Yellow Dog for folks. Seems like it's okay. I'm seeing your.

18
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,760
Getting through. Yeah. As the semester are going for everybody.

19
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:16,850
It's October tires. You know the tired factor just kind of like sorry goes up the energy levels other things for you.

20
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,240
Can I ask you this might be really obnoxious. I'm sorry. No, because.

21
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,350
But and maybe just because I'm old and technology is different.

22
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,939
Like what? What is the goal of yellow tech and how how are you hoping people interact with that?

23
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:36,639
Because I will probably not speak for myself alone when I say I get on that to get the points that you want.

24
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,750
And again, look, I don't know what I'm really supposed to be doing with it.

25
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,110
Okay, that's a great question, but no question is a bad question.

26
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:53,109
So here's my goal for yellow logic. I want it to be a place where you have the ability to see what's going on, to read more.

27
00:02:53,110 --> 00:03:00,550
If you'd like to read more, there isn't really a way to create an equitable community where everyone's participating.

28
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,340
There's no real incentive to go on there.

29
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:10,000
And what usually ends up happening when we do that, we've tried it that way is, you know, three or four people are there and then the rest are not.

30
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:19,930
So what my goal is there is for you to have a space to share what we've tried in the past before Yellow Digg was just kind of having an environment

31
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:27,850
where it just sort of closed ad hoc and I think feedback in the past that there's not really a place to share some of these other things.

32
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,290
So if you have articles, if you have links, if you have other information that you're looking to share,

33
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,980
if you individually aren't getting much out of it, that's that's fair and understandable.

34
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:47,590
But I want it to be there for us collectively to facilitate participation for those who maybe aren't necessarily as comfortable sharing it class.

35
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:54,040
So it's really to create a more inclusive participation component because absent that,

36
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,399
there's not a whole lot of ways to really share with each other.

37
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:04,180
We've done in the past like a Slack channel for class, but it just kind of ends up not really panning out.

38
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,690
Some folks have tried Piazza and some of these other tools.

39
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:15,550
I've just found that this one particularly has been the most robust and the point structure for it is

40
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:20,560
really set up again to just make it so that it's at least worth your while to go in there and not,

41
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:28,299
you know, have it be assignments. So the alternative to it is discussion assignments or have you submit reflections or those types of things.

42
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:35,740
And I just feel like those are even more challenging because then it requires you don't have to like write up like a paper every week.

43
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,760
And I just I don't want to add that to your desks.

44
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:47,050
So practically, do you want us to get on and just like browse through what's on there or something that we're reading like say in the news?

45
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,710
Yeah, it's striking. You get on it, just throw it there so people can see it.

46
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,040
That's right. If that's the post you want to provide, that's totally fine.

47
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,309
If you want to post a couple of things and talk about them and, you know,

48
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,120
write a couple of posts and instead of having a reply to someone else, that's fine.

49
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:10,360
The way that the points are structured and this is how the tool was designed, is to give you different ways in that space to have some interaction.

50
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,710
So if you want to be a content producer, as you see, you get more points for that.

51
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,639
I don't care if you want to post three things a week, you know, and say, Hey, I read this article,

52
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,140
this article, this article, and then some of you may feel like, you know what, I don't really want to do that.

53
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,280
I'll just reply to other things. So that's why I think of it as being organic.

54
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,939
So that way we can have a forum for that place.

55
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:39,700
I I'm big into honoring everyone's participation style, though, and I recognize especially coming out of COVID, that we,

56
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,930
you know, we've had a lot of time where we were on Zoom and you could chat and you could do all kinds of other things.

57
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:52,150
And they're just we're back to in-person and I want to honor those who maybe aren't as comfortable participating,

58
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,100
you know, verbally or raising their hand.

59
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,620
As much as I would enjoy to hear from everybody, but I recognize everybody that comes comes to class from a different perspective.

60
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,640
That is the question. Yeah, that's great. Thank you so much. My pleasure.

61
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,090
Yellow Dick was worth double last year. We did away with that.

62
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,899
It was way too much. I got double yellow.

63
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:19,120
Big fines for asking. Oh, you know why? We'll just throw out yardage coins all day.

64
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,100
That's it. That's like. That's like the new rewards as you as you get some points and you get the points.

65
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,750
Christiana, you had your hand up in the afternoon.

66
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:38,410
I know I have class on the floor, so I was just wondering, like, if there was like fives for, like, capacity building today.

67
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,029
Okay. I'm going to go through today. Okay. I was going to post them, but we have a little bit of time to do them today.

68
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:48,550
And I want to go from the other great question, other things.

69
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:58,640
Okay. A bit. Okay.

70
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,650
Assignment to. They decided to.

71
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:12,200
All right. So hopefully you have had ample time and energy devoted to figuring out your organization.

72
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:19,220
I've heard wonderful, wonderful feedback from all of you about the different organizations, the way that you've been going about it,

73
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:27,370
great stories about how you were pursuing the information, getting it from the organization,

74
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:32,330
getting it from online, you know, working with some of the folks that work there.

75
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,290
If you're able to use a lot of different ways, you've been able to collect this.

76
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:43,890
So now I want you to picture, since you really dug in, that you are a recently hired consultant back.

77
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:51,450
And your idea here is that you are going to propose a new service or program that the organization can offer.

78
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,259
If you've done this before, proposing a program in terms of, you know,

79
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,210
an intervention or something of that nature with with more of a health behavior or health education lens.

80
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,810
That's about the most similar part of it that there is.

81
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:12,200
So our assignment here is not about designing a program with a budget and all and, you know, program objectives and all that.

82
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:18,320
Here we're proposing a program for the purposes of understanding how it's going to fit into the organization,

83
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,830
and we're thinking about it with a strategic lens.

84
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:32,510
So we're saying, okay, let's be leaders inside the organization and let's think about how this program would fit into the organization, number one.

85
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,270
And number two, why should we pursue it?

86
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:42,710
And your task is essentially to deconstruct that proposal into the different parts that I'm going to show you.

87
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:52,410
And we'll build toward a SWOT analysis, which is a common tool that we use in strategic planning, specifically in managing organizations.

88
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:57,080
Raise your hand if you've done a SWOT analysis. Okay.

89
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:02,360
Great. All right. So we're not all that advanced SWAT and SWAT analyzers.

90
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:10,159
So I'm going to go through it today. And, um, we're going to examine all the different aspects of the organizational and

91
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:17,930
environmental context through this and essentially construct a five page report,

92
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:23,030
again, similar to what you did for your first assignment, but this time proposing something.

93
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:30,110
So you're speaking your audience is maybe the CEO, maybe the president of the board,

94
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:36,979
like likely leadership in the organization as this consultant, you're speaking to the organization saying, all right, I get what you do.

95
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,670
I know your mission. I know kind of what your operations are.

96
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:45,140
I get how your finances work. I get where you're heading, where you're not heading, etc.

97
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,710
Now I'm going to come in and suggest what you can do next.

98
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:55,430
The third assignment that we're going to do will be constructing a strategic plan, which will which we'll talk about.

99
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,580
And that's where you'll project out for five years, kind of what the organization should do more generally.

100
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,080
But here I want you to dial in specifically to a new program or service that the organization can.

101
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,660
Okay. Same rules applies what we did in Assignment one.

102
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:23,729
And I appreciate everyone being very meticulous about their about their compliance with the with the with the limitations of the assignment.

103
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,390
So thank you. Title page in the background. Okay.

104
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,150
List the name of the organization City State. You'll get my idea that we can grade these anonymously.

105
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:39,350
One paragraph on the title page, summarize the program, explain its importance to the organization and the community.

106
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:46,160
What is this not? This is not. I propose a walking program because it will be great.

107
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:55,489
Okay. It's I propose a walking program to enhance the organization's capacity to do X, Y or Z that would fit with its mission.

108
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:05,299
That would give give us a sense of why and what I want you to picture when you're writing that paragraph is I'm the CEO of the organization,

109
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,980
and I got 30 of these proposals on my desk and I'm flipping through them.

110
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,850
Okay. I asked my staff or my team to send me idea.

111
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:19,550
I flip through on one paragraph. I better know what the heck you have in that paragraph.

112
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,060
All right, so what what? What is it that you said?

113
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,100
Exactly? What are you proposing? So that that way we know what you're voting for.

114
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,120
And that way, quickly, you can communicate. Okay.

115
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,460
Now, presumably you've caught my attention. You've gotten my interest in what you wrote.

116
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,040
So now I'm going to continue on. In one page section.

117
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,770
A, you're going to describe the program and its objectives.

118
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,080
So what new program or service will provide? Who is it going to serve?

119
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,600
What's the unmet need that the program addresses?

120
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,090
And then how is it going to provide an opportunity for a more inclusive offering for the organizations?

121
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,819
I want you to think about, you know, all those constructs. S.B. number two.

122
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,850
Another page, your recommendations here.

123
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,730
I want you to describe 2 to 3 program objectives and try to be as specific as possible.

124
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,570
We'll talk more about smart objectives as we head into the third assignment.

125
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,130
But I want you to be very specific here about these objectives and how you're going to measure success.

126
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:24,890
So not enough to say, for example, we're going to recruit new people.

127
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,700
How many new people? Where are you going to get them from?

128
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,850
How are you going to recruit them? What is it that you're going to do?

129
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:40,280
And I don't expect a long, voluminous explanation for each, but try to be specific and to say, you know, by this time, by this many months,

130
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,769
this number of people will try to try to get in the habit of doing that because it'll serve you well for your third assignment,

131
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:49,600
where we will be writing objectives that are characterized as smart objectives.

132
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:58,649
Where are you going to get funding for this? So we've talked a it in our in our previous sessions about philanthropy and sponsorship

133
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:02,610
and kind of how we think about philanthropy in raising revenue for nonprofits.

134
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,410
So I want you to think about where are you going to get as sponsors for this work, for this program?

135
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,960
You know, be specific, since you know your organization well, you know who's on the board.

136
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,390
Name the entities that you plan to approach and why.

137
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:26,220
If your organization is based in Detroit, you know, you might say we're going to approach Busch's, the local supermarket, ask for sponsorship.

138
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,919
You know, if your organization is based in, say, Austin, Texas,

139
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:38,050
we're going to approach the local radio station and name the radio station so that we know, you know, where it's going.

140
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:45,450
Again, if I'm consulting with the organization's leadership, just saying we'll approach the radio station, that's not enough.

141
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:52,350
Right. Because the leader of the organization, they have to know if you are really thoughtful about doing this,

142
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:58,050
you really are intent on having us do it and you're advocating for it to happen in our organization.

143
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,430
Tell me what your plan is. Where are we going to get the resources?

144
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,300
How are we going to do it? Okay.

145
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:10,670
To that point, we have this part who on the staff is going to be responsible for managing and implementing the program?

146
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:19,760
So if I've got a staff of two people and I'm proposing a program that's going to serve 5000 new clients or 5000 new community members,

147
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,570
well, that's not going to fly, probably because we're not going to have enough staff for that.

148
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:31,250
So I got to make sure I'm indicating, you know, we're going to secure new staff or we're going to have staff to X or our

149
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,600
program is going to do this because this is what our staff has capacity to do.

150
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,620
And then to that point, what are the gaps in staffing that will need to be addressed?

151
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:48,770
Section C Governance. This is a page. Here's where I want you to go back to what you learned in your first assignment.

152
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:54,860
Look up your board, 1 to 2 board members that would be supportive and provide justification for why.

153
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,650
Name their names. Please go through the board.

154
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:02,360
This person is going to be supportive because I think they're going to support this particular aspect of this.

155
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,070
They work in this environment. You know, they've been with the board for this many years.

156
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,700
You try to really picture yourself as pitching the organization's leadership.

157
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:20,769
Describing how the board diversity will impact the implementation and how the organization's CEO will build support with the board of directors.

158
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:27,610
So again, thinking about strategy with the board and then 1 to 2 conflicts of interest that might impede our implementation of this.

159
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,290
If the board member is, let's say, for example, the Vice President at Busch's, well, that might be a conflict of interest, right?

160
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:41,560
So we need to think about that, anticipate that that doesn't necessarily mean we're going to say what we want, approach Bushes.

161
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:48,730
That just means we've got to anticipate how we're going to manage that conflict so that we can approach that sponsor.

162
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:57,490
Okay. Section D one page read to table how you plan to raise awareness.

163
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,290
So we'll be covering some of this in future weeks. I don't expect, you know, all these parts.

164
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,610
We'll get to it as we go. But I just want to lay it out for you so you know where we're heading.

165
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:14,639
So who in the community, what stakeholders would be candidates for partnering with you in your organization on delivering this?

166
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,180
So what other partners? Who's the audience for the program that you're proposing?

167
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,940
How is the organization going to reach that audience?

168
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:30,310
And then I want you to look for 2 to 3 challenges related to marketing, that new program that potentially will prove to be successful implementation.

169
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,680
Okay. So great,

170
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:41,440
great programs very often stumble when they aren't marketed appropriately and nobody knows that they're happening and nobody knows that even exists.

171
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,430
You can look across the last year and a half, I'm sure you can name many things that have gone on with COVID relief,

172
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,620
where we gave lots of resources to nonprofits, into organizations, and nobody even knew what was happening.

173
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,870
Micro grants for small businesses, you know, testing kits that were available at the library.

174
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:05,380
And, you know, you heard about it because your friend told you I was at the library and yeah, they're giving them out.

175
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,220
Well, you shouldn't have to hear from your friend. The library should be promoting it.

176
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:14,650
Although we have tests here at the library, it's part of this program or whatever the organization is, it's partnering.

177
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,970
So again, thinking about how you're going to promote your program, how you're going to get it out there.

178
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,730
All this builds you to your slot table and to talk about your moment.

179
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,300
And this is where I want you to really deconstruct this whole thing.

180
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:32,080
And you're going to build this two by two matrix, which I show you how we build one.

181
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:38,769
But how is the program catalyzed by the organization's internal strengths, its internal weaknesses?

182
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:45,610
Internal is the key word here. What external factors create opportunities for the program to succeed?

183
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:51,940
And then what external factors are threats to its success? I'm going to go through SWAT here in more detail, so I'm going to go through it now.

184
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:57,700
This whole thing will be five pages long. Again, succinct to the point.

185
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,550
It's a report. And I really again, I'm I'm encouraging you to practice as future professionals,

186
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:09,700
practice these skills of helping your leadership understand that you have it figured out.

187
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,840
Because that way, when they sit down to look at it, they can say, okay.

188
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:20,210
My team has it figured out, or in this case, my consultant really thought this through.

189
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,990
They didn't come with a plan and say, Thank you so much for securing my services as a consultant.

190
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,080
I have know what you do and so I propose these ideas, but they don't really match match with what you're able to do right now.

191
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,930
Questions. So the program's meaning?

192
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,990
No, no. Okay. So I'm just saying. I see your hand. Go ahead, honey.

193
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,470
So the programs meaning we have to like whatever it is that we must have on the day,

194
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,730
planning to implement so-and-so program like those we have to take into consideration.

195
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,770
Yeah, but you're proposing what you want to propose. It's okay if it's not something that they're doing now.

196
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,250
We can propose a program that they should do.

197
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:11,030
Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. If you really feel like there's nothing there for them to do that's new and you want to expand or scale up.

198
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,560
That's okay, too. But please don't turn something in. That's just sort of we should scale this up.

199
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,300
That's not really in the spirit of the assignment.

200
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,140
I want you to if you're if you're scaling it up and I'm going to expect a higher threshold of of thought on it,

201
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,490
because that's, you know, that's already happening.

202
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:36,769
So I'd like to see more than just, you know, we're going to expand this to serve more people and probably harder anyway to work on on an expansion,

203
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:40,970
because there's not a whole lot of donors that you're going to find, for example,

204
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,200
that the organization probably hasn't already approached on something that's already happening.

205
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,920
So, you know, I'll just be much more challenging to sort of say, okay, well, they already have this person in this person.

206
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,020
Maybe we need to, you know, try for something different. Okay.

207
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:02,930
So if we have an idea for a program to be developed, but we also know of a policy that would prevent it,

208
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:08,540
can we just like identify that as an external threat or can we not?

209
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,690
Then that's a great lead into this discussion. That is precisely what the external threats are.

210
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,920
So we can still choose that as the program we want to develop.

211
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,430
Yeah, that's and that's why you're doing this swot for that very reason.

212
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,149
That's a great question. Thank you for sharing that. That's the idea.

213
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:34,129
The SWOT should help you to illuminate that. Just because a policy stands in the way of a program doesn't mean you abandon ship on the program.

214
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,080
Maybe you choose not to pursue it right now.

215
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:45,330
But your next goal, if that program sounds great, is let's go and try to change that policy, even if it's not a policy within the agency, though.

216
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:54,860
Yeah. This is this is that's a great question. So this is why organizations very often, very often have lobbying built into that.

217
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,490
They may not be siefers in the sense that they're backing candidates,

218
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:06,560
but they are backing policy changes and they're looking actively to change policy so that they can deliver more in the problem that they offer.

219
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,510
Planned Parenthood is a great example of that.

220
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:17,720
Um, it's, it's C-4 does its work sort of for candidates, but the C three directly advocates for changes put more,

221
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,560
you know, more generally on policy associated with reproductive health.

222
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:27,710
Um, for that very reason to be able to deliver more on the services that they feel are in the scope of their vision.

223
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,400
Three questions. I didn't.

224
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:43,459
So I just want to make sure I understand that you said expanding to more people like the existing service that your organization provides,

225
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,940
expanding to more people is not what you're looking for.

226
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:54,650
Only not if you want to try to go that route, it's fine. But I just caution everyone that it may be challenging because.

227
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:01,860
If they've already figured out who sponsors it, then you're trying to kind of figure out, okay, now I'm trying to find new sponsors for something.

228
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:08,220
Most likely the organization has gone through this process and they know who the right folks are to be involved.

229
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:14,730
But offering the service, the same service to a different population, that's okay.

230
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,870
It's just like if you had if you had a daycare and you want to add elder care, it's fine.

231
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:23,550
It's set, right. That's a different service. So now now we're talking about a different population.

232
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,670
So, you know, the sponsors who are interested in the daycare very well may not be interested in the elder care part.

233
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,370
So now we're looking for different folks to pick up on that.

234
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:41,790
Others. He's got a month to work on it.

235
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,680
Manageable? No idea.

236
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,710
Oh. How stringent are you on a one page perception?

237
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,700
Stringent. Don't worry.

238
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,760
I'm going to open those assignment ones. I'm looking for one page.

239
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:01,439
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be brutal. I just. I really want you to practice that skill.

240
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,850
It's so important. And it's not arbitrary. I promise. Not arbitrary.

241
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:13,650
The greatest proposals really, really stumble and go down because they're not straight to the point.

242
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,630
And the reason that that organizations struggle to understand what those are, just because they meander and they you lose your reader.

243
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:28,260
So it's it's it's it's critical to grants that you might write if you're working in that capacity.

244
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:35,530
Critical to executive summaries, all of those things. These people only have so much attention span.

245
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:40,210
Ali. Yes, sir. I'm really I'm just hoping to make today, but. Okay.

246
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,010
But what you guys like the word capacity, I think, in ways that I haven't heard it used before.

247
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,660
Is there like a management version of that word or a non profit version of it?

248
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,370
So when I think of capacity,

249
00:23:51,370 --> 00:24:01,360
the way I define capacity and the way that field typically defines capacity is how capable are you delivering what you say you're going to deliver?

250
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:09,190
So if I have two people on my staff and I'm looking to deliver something that really takes five people to deliver,

251
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,030
I have a very limited capacity, so I'm not going to be able to do it.

252
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:19,000
Five people can do that in my capacity, as we also can think of capacity in terms of a social construct.

253
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:25,320
Sometimes we'll think of this capacity building as looking for how we can engage more people,

254
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,159
be more inclusive, you know, community based, participatory research.

255
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,510
Sometimes that term is used, but it's a little different in that context.

256
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:40,000
You know, there we're talking about capacity in terms of creating a more inclusive organization.

257
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:45,340
The management, when we say capacity, we're really talking about, you know, operationally you have the capacity.

258
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:50,350
You have the ability to deliver on what you're saying, others.

259
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,000
We'll take more as time goes on. Good.

260
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:59,970
Yeah. All right.

261
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,410
A SWOT analysis. Okay.

262
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,020
Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats.

263
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,670
Assets. What stands apart? It's an acronym. What is it?

264
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:22,470
Well, it's a strategic planning tool that we use to understand the environment where an organization exists,

265
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:30,150
what pressures they're facing, what actions are needed to be done in order to accomplish a goal at the objective,

266
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,290
at the end of the day,

267
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:40,560
is to be able to compare the organization's internal strengths and weaknesses with what's going on outside of the organization that it cannot control.

268
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:48,540
So the external environment. And that's how we start to find the strategic challenges that we need to address with strategic issues.

269
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:59,400
Theoretically and organizational theory. The idea was first articulated under this concept of the organizational psychology.

270
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:06,030
This theory, and again, it's part of a group of theories that I just want to once again emphasize that are

271
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:10,889
part of what we kind of refer to historically as the body of organizational theory.

272
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:19,260
But they don't always reflect the inclusivity or kind of the diversity of thought inside of organizations contemporarily.

273
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:24,000
But nonetheless, I just want to share it with you so that you have a sense of where theoretically this has emerged.

274
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:30,270
The key idea here is that the organization exists in an environment.

275
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:38,560
It's a marketplace. It's a it's a it's an ecosystem. Where the organization is is located, where it's delivering on its different roles.

276
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:47,490
And structural inertia. Inertia, it hinders the adaptation of the organization when the environment changes.

277
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:57,360
So this inertia, this ability to break this barrier, to overcome physics, if you're familiar with the term inertia.

278
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:08,160
We use that term to say, you know, it takes more force to overcome a certain obstacle or it takes more force to to start to build momentum.

279
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:16,830
So in organizations, we think of it as the inertia needed or the inertia that's present that prevents us from getting momentum going on an initiative.

280
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:27,600
So that inertia hinders the adaptation and as a result, the organization may become incompatible with its environment.

281
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:34,190
Eventually it gets replaced. So strategic planning is so, so critical.

282
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,930
Because if I'm not looking to Katie's point, I'm not looking at the policies that are out there.

283
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,280
I may find myself very much left behind when things start to change.

284
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:52,460
If I'm not evolving and I'm not trying to meet the needs of my current environment, my landscape, I may find myself very, very much lost.

285
00:27:52,790 --> 00:28:02,050
We see this a lot with disease advocacy organizations. Very, very often they are, you know, at the moment, very much beloved in the community.

286
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:07,310
Lots of people are really into raising money for them. You know, there's a ton of fundraising that goes on.

287
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:13,490
It's very exciting. And there are walks and races and marathons and then kind of slowly, you know,

288
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,580
another one comes out and people are all of a sudden interested in that one.

289
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,959
So each organization has to be able to say, hey, what's the landscape?

290
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:31,180
I mean, who's out there? What's going on? For example, Kogi has changed the way that organizations are going to operate internally,

291
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:42,170
but the idea that there will be long COVID that exists inside of the health care space very well may change where some dollars in the future go.

292
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:47,929
So if I'm an organization and I'm looking at, you know, kind of the landscape of what's going on, I might say, all right,

293
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:51,440
I'm not going to just look at how COVID impacts my ability to have people come into

294
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,479
work or how it's ability is enabling or disabling my ability to deliver a program.

295
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,220
I might be saying, all right, epidemiologically, I see that this is something that's emerging.

296
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,240
So I best start planning for how our organization is going to address that.

297
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,340
We're going to work under those terms. All right.

298
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:17,080
Strengths internal to the organization. So these are qualities that enable the organization to accomplish its mission.

299
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:24,510
So the internal part of this, the organization itself, not what's going on outside,

300
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,680
what exactly the organization has, can be tangible, intangible, their expertize.

301
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:43,350
The quality that the employees possess, the distinct features of the organizations make up what are beneficial capabilities.

302
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:54,180
So competency among its employees process abilities, financial resources, the products that the organization offers.

303
00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:01,120
Think back to the blood bank case. What was what was the internal strength of the Carolina blood bank?

304
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:10,190
Case group in an answer to or anyone else. I think everybody went to a great.

305
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,260
Yeah. Internal strength.

306
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,320
But after that book.

307
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:33,660
But they had a strong community that supported us and they already had strategic partnerships in place, even if they weren't as extensive at the time.

308
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:37,470
So those strategic partnerships that's internal to the organization.

309
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,490
They already have those partnerships in place. Why is that important?

310
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,480
Well, if I wanted to start a blood bank tomorrow, I have no strategic partnerships.

311
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:51,150
So already that organization is ahead of me in terms of its internal capacity.

312
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,390
There's another, Ali, another example where we're using the word capacity.

313
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,080
Okay. Weaknesses? What? Things that prevent the organization from accomplishing its mission.

314
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,400
They deteriorate success or growth.

315
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,880
They don't meet the standards that the organization feel it should meet, but they're controllable.

316
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:21,250
That's the key part of an internal peace. It's internal. It's as the strengths as well.

317
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:27,070
Controllable things. I as the organization leadership have the power to do something about this.

318
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,680
I can hire more people. I can and do positions.

319
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,650
I can change my program. I can raise more money.

320
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:42,910
I can buy more machinery. I might have more complex decision making.

321
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:48,070
That's a weakness. But I have the power to try and train my leadership or my board to do better.

322
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,900
I might waste a lot of raw material in producing something,

323
00:31:53,260 --> 00:32:01,400
but I have the ability to refine that manufacturing and try to do a better job distinct from the external components.

324
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,580
So strengths, weaknesses as the S and the W now are out, the opportunities and the threats.

325
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:11,370
Opportunities are external. They look we're looking outside.

326
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,410
When the organization can capitalize on the conditions in that environment.

327
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:24,970
The Affordable Care Act created numerous opportunities for the organizations in the health care delivery system.

328
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,640
They created numerous, numerous opportunities.

329
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,050
All of a sudden, there were all kinds of new policy streams in place to motivate and promote different kinds of behavior,

330
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:45,920
the ability to create value based care, the ability to reward people with financial incentives, the ability to coordinate care.

331
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,840
All of this was external to organizations. They had no ability to control for that,

332
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:57,070
but it created an opportunity so the organizations can gain a competitive advantage by using those opportunities.

333
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:04,420
But they arise from the market, from competition, from the government, from new technology.

334
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:11,500
Prior to the advent of the iPhone, that technology wasn't there.

335
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:22,270
So the idea of trying to have mobile technology for, you know, delivering programs for people that was far, far out.

336
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,150
Organizations didn't have that. They could use it.

337
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:35,770
That opportunity, though, provided the organization with the ability to build capacity and to now basically say,

338
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:42,309
we're going to address a deficit of ours. We don't have the expertize to utilize this new technology.

339
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:49,960
So we're going to build that expertize. But the fact that that device came out or that it was invented that was external to the organization,

340
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,100
the threats and Katie gave a great example of this are kind of the opposite.

341
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:04,540
So external environment that now jeopardizes the reliability of the organization's core offering.

342
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:12,460
It makes the organization more vulnerable, especially to its weaknesses is uncontrollable.

343
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,370
So we don't we don't have any way to stop it.

344
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:21,790
We can try reactively, maybe for policy, we can lobby, but we don't really have, as an organization any real authority.

345
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:29,040
We can just try to influence. So we start to see sort of where that comes out.

346
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:33,180
Inflation, that's a threat my organization can't control.

347
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:40,760
Roe v Wade, that decision. That's a threat. That's a you know, the organization now faces that.

348
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,540
Some organizations might view that as an opportunity.

349
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,980
You know, they may be of the opinion that that that they're not supportive of those particular services.

350
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,580
And so now they see it as an opportunity for them. Great.

351
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,780
This law is gone.

352
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:06,980
So now we can, you know, open up more clinics to counsel for people who are looking, you know, for help in these situations in order to address this.

353
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:10,130
Well, okay. That's because that's meeting their mission.

354
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:21,650
But a clinic that's trying to provide accessible services for pregnancy, they're going to view it as a threat to their operations.

355
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:27,880
Now viewed as an opportunity or a threat, we then start to see how the organization reacts.

356
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:36,700
If you view the change in the law as a threat, you might be planning and saying, okay, we better be on this.

357
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:47,170
We better be raising money to make sure that we have the capacity to transport people who are now in states that don't have access to abortion.

358
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:51,130
And we're going to need to move them or get them somewhere where they can go.

359
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,799
We're going to need to make sure that they're covered with legal services.

360
00:35:53,800 --> 00:36:00,490
So if a state has some kind of a law that is going to prosecute them for going to pursue that,

361
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,820
that, you know, we'll be able to help them to cover that so that they're not alone.

362
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:09,990
So, again, this is where we start to see organizations respond to changes in the law.

363
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:21,740
We use a lot, a lot in strategic planning. We might find that it sort of speaks to these different components.

364
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:27,139
Here's an example that the Worth textbook gives.

365
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:35,810
If you if you have a purchase that we're actually you've seen this but but essentially this is a very basic SWOT analysis for a theater,

366
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,110
an urban theater, and you can kind of take a look at it in the slides.

367
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:44,239
But no, and I and I also again, acknowledge that this this table was built in 2015.

368
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:52,850
So I don't know that it reflects, again, the key aspects of inclusivity that we're operating under in our course definition.

369
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,340
But just give it to you again as an example of just a type of swot that brings it down for you.

370
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:01,760
You know, what's responsible from the environment, what's responsible for the organization?

371
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:09,380
Which leads us into our discussion of capacity building of alliances, strategic partnerships, which I'm going to jump to.

372
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:15,070
But before I do that, questions about SWAT on the external threat slide.

373
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:20,240
It's unrest among employees. Can you explain why that's an ongoing thing?

374
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:27,710
So it may be that you have. So let's let's talk about labor shortages in hospitals or healthcare delivery organizations.

375
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:32,840
That unrest might be, you know, unions that are mobilizing across states.

376
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:37,340
And so now you're not really able to control for within your own organization.

377
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:45,320
All of a sudden, you've got many, many places that are all actively working together to mobilize around addressing a key labor dispute.

378
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:49,939
So now I can't just say, okay, I want to give everyone a raise because they're now anchored to,

379
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:56,260
you know, what's going on in this state, in this state and this state. So it's no longer just your organization that controls for it.

380
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:06,020
Yeah. It seems like a lot of like the SWOT analysis and these different sections are all about how you frame the issue because like I said,

381
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:11,510
I'm just kind of wanted to like that could also be an internal threat or what have you.

382
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:17,450
So I guess, is that possible? And then whenever we're doing our own SWOT analysis.

383
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,070
Is there a right framing we should be taking or is it open to interpretation?

384
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:30,150
It's open to your interpretation. And this is why the framework is what we use, but not necessarily this is what it is.

385
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:35,760
So that's why I gave the example of the two clinics that are responding to Roe v Wade.

386
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:43,230
You know, depending on their position related to their mission and that change in policy, some may view that as an opportunity.

387
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:49,620
Others may view it as a threat. How you build the SWAT is based on what your mission is, and that's why we're doing this.

388
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:55,230
After you really delve deep into your organization's structure so that you understand kind of high organization,

389
00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:00,960
thinks what it's trying to do and now how you can build this 40 great questions and.

390
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:12,670
Yeah. I have a question. Can I like I'm assuming most of these threats are just, like, subjective, like we deem them as being good or bad,

391
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:19,980
because if if a nonprofit is like how many chapters that could be considered a.

392
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:29,750
Like a good thing because then they have support, but then that also could be considered a threat because I don't actually know why.

393
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:37,160
But like closing chapters, that's a good example that I would characterize more in the strengths weaknesses because it's internal.

394
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,450
It's internal, but that's great. And how you've described it is in the framing.

395
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:50,029
So yes, iron has greater capacity, but that's a strange but also it's a weakness and that we have all these chapters to support.

396
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:58,700
So if we don't have enough money to support them all, then they're now weighing us down and enabled or disabling us from moving forward.

397
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:04,100
So you you as the consultant per se, are the framer of how this all goes.

398
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:10,760
And it's up to you usually when you are going through this process to interview or to talk to all the different folks inside of organization.

399
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,399
We've simulated that some through your first assignment. I didn't want to obligate you to have to go interview everyone inside of organizations.

400
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,440
It's a lot, a big lift, but we simulated that some by getting a real deep understanding.

401
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:28,100
Now you're prepared to make assessments and assertions on what is it, is it weakness, internal strength, etc.

402
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:37,900
The question. Okay.

403
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:46,100
All right. I want to take a two minute break to get a lot to do today.

404
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:50,659
Take a quick stretch. I'm going to we're going to jump to current events so we can hear from some

405
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:58,240
other people that have been and we will run part of three current events today.

406
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:02,000
We're going to have to really like make them move so we can get to everything.

407
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,860
So we have our our time for our kids. But a two minute stretch.

408
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:20,350
So for 47 or 47 that's why of the Chris Christie has a few is pretty.

409
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:25,070
Oh I know he would have said he would have I'm sorry wants to be alone but you know.

410
00:41:27,002 --> 00:41:30,562
Yeah. All right, Noah's up first.

411
00:41:36,592 --> 00:41:41,752
When you're ready to work to do it, you know, like everybody else.

412
00:41:44,842 --> 00:41:50,762
Yeah. Just typically, like. Hello, everyone.

413
00:41:52,232 --> 00:42:00,062
And I was inspired by Yellow Digg, actually, thanks to John for posting an article about Joe Biden's Maryland appearance.

414
00:42:00,662 --> 00:42:07,532
Oh man. I think this is like huge news and I personally think it's a really great step towards that.

415
00:42:07,562 --> 00:42:16,952
We need to go as a country. And so some questions that I want you to think about as we go through are how does this affect real lives and real people?

416
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:20,912
And will the rescheduling of marijuana happen soon or ever?

417
00:42:20,942 --> 00:42:28,172
Or just just give us. So by then this was actually happening.

418
00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:34,812
But now it looks like the title Biden Pardons for Marijuana Possession Inject Shoots into the midterm final stretch.

419
00:42:35,802 --> 00:42:38,862
And so on October 7th, Joe Biden, I'm sure, you know,

420
00:42:38,862 --> 00:42:47,892
announced that he would be pardoning for simple possession of marijuana, anyone that person and convicted on a federal crime.

421
00:42:49,482 --> 00:42:54,892
But other counts of marijuana related charges would not be included in this.

422
00:42:56,382 --> 00:43:01,512
And so this pardon will affect about 6500 people throughout the United States.

423
00:43:01,932 --> 00:43:07,842
And there was also a call along with this by President Biden to reschedule marijuana.

424
00:43:08,232 --> 00:43:10,482
I've heard different things about where it's going to be rescheduled,

425
00:43:10,482 --> 00:43:19,512
but I think the most common is to schedule it down to the same as alcohol, which is, I think, not scheduled and not enforced by the DEA.

426
00:43:20,592 --> 00:43:23,921
And rather than being with LSD, heroin and ecstasy,

427
00:43:23,922 --> 00:43:30,462
which I think most public health officials would agree that it should not be scheduled the same as LSD,

428
00:43:30,852 --> 00:43:38,682
heroin and ecstasy, especially since schedule one is scheduled to I believe it's like math is on the schedule, too.

429
00:43:38,712 --> 00:43:44,412
So it's really interesting. And so this actually is put on schedule one in the 1970s.

430
00:43:45,402 --> 00:43:52,062
And so we have been having pretty much the war on drugs ever since and is proving not fruitful.

431
00:43:53,112 --> 00:43:59,532
And many people or many have called this like purely political, which is something that we discussed on the conversation.

432
00:44:00,402 --> 00:44:05,682
But a lot of nonprofits in this area are working to say this is a step in the right direction and want it to go even.

433
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:18,792
So what would reclassify mean basically mean a policy scale that decades old patchworks of state and federal laws that are misaligned and not working

434
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:28,932
together kind of be dismantled and any sandbox except that certain laws would be enforced for Schedule one drugs would not apply to marijuana anymore,

435
00:44:29,922 --> 00:44:39,522
and it would make it a lot easier for governments to legalize marijuana, which is a platform for the Democratic Party.

436
00:44:39,912 --> 00:44:46,962
And so this is really interesting. And I think what's interesting that we discussed in my yellow jacket about how this could

437
00:44:47,682 --> 00:44:53,231
really just be seen as a political ploy because 6500 and just simple marijuana possession,

438
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:57,732
really, there's like a lot of arguments that this is just a political ploy because there's so many other things that need to be done.

439
00:44:58,572 --> 00:45:05,502
And so that's something to think about. And then many are calling for it to be completely declassified rather than reclassified.

440
00:45:06,402 --> 00:45:09,462
And that is what the next I believe the next slide.

441
00:45:11,112 --> 00:45:13,272
Yes. The last prisoner project is called for.

442
00:45:13,572 --> 00:45:26,352
So the Last Prisoner Project is a nonprofit organization that is nonpartisan and it is focused on criminal justice reform surrounding cannabis.

443
00:45:26,832 --> 00:45:32,532
And it says their mission is that they aim to end America's policy on cannabis criminalization

444
00:45:32,952 --> 00:45:37,632
as well as to repair the harms of this discriminatory and counterproductive per se.

445
00:45:38,532 --> 00:45:44,101
In the vision is if anyone is able to profit off of marijuana while people are serving jail time for that,

446
00:45:44,102 --> 00:45:50,262
then they should be taking part and rebuilding the lives of those who suffer from cannabis criminalization.

447
00:45:51,342 --> 00:45:59,891
Okay, so the last prisoners projects role in in this was that they worked with the Biden administration a lot.

448
00:45:59,892 --> 00:46:07,092
They've done a lot of lobbying and advocacy, as we were talking about earlier, of using their organization to lobby for a certain bill.

449
00:46:07,992 --> 00:46:12,912
And so they've been meeting with the Biden administration since 2020.

450
00:46:13,482 --> 00:46:20,682
The organization has actually been around since 2019. And so they have done a lot of work in the three years that they've been around.

451
00:46:22,032 --> 00:46:25,001
And so in addition to decriminalization of marijuana,

452
00:46:25,002 --> 00:46:32,072
the last prisoner project focus is on record relief of those convicted reentry programs for those unfairly imprisoned,

453
00:46:32,082 --> 00:46:39,762
as I say, and advocacy and policy efforts relating to the release of release and support of those currently.

454
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:46,682
So these are their four area framework that they work within sort of policy of legal reentry and advocacy.

455
00:46:47,502 --> 00:46:50,502
And under policy they have two main things.

456
00:46:50,502 --> 00:46:54,971
One is to provide release for individuals still incarcerated for cannabis and to

457
00:46:54,972 --> 00:46:59,382
automatically clear any charges from their criminal records that relate to cannabis.

458
00:46:59,652 --> 00:47:02,801
If it is a nonviolent crime, two is legal.

459
00:47:02,802 --> 00:47:13,732
So they work with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers to try and get all those records cleared from marijuana and then reentry.

460
00:47:13,782 --> 00:47:20,892
So they they use a lot of money to provide micro grants for those coming out of prison to help try and rebuild their lives.

461
00:47:21,792 --> 00:47:28,181
And advocacy, they do everything from letter writing to people who are currently in prison for cannabis related

462
00:47:28,182 --> 00:47:36,342
crimes to trying to get other for profit dispensaries to try and partake in advocacy efforts.

463
00:47:37,452 --> 00:47:45,322
Since they are I mean, their vision is if you're making money off of it, you should also be working to help those who are currently in prison.

464
00:47:45,352 --> 00:47:51,952
And so that's what they're obviously. So this is their their major achievements.

465
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:56,062
They sponsored two bills in state legislatures that passed.

466
00:47:56,842 --> 00:48:04,042
They have seven automatic record clearances and resentencing bills passed at the state level.

467
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,191
They have 85 constituents released from prison.

468
00:48:07,192 --> 00:48:16,822
Prior to Biden's announcement, 196 participants in the court in the organization's Legal Framework Reentry Program has given out $1.59 million,

469
00:48:17,272 --> 00:48:19,162
redistributed through several programs,

470
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:29,572
and 160 people within their programs have received micro grants to either start businesses or help them get back on their feet.

471
00:48:29,962 --> 00:48:36,622
And finally, under advocacy, 115 constituents received quarterly commissary payments while serving time in prison.

472
00:48:37,012 --> 00:48:40,762
And 375 dispensaries are involved in advocacy partnerships.

473
00:48:44,512 --> 00:48:49,222
This is the statement from the executive director of the Last Prisoner Project.

474
00:48:49,792 --> 00:48:50,301
Sum it up.

475
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:57,922
It basically says, We think this is really cool that he pardoned everyone out of the 1800 people, but there's a lot of work that is left to be done.

476
00:48:59,152 --> 00:49:05,602
And that last thing is just the discussion. So these are some questions that I am interested in.

477
00:49:05,632 --> 00:49:11,442
And I guess like the greater thing is like the greater discussion is do you think that this should be happening?

478
00:49:11,452 --> 00:49:15,651
Should pardons be happening? But the thing that's kind of political,

479
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:19,792
so what I really want to focus on is should the government be responsible for more than just

480
00:49:19,792 --> 00:49:23,632
pardoning those who are incarcerated for marijuana possession if they're saying this is wrong?

481
00:49:24,532 --> 00:49:28,911
Should they be responsible for reentry programs and payments to allow those

482
00:49:28,912 --> 00:49:32,332
incarcerated to get back on their feet or should it all fall on the nonprofit?

483
00:49:32,342 --> 00:49:39,382
So I guess it's kind of two questions, but we'll start with should the government be responsible for.

484
00:49:42,222 --> 00:49:53,522
Reentry programs. For me, I think, yes, because if you're thinking about it long term, you know, you're stopping people, though.

485
00:49:53,902 --> 00:49:59,732
The purpose of those reentry programs, the people out of the jails without, you know, putting money over there anymore,

486
00:50:00,392 --> 00:50:07,912
we're using maybe some of that money to keep people out, which overall helps with the societal perspective as well.

487
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:15,392
Right. Not just the cost aspect, which I think is always the biggest thing that we need to think about.

488
00:50:15,462 --> 00:50:19,611
Like how much does this cost? Right. So I think.

489
00:50:19,612 --> 00:50:25,652
Yes. I also think yes.

490
00:50:27,062 --> 00:50:31,382
I mean, I do think it should be there should be nonprofit work involved, too,

491
00:50:31,382 --> 00:50:39,212
but it just reminds me of or makes me think about like deinstitutionalization and how we,

492
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:45,052
you know, opened the doors to mental institutions and didn't provide any services or housing.

493
00:50:45,062 --> 00:50:52,232
And that is partially what contributed to the criminalization of drug use and homelessness.

494
00:50:52,562 --> 00:51:01,802
So I feel like by not providing any reentry services, it could just kind of be that sort of situation played over again.

495
00:51:03,182 --> 00:51:08,582
I think it's really interesting because there's some people who are serving like decades or still serving like the 1970s.

496
00:51:08,602 --> 00:51:16,922
And so how in some ways must go back into society after being in prison for almost 40 years.

497
00:51:18,902 --> 00:51:23,972
And so, yeah, the second question is, if marijuana is decriminalized and becomes a legal substance of the federal level,

498
00:51:24,482 --> 00:51:31,592
should all of those incarcerated for nonviolent marijuana offenses be released from state and federal prisons?

499
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:34,922
I know there's a lot of policy issues that go into effect there.

500
00:51:35,732 --> 00:51:42,891
And what role would you see nonprofits playing in this? And for the state level, I think it's really interesting.

501
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:46,912
There's a lot of governors that are following up on Biden's pardons and finding people

502
00:51:46,912 --> 00:51:51,502
for the sake of it or pardoning people which are the same thing at the state level.

503
00:51:51,712 --> 00:51:55,862
That's an interesting and technical term, I think.

504
00:51:59,802 --> 00:52:03,792
I think that they should, or at least at the state and federal level,

505
00:52:04,842 --> 00:52:10,962
because I think overall that's just good for the government in many ways because.

506
00:52:12,032 --> 00:52:16,252
There's a lot of like economic incentive for doing this and the government will probably beginning.

507
00:52:16,262 --> 00:52:22,292
I assume they're probably going to be like, okay, if we're doing this, then this means we can probably tax this at a greater rate.

508
00:52:22,862 --> 00:52:29,492
They're going to be getting profit from that. So we should be playing some of that back and doing like retributive justice.

509
00:52:30,482 --> 00:52:35,042
So I think that it should be at a state and federal level. Now, do I see that happening in Texas?

510
00:52:35,102 --> 00:52:39,062
No. So that would be where a nonprofit might step in potentially.

511
00:52:43,932 --> 00:52:56,052
Anyone who thinks this shouldn't happen. Any thoughts on how and what role?

512
00:53:03,142 --> 00:53:11,782
I think something interesting that was like in the more act of 2021 was like helping people get into the marijuana industry.

513
00:53:12,082 --> 00:53:19,132
So like providing grants. And I forgot what that related is like providing various assistance for people to like enter the industry so that like,

514
00:53:19,732 --> 00:53:25,942
you know, they can make money off of this business as well. So I think that could be something else that nonprofits could do.

515
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:33,311
I actually just went to a health conference where they were talking about the possibility

516
00:53:33,312 --> 00:53:39,432
of bringing nonviolent offenders on as employees like peer supports or hiring.

517
00:53:40,272 --> 00:53:45,922
You know, because and as a way to address the workforce shortage in social work and other areas.

518
00:53:45,942 --> 00:53:47,442
So I thought that was interesting.

519
00:53:55,992 --> 00:54:05,592
This is an excellent presentation I think would be highlighted for us is this question of what their role ought to be in Rwanda.

520
00:54:05,592 --> 00:54:06,582
And number two,

521
00:54:07,272 --> 00:54:16,661
how relevant the nonprofit is in terms of both its advocacy around the issue and then following up from there what it does with those resources.

522
00:54:16,662 --> 00:54:23,522
So, you know, this is a great example for kind of to get to later on in our discussion about conflicts of interest.

523
00:54:23,532 --> 00:54:27,882
So the organization is sitting at the table and advocating for the change of the policy.

524
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:32,891
Is it advocating for the change due to its mission or is it just another form of vision?

525
00:54:32,892 --> 00:54:41,471
Or does it stand to benefit from, you know, a change in policy in which it will be the best candidate to start working on the reentry programs or,

526
00:54:41,472 --> 00:54:48,582
you know, the services or the dollars that would flow for what to do with people who are now in need of support.

527
00:54:49,232 --> 00:54:57,672
I think that's interesting through advocacy section where they're trying to get dispensaries who would benefit from marijuana decriminalized.

528
00:54:59,442 --> 00:55:04,721
They're like, try working with them to do a lot of the advocacy with them, which can be adventurous, I suppose.

529
00:55:04,722 --> 00:55:10,452
But yeah, I just thought that was really interesting of like if somebody is going to make money off of their.

530
00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:20,322
Just a quick addition to this. So. So there's a thing there's a form of DNC called into it.

531
00:55:21,552 --> 00:55:25,022
So it's like it's federally regulated, it's basically federally.

532
00:55:25,042 --> 00:55:30,192
And so I think the non-profits can, you know, take the lead from that and then, you know,

533
00:55:30,582 --> 00:55:36,522
just in a way to make sure that it's, you know, that user DNC is like decriminalized and, you know, legal for.

534
00:55:41,262 --> 00:55:47,651
Excellent. I hope so.

535
00:55:47,652 --> 00:55:53,051
Once again. Excellent presentation. And I want to just continue to point out how each of you in every presentation

536
00:55:53,052 --> 00:55:59,322
you've given is truly helping us see right now with what's going on in the news,

537
00:55:59,652 --> 00:56:05,682
how our nonprofit organizations in both domestically and internationally are playing a significant role.

538
00:56:06,432 --> 00:56:22,222
Thank you for that. Okay. Who wants to go next? Deanna, you want to go to the crisis comments by your sister?

539
00:56:22,902 --> 00:56:27,402
Yes, I just. Yeah, that today I would talk to you about the color of your service, lady.

540
00:56:27,912 --> 00:56:32,471
And I will say that I've actually read, I believe, and talked about Haiti with a lot of context.

541
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:36,862
So I tried to build some not so much that because it's a short presentation, but get excited.

542
00:56:38,322 --> 00:56:46,362
So there has been the first new cases of cholera reported on October 2nd, and as of Sunday there have been 32 confirmed cases,

543
00:56:46,602 --> 00:56:53,292
224 suspected cases, hundred 89 of them are hospitalized and then 16 deaths.

544
00:56:53,862 --> 00:56:57,732
And most of the cases are located in Port au Prince, which is Haiti's capital.

545
00:56:58,722 --> 00:57:07,212
So the Haitian government has requested for immediate deployment of armed force to address the crisis by securing the free movement of water,

546
00:57:07,212 --> 00:57:12,342
fuel, food, medical supplies from the ports and airports for the communities and health care systems.

547
00:57:14,352 --> 00:57:23,172
So the last cholera outbreak, which is why this is a big issue, lasted almost ten years from October 2010 to January 2019 in Haiti.

548
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:28,752
There are over 100 820 cases and nearly 10,000 deaths.

549
00:57:29,172 --> 00:57:35,202
And the outbreak was traced to a sewage leak from a U.N. base after the 2010 earthquake.

550
00:57:37,712 --> 00:57:45,782
So like I said, the context part, which is why like this outbreak is a huge issue and everyone's concerned is because in January 2010,

551
00:57:46,022 --> 00:57:53,342
the most devastating earthquake in Haiti resulting in over 200,000 deaths and 100 million people displaced.

552
00:57:53,792 --> 00:57:56,882
And then ten months later, that's when the cholera outbreak happened.

553
00:57:58,082 --> 00:58:07,292
What the U.N. peace work, peacemakers were there. And then we see two years later, the president of Haiti was assassinated.

554
00:58:07,472 --> 00:58:16,502
And since his assassination, there's been an increase of fuel shortages, hunger, insecurity, political unrest, kidnapings and gang violence.

555
00:58:18,212 --> 00:58:23,822
Just from April to July of this year, half a million children in Haiti's capital cannot go to school anymore.

556
00:58:24,272 --> 00:58:31,382
And then at least 234 people were killed within the span of four days in Port au Prince in July.

557
00:58:31,412 --> 00:58:37,922
So that's just kind of like a scope of how things are. And then now we see the new cases of cholera emerge in Haiti's capital.

558
00:58:38,702 --> 00:58:42,682
I might interrupt. I just want to point out for everyone that's a great example.

559
00:58:42,692 --> 00:58:47,072
So the assassination of the president is an example of an external threat.

560
00:58:47,162 --> 00:58:51,062
So this was nothing the organizations could control. It's something that happened.

561
00:58:51,422 --> 00:59:00,722
And now there's a response as necessary already addressed. So that points to why is aid in Haiti so complicated?

562
00:59:02,312 --> 00:59:05,522
So, you know, her intervention in Haiti has been very controversial.

563
00:59:05,822 --> 00:59:12,002
There's a whole history that you can read up on about the U.S. coming into Haiti, taking over their banks,

564
00:59:12,212 --> 00:59:17,092
taking over their natural resources, and kind of putting Haiti in this place where it's become so rushed.

565
00:59:18,632 --> 00:59:22,622
And that's a picture of recently, actually, of after, I believe,

566
00:59:22,862 --> 00:59:28,742
some U.S. official has decided to actually go and serving Haiti right now with all the unrest.

567
00:59:29,012 --> 00:59:33,542
So those are Haitians protesting for the White House saying the Haitians decide their own future.

568
00:59:34,532 --> 00:59:38,792
And then, of course, with the earthquake in Haiti that happened in 2010,

569
00:59:38,822 --> 00:59:44,612
the Red Cross raised half a billion dollars for Haiti and only built six homes.

570
00:59:44,882 --> 00:59:48,812
So there's a lot of mistrust with aid coming into Haiti,

571
00:59:49,382 --> 00:59:57,062
just seeing how the U.S. and other countries have stolen from Haiti both financially and their resources to build to build in the future.

572
00:59:57,392 --> 01:00:01,892
And then, of course, the aid being set to Haiti actually not helping them are not reaching them.

573
01:00:03,932 --> 01:00:08,161
So because of all of that, people are very wary of how they can help Haiti now.

574
01:00:08,162 --> 01:00:14,452
And one thing that has come up in the Haitian diaspora is just really getting to people that, you know, really excited.

575
01:00:14,492 --> 01:00:17,822
One example of this is like the outbreak right now.

576
01:00:18,902 --> 01:00:21,572
Someone I know, this is her caption on Instagram.

577
01:00:21,572 --> 01:00:29,822
I partnered with my fellow nurse to raise money, to build lifesaving, to buy lifesaving electrolytes, baby formula, water purification straws.

578
01:00:30,242 --> 01:00:36,122
We are in communication with this hospital right in the city where it's located, where the outbreak is located.

579
01:00:36,752 --> 01:00:40,322
Please consider consider donating so that we can square the lives of many.

580
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:48,802
And then she says, Oh, look at pop. Which means together we can add that 100% of the money goes to buy supplies and shipping them on of airplanes.

581
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:57,282
No middlemen. So the middleman is a very big issue for patients in the Haitian diaspora, just that mistrust and also grief.

582
01:00:59,972 --> 01:01:04,982
So the organization I chose is UNICEF, just because it's just on such a large scale.

583
01:01:05,252 --> 01:01:09,512
That was pretty much the only organization that I saw that intervene so far.

584
01:01:10,232 --> 01:01:16,052
I know we talked about UNICEF already, but I think with the context of how the U.N. has.

585
01:01:17,222 --> 01:01:21,542
Contributed. And, you know, there was a little bit of scandal from the last cholera outbreak.

586
01:01:21,752 --> 01:01:22,682
I think it's important.

587
01:01:23,702 --> 01:01:35,312
And, of course, the U.S. mission is to be committed to helping children in emergencies and their title of their report on the outbreak.

588
01:01:35,522 --> 01:01:39,992
They said the new cholera upsurge puts 1.2 million children at risk.

589
01:01:40,202 --> 01:01:47,482
So that's how they're framing their support of Haiti in this. So what are they exactly doing?

590
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:52,602
They're providing waterproofing tablets for 15 days as of right now.

591
01:01:52,612 --> 01:01:55,702
Soap bars to help with the sanitation efforts.

592
01:01:56,032 --> 01:02:01,882
And then these different sanitation measures for one of the biggest agencies.

593
01:02:02,272 --> 01:02:08,872
And they're also working with other organizations and other U.N. agencies to get cholera vaccinations in place.

594
01:02:11,742 --> 01:02:15,292
It's been. Click. All right.

595
01:02:15,372 --> 01:02:18,552
So my questions are well, my first question is,

596
01:02:18,852 --> 01:02:26,152
what do you think are some points of agreement and disagreement between Haitians in their healing and recovery during times of great medical?

597
01:02:27,672 --> 01:02:33,172
So there's really a need for help. But with the context of everything, like, what do you think are some points of agreement?

598
01:02:33,362 --> 01:02:44,962
Disagreement? Do you mean like.

599
01:02:46,822 --> 01:02:51,472
In the context of lack of trust in the medical profession.

600
01:02:51,752 --> 01:02:56,602
Like some some patients want a forum where some other countries and some don't at all.

601
01:02:56,632 --> 01:02:59,812
So what do you think, some plates that are coming up in those conversations?

602
01:03:07,472 --> 01:03:13,862
Okay. I was going to say, I think there's a lot of good reasons for them to be skeptical of taking foreign aid from anyone,

603
01:03:15,332 --> 01:03:18,842
because from what I know of Haitians and Haitians,

604
01:03:18,932 --> 01:03:28,082
history is that every time somebody has come in to Haiti, basically in one way or another, especially by governments like major powers.

605
01:03:29,612 --> 01:03:35,341
And so I can see that like nonprofits play a really big role in this,

606
01:03:35,342 --> 01:03:42,932
but also like they've also been screwed over, like probably American Red Cross and Red Cross, right.

607
01:03:43,472 --> 01:03:52,382
So I feel like if I if I were in that position, I just wouldn't trust any help from any external sources was going to come and be fruitful for.

608
01:03:53,642 --> 01:03:56,882
So I can see that as you out. Disagreement or maybe agreement.

609
01:03:59,152 --> 01:04:03,592
And after that, like the other side of that is I can see when you're in need.

610
01:04:04,012 --> 01:04:07,492
I'm sure some people are like, well. Help us help.

611
01:04:08,902 --> 01:04:15,152
Even if they're distrustful that resources are resources side of care.

612
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:16,172
Why would I trust that?

613
01:04:16,242 --> 01:04:25,042
But yeah, I think it's also important to build on the earlier sites that the Haitian government specifically asked for armed forces,

614
01:04:25,312 --> 01:04:31,612
which is what kind of like, I guess makes Haitians in Haiti uncomfortable because there's already so much violence going on.

615
01:04:31,912 --> 01:04:34,462
And just bringing in more violence is a scary thought.

616
01:04:34,462 --> 01:04:42,771
So, yeah, I was going to say in terms of like the agreements, we were just like focusing on building a sense of community.

617
01:04:42,772 --> 01:04:50,692
So there's a lot more happening. I mean, it seems kind of contradictory, but not not in the sense where like the people in Haiti can organize,

618
01:04:50,692 --> 01:04:59,571
but just if they all pooled together and yeah, like if you build the sense of community with all of them, then they can have more individual efforts.

619
01:04:59,572 --> 01:05:05,202
But I mean, they would still need because of how large the scale is, help from outside resources.

620
01:05:05,542 --> 01:05:07,311
But I think if if everyone pulls together,

621
01:05:07,312 --> 01:05:13,702
then they can have like if they have someone that's in the states can create like a campaign or something for them,

622
01:05:13,942 --> 01:05:18,351
they can all just come up with ways that they themselves can like try to help their own community

623
01:05:18,352 --> 01:05:23,452
rather than relying on outside sources is definitely a conversation that I've been seeing,

624
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:29,722
like on Twitter and Instagram a lot like what can we in the diaspora do for Haitians instead of, you know, the US government?

625
01:05:32,132 --> 01:05:38,702
I was wondering if there's like an agreement would be, I guess going back to the side of the.

626
01:05:40,582 --> 01:05:43,402
People saying try the White House thing. But she wasn't asking her.

627
01:05:44,092 --> 01:05:51,052
Like, I wonder if outside forces of a lot of times can be seen as like savior complexes.

628
01:05:51,562 --> 01:06:00,892
And so I wonder if there could be an agreement of receiving money to nonprofits, organizations that are actually Haitian and from Haiti,

629
01:06:01,462 --> 01:06:06,471
giving the money to them to allow them to make decisions on the future within

630
01:06:06,472 --> 01:06:10,551
Haiti rather than outside nonprofit organizations or governments coming in and

631
01:06:10,552 --> 01:06:17,242
trying to make sure that the government is aligned to it because the person that's

632
01:06:17,242 --> 01:06:21,321
taking over for the president that was assassinated specifically as the U.S.,

633
01:06:21,322 --> 01:06:25,132
which I believe they're protesting to, for military aid to come with Haiti.

634
01:06:25,582 --> 01:06:30,002
So, yeah, it's the government kind of like doing what the Haitian people don't want.

635
01:06:30,042 --> 01:06:39,111
So it's just a lot like I was kind of getting a similar thing of just like I think a point of agreement like you exemplified in the previous text that

636
01:06:39,112 --> 01:06:48,622
you showed is like then the people in Haiti directly asking for what they need and getting it directly from individuals and not relying on others,

637
01:06:48,622 --> 01:06:57,982
not relying on external like the middleman, maybe like being able to have a source of agreement on the exact needs that they have.

638
01:06:59,812 --> 01:07:03,502
But I think that the issue or the hard part is like, where did this actually come from?

639
01:07:04,522 --> 01:07:10,672
And how can we organize to make sure that everyone in Haiti doesn't have someone in the U.S. can get stuff as well?

640
01:07:11,842 --> 01:07:13,402
The second question just really quick.

641
01:07:13,642 --> 01:07:21,022
If you were on the board of UNICEF, what are some tangible ways that you were trying to improve public trust between UNICEF,

642
01:07:21,022 --> 01:07:27,681
such the U.S. trying to present to the last point that no one knew about, like giving the money to Haitians,

643
01:07:27,682 --> 01:07:35,241
maybe UNICEF or the U.N. could kind of appoint like a community liaison who is from the Haitian community that

644
01:07:35,242 --> 01:07:41,412
can help with like allocating the funds and ensuring that the aid is being received by the communities that.

645
01:07:44,262 --> 01:07:48,432
Oh, God. Oh, really? Really. I was going to say.

646
01:07:48,432 --> 01:07:57,012
But they couldn't build stronger relationships with community leaders and the Asian community.

647
01:07:59,652 --> 01:08:07,452
They can just ask like what they would like to receive rather than just like if they just wanted vaccinations,

648
01:08:07,452 --> 01:08:11,892
then helping them get access to the vaccinations that they needed staff to

649
01:08:12,222 --> 01:08:16,862
like medical staff to develop those vaccinations like let's provide them 2%.

650
01:08:16,872 --> 01:08:23,411
Like I think it's like asking them like specifically what they really need can be better than

651
01:08:23,412 --> 01:08:28,992
just like having fun like leaders because there's always corruption when it comes to money.

652
01:08:30,952 --> 01:08:32,932
Yeah. And another partnership aspect.

653
01:08:33,562 --> 01:08:41,332
I was also going to say, to help trust, you can just make sure there's some sort of process to increase transparency.

654
01:08:41,632 --> 01:08:48,382
So that's like, okay, if money's on the way, like I don't know how it would be like a newsletter, I don't know, maybe some something about digital,

655
01:08:48,382 --> 01:08:53,181
but some way to track every step of the way, like what's happening and like when it has to be implemented,

656
01:08:53,182 --> 01:08:56,452
like where it's going that everyone can see it.

657
01:08:56,482 --> 01:09:02,721
Because typically a lot of those deals or donations happen behind closed doors and no one actually knows where it's going.

658
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:10,132
So some sort of transparency, I'm not sure what that would look like, but I think that could help to break the government down.

659
01:09:10,402 --> 01:09:13,902
Yeah, that would be good because you know, a lot or whatever.

660
01:09:14,152 --> 01:09:20,572
Oh. Oh. The government often whenever they like do contracting,

661
01:09:20,572 --> 01:09:24,442
they have to post all the documents online and then you can see the different

662
01:09:24,442 --> 01:09:28,431
stakeholders in their comments and you can as a citizen might track that.

663
01:09:28,432 --> 01:09:32,582
So that would be a great way to. Sorry.

664
01:09:33,052 --> 01:09:35,152
It's just like in the situation with the Red Cross,

665
01:09:35,152 --> 01:09:41,062
people don't know for a long time that the Red Cross only built six homes in Haiti with half a blue box.

666
01:09:41,332 --> 01:09:47,422
But yeah, if I need that money or the money, I think the money is gone.

667
01:09:47,692 --> 01:09:52,221
But you don't know what happened to it. Okay, so wait, wait. I wasn't glad you asked that, and I'm glad you raised it.

668
01:09:52,222 --> 01:09:55,762
And some question I want to ask, because it's a bit of a lead into today's case.

669
01:09:56,212 --> 01:10:02,152
So. Why does the organization choose to do that?

670
01:10:03,552 --> 01:10:06,982
Why do they like? Let's picture. Wear them for a minute.

671
01:10:07,642 --> 01:10:11,092
Why? Why would they allow that to happen? What's in their interest?

672
01:10:12,062 --> 01:10:20,432
So, you know, we we see it very clearly as an example of unethical behavior and malfeasance.

673
01:10:21,032 --> 01:10:25,412
But inside the organization, there is a board there, staff.

674
01:10:26,372 --> 01:10:29,162
But where do you think that starts to come about?

675
01:10:30,302 --> 01:10:40,712
Well, maybe they have that's from another project or some other need arises that the board, even though it's unethical,

676
01:10:40,712 --> 01:10:47,752
seems to think that they would rather allocate the money there instead of using it what it was originally intended for, even though.

677
01:10:50,122 --> 01:10:54,402
It's surprising comes. Yeah.

678
01:10:54,612 --> 01:11:01,862
I don't know how it works in the traditions. Like if you just give to the Red Cross that you can't guarantee it's going to Haiti necessarily.

679
01:11:01,872 --> 01:11:06,882
Maybe there are kind of your works for that. But I like whatever I'm saying. I just I just give to the Red Cross.

680
01:11:06,882 --> 01:11:16,892
Then they're deciding for themselves how to allocate that money, and maybe they just did decides that he didn't want to prioritize bien sur.

681
01:11:17,262 --> 01:11:23,892
He did other things with it. I think it was specifically earmarked for Haiti, but through the links, the references will probably talk to it.

682
01:11:24,342 --> 01:11:31,782
But it's going to come at the question from more of like the Red Cross's benefit as being relative.

683
01:11:31,782 --> 01:11:35,981
I'm going to say selfish, even though they they're it's just like help people in need.

684
01:11:35,982 --> 01:11:42,012
Maybe they saw that they could strategically help a different group and build a better

685
01:11:42,012 --> 01:11:47,051
partnership with someone else if they were to give a certain amount of dollars to that group.

686
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:53,652
And they just saw another way that that money could benefit them instead of the communities.

687
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:59,312
I don't know. Without giving too much away from the presentation.

688
01:11:59,672 --> 01:12:03,262
I think it's hard to know, like exactly what the intent is like.

689
01:12:03,272 --> 01:12:08,572
Obviously it looks terrible, but it could be that their board structure is like not organized,

690
01:12:08,712 --> 01:12:12,511
but they're, you know, someone has too much power or someone doesn't have enough.

691
01:12:12,512 --> 01:12:15,802
They're not like actually keeping up with meetings that they're supposed, etc.

692
01:12:16,142 --> 01:12:18,752
And so it could just be that this got lost.

693
01:12:18,752 --> 01:12:26,282
I mean, obviously, it's possible that there's content and it's like a huge mistake, but I think we don't know exactly what's going to happen.

694
01:12:26,282 --> 01:12:32,882
And I guess. Or that, you know,

695
01:12:32,882 --> 01:12:38,701
there's some there's some marketing strategy involved there that if they can show what kind of

696
01:12:38,702 --> 01:12:42,242
beautiful things they're building for people in Haiti with the money that you've given them,

697
01:12:42,452 --> 01:12:45,932
instead of showing that they've put up a thousand pop tents that are going to blow away,

698
01:12:46,712 --> 01:12:53,102
that that I feel like that might help them to sell their product to get more donors to.

699
01:12:55,012 --> 01:13:01,672
To further their, I don't know, their annual bonuses for their missions.

700
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:09,591
Yeah, I'd probably piggyback off that. I think it could have been just also bad planning.

701
01:13:09,592 --> 01:13:16,222
It's like you're spending so much money on those six houses that you didn't realize that you only have money for six houses.

702
01:13:16,822 --> 01:13:18,442
Possibly that was it.

703
01:13:19,882 --> 01:13:27,532
So I raise this question because it's a great example, and I want to, again, as we think about it, just like we do in all of our cases.

704
01:13:27,952 --> 01:13:32,662
Think about it from all the angles that you can kind of picture yourself in all these different roles.

705
01:13:33,322 --> 01:13:36,802
So where does the Red Cross get its money from, period?

706
01:13:37,522 --> 01:13:41,522
Where? Does it just get bestowed upon them?

707
01:13:41,522 --> 01:13:44,522
Like, where do they usually get their dollars? Where do we think?

708
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:54,032
And they're 990 lately and some donations like grants and donations from individual donors.

709
01:13:54,822 --> 01:13:58,362
Who else needs government? Government?

710
01:13:59,442 --> 01:14:04,052
So if I've got a whole organization set up, I don't have products that I sell.

711
01:14:04,062 --> 01:14:12,852
I don't have revenue that I can predict. I don't have, you know, you know, aside from the example of the blood bank case, you know,

712
01:14:12,852 --> 01:14:18,462
something like that, you know, I've got I've got needs that I need to fill, not needs in the community.

713
01:14:18,462 --> 01:14:25,902
I mean, staff and infrastructure and people and and and facilities and capacity.

714
01:14:26,652 --> 01:14:28,812
Keep using that. Whereas, you know,

715
01:14:29,562 --> 01:14:37,332
capacity that needs to be there in order to be able to respond to this type of a disaster so that I'm actually there so that somebody is there.

716
01:14:39,222 --> 01:14:46,092
To your point, Christiane, I was finally I got this money and, you know, I got all kinds of stuff.

717
01:14:46,552 --> 01:14:51,432
And I think it speaks you raise a good point. It is speaks directly to the challenge in this landscape,

718
01:14:51,792 --> 01:14:58,452
which is that these are not governments that are responding historically, the government that responded.

719
01:14:58,632 --> 01:15:01,632
You know, so international NGOs who talk about those kind of things.

720
01:15:01,902 --> 01:15:04,061
But at the end of the term, you know, they get involved.

721
01:15:04,062 --> 01:15:08,922
But even domestically, the government often was the one to respond to these kinds of situations.

722
01:15:08,922 --> 01:15:16,542
You know, it wasn't necessarily push it out to a nonprofit who now has the burden of having to figure out how to spend those resources, one and two,

723
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:24,972
how to make sure that they're tracking them and having people who are on staff who can do all of that tracking and it can kind of spiral quite a bit.

724
01:15:25,392 --> 01:15:31,242
So, you know, I think to your point about trust, this is a big part of trust is,

725
01:15:31,242 --> 01:15:35,262
you know, how do we create transparency and make sure that people get it,

726
01:15:35,262 --> 01:15:40,842
you know, like, hey, we're going to give them all this money and they're only going to build six houses that really we want to get into it.

727
01:15:42,142 --> 01:15:50,902
Or are they the ones who have the ear of the policy maker? You know, you can say, for example, to know as a nation, you know, hey, we've been here.

728
01:15:51,142 --> 01:15:54,172
Give it to us. You should trust us because we're the ones who are always reliable.

729
01:15:56,942 --> 01:16:02,321
Something really wrong that we should move to Andrea. Yeah. On the trust comment.

730
01:16:02,322 --> 01:16:04,952
Some something you just mentioned reminded me of this.

731
01:16:05,282 --> 01:16:11,542
Like with the federal government, whenever there is like a ruling or a policy or like a lot of things within the federal government,

732
01:16:11,612 --> 01:16:17,962
like an agency does something they like post it on, like the Federal Register and it's like open to public comment.

733
01:16:17,972 --> 01:16:22,712
So then people like they'll stop and then if they change it, they'll do it again.

734
01:16:23,012 --> 01:16:27,932
And so if they create something like that for this, that would yeah.

735
01:16:27,962 --> 01:16:36,752
Like I think that would be really helpful. Yeah. I mean, this is this is so for example, when the stimulus bill was passed in 2009.

736
01:16:37,172 --> 01:16:48,742
Um. So to quote the presentation a few weeks ago, long, long ago, when none of us could potentially remember when the stimulus bill was passed.

737
01:16:51,232 --> 01:16:54,891
There was oversight over the spending of those dollars.

738
01:16:54,892 --> 01:16:58,972
So at the time, it was Vice President Biden who was responsible for overseeing that.

739
01:16:59,422 --> 01:17:02,982
But they've done the same in the way with the COVID relief dollars.

740
01:17:02,992 --> 01:17:09,292
We'll see how it pans out. But, you know, watching and seeing, because, Christiane, you bring up a great point.

741
01:17:09,682 --> 01:17:14,362
Six houses for all that money. That's. You know, how can you explain that?

742
01:17:14,542 --> 01:17:20,002
So so, you know, it creates accountability, whereas the dollars are not just kind of flowing out.

743
01:17:20,012 --> 01:17:26,962
This government is responsible to be accountable in the sense that it's by law it must be transparent, or at least it's supposed to be.

744
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:31,102
Um, so, you know, these are private entities.

745
01:17:35,662 --> 01:17:40,322
Great presentations. All right.

746
01:17:40,342 --> 01:17:44,632
Get me all fired up by room. Your shirt with your slides.

747
01:17:44,882 --> 01:17:52,192
You play. Yes, sure.

748
01:17:52,412 --> 01:18:03,672
And wherever anyone wants to present, you are welcome. And you can sit from where you are here, where everything is because you're the only one.

749
01:18:05,032 --> 01:18:17,422
Okay. So we, in fact, current event presentation on this and and Habitat for Humanity as a hurricane in as a Category four hurricane.

750
01:18:17,932 --> 01:18:29,802
And it made landfall near Cayo Costa in southwest Florida on September 28, 2022, as a Category four hurricane.

751
01:18:29,812 --> 01:18:37,582
And this means that. All right. Well, this one specifically has maximum sustained winds of 155 miles per hour.

752
01:18:37,972 --> 01:18:42,142
And the category five actually starts from 157.

753
01:18:42,142 --> 01:18:46,162
This is really close to being a Category five. You don't know much about hurricanes.

754
01:18:46,162 --> 01:18:49,542
Neither do I. You have categories one, three, five, five.

755
01:18:49,552 --> 01:18:53,002
Being destructive, strong gets you.

756
01:18:54,652 --> 01:19:00,862
So, yeah, after I hit Florida, I made its second landfall near Georgetown, South Carolina, as a Category one hurricane.

757
01:19:00,862 --> 01:19:05,352
So it died down a little bit. The death toll is still counting.

758
01:19:05,362 --> 01:19:09,612
When you look at hurricane death tolls, they calculate by us.

759
01:19:09,622 --> 01:19:16,721
And that's and then as are calculated pretty much after that from the aftermath of the storms.

760
01:19:16,722 --> 01:19:19,882
So like flooding and stuff like that.

761
01:19:20,872 --> 01:19:24,472
So it's in Florida, it's 105 that's right now.

762
01:19:24,922 --> 01:19:30,922
So which is a big deal. And they say that Florida.

763
01:19:32,462 --> 01:19:43,621
That hurricane that we're starting to have Florida since the 1935, really long time ago as a result of the hurricane, we see property damage.

764
01:19:43,622 --> 01:19:46,742
We see power and water outages.

765
01:19:47,792 --> 01:19:55,762
That's. These are some of the images from Florida.

766
01:19:55,792 --> 01:20:00,382
The coastline is the part of the damage that has happened.

767
01:20:02,852 --> 01:20:06,902
So I want to talk about Florida's housing crisis before the hurricane.

768
01:20:08,042 --> 01:20:14,942
And earlier this year, the Florida Housing Coalition estimated that there is a statewide deficit of 500,000

769
01:20:15,422 --> 01:20:21,542
homes that are affordable to lower income middle income families before Hurricane Ian.

770
01:20:22,862 --> 01:20:27,602
Florida has been or has already been experiencing housing costs, burden and rising rents.

771
01:20:28,172 --> 01:20:34,891
So over 21 million low income Florida households pay more than 30% of their income

772
01:20:34,892 --> 01:20:45,452
source housing and 30% as opposed to the maximum percentage for adequate housing,

773
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:56,731
affordable housing. And with over half with 1.2 million low income households paying more than 50%, so high, high housing costs.

774
01:20:56,732 --> 01:21:04,772
Very high rents. Brighton, Florida has only 25 affordable and available rental units for every extremely low income renters.

775
01:21:05,682 --> 01:21:09,302
And homelessness has decreased over the time year.

776
01:21:09,312 --> 01:21:11,462
But obviously with a hurricane,

777
01:21:11,472 --> 01:21:23,442
a lot of people have right now on the streets and going to shelters or their friend's place or other people from different organizations.

778
01:21:25,772 --> 01:21:32,102
So Habitat for Humanity International is if I go and see three members of the organization.

779
01:21:32,932 --> 01:21:38,222
It was founded in 1976 and its first headquarters are located in Georgia.

780
01:21:39,452 --> 01:21:44,942
Its mission is to seek or seeking to put in action.

781
01:21:45,812 --> 01:21:54,392
And it brings people together to build homes. And it's created Christian values principles.

782
01:21:54,702 --> 01:21:59,772
Do you have a statement on why I say always?

783
01:22:01,722 --> 01:22:09,872
Anyway, the organization has a lot of chapters working in local communities across all 50 states and 70 countries in the world.

784
01:22:10,242 --> 01:22:14,392
So very big organization. Um.

785
01:22:16,042 --> 01:22:22,342
They primarily serve low to moderate income individuals and families in need for safe, affordable housing.

786
01:22:22,822 --> 01:22:28,132
And they partner with those in the community and all over the world to help build and improve housing condition.

787
01:22:30,232 --> 01:22:34,502
So these are some of the services that the organization provides.

788
01:22:35,342 --> 01:22:46,862
They do repair and renovate existing housing that they've worked with, Habitat affiliates and the community they help.

789
01:22:47,702 --> 01:22:53,611
So what they do is they help the families build the homes,

790
01:22:53,612 --> 01:23:01,562
but also like more time like for you to financial plan that they can sustain themselves after they get home.

791
01:23:02,582 --> 01:23:07,862
They also do a lot of advocacy for advocacy work for housing policies,

792
01:23:08,852 --> 01:23:16,712
and they do work in natural disasters where this is relevant to donations as well.

793
01:23:18,282 --> 01:23:25,002
So I want to focus more on Habitat for Humanity in Florida, because hurricane can happen in Florida.

794
01:23:25,992 --> 01:23:36,792
But before the hurricane, organization has built more than 60,000 homes in Florida for safe, adequate and safe adequate housing.

795
01:23:40,872 --> 01:23:50,382
So in response, Habitat, Florida, they've been trying to assess the long term housing and disaster recovery needs of Florida community stuff,

796
01:23:50,382 --> 01:23:58,961
as stated by Christine and the experts operating with partner organizations to gather all the emergency supplies such as water,

797
01:23:58,962 --> 01:24:03,822
food, hygiene products, etc. and.

798
01:24:05,812 --> 01:24:13,492
There. Well, right now it's still not safe to enter for other help than to build houses necessarily.

799
01:24:13,492 --> 01:24:18,472
So that's the short term goal right now to provide like that first kind of aid.

800
01:24:19,372 --> 01:24:27,562
But housing, housing organization, they have their long term goals for recovery efforts and it's meeting,

801
01:24:28,162 --> 01:24:32,902
it's helping to build affordable housing and helping to rebuild them.

802
01:24:33,492 --> 01:24:43,682
And also and cases of places and cases that areas are hit with natural disasters, but making sure that the homes are disaster.

803
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:54,172
So first the special question What kind of conflicts may arise between public

804
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:58,342
agencies and nonprofit organizations in disaster operations relief efforts?

805
01:24:58,792 --> 01:25:08,842
So for the aid of Hurricane Irene in Florida, obviously habitat for mankind is not the only organization that's coming in to help.

806
01:25:09,202 --> 01:25:14,092
You see a vision across all of these other nonprofit organizations.

807
01:25:14,992 --> 01:25:19,302
So I think this question was kind of geared towards like, how would.

808
01:25:20,562 --> 01:25:28,932
Conflict. How might conflict arise when you have multiple nonprofit organizations coming in to provide or if there is any conflict?

809
01:25:35,402 --> 01:25:38,942
If I might add to your question, which is it's a great question to start us with.

810
01:25:39,782 --> 01:25:46,652
I want everyone to maybe think also about the large versus the small organizations against the dollars.

811
01:25:48,482 --> 01:25:59,132
So let's say I'm an organization that's smaller, that can do a great service for the people who are affected by a disaster like this.

812
01:25:59,972 --> 01:26:06,482
Do I have a seat at the table, so to speak, to get to those who are in leadership who are deciding, okay,

813
01:26:06,482 --> 01:26:12,422
we've got $1,000,000,000 from FEMA, we're going to give 300 million a year, 200 million here and 20 million here.

814
01:26:20,122 --> 01:26:26,551
I could see conflicts arising between organizations versus larger organizations

815
01:26:26,552 --> 01:26:29,632
because I feel like local organizations generally know the area better.

816
01:26:30,142 --> 01:26:39,412
And then when larger organizations come in, they don't really or they may not take direction from the smaller local organizations

817
01:26:39,412 --> 01:26:43,732
and they probably will have more money because they're a bigger player.

818
01:26:45,142 --> 01:26:48,622
I can see there being caught between the two because.

819
01:26:50,992 --> 01:26:55,792
I think we've seen like a thousand times of organizations doing things that aren't necessary,

820
01:26:56,212 --> 01:27:00,112
especially after times of crisis, just because they have money to spend.

821
01:27:03,212 --> 01:27:13,962
Christina I was going to say I found some sort of timeliness after her experience or so.

822
01:27:13,982 --> 01:27:20,672
Like, I think it will just be like conflict to who can deliver services first.

823
01:27:21,682 --> 01:27:28,302
I think that's where a lot of the conflict will come from. And I think like bigger agencies have more capacity to get their first stuff.

824
01:27:29,202 --> 01:27:32,641
So back to I'm going to connect the dots between the two presentations.

825
01:27:32,642 --> 01:27:38,132
So back to what you're talking about with Christina's presentation. Where we left off at that last question.

826
01:27:38,522 --> 01:27:42,812
So six houses. How much money was it that they got? About half a billion.

827
01:27:42,872 --> 01:27:47,192
Half a billion dollars. Okay. So $500 million comes in and they build six houses, but.

828
01:27:47,582 --> 01:27:50,942
Right. But then ask, are they there?

829
01:27:51,122 --> 01:27:54,992
Meaning, are they prepared to be present on the ground?

830
01:27:55,802 --> 01:27:59,132
Are they are they in existence?

831
01:27:59,132 --> 01:28:02,851
Meaning they didn't go out of business, meaning they you know, they have staff.

832
01:28:02,852 --> 01:28:08,262
They have people. You know, so this is the tension that many of these organizations.

833
01:28:08,612 --> 01:28:13,172
You know, they've got infrastructure built. So when it happens to your point of view, you have to get right on it.

834
01:28:14,732 --> 01:28:21,122
So, you know, how maybe is the question, but that is part of their strategy to say, well,

835
01:28:21,362 --> 01:28:26,342
we got to make sure we get all those dollars in so that we're staffed and ready to be able to leave.

836
01:28:26,502 --> 01:28:29,641
So, again, I'm not making a judgment on.

837
01:28:29,642 --> 01:28:34,262
Yes, right or wrong. I'm just saying, how do we get into their psychology to go ahead?

838
01:28:34,622 --> 01:28:41,372
And I was also just thinking, like, I think people are also more likely to give to a bigger public agency.

839
01:28:42,512 --> 01:28:46,672
And I think people are more likely to trust because I heard it's really devastating.

840
01:28:46,682 --> 01:28:51,152
So, like, you're just going to trust to, you know, like has somebody tell you right now we're going to be there?

841
01:28:51,422 --> 01:28:55,471
So I think, like, there's definitely going to be a lack of support, definitely.

842
01:28:55,472 --> 01:29:00,462
But there would likely be a lack of support for smaller organizations and nonprofits during this time.

843
01:29:00,462 --> 01:29:04,502
But maybe they can shift their efforts to like stabilization.

844
01:29:06,542 --> 01:29:11,072
I guess maybe reserving some of the funds to say, you know what? Well, you know, you don't need all of that.

845
01:29:11,552 --> 01:29:16,052
So we're going to hold on to some to make sure that some of these smaller organizations, they get a piece of this.

846
01:29:17,422 --> 01:29:26,372
Anyone else. And I have this question. I was also kind of thinking more about like coordination efforts and organizations like how would

847
01:29:26,372 --> 01:29:32,072
you divvy up the area or what type is one just kind of one specific area like resource allocation?

848
01:29:33,332 --> 01:29:37,322
Yeah, I, I kind of I like this question.

849
01:29:37,472 --> 01:29:44,942
And I think it's interesting because this idea of like who gets what, when, and then also like the supply chain aspect of it,

850
01:29:44,942 --> 01:29:51,322
even though it's business, but like the idea of like called last mile I think is when they call it.

851
01:29:51,332 --> 01:29:58,622
And I think that small local nonprofits have like a really great potential to actually get at that final mile, which is often like the hardest part.

852
01:29:59,012 --> 01:30:05,882
So it's interesting to see like, do they even have the capacity to look at like the framework and be able to say,

853
01:30:05,882 --> 01:30:10,952
well, this person, this organization will be best in this area. This organization will be able to like finance.

854
01:30:11,942 --> 01:30:16,152
ET cetera. Or yeah, whether or not they would be able to do that.

855
01:30:16,202 --> 01:30:22,472
So I could see something like FEMA, which has a lot of experience in natural disasters, doing that very well.

856
01:30:22,532 --> 01:30:28,312
But it's not complicated. Move on to the next question.

857
01:30:29,602 --> 01:30:32,272
What is the fact that she came by government agencies?

858
01:30:32,272 --> 01:30:39,682
When we have organizations willing to lobby Congress and a state and local legislature to increase agency funding,

859
01:30:40,342 --> 01:30:45,172
public policies, responsibilities to authorities and facilitate the work.

860
01:30:45,832 --> 01:30:52,432
So this doesn't necessarily like with natural disasters per se,

861
01:30:52,462 --> 01:31:02,352
but just because Habitat for Humanity is a housing organization and they did a lot of the work and lobbying in the fiscal year of 21,

862
01:31:02,362 --> 01:31:05,842
they helped enact 800 policies on housing.

863
01:31:06,862 --> 01:31:14,741
So. And I guess just the question of like the how we talked about this couple other causes.

864
01:31:14,742 --> 01:31:19,562
I'm like, why can't the government just do the right thing? Or I can't they just do it right.

865
01:31:20,662 --> 01:31:25,002
So like, what do you think the government needs?

866
01:31:27,422 --> 01:31:30,902
I think that was probably seamless with.

867
01:31:33,462 --> 01:31:38,592
I think it was every Republican from Florida voted no on the.

868
01:31:41,482 --> 01:31:45,432
Funding to help fund natural disasters they had asked for.

869
01:31:45,442 --> 01:31:51,351
And so I think the Florida government is gaining a lot of this is gaining a lot

870
01:31:51,352 --> 01:31:55,551
from having these nonprofits ask for money and things because they voted no on it,

871
01:31:55,552 --> 01:32:01,552
but now they need the money. So it's like having these nonprofits and other people coming in and asking for money,

872
01:32:02,662 --> 01:32:09,051
which really gives those people up on a no and out I angel from the government.

873
01:32:09,052 --> 01:32:15,832
But they don't have to use their own government funding these things and push one more degree on this question too,

874
01:32:16,282 --> 01:32:21,712
which is if the government is not in the business of doing any of this work,

875
01:32:22,372 --> 01:32:29,092
meaning it's all farmed out to nonprofits so the government doesn't have a whole lot of direct service that it's offering.

876
01:32:30,622 --> 01:32:36,152
How much are lawmakers then really even caring about how all this goes?

877
01:32:36,202 --> 01:32:41,782
Given that their day to day job doesn't have much to do with how well things happen for any of this,

878
01:32:42,562 --> 01:32:46,462
it's all offloaded onto, you know, did we pass enough money to be spent?

879
01:32:46,882 --> 01:32:53,422
But now the actual delivery of it, the responsibility of how well it went, it just goes to all these organizations.

880
01:32:54,022 --> 01:32:58,312
So, you know, the more the government is not directly in there being responsible,

881
01:32:58,732 --> 01:33:03,891
how much then does it really give them any reason to the point you're making about,

882
01:33:03,892 --> 01:33:08,032
you know, they voted no on it and now they're looking for all the dollars from the non-profits.

883
01:33:08,482 --> 01:33:13,221
Why did they think that it was okay to vote no? I mean, it's politics.

884
01:33:13,222 --> 01:33:19,132
Yes. But, you know, if they were responsible, though, they were responsible and they weren't there to respond,

885
01:33:19,612 --> 01:33:24,742
then there is a different political arrangement. Right now, they're not they're out there.

886
01:33:24,922 --> 01:33:33,222
They're not responding. I think we saw that a bit with the Kobe piece at the beginning.

887
01:33:33,882 --> 01:33:39,932
The only entity that really good responders, the government, the nonprofits could do something that the government needed to respond.

888
01:33:39,942 --> 01:33:49,632
And it was just not responding. But yeah, I think deflection is a huge part of that because it's like they're able to say,

889
01:33:50,202 --> 01:33:54,522
you know, anything in this instance, I like emergency funding.

890
01:33:54,552 --> 01:33:59,022
They're saying we don't believe in big government, etc., etc.

891
01:33:59,622 --> 01:34:05,652
And so we've known this. And now, you know, I, I love the video personally.

892
01:34:05,802 --> 01:34:08,502
Ron DeSantis sitting there with his head down, looking at the crowd,

893
01:34:08,512 --> 01:34:16,752
asking for monetary signing thing because it was like they felt like they could say, no, we hate big government, we hate having all this money.

894
01:34:16,812 --> 01:34:22,032
But when it comes down to it, the people that are living here are the ones that are voting them back into office.

895
01:34:22,032 --> 01:34:29,112
And so they should always be the people, you know, whether there is enough money sent or not, whether that actually happens or not.

896
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:35,212
I think we're seeing that change. It happens in the last four or five years.

897
01:34:37,372 --> 01:34:42,952
But by giving the money for COVID, I guess Trump said it's the state's fault.

898
01:34:43,342 --> 01:34:50,392
The state can do what they want with COVID now, and so it's like deflecting the responsibility away from them to state leaders.

899
01:34:50,872 --> 01:34:53,512
I think that's the same thing that's happening here. It's like deflecting.

900
01:34:54,412 --> 01:35:02,762
From their responsibility as lawmakers to nonprofits like, well, the nonprofits in doing what we can.

901
01:35:08,852 --> 01:35:15,792
Closing thoughts is an excellent another excellent presentation. Thank you.

902
01:35:19,742 --> 01:35:28,302
So I want to I want to just commend all of our presenters for today and Andrea for for really bringing us timely,

903
01:35:28,602 --> 01:35:33,971
very timely current events to help us contextualize these issues.

904
01:35:33,972 --> 01:35:38,622
And I hope through our discussion of these current events, you're seeing not just, you know, what's going on in the news,

905
01:35:38,622 --> 01:35:46,962
but very much connecting why the nonprofits are involved to begin with, what their role is and how central they are.

906
01:35:47,262 --> 01:35:52,212
So all of the health services that are getting delivered inside of these various systems.

907
01:35:52,602 --> 01:35:55,602
And it's not just the government that's dealing with all of this,

908
01:35:55,602 --> 01:36:00,822
that it's organizations have to make decisions but have to stand behind those decisions and contend with them.

909
01:36:01,452 --> 01:36:10,272
All right. I'm going to jump back here and then we'll get to our break. All right.

910
01:36:10,482 --> 01:36:17,232
So tell me about relationships, Capacidad strategic partnerships, alliances.

911
01:36:17,532 --> 01:36:23,712
So we think about these as relationships where organizations are competing against each other for these scarce resources.

912
01:36:23,712 --> 01:36:30,132
But you've talked quite a bit about the relationship for collaboration is often where things are mutually dependent.

913
01:36:30,132 --> 01:36:36,732
So Andrea's question and cases, it's a great setup for this because this idea of how are we collaborating?

914
01:36:37,002 --> 01:36:43,002
And that first question, you know, how are these organizations working together so we can see philanthropic collaborations,

915
01:36:43,782 --> 01:36:49,032
commercial collaborations, things where operations might benefit to different organizations.

916
01:36:49,722 --> 01:36:57,522
But we also see situations where organizations are competing against and at the same time cooperating with each other.

917
01:36:58,302 --> 01:37:02,832
So we might see an organization that is delivering on a service in one category,

918
01:37:04,032 --> 01:37:10,662
but it is also cooperating because it's in the same zone or sector with the other competitors in the environment.

919
01:37:12,292 --> 01:37:16,852
So there's a broad spectrum of these types of relationships that I want you to keep in mind.

920
01:37:17,572 --> 01:37:25,672
Sometimes we might see that there's no relationship, so it's arm's length negotiation between organizations.

921
01:37:26,152 --> 01:37:32,322
Sometimes we'll see there's an agreement to collaborate and it kind of goes all through, you know,

922
01:37:32,422 --> 01:37:38,902
where we see, you know, organizations becoming, in fact, wholly owned subsidiaries of another partner.

923
01:37:40,282 --> 01:37:47,632
So we use this term stakeholder a lot. And I want to just kind of give you sort of different examples of stakeholders customers,

924
01:37:47,632 --> 01:37:53,571
users, inventors, shareholders, the media, the governments, trade groups, community groups.

925
01:37:53,572 --> 01:38:02,002
These are all stakeholders that you might see. And the relationship between these stakeholders is quite extensive.

926
01:38:03,552 --> 01:38:12,732
Now in health care delivery. Specifically, we are seeing that we are moving toward a scenario where we're looking for comprehensive quick care,

927
01:38:13,002 --> 01:38:17,352
which is requiring both cooperation and then at the same time, collaboration.

928
01:38:18,012 --> 01:38:24,341
So we have to make deliberate arrangements and relationships in order to properly market our services,

929
01:38:24,342 --> 01:38:27,552
in order to properly deliver on what we're saying we're going to do.

930
01:38:28,062 --> 01:38:33,672
And this is now where we start to see growth in integration among health care

931
01:38:33,672 --> 01:38:38,382
organizations specifically and more complexity in the contractual arrangements.

932
01:38:38,832 --> 01:38:45,822
Well, I might have just seen that Beaumont and Spectrum merged, and it announced today their new newly formed health system,

933
01:38:46,362 --> 01:38:53,862
two large nonprofits that that sat down and said, all right, we have a reason that we're going to make one unit out, one organization.

934
01:38:55,192 --> 01:39:02,632
This brings us to another organizational theory piece, which which is a term that we use often and or a theory called transaction costs.

935
01:39:02,962 --> 01:39:06,832
So the costs that we have to maintain a relationship.

936
01:39:07,522 --> 01:39:12,141
So when I contract with someone, when I subcontract with someone,

937
01:39:12,142 --> 01:39:17,572
when I hire someone outside of my organization to do something, there's a transaction cost.

938
01:39:18,082 --> 01:39:22,102
It costs money to have a contract with them. It costs money to work with them.

939
01:39:22,252 --> 01:39:28,042
It costs money to have their people come in and have to get trained to work with me.

940
01:39:28,912 --> 01:39:32,482
So the costs of organizing additional transactions, they go up.

941
01:39:33,732 --> 01:39:41,652
And they start to become a barrier potentially for firms to be able to deliver.

942
01:39:42,512 --> 01:39:47,282
So we see a tension in organizational theory between transaction cost economics.

943
01:39:47,282 --> 01:39:55,471
So where do we see that we're looking to minimize these transaction costs and the concept of vertical integration or horizontal integration,

944
01:39:55,472 --> 01:39:58,202
but specifically vertical integration where an organization says,

945
01:39:58,202 --> 01:40:01,952
you know what, rather than have this delivered by this person, this little guy, this, this,

946
01:40:01,952 --> 01:40:05,172
delivered by that, instead of collaborating, we're just going to bring it all inside.

947
01:40:07,132 --> 01:40:13,322
So the theory here is connected to this idea of theory of the firm.

948
01:40:13,352 --> 01:40:15,681
It's the classical theory of man, of natural.

949
01:40:15,682 --> 01:40:22,012
Again, when I say classical, I mean because historically it has been pointed to quite a bit and with all theory,

950
01:40:22,042 --> 01:40:27,712
like to always say doesn't necessarily reflect how we view issues of management.

951
01:40:27,742 --> 01:40:35,272
Now with our with our lines that we've set together as a learning community but again, one that historically see about.

952
01:40:37,102 --> 01:40:42,172
So the idea of transaction cost economics are that transaction costs have these three dimensions.

953
01:40:42,562 --> 01:40:46,582
There's a frequency to them. There's a degree of asset specificity.

954
01:40:46,762 --> 01:40:53,752
Asset specificity, meaning the thing that I'm getting, the entity I'm getting has a specific, tangible use to it.

955
01:40:55,042 --> 01:40:58,972
So I need a computer system in order to deliver my program.

956
01:40:59,482 --> 01:41:02,572
There's a specificity to that asset that I require.

957
01:41:03,502 --> 01:41:07,522
And then there's a degree of uncertainty. I don't know whether or not I don't need it.

958
01:41:07,792 --> 01:41:10,862
Maybe I do. Maybe I don't. Maybe it will help me.

959
01:41:10,882 --> 01:41:14,492
Maybe it won't. There's no direct answer. We think there is.

960
01:41:14,512 --> 01:41:19,522
We say, Yeah, we have this all automated. It will be great. Then we automated all and then we go, Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

961
01:41:19,612 --> 01:41:27,952
That didn't work. So there's uncertainty to them. So our mission, we say then is bounded.

962
01:41:28,342 --> 01:41:31,372
It's subject to bounded rationality opportunities.

963
01:41:31,372 --> 01:41:39,892
And these are all sort of concepts that we draw from economics, especially in organizational theory that draws on sociology and economics,

964
01:41:40,762 --> 01:41:46,641
but individual preferences that are endogenous or that are internal to that person or that

965
01:41:46,642 --> 01:41:54,802
entity are products of how we conditioned those of those people to socially interact.

966
01:41:55,702 --> 01:42:02,362
So at its core that adapting where we talked about earlier, this organizational ecology,

967
01:42:02,782 --> 01:42:07,882
that adaptation is required to respond to the environmental pressures and transaction costs.

968
01:42:07,882 --> 01:42:12,892
Economics adaptation is the central problem of the economic organization.

969
01:42:14,262 --> 01:42:17,862
The adaptations can be autonomous, meaning they're just kind of happening.

970
01:42:18,402 --> 01:42:22,632
They can be the product of cooperation or they're a hybridization.

971
01:42:23,582 --> 01:42:28,292
So what I want you to kind of keep in mind is the idea of a trade off.

972
01:42:28,682 --> 01:42:32,852
Every transaction that I make or initiate with an organization is a trade.

973
01:42:33,572 --> 01:42:36,632
I decide to make a partnership with someone. I got a trade.

974
01:42:37,232 --> 01:42:40,732
Now I'm in partnership. I get something, but I'm also maybe giving something up.

975
01:42:42,582 --> 01:42:44,142
Resource dependency theory.

976
01:42:44,462 --> 01:42:52,721
Another theory that we that we can point to is that organizations exchange resources with the environment that they're in and

977
01:42:52,722 --> 01:43:00,222
that organizations are seeking to establish relationships with other organizations to obtain the scarce resources that exist.

978
01:43:00,732 --> 01:43:04,422
So the goal here is for the organization to have sufficient power.

979
01:43:04,752 --> 01:43:09,551
And that's the key term with this particular theory of theoretical concept is the power of

980
01:43:09,552 --> 01:43:15,162
the power to influence the environment so that those scarce resources are available to them.

981
01:43:16,422 --> 01:43:24,522
So we see strategic partnerships, those that we might see, where contracts that specify performance characteristics, etc.,

982
01:43:24,912 --> 01:43:32,682
are distinct from joint ventures, where we have capital investment from both partners and joint governance or management.

983
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:37,832
We also see mergers. So mergers being irreversible.

984
01:43:37,982 --> 01:43:45,482
So it's two entities. Now it's one versus an acquisition where it's irreversible, like a merger.

985
01:43:45,752 --> 01:43:49,802
But one if the existing entity totally acquires the other.

986
01:43:50,252 --> 01:44:00,242
So in a merger, some of the governance from each may be retained in a in an acquisition, the whole test chain of governance kind of goes away.

987
01:44:02,102 --> 01:44:05,942
So in health care organizations, specifically health care delivery organizations,

988
01:44:05,942 --> 01:44:14,242
here's kind of a list for you you can take a look at for, you know, the different ways where you can see the arrangements.

989
01:44:14,272 --> 01:44:18,601
I use these just as a proxy because nonprofits behave in a very similar way in

990
01:44:18,602 --> 01:44:23,552
terms of how they think about these types of services that they're delivering.

991
01:44:23,972 --> 01:44:27,092
So let's take, for example, primary care in health care delivery.

992
01:44:27,092 --> 01:44:30,662
Primary care is delivered through independent physician groups.

993
01:44:32,002 --> 01:44:39,562
Alternatively, we could see a joint venture where the physician owners might employ other physicians.

994
01:44:40,252 --> 01:44:44,632
So you can think about this by extension into the nonprofits that are delivering other services.

995
01:44:45,822 --> 01:44:52,212
Maybe I'm delivering food. You know, I have a food thing that I that I deliver.

996
01:44:52,542 --> 01:44:55,942
So where do I get the food? There's transaction costs associated with it.

997
01:44:55,962 --> 01:45:04,822
Or do I decide to now open up my own farm and create my own supply of the food instead of having to rely on someone else to provide me?

998
01:45:06,372 --> 01:45:09,462
I commented on vertical and horizontal integration.

999
01:45:09,732 --> 01:45:17,352
The concept here is that vertical integration means that I'm absorbing all the parts of the supply chain inside my own organization,

1000
01:45:17,682 --> 01:45:24,001
horizontal meaning that different parts of the same are kind of becoming integrated with each other across.

1001
01:45:24,002 --> 01:45:29,392
Different. So we have to ask ourselves then if we're going to partner, is there fit?

1002
01:45:29,902 --> 01:45:33,142
Are there going to be gaps in service? How are we going to brand that?

1003
01:45:33,562 --> 01:45:37,642
What efficiency can we create? What access to care will there be?

1004
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:42,592
What's the market share of is that will enhance population health?

1005
01:45:43,132 --> 01:45:49,762
Where geographically will this allow us to serve? These are all questions that we ask when we're thinking about establishing a partnership.

1006
01:45:52,582 --> 01:45:59,962
The competing values framework, again, is another way of thinking about this, where we think about team culture, hierarchical culture.

1007
01:46:00,622 --> 01:46:07,192
So how cohesive is the team? What clear lines of authority are there around organizational processes?

1008
01:46:07,912 --> 01:46:15,562
What rationality? So this rational culture here, you know, have clear tasks and then an entrepreneurial culture.

1009
01:46:15,772 --> 01:46:24,292
So across these different axes, you can see that as I move toward more control and I'm becoming more internal here,

1010
01:46:24,292 --> 01:46:31,592
I'm entering a more hierarchical environment. So how do I then start to think about engaging stakeholders?

1011
01:46:31,772 --> 01:46:34,802
Here's a here's a particular way that you can think about it.

1012
01:46:35,372 --> 01:46:40,412
So first we have to think about engagement. We have to set a vision for how we're going to engage together.

1013
01:46:41,132 --> 01:46:45,722
Step two, we have to map the stakeholders. Remember back to that slide on the stakeholders.

1014
01:46:45,992 --> 01:46:49,922
You know, who are we going to prioritize? Who are we going to try to get involved?

1015
01:46:51,042 --> 01:46:54,552
Then we have to prepare. So we've got to think about our long term goals.

1016
01:46:55,062 --> 01:46:59,502
And then then from there, determine our logistics for how we're going to engage.

1017
01:47:00,462 --> 01:47:05,171
Then step four, we engage. So the engagement itself takes place.

1018
01:47:05,172 --> 01:47:12,372
We're ensuring equitable contributions or mitigating tension while different parties are involved.

1019
01:47:12,732 --> 01:47:16,992
And then we start to see an action platform. So we start to create feedback.

1020
01:47:17,262 --> 01:47:21,552
We start to create ways for us to revisit our goals and take those next steps.

1021
01:47:22,432 --> 01:47:32,241
So across health care delivery organizations here, today's word capacity speaks to hear kind of the specifics in a health care delivery organization,

1022
01:47:32,242 --> 01:47:38,752
specifically the you know, these are the types of ways we think about them.

1023
01:47:39,082 --> 01:47:44,122
You know, what is their capacity? You know, what physical assets, ownership, personnel, etc., do they have?

1024
01:47:44,602 --> 01:47:48,442
What's the organizational structure? What are their finances?

1025
01:47:49,072 --> 01:47:52,912
If they're delivering services, how are they engaging with patients?

1026
01:47:53,242 --> 01:47:57,172
What care processes are set up? What's the culture inside the organization?

1027
01:47:58,012 --> 01:48:02,032
Which leads us into our next topic, which is sort of this idea of finance.

1028
01:48:02,602 --> 01:48:08,032
I just wondered kind of broadly, you've done quite a bit of work already on the financial components of these organizations in your first assignment.

1029
01:48:08,392 --> 01:48:12,352
So I just want to give you kind of some some key issues. I want you to just keep in mind with finance.

1030
01:48:13,082 --> 01:48:16,712
So we have to think about budgets in these organizations.

1031
01:48:16,722 --> 01:48:24,992
There are three types typically an operating budget, which tracks the revenue and expense in the organization, the capital budget,

1032
01:48:25,322 --> 01:48:33,992
the purchase or sale of the long term assets, so the building, the equipment, etc., and then the cash budget that's tracking our cash flow.

1033
01:48:34,412 --> 01:48:39,152
So very often the organization will rely on its operating budget to decide what to do for the year.

1034
01:48:39,512 --> 01:48:43,922
It will rely on its capital budget to understand what long term decisions it's going to make.

1035
01:48:44,312 --> 01:48:53,822
And then day to day it will rely on its cash budget to say, okay, I can't do X today because it means I'm going to be short next week or next month.

1036
01:48:55,962 --> 01:49:00,851
The budget is a financial document, but it also very importantly, very, very importantly,

1037
01:49:00,852 --> 01:49:07,062
has political implications for how my organization chooses to budget, reflects what my core values are.

1038
01:49:07,572 --> 01:49:11,112
If I am prioritizing a more diverse workforce,

1039
01:49:11,502 --> 01:49:19,032
if I am prioritizing a mission that's going to reduce pressures that have caused oppression in a particular community,

1040
01:49:19,602 --> 01:49:22,462
then I'm likely going to reflect that in my budget.

1041
01:49:22,482 --> 01:49:31,332
If my budget doesn't reflect it, then it's likely not necessarily central to what it is that I'm claiming to be pursuing.

1042
01:49:32,142 --> 01:49:39,402
So we'll see some insight. We can get insight into what the strategic plan is and those priorities by looking at the

1043
01:49:39,402 --> 01:49:44,442
budget and we'll start to see this push and pull inside the organization's politics.

1044
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:48,132
What's the board's perspective? The staff perspective? The donors?

1045
01:49:49,782 --> 01:49:52,242
Primarily, though, as the resources are limited,

1046
01:49:53,112 --> 01:50:01,902
we start to see the competition that emerges between departments or departments are really looking to try and get to what it is they want.

1047
01:50:02,292 --> 01:50:08,922
So where these funds are allocated reveals for us the nexus of power inside the organization.

1048
01:50:09,432 --> 01:50:14,672
If more of the dollars are going to the marketing department, that's probably because the marketing department carries more power right now.

1049
01:50:14,692 --> 01:50:20,802
The organization. Again, as we talk about every week, nothing is right or wrong.

1050
01:50:21,012 --> 01:50:29,562
It just we have to look at it, examine it and say, is this the direction the organization ought to be heading or not based on our assessment?

1051
01:50:31,342 --> 01:50:36,722
So leadership uses budgets in different ways to incentivize behavior, just incentivize behavior.

1052
01:50:36,742 --> 01:50:40,102
Sometimes we have this concept called you call the use it or lose it.

1053
01:50:40,102 --> 01:50:43,232
Meaning if funds are left over, they go back to the general fund.

1054
01:50:43,252 --> 01:50:49,702
You don't get to have them. So sometimes you'll see departments are on a spending spree at the end of the year or the end of the fiscal year to say,

1055
01:50:49,702 --> 01:50:59,842
okay, we've got to spend it all down before we lose access to it. And then sometimes, you know, leadership can reprioritize those funds.

1056
01:51:01,552 --> 01:51:07,912
Organizational budgets are constructed from revenue where it is generated by

1057
01:51:07,912 --> 01:51:11,722
the organization and then allocated by leadership to different departments.

1058
01:51:12,742 --> 01:51:18,232
A central budgeting process is one where revenue is generated by each department or center,

1059
01:51:18,442 --> 01:51:22,492
and it leads to a more entrepreneurial approach to raising revenue.

1060
01:51:23,092 --> 01:51:28,192
So in organizational budgeting, the organizational leadership is going to decide the priorities.

1061
01:51:28,222 --> 01:51:32,422
We see this very often in large corporations, especially large corporate nonprofits.

1062
01:51:33,062 --> 01:51:36,132
Leadership says this is our priority for this year.

1063
01:51:36,162 --> 01:51:42,312
That's it. It's going to go down and that's what we're doing. Versus a more decentralized nonprofit.

1064
01:51:42,732 --> 01:51:46,362
The university is a great example of a center based budgeting model.

1065
01:51:46,812 --> 01:51:53,592
Each school or college has its own budget, and it makes decisions on what it wants to spend those dollars on.

1066
01:51:55,952 --> 01:52:02,342
We also see the term incremental budgeting where we add perhaps a percentage to last year's budget.

1067
01:52:02,762 --> 01:52:11,102
So let's say, for example, you've got a department budget that was half, half a million dollars in the following fiscal year.

1068
01:52:11,102 --> 01:52:14,852
They're going to increase their budget to $515,000.

1069
01:52:15,292 --> 01:52:23,582
That's a 3% increase. So the department will won't see a 3% increase, though, across every category.

1070
01:52:23,732 --> 01:52:33,032
So you'll see that essentially what starts to happen is some categories may have no change or a more modest increase.

1071
01:52:33,422 --> 01:52:39,592
So if the department spends only $480,000 of their budgeted amount for salaries today,

1072
01:52:40,172 --> 01:52:49,952
then the fiscal year 22 budget or the next year basically may be estimated at only a 3% increase of what the total spent was not what was budgeted,

1073
01:52:49,952 --> 01:52:55,952
what was spent which would yield less for fiscal year 22 than fiscal year 21.

1074
01:52:56,522 --> 01:53:03,272
So the incentive there is to spend the entire budget, even if the budget even if the department doesn't need it.

1075
01:53:04,102 --> 01:53:08,612
So this is why we see dollars getting spent down, because the next year the leadership is going to say,

1076
01:53:08,612 --> 01:53:11,642
all right, well, you didn't spend that, but now we're going to base it on incrementally.

1077
01:53:11,942 --> 01:53:16,471
What happens? The next concept then is redistribution,

1078
01:53:16,472 --> 01:53:23,882
which basically says the organization is now allowed to redistribute these unspent resources on the priorities established in our strategic plan.

1079
01:53:24,332 --> 01:53:28,082
So let's say I have $225,000 spent on salaries.

1080
01:53:29,072 --> 01:53:33,212
Someone who resigns from our organization, the position is unfilled.

1081
01:53:33,602 --> 01:53:38,372
So now the organization only spends 175 K of what it budgeted for salary per year.

1082
01:53:39,002 --> 01:53:47,942
So now the organizational leadership is able to redistribute that $50,000 to the other departments to meet the strategic priorities.

1083
01:53:48,332 --> 01:53:55,622
So this is the difference here. Incremental budgeting, meaning what I have left over now, sets the tone for what it is that happens next year.

1084
01:53:56,282 --> 01:54:02,492
Redistribution means I take those dollars and I get to spend them in a way that sort of it means the strategic plan.

1085
01:54:03,722 --> 01:54:14,612
So the redistribution budgeting approach is more favorable to have consensus in the organization around those strategic priorities.

1086
01:54:15,062 --> 01:54:23,372
So the center budgeting approach is more aligned with incremental budgeting, where we can set expectations that the department here,

1087
01:54:23,372 --> 01:54:27,872
the department has control over its expenditures and then can shift priorities.

1088
01:54:29,242 --> 01:54:34,162
One more term I want to just kind of quickly give you a heads up on is zero based budgeting.

1089
01:54:34,522 --> 01:54:39,022
This is where managers are setting their budgets starting from zero every year.

1090
01:54:39,382 --> 01:54:46,102
This came into popularity in the federal government in the late seventies under the Carter administration.

1091
01:54:46,552 --> 01:54:52,972
The idea is that you are justifying every single line item so that you can say every category.

1092
01:54:52,972 --> 01:55:02,162
This is why we're spending it every year. So it's more timely and more time consuming excuse me, more resource consuming to do this every year.

1093
01:55:02,192 --> 01:55:11,312
So very often what organizations will do is they'll use zero based budgeting every five years or only use it on 20% of the budget,

1094
01:55:11,642 --> 01:55:15,842
because perhaps the rest is know something that's a little bit easier to predict.

1095
01:55:18,722 --> 01:55:25,862
At the end, though, of a financial decision for specifically for a nonprofit, we have to think about what's controllable versus what's uncontrolled.

1096
01:55:26,582 --> 01:55:31,682
So managers may be required to budget for items that they can't control, such as utilities.

1097
01:55:32,162 --> 01:55:40,802
Disaster response. We've talked about that. But organizations have to have in place some way to review these uncontrollable budget expenditures.

1098
01:55:42,522 --> 01:55:48,732
As opposed to managers who are tasked with the idea of having the ability to control that.

1099
01:55:49,452 --> 01:55:53,802
So issues of mismanagement, which we're going to talk about here in a moment after a break,

1100
01:55:54,492 --> 01:56:00,822
are going to arise very often when a line item is spent on something that was expected to be controlled.

1101
01:56:01,692 --> 01:56:03,992
So to Christina's presentation, you know,

1102
01:56:04,002 --> 01:56:09,072
we expected that there would be a certain number of houses for that half a billion dollars, but didn't happen.

1103
01:56:10,482 --> 01:56:18,162
Know but the department maybe working with another party that grew a conflict of interest, it might influence spending more versus staying on budget.

1104
01:56:18,162 --> 01:56:22,932
So maybe we're hiring a contractor that's related to a board member who's going to repair the building.

1105
01:56:22,932 --> 01:56:26,112
So, yeah, you know, we'll prepare that new wing.

1106
01:56:26,112 --> 01:56:29,352
Sure. We'll build a whole new part of that facility. No problem.

1107
01:56:29,892 --> 01:56:39,012
And then it starts to develop. So many, many nonprofits are facing dramatic reductions in 20 2021 due to COVID on set.

1108
01:56:39,642 --> 01:56:45,552
And in this case, things that were controllable were suddenly uncontrollable.

1109
01:56:46,392 --> 01:56:52,572
We didn't have the ability to do much, so it warranted a different type of scrutiny around the budget.

1110
01:56:53,142 --> 01:56:57,792
We couldn't just say, Well, you just messed it up. And you probably saw that in your 1990s.

1111
01:56:57,792 --> 01:57:03,162
If you were looking at 20, 20, 2021, you can't justify that it was because of of mismanagement.

1112
01:57:03,552 --> 01:57:09,852
There are externalities that tend to play a role that speaks to the concept of budgeting, equity,

1113
01:57:10,242 --> 01:57:15,972
the idea that we need to consider the implications for managers of what those budgeting decisions are.

1114
01:57:16,722 --> 01:57:20,772
Are the decisions inclusive of the different stakeholders in the organization?

1115
01:57:21,282 --> 01:57:26,712
Are the voices of the community that the organization serves represented in that budgeting process?

1116
01:57:27,402 --> 01:57:33,912
Is the board you looked at in your first assignment representative of the diversity of the community that that organization is serving?

1117
01:57:34,332 --> 01:57:38,262
And therefore, is it able to make those budgetary recommendations?

1118
01:57:38,832 --> 01:57:44,172
If not, how are we encouraging and assuring equity in our budgeting process?

1119
01:57:44,952 --> 01:57:51,462
And finally, this this speaks and rolls right up into the structural racism that might exist,

1120
01:57:51,792 --> 01:57:57,102
that can impose budgeting constraints and organizations that are working to overcome.

1121
01:57:58,272 --> 01:58:01,292
So we're not going to take time to talk about this. Now,

1122
01:58:01,302 --> 01:58:04,362
I want to just pose this question for those we would like to write about on

1123
01:58:04,392 --> 01:58:08,112
Yellow Dick is a good example of a prompt that you can use if you would like,

1124
01:58:08,892 --> 01:58:15,762
but think about the organization that you're focusing on. You know, what are some of the budgeting challenges that you think they're perhaps facing?

1125
01:58:16,212 --> 01:58:21,102
What types of solutions do you think they can introduce to address these challenges?

1126
01:58:21,552 --> 01:58:25,602
So again, thinking about those strategic partnerships, those collaborations,

1127
01:58:25,842 --> 01:58:32,442
and then kind of how they're addressing their finance are kind of the key points for you to consider when you're thinking about that question.

1128
01:58:33,162 --> 01:58:44,392
We will take 9 minutes and then we're going to turn to our case presentation and we'll be back here at 643,

1129
01:58:50,908 --> 01:58:56,518
Let's go pick up some old air on your face.

1130
01:59:01,648 --> 01:59:12,468
Okay. Oh, okay. Tell me what I'm going to be like.

1131
01:59:14,608 --> 01:59:19,618
I'm sure you guys all read the case, but we're doing the National Kidney Fund, which you all read the case, right?

1132
01:59:20,368 --> 01:59:32,968
Then you read the case. Fantastic. You see, Ali's husband really cared about some of those things, so it was pretty funny.

1133
01:59:35,488 --> 01:59:38,998
Which I to over to Dolly. It's like, what is that?

1134
01:59:39,118 --> 01:59:42,118
Like the one where you put in keywords and it makes nothing.

1135
01:59:42,208 --> 01:59:50,428
You can be like, please make a public health professor who is drinking water tap and it will do it.

1136
01:59:50,848 --> 01:59:56,578
And you can say like in watercolor or in photorealistic style or whatever.

1137
02:00:00,578 --> 02:00:07,758
Yeah. So we are talking about Pictured Rocks, National Lakeshore, which is near and dear to my heart.

1138
02:00:07,768 --> 02:00:17,278
I live about 45 minutes away from there. It is in Munising, Michigan Peninsula, right along the shore of Lake Superior,

1139
02:00:18,388 --> 02:00:23,668
about 15 miles of sand and stone cliffs that are really beautiful, up to 200 feet above the water.

1140
02:00:23,848 --> 02:00:30,878
And and they're sculpted, you know, obviously naturally and really picturesque ways.

1141
02:00:30,898 --> 02:00:36,687
This is a kind of staple for you, the tree roots growing out there.

1142
02:00:36,688 --> 02:00:38,128
And it's just in the middle of nowhere.

1143
02:00:39,138 --> 02:00:50,238
And I found out that it was the first national lakeshore named by Congress in 1966, and last year it had about 1.3 million visitors.

1144
02:00:50,568 --> 02:00:57,018
A lot of people will go kayaking along the lakeshore and see it that way or go backpacking, which I would recommend.

1145
02:00:57,528 --> 02:01:02,988
So really nice spots up there. I spent a very wonderful trip backpacking there.

1146
02:01:03,078 --> 02:01:08,848
It is just as you described. That's great.

1147
02:01:09,078 --> 02:01:14,898
So getting to the case, so this is a little bit of background about the National Kidney Foundation.

1148
02:01:14,898 --> 02:01:18,288
So obviously, as you run, they're based in Singapore.

1149
02:01:18,918 --> 02:01:28,278
This is their current mission right now, which is to strive to be an advocate, an integrator for kidney health and holistic care for the community,

1150
02:01:28,278 --> 02:01:33,917
by the community, while supporting kidney failure patients with quality dialysis treatment and integrated care.

1151
02:01:33,918 --> 02:01:38,238
Its great mission lies in preventing or delaying kidney failure through kidney health education,

1152
02:01:38,568 --> 02:01:42,678
but deeper integration into the community and strategic collaborative partnerships.

1153
02:01:43,758 --> 02:01:49,068
And yes, as we read in the case, you know, their main focus is dialysis.

1154
02:01:49,428 --> 02:01:53,718
And they may have strayed a little bit as we as we saw in the case.

1155
02:01:53,718 --> 02:01:57,098
But that's sort of what kidneys is.

1156
02:01:57,108 --> 02:02:02,798
They're things. So a little background just to kind of set the stage.

1157
02:02:03,518 --> 02:02:08,978
If you read through it, obviously, there is a lot of kind of trickiness in the timeline of things.

1158
02:02:08,978 --> 02:02:18,157
So the organization was first established by a nephrologist in 1969 and as Jen said,

1159
02:02:18,158 --> 02:02:23,868
it was initially for subsidize dialysis treatments in the early 2000.

1160
02:02:23,888 --> 02:02:27,248
They were serving about 1700 patients.

1161
02:02:28,118 --> 02:02:32,708
They mentioned estimates of what their subsidized patients were,

1162
02:02:32,708 --> 02:02:43,718
and patients would pay about $100 a month for about a $2,000 price of what their what their treatments would be.

1163
02:02:44,078 --> 02:02:47,558
And they had 22 centers around the country at that point.

1164
02:02:48,338 --> 02:02:52,568
They did many firsts, as mentioned here. They started the first dialysis unit.

1165
02:02:53,018 --> 02:02:59,407
They were the first renal transplant in Singapore. And then they kind of very broadly expanded with their international.

1166
02:02:59,408 --> 02:03:10,808
Paul And they had the first overseas kidney transplant in 1992 is when the infamous Chichi Deri took over as CEO,

1167
02:03:11,828 --> 02:03:15,368
and he really did a lot of growth in the organization.

1168
02:03:15,368 --> 02:03:23,257
And one of his main emphasis points was the kind of holistic health products that they wanted to emphasize,

1169
02:03:23,258 --> 02:03:27,398
and this was really partnering with patients, families and the foundation.

1170
02:03:28,598 --> 02:03:38,708
And during his reign, they became the largest charitable organization in Singapore that was dedicated to saving lives and transforming lives.

1171
02:03:39,248 --> 02:03:42,728
And they became the world's largest nonprofit dialysis provider.

1172
02:03:43,138 --> 02:03:52,118
And they did a lot of expansion during his time, including an outreach to more than a little bit of stray from their mission.

1173
02:03:52,148 --> 02:03:54,608
They included a little bit more care to children.

1174
02:03:55,058 --> 02:04:03,548
They started doing cancer screenings and some other kind of basic health screenings within their organization's umbrella.

1175
02:04:04,268 --> 02:04:14,768
They did a lot of publicity, including kind of a charity show that 3.2 million people kind of tune into and called,

1176
02:04:14,768 --> 02:04:20,948
which is of the 4 million in Singapore. And they created a TV show, among many other things.

1177
02:04:21,878 --> 02:04:25,258
So he really grew the organization.

1178
02:04:25,268 --> 02:04:36,458
But as we all saw, 24 is when this all blew up essentially, and the infamous Golden Tap story was leaked.

1179
02:04:36,518 --> 02:04:44,848
And this really put a damper on the organization over all identifying that there were many allegations and crew,

1180
02:04:44,938 --> 02:04:54,368
including being grossly overpaying their CEOs and executives and that the actual golden tap was being installed in his office.

1181
02:04:58,238 --> 02:05:05,948
So as opposed to some of the previous cases that have presented already, this is not a decision or evaluation, but rather a problem.

1182
02:05:06,038 --> 02:05:10,488
And so the first thing that we had to do was define what the problem was.

1183
02:05:10,808 --> 02:05:13,747
And as we talked about later, there's sort of different ways that we could have defined it.

1184
02:05:13,748 --> 02:05:24,668
But the way that we defined it was obviously there was this golden tap story that you put up that led to that led to the problem,

1185
02:05:24,678 --> 02:05:29,378
which is, as we defined it, loss of public trust.

1186
02:05:29,468 --> 02:05:38,257
So as Candy mentioned, it was one of the most well trusted organizations in Singapore, with two of three Singaporeans being patrons of the foundation,

1187
02:05:38,258 --> 02:05:44,798
meaning donating to the foundation itself, let alone the number of people who actually supported the organization,

1188
02:05:44,798 --> 02:05:50,408
felt that they were, you know, a good organization and then lots of donors.

1189
02:05:51,218 --> 02:05:57,068
So within two months of the scandal, the foundation lost 16% of its monthly donors,

1190
02:05:57,068 --> 02:06:04,598
which was 40,000 people, which came out to be a loss of income of about 400,000 each month.

1191
02:06:05,288 --> 02:06:13,718
And as we talk about a little bit later, this was seriously significant, significant because all of their funding came from public public donations.

1192
02:06:16,678 --> 02:06:19,198
So in thinking about a problem,

1193
02:06:19,948 --> 02:06:25,978
these are the questions that we have to think about in order to further define the problem and then sort of think about what we need to do next.

1194
02:06:26,368 --> 02:06:29,788
So in terms of what is the problem, as I just talked about,

1195
02:06:30,568 --> 02:06:35,998
the can be foundation has massively disappointed the public and they're losing trust and donations.

1196
02:06:36,928 --> 02:06:47,008
We have to define what had happened. So this loss of trust was sort of an acute event, but with a bunch of chronic underlying factors that led to it.

1197
02:06:48,598 --> 02:07:00,837
Why does it matter? So it matters because this loss of funding threatens their mission to serve kidney patients

1198
02:07:00,838 --> 02:07:05,188
and their families and has a huge impact on those people who rely on their services.

1199
02:07:06,178 --> 02:07:12,298
And then who is responsible for the problem? Which is to say, like, who is responsible for dealing with the problem, essentially?

1200
02:07:12,628 --> 02:07:17,517
And so that is going to fall on the new chair and CEO Mr. Ian.

1201
02:07:17,518 --> 02:07:22,098
Mr. Gove. And then in thinking about how they should respond.

1202
02:07:22,548 --> 02:07:27,258
We'll get to that later and discuss it. But just coming up for a pathway forward.

1203
02:07:29,768 --> 02:07:37,058
So for a problem based case, instead of thinking about like altering it or what we would do or implement for this,

1204
02:07:37,568 --> 02:07:43,478
our hypothesis is really a diagnosis of the problem and thinking about what were the underlying causes of this.

1205
02:07:44,498 --> 02:07:53,638
So as John said, that acute cause was this leak of the story that led to the public's grabbing the public's attention.

1206
02:07:53,648 --> 02:08:01,717
And then the description of the golden tap is lost, too many funds being lost.

1207
02:08:01,718 --> 02:08:07,688
And then the new CEOs kind of pose this question of what went wrong, how did this situation come to this?

1208
02:08:08,198 --> 02:08:13,868
So defining this further, I will get into kind of our way of diagnosing the problem.

1209
02:08:16,548 --> 02:08:18,408
This is the part where my friends let me talk.

1210
02:08:20,658 --> 02:08:30,528
So we decided to look at the causal roots of this problem using an Ishikawa diagram, which is not familiar to you by explaining.

1211
02:08:35,428 --> 02:08:39,628
Yes. Affectionately known in medicine as a fishy cover diagram.

1212
02:08:40,828 --> 02:08:47,818
The idea here is to take these sort of categories of causes and break them down into the

1213
02:08:47,818 --> 02:08:52,287
factors in each of those categories that may have led to the loss of the public trust,

1214
02:08:52,288 --> 02:08:57,198
this particular problem. So I have a little animation happening here.

1215
02:08:57,208 --> 02:09:00,908
I also asked for an audio background. I got downloaded on one.

1216
02:09:03,328 --> 02:09:10,378
And so I was just going to ask you guys like, you know, in sort of rapid style, you're welcome to shout out in these categories.

1217
02:09:12,148 --> 02:09:14,608
The professor has given you the first three answers,

1218
02:09:14,758 --> 02:09:29,788
but what got what you think might be the factors in the category of our team members and for this case that contributed to the loss of public trust.

1219
02:09:36,978 --> 02:09:45,018
We get really detailed and nuanced in this. So obviously like anything that might come to mind in terms of what really spurred all of this.

1220
02:09:46,318 --> 02:09:50,878
Like as a for instance, did you think the teacher was awesome? Yeah.

1221
02:09:50,998 --> 02:09:55,018
Initially she sounded like me guy.

1222
02:09:55,028 --> 02:10:01,528
Yeah. I mean, he took it from, like, within ten years, the way he responded then transform.

1223
02:10:01,528 --> 02:10:06,987
Like they would get in dozens and dozens from like 14 universities or prestigious universities,

1224
02:10:06,988 --> 02:10:11,818
which would like be like from you, Howard, to not wanting to go in and going in single person.

1225
02:10:12,218 --> 02:10:18,327
It wasn't even the golden dance in Cuba until the gold tap.

1226
02:10:18,328 --> 02:10:23,518
Right? Other things that we thought of in this category were you're welcome to give me three.

1227
02:10:24,958 --> 02:10:33,208
Thank you. But the leadership team was actually very small just in terms of the number of people.

1228
02:10:33,208 --> 02:10:37,408
They had a lot of different committees, but they were using people for each of those committees.

1229
02:10:37,438 --> 02:10:46,288
You probably noticed another was that many of their teammates in leadership didn't have the right kinds of experience,

1230
02:10:47,368 --> 02:10:50,128
and that was a particular problem in the audit department.

1231
02:10:50,128 --> 02:10:56,818
And there were some ethical problems, some malfeasance, I think, on the part of some of the team members, too.

1232
02:10:56,908 --> 02:11:00,958
How about in materials and resources? We thought of this sort of as like, what were they rich in?

1233
02:11:01,258 --> 02:11:09,328
What was it that they were they were collecting and gathering, you know, as a priority that ended up leading to this problem.

1234
02:11:13,198 --> 02:11:21,777
It was like cash hunter gatherer. So there was a lot of, as you're saying, not a lot of kind of rules around how to spend that.

1235
02:11:21,778 --> 02:11:25,648
So it's kind of just discretionary cash to sit up with a lot of discussion.

1236
02:11:25,658 --> 02:11:33,418
I got the cattle I got, I found the way that they just like talked with the public or became publicized.

1237
02:11:33,478 --> 02:11:40,378
It was like, remind me, like the Kardashians, it wasn't on your standard communication.

1238
02:11:40,438 --> 02:11:48,618
So I think, like as far as like materials and like educating the public, that was kind of it was interesting that that's the form they use.

1239
02:11:48,628 --> 02:11:52,048
I Yeah. And they were splashy. Yeah. It was very flashy.

1240
02:11:52,918 --> 02:11:56,698
Totally. You can give us three buttons. Thank you.

1241
02:11:57,658 --> 02:12:05,848
And then just imagine the theme song from Inspector Gadget playing Who voted it down with these guys.

1242
02:12:07,198 --> 02:12:10,828
We thought it would distract from that medical diagram.

1243
02:12:12,418 --> 02:12:17,008
So the surplus of funds, they had a lot of this focus on like how great they were.

1244
02:12:17,008 --> 02:12:23,848
It felt to us as good as we were reading, that they really wanted to get some awards and get some international reputation and get a lot of publicity.

1245
02:12:24,178 --> 02:12:31,917
And I understand that that can you know, it can further their mission, but also it can be a distracting and then they're focused on,

1246
02:12:31,918 --> 02:12:40,848
as you said, like the early teacher I, you know, was very entrepreneurial and market size market sized their product.

1247
02:12:42,838 --> 02:12:46,198
Yeah. Of that. In terms of measurements.

1248
02:12:46,258 --> 02:12:51,358
Do you have recollections of like concrete things that they were measuring and how they were using or not using?

1249
02:12:55,888 --> 02:13:02,448
Interesting things are not keeping track of that in your music.

1250
02:13:05,068 --> 02:13:09,278
It's a big inspector gadget over here.

1251
02:13:10,698 --> 02:13:17,948
Great. Thank you. So go Gadget. So I read the case more than once, which, you know, just took more and more passes through.

1252
02:13:17,958 --> 02:13:23,618
But there were audits that were done internally that no one used.

1253
02:13:23,628 --> 02:13:32,088
They actually had good information about things that were going wrong and then just failed to act on those things at multiple levels.

1254
02:13:32,358 --> 02:13:40,788
Another thing was that the sort of basic things like performance evaluations were

1255
02:13:40,788 --> 02:13:46,788
areas where they just scraped by and didn't actually take any measurements.

1256
02:13:48,048 --> 02:13:51,198
That's what we came up with in that category. Then I think we're down to process.

1257
02:13:51,528 --> 02:14:04,837
I think about their process like you guys, that's worrisome. Thoroughly lack of internal regulation and support within to check and balance,

1258
02:14:04,838 --> 02:14:12,338
which is something that like I did that my last role and it sucked being that person but we were caught because we told the sales team.

1259
02:14:12,348 --> 02:14:21,518
Yeah. And like telling people no and they just didn't have that like that sturdy systemic or systematic process regulation.

1260
02:14:21,998 --> 02:14:30,758
Yeah, yeah. I just grinded my gears. There was a ton of like sort of trust in that.

1261
02:14:30,758 --> 02:14:36,968
CEO Did you pick up on that theme like this organization deferred or sorry, this committee deferred constantly to the CEO.

1262
02:14:36,968 --> 02:14:41,468
And this board really believed that the CEO had their best interests at heart.

1263
02:14:41,468 --> 02:14:47,888
And, you know, there was there were a lot of arrows pointing back at the CEO also that everyone believed in him and trusted him.

1264
02:14:48,598 --> 02:14:52,568
I. I was going to say the executive committee was really strange,

1265
02:14:54,548 --> 02:15:03,188
like the fact that they passed things without ever voting on it and there wasn't even like unanimous consent.

1266
02:15:03,218 --> 02:15:08,778
It was just like, if it's in front of us, it's probably a pass. Yeah, nobody said no real strongly, so yeah.

1267
02:15:08,858 --> 02:15:13,328
And then if they did like they talked about it for a minute Don.

1268
02:15:13,988 --> 02:15:19,438
Also if they pass something like. Maybe it was implemented, maybe it wasn't.

1269
02:15:19,678 --> 02:15:26,998
And the organization, like the employees, didn't even know the difference between the board and the executive committee.

1270
02:15:27,918 --> 02:15:32,098
Just three months.

1271
02:15:33,088 --> 02:15:37,237
I think we got them. Great. Okay.

1272
02:15:37,238 --> 02:15:42,518
So then getting a little bit more, you started to tip into this category, I think into the management.

1273
02:15:44,318 --> 02:15:49,958
How did that set up their strike, you guys? Their various committees and how they interacted and.

1274
02:15:53,338 --> 02:15:56,848
Kind on paper there was a decent setup.

1275
02:15:56,858 --> 02:15:59,308
Maybe it's like, Oh, we have this committee, this supposed to approve things.

1276
02:15:59,308 --> 02:16:05,277
And then I guess also further into the environment kind of section, that was there's one thing to kind of set up rules and regulations,

1277
02:16:05,278 --> 02:16:11,568
but it was not enforcement per culture around actually enforcing them or adhering to them that,

1278
02:16:12,228 --> 02:16:15,178
you know, it's just words on a piece of paper that don't actually do anything.

1279
02:16:16,738 --> 02:16:21,718
So it wasn't clear that they were actually performing some of the functions that they were set up to perform.

1280
02:16:22,838 --> 02:16:27,327
But I thought it was kind of weird that the board members were on the executive committee.

1281
02:16:27,328 --> 02:16:33,478
It just felt that was a little bit of a conflict of interest. And going off of what the executive committee kind of did,

1282
02:16:33,478 --> 02:16:38,158
they just thought everything was in the best interest for the organization to really look into it.

1283
02:16:38,998 --> 02:16:47,878
And like I said, that's that. So we're going to explode this one a little bit in the next slide.

1284
02:16:47,878 --> 02:16:53,247
But you touched on some of those important themes that the power was like very consolidated among people

1285
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:58,438
who sat on multiple committees and that they were sort of all governing or not governing each other.

1286
02:17:01,058 --> 02:17:10,987
All right. And then in the environment, we thought about this like sort of culturally in Singapore, where they existed is actually surprising,

1287
02:17:10,988 --> 02:17:19,838
by the way, that the national foundations from Singapore to me and I think and I ran it past my husband who also in medicine.

1288
02:17:20,548 --> 02:17:30,098
It was it was shocking to him also because their international reputation is so huge and and so present in the United States also.

1289
02:17:30,428 --> 02:17:33,188
But we actually both thought that that was a US organization.

1290
02:17:33,428 --> 02:17:40,808
So anyways, what do you think it was about Singapore that helped them to get to their problem?

1291
02:17:41,788 --> 02:17:48,728
Right. Yeah, go ahead. Singapore is just fascinating as a country that's going to be like our next economic hub is what a lot of people say.

1292
02:17:48,728 --> 02:17:51,307
And in that instance, there's a lot of growth,

1293
02:17:51,308 --> 02:17:59,047
money and power that are still flowing around and there's not as much maybe precedence as in Europe or in America.

1294
02:17:59,048 --> 02:18:02,407
We have just like different foundations in Singapore.

1295
02:18:02,408 --> 02:18:07,688
So I think that really lends itself to a like this.

1296
02:18:12,098 --> 02:18:20,258
I think the organization was kind of like bastions sense of pride because the empire that was still there had.

1297
02:18:23,208 --> 02:18:31,308
And they were real careful to to tap into people's sense of the importance of family.

1298
02:18:31,338 --> 02:18:31,598
Right.

1299
02:18:31,608 --> 02:18:45,598
That this sort of filial duty to, I think, was a ripe environment for an organization like this to flourish maybe beyond the capabilities of its own.

1300
02:18:47,078 --> 02:18:54,508
Organizations and governments have city capacity ahead of.

1301
02:18:56,108 --> 02:19:01,267
Yeah. And they I didn't say that, but they did really dominate this market in Singapore too.

1302
02:19:01,268 --> 02:19:06,558
And they were the first to do a lot of kidney related things and they did not have strong competition there.

1303
02:19:08,438 --> 02:19:16,208
Great. So the next slide is this sort of just exploration of the spider web of their leadership.

1304
02:19:16,418 --> 02:19:24,848
And you might remember that there were 40 departments, all of which reported directly to the CEO.

1305
02:19:24,848 --> 02:19:31,148
And the same was true of the remuneration subcommittee that they were reporting to the CEO.

1306
02:19:31,148 --> 02:19:34,357
That subcommittee was actually completely deferential.

1307
02:19:34,358 --> 02:19:41,048
So with the point they would make, uh, when they would analyze something or come up with a solution,

1308
02:19:41,408 --> 02:19:47,828
they would never insist upon its implementation, just defer to the CEO for that decision making.

1309
02:19:47,828 --> 02:19:52,478
So they were like not not really an independent committee so much.

1310
02:19:52,718 --> 02:19:58,578
The CEO participated in the executive committee, although he wasn't technically a member.

1311
02:19:58,598 --> 02:20:03,998
The executive committee was essentially identical to the board with the exception of like a couple of bodies.

1312
02:20:05,828 --> 02:20:10,868
The board had board members who were also on the financial and the audit

1313
02:20:10,868 --> 02:20:15,668
committee and and some of those committees were also on the executive committee.

1314
02:20:15,998 --> 02:20:17,738
It's really a tangled little web.

1315
02:20:19,148 --> 02:20:27,277
And then from the audit committee, you'll remember that there were internal and external auditors who didn't communicate with each other,

1316
02:20:27,278 --> 02:20:33,517
although they were aware of the problems that that they were finding, they weren't reporting back.

1317
02:20:33,518 --> 02:20:44,078
And the internal audit committee, they were reporting back to the executive committee who just like did a earplug maneuver with those results.

1318
02:20:45,908 --> 02:20:49,208
I think those are all the arrows. I didn't pretty catch other.

1319
02:20:50,418 --> 02:21:00,508
Connections that I missed. So I'm thinking about alternatives for this.

1320
02:21:00,808 --> 02:21:04,888
Really what we were looking at is other ways that we can define the problem.

1321
02:21:05,488 --> 02:21:12,358
Obviously, we just went into a lot of nuance of intricacies of when and what kind of caused this.

1322
02:21:12,958 --> 02:21:21,058
But we can pinpoint other things and kind of hone in on some of the more specific details for defining the problem.

1323
02:21:21,928 --> 02:21:34,738
Was it, you know, the actual cause of having to write in the CEO position and his business model of how he ran this organization?

1324
02:21:35,488 --> 02:21:40,738
Was it the structure that kind of ended up running more like a business as opposed to a nonprofit?

1325
02:21:41,488 --> 02:21:46,918
And again, as we talked about before, like, they really strayed from their mission.

1326
02:21:46,918 --> 02:21:58,378
And kind of how he really built up this organization was reaching into a lot of different types of parts of medicine and reaching into the children,

1327
02:21:58,378 --> 02:22:09,838
the cancer screenings and all of that. And did that kind of participate in causing this, as we talked about, also, like lack of government oversight?

1328
02:22:10,108 --> 02:22:13,708
I don't know the intricacies of how Singapore does this for nonprofits,

1329
02:22:13,708 --> 02:22:21,208
but is there something there that would just really not check in on this organization for a long time leading up to this?

1330
02:22:21,978 --> 02:22:28,677
And we talked about the fact that there really weren't many other public options for the services that they were providing.

1331
02:22:28,678 --> 02:22:35,728
And this was something that the community was leaning heavily on for dialysis and supplementing that.

1332
02:22:37,318 --> 02:22:41,217
And then we talked about how all of their funding is coming from donations.

1333
02:22:41,218 --> 02:22:46,827
So really kind of that very scary through this organization,

1334
02:22:46,828 --> 02:22:51,958
especially with this big scandal that happens and they lose so much of their funding very quickly.

1335
02:22:55,288 --> 02:22:58,008
On in terms of proof and action.

1336
02:22:58,028 --> 02:23:05,588
You know, this is where we think about, you know, what evidence is required to support the hypothesis versus what additional evidence is needed.

1337
02:23:05,598 --> 02:23:11,078
So in terms of what we know, you know, it's everything that we discuss in this root cause analysis.

1338
02:23:11,378 --> 02:23:19,178
We were given a detailed description of the government and weak governance structure of the organization and their leadership structure,

1339
02:23:19,748 --> 02:23:25,058
sort of a timeline of what happened, etc. But there are sort of a lot of pieces that we don't know.

1340
02:23:25,618 --> 02:23:28,237
And we sort of touched on this earlier in one of the earlier presentations.

1341
02:23:28,238 --> 02:23:36,368
But, you know, for example, we don't have any idea of what the intent was behind the organizational structure.

1342
02:23:36,818 --> 02:23:40,408
Why was it that the executive committee was completely different to Deri?

1343
02:23:40,448 --> 02:23:42,968
Why, you know, why did they set it up this way?

1344
02:23:43,658 --> 02:23:47,588
Additionally, there are just sort of random pieces of information that we don't have that might help us,

1345
02:23:47,588 --> 02:23:53,018
like the financial committee man who just lost his computer and lost all the minutes from

1346
02:23:53,018 --> 02:23:59,048
those meetings or sort of a lack of full understanding of what a community is feel like.

1347
02:23:59,048 --> 02:24:06,578
Obviously the donations went down, but you know, how how are people in Singapore feeling?

1348
02:24:08,918 --> 02:24:14,738
And yeah, why was it why why was there no follow through with so many of these things that actually were sort of along the way,

1349
02:24:15,308 --> 02:24:18,368
like the auditing committee? Why weren't those actually follow through?

1350
02:24:18,378 --> 02:24:28,718
We don't actually have answers to those questions. And so then what action does our diagnosis call for which leads into our discussion activity?

1351
02:24:32,168 --> 02:24:39,988
So we want you guys to act as the new CEOs, so as go and E and so break,

1352
02:24:39,998 --> 02:24:48,278
break into groups of 3 to 5 and just come up with a plan for how you think about that can you foundation might

1353
02:24:48,278 --> 02:24:53,437
build back public trust so some of the things you might think about are just sort of thinking about that.

1354
02:24:53,438 --> 02:24:59,318
So our Fishbone analysis and the various elements of what went wrong and where you would want to act on those.

1355
02:25:01,848 --> 02:25:06,928
Yeah. I'm getting about, like 5 minutes or so if you want to talk among yourselves.

1356
02:25:08,068 --> 02:25:33,078
You have 5 minutes. I don't even know you.

1357
02:25:33,798 --> 02:25:51,018
Just because this is just about government needs to be transparent about exactly what, if anything, really, really affected lives.

1358
02:25:52,648 --> 02:26:02,858
Yeah, it's similar to the other cases, but it's not clear what made you just consider this case sometimes.

1359
02:26:02,898 --> 02:26:25,858
Like you, like, stated. Yeah, I think that this is real because I feel like we've seen the aftermath, including from this family and others.

1360
02:26:26,368 --> 02:26:29,158
Like, I was just like reading the letter to the prosecutor.

1361
02:26:30,458 --> 02:26:51,018
It's like the rest of the time that she was not thinking of having to go to the Court TV ads and several other people like that.

1362
02:26:51,308 --> 02:26:52,648
So I think this is a concern.

1363
02:26:56,168 --> 02:27:11,208
It is, you know, like halfway through something more than we ever realized that there's real [INAUDIBLE] and what's going on in the middle of their.

1364
02:27:12,378 --> 02:27:16,748
Just. I feel like it's true. Yeah. Right.

1365
02:27:19,728 --> 02:27:26,368
Yeah. I'll just. I'll start with you.

1366
02:27:28,528 --> 02:27:32,608
We don't. We don't. We don't go there first, do we?

1367
02:27:33,258 --> 02:27:37,338
Are you. Do you have a team? So I do.

1368
02:27:37,348 --> 02:27:40,618
I know you have the team. That was Thomas.

1369
02:27:42,348 --> 02:27:46,818
Maybe not sending pictures.

1370
02:27:51,048 --> 02:27:55,488
Yeah, because I did some research showing it.

1371
02:27:58,338 --> 02:28:06,298
You have to talk to too here I try to prosecutors especially because like all this expectation kind of.

1372
02:28:06,508 --> 02:28:12,378
Yeah that science is like that's good for you.

1373
02:28:12,378 --> 02:28:16,457
It's good for you. That's why I give to all of you.

1374
02:28:16,458 --> 02:28:22,908
I mean, I'm here to do the First Amendment and everything.

1375
02:28:23,438 --> 02:28:32,388
And then he goes over and he goes to answer, Did you?

1376
02:28:35,248 --> 02:28:39,088
Like we're really eating. Everything else in the kitchen.

1377
02:28:39,748 --> 02:28:47,288
And I just are the people that I just. I don't know.

1378
02:28:48,058 --> 02:28:52,168
I know it's going to come back together.

1379
02:28:53,218 --> 02:28:58,228
Come back together. Okay. That's what we came up with.

1380
02:28:59,848 --> 02:29:04,678
All right. Volunteer there. Their advice.

1381
02:29:06,668 --> 02:29:12,068
I think this is a real fascinatingly complicated problem.

1382
02:29:12,508 --> 02:29:22,808
I'll put it that diplomatically. Okay. I guess we kind of have some combined answers for a lot of things that we we talked about.

1383
02:29:22,808 --> 02:29:26,678
We're increasing transparency through providing, you know,

1384
02:29:27,488 --> 02:29:32,258
their making their financial information, which is information about their nonprofit more public.

1385
02:29:32,858 --> 02:29:35,558
Another thing was organizing their governance structure.

1386
02:29:35,558 --> 02:29:49,478
So maybe taking a step back, convening with their board and their organization to kind of work on an org chart that clarifies everybody's scope,

1387
02:29:50,048 --> 02:29:54,848
how much that they can actually give their input and their input in there.

1388
02:29:55,568 --> 02:29:59,707
We also talked about potentially holding like a town hall with the community.

1389
02:29:59,708 --> 02:30:04,388
And that way it's like and that's how they can give back their donors and community support by just, you know,

1390
02:30:05,108 --> 02:30:11,768
having a conversation with people in the community talk to, you know, regain that support since leaving.

1391
02:30:14,288 --> 02:30:18,308
Oh, and then we talked about like salaries. So they had some issues with their salaries.

1392
02:30:18,308 --> 02:30:26,287
We talked about maybe they could create a committee you could do some research on like other nonprofits and percentages of you know,

1393
02:30:26,288 --> 02:30:30,487
salaries for there's. For their leadership.

1394
02:30:30,488 --> 02:30:34,238
And then from there they can they're able to set like. So does that make sense?

1395
02:30:35,538 --> 02:30:43,358
Yeah. I really like the town hall idea. Um, can tell you from briefly looking at their current website,

1396
02:30:43,478 --> 02:30:50,288
they have lots of different parts to their transparency that you can see are like very evident on it.

1397
02:30:51,188 --> 02:30:57,188
They talk, you know, they have name tags going into who's doing what and their kind of organizational structure.

1398
02:30:57,698 --> 02:31:01,688
And then there's even a tab that's about like whistleblowing organization and stuff.

1399
02:31:01,718 --> 02:31:05,918
So it's very like you can tell that they have quite a lot of effort into it.

1400
02:31:07,688 --> 02:31:11,078
We have. One and a half minutes here till we're done.

1401
02:31:11,158 --> 02:31:18,388
So I think groups really quick away and basically said the same exact thing to add on.

1402
02:31:18,748 --> 02:31:25,328
You spoke about how the board only has three members and just expanding that and having more opinions would be something good.

1403
02:31:25,358 --> 02:31:30,648
But mostly spoke about the structure of organization. Groups over here.

1404
02:31:32,928 --> 02:31:37,848
And I have a question actually for you then maybe to close,

1405
02:31:37,848 --> 02:31:44,898
which is that the members of the board were nearly the same as the members of the executive committee.

1406
02:31:45,348 --> 02:31:49,998
The case mentioned specifically that the board members were volunteers.

1407
02:31:51,328 --> 02:31:54,918
But they would have been salaried on the executive committee anyways, right.

1408
02:31:55,168 --> 02:31:58,407
So the executive committee, it depends on the nature of the executive committee.

1409
02:31:58,408 --> 02:32:05,818
And executive committee sometimes exists inside of an organization as a subset of board members that drive the general decision making.

1410
02:32:06,328 --> 02:32:08,907
So I might have a 40 person board of directors.

1411
02:32:08,908 --> 02:32:16,138
Each one of the people was labeled as a trustee, but then the executive committee are the five that are really driving the decision making,

1412
02:32:16,138 --> 02:32:19,798
and then they report back to the General Board and then the general will take a vote.

1413
02:32:20,308 --> 02:32:29,458
So they have a lot of autonomy. But this case I outlined for us is kind of a key for their structure, was that it was all the same people.

1414
02:32:29,638 --> 02:32:35,518
So there wasn't a general board. It was just kind of, you know, one small group tightly making decisions now.

1415
02:32:35,998 --> 02:32:42,388
But that small group, which is not uncommon to see in nonprofits, is ethically making decisions then.

1416
02:32:44,038 --> 02:32:51,868
You know, then that's not problematic. If if it if it is not and could become problematic.

1417
02:32:55,638 --> 02:33:00,498
So this case, I hope, illuminates for us as our case presentation.

1418
02:33:00,828 --> 02:33:07,518
Let's give them a really important one.

1419
02:33:08,288 --> 02:33:15,988
Oh, okay. I think the ureter and everything is perfect.

1420
02:33:16,068 --> 02:33:19,698
A great physician. Um.

1421
02:33:20,238 --> 02:33:25,848
Okay. I have to do a kidney transplant on this fascinating thing in Singapore.

1422
02:33:26,378 --> 02:33:32,098
No, I'm not sure why the surgeon allowed me to suture, but.

1423
02:33:33,798 --> 02:33:49,908
Okay, so the the key for today is to keep in mind a bit, these issues of ethical concern do not emerge necessarily out of nefarious intent.

1424
02:33:50,478 --> 02:33:54,828
And we saw that in Christina's presentation specifically.

1425
02:33:55,098 --> 02:34:02,328
Sometimes these things happen because there's not good planning, because there's not good control, because there's not good foresight.

1426
02:34:03,168 --> 02:34:10,878
Sometimes they happen because it's nefarious. Part of our role in terms of taking apart these organizations and understanding

1427
02:34:10,878 --> 02:34:15,678
them is that we have to think very carefully about what is and isn't appropriate.

1428
02:34:15,978 --> 02:34:21,468
And keep in mind throughout all the different managerial decisions that managers are making,

1429
02:34:21,798 --> 02:34:32,327
that each one comes with scrutiny and has to be something that you can justify and say, I did this because I did this or this and that.

1430
02:34:32,328 --> 02:34:38,208
It's not just, you know, doing out of experience when resources get to be abundant.

1431
02:34:38,388 --> 02:34:45,528
That is very often when you start to see these controls start to slip away because it becomes very easy to do.

1432
02:34:45,858 --> 02:34:54,528
And the organizations that we talk about are very much predicated on trust operations, very often in the for profit space run into issues like this.

1433
02:34:55,068 --> 02:35:00,348
But there's not a trust component necessarily if the product is still going, if everything is still working.

1434
02:35:00,828 --> 02:35:06,498
It's a different story that to mean that it's good or bad, but meaning it's characterized differently.

1435
02:35:06,858 --> 02:35:12,598
But with nonprofits where they're bills and this assumption of trust becomes a very critical component.

1436
02:35:12,618 --> 02:35:17,238
So I think today's case group really is breaking it down for us in an excellent way.

1437
02:35:17,568 --> 02:35:24,018
That structure, each group has brought a different sort of creative element to our discussion.

1438
02:35:24,028 --> 02:35:32,847
So thank you for helping us to dissect the structure of the case in the same way we will be back here in one week from now.

1439
02:35:32,848 --> 02:35:37,278
So we're not meeting next week because it's all great. So I hope they're both taking a long break.

1440
02:35:37,848 --> 02:35:43,278
And when you come back on October 25th, you'll get two weeks to read.

1441
02:35:43,758 --> 02:35:47,748
Thank you very much. I was always an entrepreneur.

1442
02:35:48,048 --> 02:36:08,718
There were so many girls at the college, you know, when they go to say, you know, oh, yeah, I also was on vacation.

1443
02:36:09,648 --> 02:36:22,668
And then I heard that, you know, I like.
