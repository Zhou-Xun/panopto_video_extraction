1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,010
And I'm talking so much about it. So drastic.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,540
Right. So I just want to. I told you I saw you. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,280
I'm not so much as working on it, but I thought that my voice was written on Sunday,

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:30,040
and I was like, You are part time or not that long, so I think we should start our discussion for.

5
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:41,890
This week. First, we're going to reveal who was ordered and then there will be an engaged learning assignment and a learning three.

6
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:53,470
And that will be different from the previous assignments because we will first answer a survey to gauge interest in different topics,

7
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,330
and then you will form groups of about 4 to 5 people.

8
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:07,550
And you will work together to find a research paper on an epidemiologic topic that your previously chosen.

9
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,720
And you will work with that paper throughout the rest of the semester on various things to.

10
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,530
He's memorized the methods and apply the knowledge you learn in this course.

11
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:36,430
So first, what were you ordered? The US federal government plays a role in collecting data used by immunologists to prove to state that there is

12
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:42,790
no need to collect new data nowadays because so much epidemiologic data are available in the public domain.

13
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:52,810
That is very false. Syria program is frequently used by epidemiologists to understand cancer survival.

14
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:02,890
And there was a question about this one. The U.S. federal government does not decide which diseases are reportable.

15
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:12,310
That is done through a collaboration between the CDC and state legislatures that work together.

16
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,440
It's states working together and not based on federal legislation.

17
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:34,050
And the following sources are useful to find people who've been in epidemiologic studies, hospital disease registries, radio advertisements, in print.

18
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:44,470
And these are all useful sources. The following are all reasonable sources of data for epidemiologic studies,

19
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,360
personal fitness tracking information, vital statistics, medical records, and laboratory results.

20
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:59,080
For a physician in Oakland County, Michigan, informing the local health department of a case of West Nile virus.

21
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,220
That is not an example of active surveillance. So that is false.

22
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:12,640
If you observe an abrupt decrease in mortality for a particular disease, the possible explanations are.

23
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:21,460
The definition of the disease might have changed. There is a new treatment for the disease that results in cure for many people,

24
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:29,080
or there is a new screening test that results in early detection of disease that results in prolonging survival.

25
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,450
Each of these could impact and show an abrupt increase in mortality.

26
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,870
And the major issue with using life insurance statistics to understand morbidity is that these data may not

27
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:49,349
be reflective of the general population concerned that healthy people are more likely to get life insurance,

28
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:54,910
even though everyone in the population is eligible. And this can you can think about that.

29
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,600
More healthy people are more likely to be employed and employed.

30
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,940
People are more likely to be offered life insurance.

31
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:13,280
Individual physicians have the legal right to not report a case of a reportable disease of the patient as him or her not to.

32
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,390
And that is false. The reportable disease must be reported.

33
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,080
Now for the in-game learning that I've previously referenced,

34
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:33,250
you can go to your assignments and also find it or go under week five and look through the slides and download Engage Learning.

35
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:42,629
For this, you will critically evaluate epidemiologic topics and methods covered in the article

36
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:47,190
throughout the semester and identifying critical components of the studies,

37
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:57,650
exposure and outcome, measurement and other methods. The assignment will be due in 30 minutes after the end of discussion as.

38
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:10,350
But first, before you begin this and do the other survey, go and report your area of interest on this poll here?

39
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:25,150
It should be fine. We're going back.

40
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:45,289
It's not like that. It's not about us.

41
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:48,529
And you speak with you three or four years ago.

42
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:53,809
It's like you're are the results of the survey.

43
00:05:53,959 --> 00:06:14,719
This includes the other sections. So. So when you have enough people to form groups for all the genetic counseling, immigration and LGBTQ issues.

44
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:20,209
So you prefer groups of 4 to 6.

45
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:26,839
So answer as nine through alternative form for that.

46
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,069
Ideally individuals or charities that age.

47
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:34,869
So it could be one group or separate.

48
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:43,279
And there are a few topics that.

49
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:52,769
Industrial hygiene, nutrition and maternal and child health which have to people.

50
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:58,029
If anyone from those once larger groups and.

51
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:03,929
I suggest searching for a partner that might want to switch from one of the larger topics.

52
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:09,829
But it should also be okay to work as a group of two.

53
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:18,629
No. This is designed as a group assignment, so there may be more work than you want if it's just two people.

54
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:23,949
The. Sort of into groups.

55
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:34,879
And you see, you define the people that you're working with.

56
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:56,569
A lot of good epidemiologic studies and learning under them.

57
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:11,283
Yeah. Yeah. This is what happens in several jobs once you.
