1
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:10,644
In this module,

2
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:14,352
we'll be talking about some key
concepts with regards to air pollution.

3
00:00:14,352 --> 00:00:17,992
Now, it's very common that we refer to
air pollution as though it were a single

4
00:00:17,992 --> 00:00:18,993
exposure or hazard.

5
00:00:18,993 --> 00:00:23,051
But of course, air pollutants
actually number in the hundreds or

6
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:24,686
thousands in many areas.

7
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:28,360
In this lecture we're going to
focus in on some parameters of air

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,106
pollution that are particularly important
from a public health perspective.

9
00:00:33,106 --> 00:00:35,837
I want to return us to
the Exposure-disease model.

10
00:00:35,837 --> 00:00:37,099
So for air pollution and

11
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:40,642
all other types of pollutants in
the environment we have a source.

12
00:00:40,642 --> 00:00:43,803
We are very interested in how
the air pollution might move through

13
00:00:43,803 --> 00:00:46,687
the environment and
ultimately come into contact with us.

14
00:00:46,687 --> 00:00:50,149
Of course, in terms of dose for an air
pollutant, we're typically thinking about

15
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:52,778
something that's inhaled the dose
is occurring in the lungs.

16
00:00:52,778 --> 00:00:57,056
And there are unfortunately many
different health effects associated

17
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:59,700
with excessive exposure to air pollution.

18
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,192
Let's talk for a moment about different
pathways and routes of exposure that we

19
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:07,825
might have between for
example a source of air pollution and us.

20
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:11,316
So in this image here we're looking
at lots of different pathways and

21
00:01:11,316 --> 00:01:13,602
these are highlighted
with the red arrows for

22
00:01:13,602 --> 00:01:16,148
chemicals as they move
through the environment.

23
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:20,288
If we focus on the topmost red arrow,
which is labeled atmospheric release,

24
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:23,026
let's imagine we have
a source perhaps the factory

25
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:26,803
in the background that's releasing
some type of hazard into the air.

26
00:01:26,803 --> 00:01:29,790
Well, that hazard may float along
through the air until finally,

27
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,482
it comes into contact with a person, and
we have an inhalation route of exposure.

28
00:01:33,482 --> 00:01:37,010
That's maybe the most direct pathway for
air pollution.

29
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,712
But there are other ways that
are pollutants can end up in our body.

30
00:01:39,712 --> 00:01:42,871
So if we imagine for
example a chemical like mercury,

31
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:47,429
it can actually deposit out of the air and
it may deposit onto the ground or on to

32
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:52,088
plants where it's then eaten by animals,
and we then consume those animals.

33
00:01:52,088 --> 00:01:56,350
So that's an air pollutant that's
end up coming into our body actually

34
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,063
through ingestion of food.

35
00:01:58,063 --> 00:02:00,436
We could also think
about a chemical again,

36
00:02:00,436 --> 00:02:03,385
mercury is a good example
depositing out into water and

37
00:02:03,385 --> 00:02:06,607
us then drinking that water and
becoming exposed that way.

38
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:11,412
So although we're talking about pollutants
that start in the air these pollutants

39
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:14,501
can get into our bodies
through multiple pathways and

40
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,880
at least two routes of exposure
inhalation or ingestion.

41
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,455
Let's think about different types
of air pollutants for a moment.

42
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:23,635
So you may have heard about
particulate matter previously.

43
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:27,859
This is basically a complex mixture of
extremely small particles as well as

44
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:30,549
liquid droplets that
are suspended in the air.

45
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:33,195
This could include things like acids or

46
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:38,175
organic chemicals that contain carbon or
metals as well as soil and dust.

47
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:40,878
We also have to worry about gases and
vapors, so

48
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:45,418
things like hydrocarbons and carbon
monoxide can be present in air pollution.

49
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:47,799
And the third type would be
what we consider to be smog.

50
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:53,390
Now we talked in a previous module about
the Great London Smog event in 1952.

51
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,655
Smog is actually a portmanteau
of smoke and fog.

52
00:02:57,655 --> 00:03:01,251
In more modern times we consider smog
to be a mixture of pollutants but

53
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:04,661
were primarily concerned actually
about ground-level ozone,

54
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:06,779
which I'll talk about more in a moment.

55
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:09,537
So if we focus even further in
just on particulate matter it

56
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:12,089
turns out there's two types
of particulate matter.

57
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:15,896
There are primary particles, so this
is particulate matter that's basically

58
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:18,236
emitted directly from
an air pollution source.

59
00:03:18,236 --> 00:03:22,705
The smoke you see coming out of a diesel
stack on a truck is a great example.

60
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:26,316
We can also think about secondary
particles, so these actually form in

61
00:03:26,316 --> 00:03:30,366
the atmosphere from a combination of
gaseous and particulate air pollutants.

62
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:35,330
So for example, sulfur dioxide it's
emitted from power plants can combine with

63
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,692
other pollutants in
the atmosphere to form sulfates.

64
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:41,684
The image you're looking at here is
designed just to convey the scale

65
00:03:41,684 --> 00:03:42,776
of air pollution to you.

66
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:47,698
So you can see in the lower left corner
we're looking at a fine grain of beach

67
00:03:47,698 --> 00:03:50,526
sand about 90 micrometers in diameter.

68
00:03:50,526 --> 00:03:55,377
So a micrometer is a millionth of
a meter a very, very small distance.

69
00:03:55,377 --> 00:03:59,495
You can also see here Illustrated
a human hair which is typically

70
00:03:59,495 --> 00:04:02,783
somewhere between say 50 and
70 micrometers.

71
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:03,546
Now the blue and

72
00:04:03,546 --> 00:04:07,436
pink circles on this image represent
different sizes of particulate matter.

73
00:04:07,436 --> 00:04:09,071
PM10, the blue circle,

74
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:13,337
is particulate matter with a diameter
of 10 micrometers or less and so

75
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:17,403
you can see that's much smaller than
a human hair or a grain of sand.

76
00:04:17,403 --> 00:04:21,571
And PM2.5 is four times smaller than that,
so two and

77
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:23,973
a half microns in width or less.

78
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:28,946
So we're talking about very ,very
small microscopic particles.

79
00:04:28,946 --> 00:04:31,982
Now, why are we worried about
the different sizes of particulate matter?

80
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:35,641
So this is another way to look at the size
distribution of different particles.

81
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:40,397
So across the top of this image, you
can see different biological substances

82
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:44,419
from down to the level of a molecule
all the way up to a human hair and

83
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:47,518
you can see that the range
of sizes is quite broad.

84
00:04:47,518 --> 00:04:52,384
We're interested in the distribution
of sizes here because not all particles

85
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:54,234
can actually enter our body.

86
00:04:54,234 --> 00:04:58,636
So something, for example, the size of
a human hair is very difficult to inhale

87
00:04:58,636 --> 00:05:01,148
it's simply too big to
get into our airways.

88
00:05:01,148 --> 00:05:04,344
On the other hand something like
pollen that might have a lower or

89
00:05:04,344 --> 00:05:08,432
smallest diameter of say 10 micrometers
that's something that's considered

90
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:09,573
a thoracic particle.

91
00:05:09,573 --> 00:05:10,487
In other words,

92
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:14,220
it's of a size where it can get into
our thoracic cavity in our body.

93
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,923
If we think about something like
a bacteria down around 1 micrometer,

94
00:05:17,923 --> 00:05:21,194
that would be what we consider
a fine particle that can actually

95
00:05:21,194 --> 00:05:23,617
penetrate to the deepest
regions of our lung.

96
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:29,375
Viruses are even smaller we might
consider those to be ultrafine particles.

97
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,564
So let's talk a little bit in
depth about gases and vapors.

98
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:35,095
I mentioned ground-level
ozone a moment ago,

99
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:38,771
I want to highlight that this is
different from stratospheric ozone.

100
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:42,660
So the ozone layer up in the stratosphere
actually is quite good for

101
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,141
us it absorbs harmful ultraviolet
radiation from the sun.

102
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:48,966
Ground-level ozone unfortunately is
down here where we're breathing.

103
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:53,759
It's created by chemical reactions and
it causes a number of health outcomes.

104
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,599
We're also concerned about
nitrogen oxides or NOx.

105
00:05:56,599 --> 00:06:01,508
These are highly reactive chemicals that
actually lead to the formation of ozone

106
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:02,817
among other things.

107
00:06:02,817 --> 00:06:05,086
We're interested in
volatile organic compounds.

108
00:06:05,086 --> 00:06:09,572
So these are organic or in other words
carbon-containing compounds that actually

109
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:12,915
evaporate at normal temperature and
atmospheric pressure.

110
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:15,587
Finally, we're also very
concerned about greenhouse gases.

111
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:18,687
So these are gases that can contribute
to climate change which we'll talk

112
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:21,885
about this more later in the course.

113
00:06:21,885 --> 00:06:26,472
So let's imagine two pollution sources as
we have illustrated here the tailpipe of

114
00:06:26,472 --> 00:06:27,792
a car and a power plant.

115
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:31,728
Both of those sources might be emitting
NOx as you can see in red as well as

116
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:33,839
volatile organic compounds in blue.

117
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,641
And it turns up the interaction of those
two things in the presence of heat and

118
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:42,769
light as we get from the sun
combine to form ground-level ozone,

119
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:47,695
which again is another type
of toxic air pollutant.

120
00:06:47,695 --> 00:06:51,816
Now I want to return here for
a moment just to highlight why the size of

121
00:06:51,816 --> 00:06:55,358
particulate matter especially
is of such concern to us.

122
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:59,951
So in the image here, you see highlighted
in blue the upper airways of the human

123
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:02,538
body and in green and
red the lower airways.

124
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:05,738
You'll also see to the right of that
actually a couple of different graphs

125
00:07:05,738 --> 00:07:07,350
showing different colored curves.

126
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,308
So the blue curve corresponds
to the upper airways,

127
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:13,614
green to the middle airways and
red to the lowest airways.

128
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:16,810
So if we focus in on the blue area,
your upper airways,

129
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,919
it turns out the body has many ways
of keeping particulate matter out.

130
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:25,528
You have hairs in your nose that are very
effective at filtering large particles.

131
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:29,668
Larger particles will also tend to impact
onto your mucus membranes both in your

132
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:31,417
nasal cavity and in your throat.

133
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:35,292
And both of those mechanisms will
capture the particulate matter and

134
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:39,454
then ultimately expel it by swallowing or
blowing your nose or coughing.

135
00:07:39,454 --> 00:07:44,321
You can see in the graph on the right with
the blue line this is showing basically

136
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:49,514
the impaction effectiveness of different
size particles in those upper airways.

137
00:07:49,514 --> 00:07:53,878
And so you can see we have this U-shaped
curve here meaning that the upper airways

138
00:07:53,878 --> 00:07:57,472
are really good at trapping very
small particles and really good at

139
00:07:57,472 --> 00:08:01,986
trapping large particles, but they let
those medium-sized particles through.

140
00:08:01,986 --> 00:08:05,621
Once the medium sized particles are
through the upper airways there now into

141
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:06,943
the mid and lower airways.

142
00:08:06,943 --> 00:08:11,105
Here we have particles that might
impact into our bronchial tubes and

143
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:12,683
embed in the lung tissue or

144
00:08:12,683 --> 00:08:17,287
the very smallest particles can actually
get down into our alveoli spaces.

145
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:21,736
So the alveoli in your lung are where
your body exchanges oxygen with

146
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:24,635
the atmosphere and with your bloodstream.

147
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:27,205
And so if you look at
the graphs with the green and

148
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:31,446
red lines here you'll see there's a
different size particle that tends to get

149
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:34,737
trapped in the middle airways
then in the low or red airways.

150
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:38,480
And I want to highlight
specifically that red line, so

151
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,389
you can see between about .01 and
.1 micrometers or

152
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:48,235
microns is where the lower airways tend
to capture those very smallest particles.

153
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:53,682
In other words, that size particle range
tends to go very deep into our lungs and

154
00:08:53,682 --> 00:08:57,029
potentially can have
the worst health impacts.

155
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:02,008
Now switching gears for a moment here I
want to talk a little bit more about smog.

156
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,359
You may have experienced or
heard of smog episode,

157
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:06,445
we certainly talked
about the one in London.

158
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,501
But why does a smog episode occur?

159
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:10,264
Why isn't it always smoggy?

160
00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:13,812
And it turns out here we
actually have to turn to weather.

161
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:18,474
So if you look at a normal circumstance
for most weather conditions in the left

162
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:23,495
graphic here, we have warm air rising and
it can continue rising through cooler and

163
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:27,462
cooler air until eventually,
it hits the ambient temperature.

164
00:09:27,462 --> 00:09:31,896
In the case of an inversion, we have
a flipped situation where cool air is

165
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:35,476
trapped down at the ground by
an upper warmer layer of air.

166
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:38,938
So here we imagine the pollutants rise
because they tend to be warm, but

167
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:43,037
then they hit this warm layer of air, and
they can't rise anymore which effectively

168
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:46,733
results in all those pollutants
particularly ozone and particulate matter

169
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:52,142
being trapped right down at the ground
level where we are trying to breathe.

170
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:56,028
I want to wrap up here by noting that it's
not just outdoor air pollution that we're

171
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,541
concerned about we also have to be
concerned about indoor air pollution.

172
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:03,708
So here we have an image of a house you
can see all of these red lines coming in

173
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:07,893
are different types of pollutants that
we might be exposed to in the home.

174
00:10:07,893 --> 00:10:11,509
In the upper right corner, you can see
outdoor air pollutants, of course,

175
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:15,316
our house does not exist in a vacuum and
whatever's outside can make it inside.

176
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:18,036
But in the home,
we might have exposure to example for

177
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:20,525
things like asbestos
from building materials.

178
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:23,640
At the bottom you see we may have
radon actually coming in from

179
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,157
the ground through our basement or
crawlspace.

180
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:29,247
If we have just the wrong
combination of temperature and

181
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,873
humidity we can have mold and
bacteria very common in bathrooms.

182
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:36,960
If we have a fire going somewhere in the
house either for heating or for cooking or

183
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,502
both we're going to have combustion
products and smoke from the fire.

184
00:10:40,502 --> 00:10:45,104
And unfortunately a lot of the building
materials we use as well as paints tend to

185
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,175
omit volatile organic compounds.

186
00:10:47,175 --> 00:10:51,340
So again, we're very concerned at a global
scale about outdoor air pollution, but

187
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,701
we also need to be concerned about
what I'll say is a microclimate.

188
00:10:54,701 --> 00:11:00,672
Basically the indoor environment in
homes where people can also get exposed.
