1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:19,520
It's not that you don't like to call me here in America or things like that.

2
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:55,440
I start with you can choose from something like that, but I think that just because something else I think about it.

3
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,350
Yeah, it's high time.

4
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,880
I'm excited and excited to be back.

5
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:23,650
That's always a good thing.

6
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:32,910
And I almost cried because that's what it's like.

7
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,120
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

8
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:51,640
Yeah. Like I was like, oh, we're going to go.

9
00:01:53,250 --> 00:02:00,180
Oh, yeah, it was my friend. So I was really happy.

10
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,460
It was like, Yeah, you know what I mean?

11
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:22,410
Like it was like, very. Because like I said, I think it was well, anyway,

12
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:41,459
basically families are very important because they are really like not like I think they were in the wedding.

13
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:57,540
So I was really cool to be there when your husband was like, Yeah, sounds cool, but well, I do like to see your kids and scores yesterday afternoon.

14
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:13,020
Yeah. So, um, uncurved version of the example, the average was an 82 and the standard deviation apparently and I should say it was like one half.

15
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:20,580
Erm the exam and if you want to get a look at your exam I have them.

16
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,770
So they're in alphabetical order so I can put these up here, can look at these hundreds at the end of class.

17
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:39,570
So if you have any questions about any, any particular things about the exam that you want to ask me about, I'm happy to answer any questions.

18
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:48,689
I'll note that. Just a second question. Number 17, there were two acceptable answers, and I went back and I made that correction.

19
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,070
Everybody's exam a hand up here. What's the mean now?

20
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,840
Like With the curve now is 90 to 90% in.

21
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:10,800
Okay. All right. Today, we're going to talk about how do we know that obesity is causally related to chronic disease?

22
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:18,870
We're going to go through a bunch of different ideas and examples about humans and animal models.

23
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,499
Yes. I can't. It's in October of.

24
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,220
Oh, it's an October, October, because we're behind by a day.

25
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,810
Yeah. We're going to finish that discussion. We have.

26
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:48,900
Sorry. This is an important topic here, and I'm.

27
00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:03,380
All right. We're talking about Cushing syndrome. Sorry. So this is a condition that's usually caused by a tumor in the pituitary gland.

28
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:17,540
And as a consequence, they produce a lot of the speech that results in an increase in hormones, every gland.

29
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:27,260
So you have an over an overexuberant increase in cortisol, but this is a massive increase.

30
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:34,490
If you were to measure the urinary output of cortisol metabolites and somebody who has this condition,

31
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:40,370
you'd find 50 to 100 milligrams per liter of urine of cortisol metabolites.

32
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:48,740
If you were to measure the level of cortisol metabolites in somebody who does not have this condition,

33
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,840
it would be in the microgram range per liter of urine. Somebody who's stressed, who's under chronic stress.

34
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,319
Stress. You know, it depends. Sometimes they'll have a plan where I'll put in.

35
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:09,760
Sometimes I have an elevated cortisol output. But in either case, it would be in the microgram per liter of urine range.

36
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:18,310
So this is way above the charts in terms of its level of cortisol that's being produced.

37
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:30,130
So what happens? So with this particular condition, you get all kinds of changes in your body composition and your appearance.

38
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:39,930
So having this condition can cause emotional disturbance because you have this chronically activated cortisol response.

39
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:49,750
Right? And then this can cause all kinds of conditions, including energy surplus from caution makes you hungry.

40
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,730
And as a consequence, you consume more calories if you have a positive energy balance.

41
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:06,700
So over time this occurs, it can lead to cardiac hypertrophy and hypertension and this chronic activation of this system.

42
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:17,200
And it can cause not only not only having a higher BMI, obesity, but you can have an increased lipid turnover.

43
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:31,060
So cortisol changes in your adipose tissue compartments or location can change as a consequence of having this elevated output of cortisol.

44
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,719
And one thing that was noted in the paper that I had,

45
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:45,880
all you have to do with Lipolysis occurring and you're seeing this reduction in the lower body adipose tissue, the subcutaneous compartment.

46
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,530
So those lipids are mobilized and they are.

47
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,630
Accumulate in the upper body compartment above the waist, in the visceral compartment.

48
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:04,100
And you'll see this appearance of what is described as a a buffalo hump or a deposition of adipose tissue on their backs.

49
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:14,690
So this is a clinical condition caused by this massive increase in political costs as a

50
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:24,410
consequence of having this overproduction cortisol due to perhaps a tumor within the pituitary.

51
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:34,170
And naturally, as we see more and more people having this, you know, I don't know.

52
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,820
I don't know. I don't think so. But I don't know about the prevalence of this condition.

53
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:44,150
I just wonder about the tumor. In the pituitary gland, tumors become more prevalent.

54
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,050
I don't know. I don't know. So it's kind of constant.

55
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:57,980
Yes. Yeah. Okay. The other thing that you should know about this is you can have a condition called the Archer genic, iatrogenic Cushing syndrome.

56
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:07,220
And in this particular condition, it happens on people who are on who are taking dexamethasone or prednisone.

57
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,640
This is a drug form of the cortisol.

58
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:19,250
That's the same thing. And again, the dosage here is in the milligram range and the 20 milligrams per day.

59
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:27,440
So this is a massive dose of of of cortisol or glucocorticoid that can have a similar effect.

60
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,630
Okay. I've seen what the trial has been discussing at the moment.

61
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:40,550
Yes. Can cause a change in lipid deposition as a consequence of having very high serum cortisol levels.

62
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:46,910
And once she recovered from the additional illness she had, she stopped using them as the centerpiece.

63
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,900
Yes. And you can go back to the appearance they had before they were on the drug.

64
00:09:51,920 --> 00:10:01,070
Yes. So if you have if you have a condition where you have chronic inflammation, you might be given a high dose of cortisol.

65
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:09,500
These people develop if you're on high dose cortisol for a long period of time or you have Cushing syndrome, you could develop diabetes.

66
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:13,840
But when you go off the drug, everything goes back to where you.

67
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,460
So this is a little bit of a summary of what we talked about.

68
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:29,800
So within the paper, it describes the differences between upper and lower body fat compartments.

69
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:38,599
And it specifically talked about Inhumans and it talked about the fact were abdominal

70
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:45,260
subcutaneous adipose tissue versus that that you sat within the gluteal going,

71
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,520
I know I should say something in this adipose tissue compartment.

72
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,100
And why do you think why do you think they had very little discussion of visceral.

73
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:01,130
Adipose tissue in this particular case.

74
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:09,360
You're going to find a whole lot of studies that have examined visceral tissue not.

75
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,500
It's highly it's an invasive procedure to get visceral, adipose tissue.

76
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,330
Okay. You have somebody undergoing surgery for whatever purpose that might be.

77
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:28,719
You could access the visceral fat plus tissue compartment, but otherwise you're not going to do this.

78
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,390
And they're not going to do that because they're not going to let you access this.

79
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,550
Tissue. Unless there is a significant need to do something.

80
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:47,810
And so that's limited our ability to study visceral, adipose tissue in humans.

81
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:59,750
However, there are a number of studies that have done this. Most of the time they're in studies where people are undergoing some type of surgery.

82
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:10,429
And it could be for people who are undergoing bariatric surgery, and it could be for people who are undergoing a procedure to,

83
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:19,670
for example, that they're having their gallbladder removed or they're having their appendix or so.

84
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:34,670
So the upper body, the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue is the adipose tissue that it gets its lipid from killing microns after a meal.

85
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,400
And that's the immediate fat storage. Or at least.

86
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:51,090
And you have within this particular adipose tissue depot, lots of vasculature that drain into the blood supply.

87
00:12:51,690 --> 00:13:00,690
And this is another reason why this is thought to contribute to issues with insulin insensitivity and higher

88
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:06,990
glucose output as a consequence of having a larger tissue compartment or a higher waist circumference.

89
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:16,030
It's it's release of lipids is sensitive to the adrenergic stimuli.

90
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,200
It's heavily innervated with a sympathetic nervous system.

91
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:29,410
And then with exercise, you'll see the greatest percentage change in terms of a decrease in this particular detail.

92
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:39,520
Now, the changes that occur with exercise in terms of liberation of lipids from tissue adipose tissue fats is systemic.

93
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:47,890
So the idea that you can spot trained to reduce adipose tissue and of one region of the body is not true.

94
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:57,399
The systemic effects from and including coalmines and other hormones that increase the liberation of lipids from different adipose tissue.

95
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:10,030
That's okay. In terms of why we see more hypertrophy as opposed to hyperplasia and less adipose tissue better.

96
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:23,170
Well, this is regulated by genes that are exclusively expressed in this particular emphasize that affect their expansion.

97
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,020
And I'm sure a bunch of transcription factors that were noted in your reading

98
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,910
in terms of their ability to regulate the process of adipose tissue expansion.

99
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:42,430
And I'll talk on the next slide a bit about what these cells do when you take them out and culture them and study them.

100
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:50,780
The lower the G sat, the lower subcutaneous adipose tissue compartment there,

101
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:59,030
their lipid uptake comes from the redistribution pathway, from very low density lipoprotein and not after five fatty acids.

102
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:09,410
So long term storage, you can liberate lipids from this with a negative energy balance, but it takes a much longer period of time to do this.

103
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:19,310
And this bet is regulated by a number of genes that are exclusive to this particular detail.

104
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:31,700
So these are transcription factors here that can regulate this process of hyperplasia as opposed to hypertrophy, but the tissue undergoes expansion.

105
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:39,650
So upper body adipose tissue, short term adipose tissue develop in terms of turnover of lipids,

106
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:51,290
lower body long term storage is important in terms of it having a long term effect and they're regulated by different sets of transcription factors.

107
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:59,870
The paper also mentioned how epigenetic control can influence the genesis of these different sites.

108
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:08,770
Yeah, yeah. So you asked why they didn't compare this to the other two compartments.

109
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:16,280
And what I saw is, isn't there a difference between the Crestor or the subcutaneous,

110
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:22,159
which they want to check just the subcutaneous fat, the two different nutrients there still.

111
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:32,850
Yes, yes. Even though we're talking about the same type of subcutaneous adipose tissue, there are still differences of this alone.

112
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:41,970
That was the point of this this diagram and this this particular, though, I would say between visceral and subcutaneous.

113
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,010
Okay. Next slide. Okay.

114
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:55,320
So. How do we know that there are these different programs that are genetically controlled?

115
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:03,570
And that comes from studies when we're looking at three different adipocytes, when you take them from different adipose tissue deposits.

116
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:17,190
So here in the top part of this figure, we have a little subcutaneous period that besides portion A and B portion of this figure,

117
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:25,040
we have abdominal subcutaneous created sites. And then a portion see of this figure, you have a mental, visceral period of a science.

118
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:34,990
Okay, so the reason why you're studying the pre adipocytes is they're a much, much easier to culture and they live for a longer period of time.

119
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,790
The mature adipocytes are difficult to do very much with.

120
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,870
They don't live very long. They're hard to to study in culture.

121
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:51,750
So a lot of the studies that you'll look at or you'll see in the literature study, if it Genesis start with the pre adipocytes.

122
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:59,310
So you can take you can take a biopsy of adipose tissue and you can subjected to a collage and they

123
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:08,940
digest this degrades the structure of the adipose tissue liberates lipids to mature adipocytes.

124
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:15,030
You put this in in cell culture, media, immature deposits float to the top because they have more lipid in them.

125
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:22,230
And then you centrifuge that and the cells that are denser will go to the bottom of the tube.

126
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:32,490
That's where you'll find the pre adipocytes. And you take those out, you culture them and you give them things that promote their differentiation.

127
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:42,660
So when you follow these cells and you promote conditions that will result into Genesis and replication,

128
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:48,000
you get an cells or a pre adipocytes coming from this region,

129
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:59,100
the subcutaneous femoral region, you get lots of hyperplasia and cells that have a smaller vacuole with lipid occlusion.

130
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:10,619
When you study that abdominal subcutaneous version of that, it's up to the abdominal subcutaneous created.

131
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,009
Besides,

132
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:20,459
they differentiate and they follow a pattern that's somewhat similar to what you would see and the ephemeral subcutaneous period of the sites.

133
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,320
But there are some differences that were noted in the paper in terms of what controls

134
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:34,710
their proliferation and the number of cells and the diameter of the cells and so on.

135
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:45,030
The big difference here in this particular figure is when you take the sites from the visceral compartments in this particular diagram,

136
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:50,670
the first illustration, they refer to the your mental tissue pad.

137
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:56,819
Some of you have posted this picture of this in the reading, and this is a adipose tissue,

138
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:06,930
people that is within the visceral compartment that kind of hangs from the stomach.

139
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:18,030
So it's often referred to as an apron or a adipose tissue that grows from the stomach

140
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:24,150
and expands over the small intestines within the visceral compartment within humans.

141
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,890
And in this scenario,

142
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:39,420
you're adding things within culture that promote adipose genesis and replication relative to process is is less than

143
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:48,000
what you see for the other types of sites so they don't replicate and expand under these same culture conditions.

144
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,770
Instead, they increase in diameter.

145
00:20:53,340 --> 00:21:04,800
So just by taking these cells out of people and culturing them, we, we see differences in terms of their ability to proliferate in culture.

146
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,259
So this is this is how we know this is true.

147
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:19,100
And in humans, instead of just relying on animal models where we feed them a high fat diet to help you acculturate.

148
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:26,809
So you have cell culture media that you can buy from a supplier and you have cell culture

149
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:33,230
dishes and you take a biopsy of somebody who's undergoing some kind of a surgical procedure,

150
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:44,149
and then you do that to a college and digest and centrifuge and then pour off the fluid and then what's left in the bottom of these cells.

151
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:48,620
And you can extract the adipocytes by using a density gradient.

152
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:55,670
So intensity gradient, essentially a high molecular weight type of fluid,

153
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:02,450
and you can centrifuge the cells and you can separate them based on their density.

154
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:11,149
I saw through a people who are close to you have to do a transplant and that explains you take out the silicone,

155
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:17,600
but breast implants and the surgeon takes some of the fat and the arm release

156
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:24,830
and also tummy input to the chest cavity for a more natural kind of implant.

157
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,590
Does that change the best hope to change what the best hope says?

158
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,140
Oh, probably, yeah. I just moved to a different place and probably not.

159
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:45,740
Okay, any questions? Glad that if you want to clarify control of how this is the same as visceral.

160
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:46,720
Yes. Okay.

161
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:56,660
And then in terms of risk of metabolic dysfunction, the more visceral adipose tissue you have, the greater risk and then the visceral adipose tissue.

162
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:06,090
And so for abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue and then direct your summer.

163
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:22,850
Yes, that's true. Yeah. Just a question about the subcutaneous adipose tissue and abdominal spontaneous adipose tissue.

164
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:31,100
You this link to the second family of the interesting not significant AIDS eight.

165
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:40,520
The well in this particular diagram in terms of tissue growth they're the same but

166
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:46,430
in terms of what controls their growth and what's been shown and other studies,

167
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:53,890
they're different. Okay. Okay.

168
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:05,980
So moving on to the next thing. So learning objectives for describe the relationship between BMI and all cause mortality in humans.

169
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:15,090
I've got a bunch of different associative or graphs to show you the evidence that

170
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:18,450
supports the notion that being overweight increases the risk of chronic disease.

171
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:24,630
And finally, to explain the impact of cardiorespiratory fitness on obesity related complications.

172
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:40,769
Okay, so if you have a condition that if you have a high BMI and usually this is indicated as having a BMI 30 and over this,

173
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,669
first of all, is associated with two different things.

174
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:48,120
You have the metabolic outcomes and we have the mechanical health.

175
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:55,650
Mechanical stress relates to things like obstructive sleep apnea is one example

176
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:00,479
and it's drop and we'll go over this when we talk about obstructive sleep apnea.

177
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:11,960
But this is a condition in which the adipose tissue expands around the neck and it affects your your airway.

178
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:21,820
When you lie down, you go to sleep. And so this is an example of the mechanical stress that's increased with having a hard time.

179
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,830
And there are other ways to have sleep apnea. We'll talk about that more detail later.

180
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:34,570
There's osteoarthritis. This is a condition that usually occurs as you age.

181
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:46,930
If you have a higher weight, higher, higher adipose tissue levels, this can promote and worsen outcomes associated with osteoarthritis.

182
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:54,520
It's the it's the mass we're talking about here in terms of provoking this increased risk.

183
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:01,240
It's also an inflammatory component that can increase the severity of osteoarthritis as well.

184
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:07,630
Not only in the weight bearing joints relationship, but also in your fingers, in your hands.

185
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,920
And that's related to this chronic state inflammation.

186
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:20,200
And if you have other things, hypo obesity, hyperventilation syndrome, we talk about that a little bit later.

187
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:32,740
So these are mechanical stress related issues with having a higher BMI and they can occur at a younger age in terms of sleep apnea and at older age.

188
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:38,110
In the case of osteoarthritis and the hyperventilation syndrome can occur at any age.

189
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:51,059
So for the most part, the consequences and metabolic health related to obesity have to do with this

190
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:56,250
increased circulating pool of blood in the bones going back to the bathtub.

191
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:10,930
Examples. If your adipose tissue did not functionally store those lipids, spill over into the blood, they can go into other tissues and organs.

192
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:20,310
So it's the functional capacity of more adipose tissue to completely prevent this from happening.

193
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:32,280
But if you overload your adipose tissue, no matter how big your bathtub is, how big your frame size is, it can lead to metabolic consequences.

194
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:39,830
So that the insulin resistance, hypertension and dyslipidemia.

195
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:44,180
We'll talk about each of these in subsequent lectures.

196
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:51,560
And a type two diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke and so on.

197
00:27:52,150 --> 00:28:00,470
And nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. I have a lecture prepared for each of these types of chronic diseases associated with obesity.

198
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,720
Okay, what about some other things?

199
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:13,100
So with chronic systemic inflammation that occurs as you increase in BMI, this can lead to many, many other conditions.

200
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,660
Certain types of cancer, endometrial liver, colon cancer.

201
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:24,950
And that can affect the severity of illness from certain infectious diseases.

202
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:32,270
And there have been numerous studies on severity of illness from viral diseases,

203
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:37,819
primarily COVID 19 being one and influenza being another that are more severe

204
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:42,410
in people who have these need for reasons that are completely understood.

205
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:52,730
What happens there is individuals who get these viral infections that a to the immune response to the viral infection seems to be delayed.

206
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,400
And when they do respond,

207
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:03,860
it's an overexuberant inflammatory response that can result in a collateral damage to tissues that makes their outcomes a bit worse.

208
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:17,210
Okay. So this is the these are the this is the paradigm leading to an increase in morbidity mortality.

209
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:23,510
How do we know this is true? Okay. Let's start out with these association studies.

210
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:34,220
Okay. Yeah. Just real quick, you said for the COVID 19 or like diseases that it would be like an over inflammatory response or did you say delayed?

211
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,050
So it's it's first it's delayed.

212
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:44,300
So if you look at the recruitment of immune cells to the lung after infection and we follow that time course first there are fewer cells,

213
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:48,770
there are fewer cytokines produced to recruit recruitment, the cells there.

214
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:59,510
And then there's an overexuberant response. You get a massive increase in cytokines and a massive increase in cells and as a consequence there's more

215
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:05,840
collateral damage to the tissue from the lung as a consequence of that aberrant response to the infection.

216
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,860
Yes. And it's been shown in mice and humans bacterial infections.

217
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:19,700
There's some controversy there in terms of whether or not it's it's it follows the same pattern or not.

218
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:24,590
And it depends on the pathogen, the age of the individual and so on.

219
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:31,750
Okay. Associative studies on mortality and the j shape.

220
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:41,329
For this particular example, we're looking at just white people, people of European descent.

221
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:46,710
We're going to get to other populations here in a minute. So this is a massive study.

222
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:52,219
So this was data that was acquired from a number of different cohort studies.

223
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,580
These are prospective studies that were examined here.

224
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:05,030
So in this particular study of almost one and a half million white adults and 58% of them were women,

225
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:14,870
and median age was 58 years, the median BMI was 26.2.

226
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:25,670
And we're looking at all cause mortality, adjusting for age, physical activity, alcohol consumption, education, marital status.

227
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:33,490
Now, education is often used as an indicator of socioeconomic status and a number of epi studies.

228
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:41,719
It's not perfect, but it's it's used for that purpose. The other thing that's noted in this particular figure,

229
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:52,760
and this is something that affects these curves is smoking stats so that people weren't sure line here

230
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:58,700
represents smokers are all subjects and then the blue line is just healthy subjects who never smoked.

231
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:04,080
So at baseline everybody's considered healthy and then they should do this follow ups

232
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:11,660
and they look at how their BMI at baseline affects mortality all cause mortality.

233
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,310
And this is white women and white men.

234
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:21,620
We see this j shade for greater risk having fewer people who are in the lower category,

235
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:27,580
the underweight category, and an increasing risk with having a higher BMI.

236
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:34,760
And the one value here represents a range shown here in the BMI scale.

237
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:45,080
So we're looking at a range between 21 and about 23 for the control value for this particular analysis.

238
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:55,370
Okay. So the other thing you should note about this is the shape of the curve and the the differences between men and women.

239
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:06,500
Earlier in this semester, I told you that men are going to be more affected by having a higher BMI.

240
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:16,940
And you see that reflected in the shape of the curves that the hazard ratios increase even in people who have never smoked.

241
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:23,030
Okay. So that's just white people.

242
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:29,540
This is an association study and this is a lot of participants combining lots of cohort studies.

243
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:35,690
I wonder why they chose to put everyone together in smoking.

244
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:44,750
Separate smoking smokers from non smokers are no current smokers from previous smokers from years of smoking.

245
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:49,880
So there's a lot of variation there that I feel like they put everyone that has never smoked.

246
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,110
Yeah. And everyone else never smokers versus everyone else.

247
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:58,760
Yes. So the never smokers is to remove the risks associated with smoking.

248
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:03,160
And that has to do with what's going on down here. Okay.

249
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:12,469
What's going on down here is so you have all subjects and we see this uptick of having this people being in this lowest category for BMI,

250
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:18,140
having a greater risk of all cause mortality so smokers can get a placebo.

251
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,390
And in emphysema, you see a decline in body mass.

252
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:32,270
And as a consequence, they'll have a lower BMI and a lower life span as a consequence.

253
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:38,960
So that's why you'll see this separated like this. Otherwise, it can be confounding in terms of this association.

254
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:44,480
Okay. What about other populations?

255
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:50,320
So I showed you this. Bigger from the beginning of the semester.

256
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:54,430
So this is BMI. This is a BMI.

257
00:34:54,610 --> 00:35:04,390
All cause mortality and individual participant data from a meta analysis of 239 prospective studies in four continents.

258
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:09,900
Okay. So here we have the overall similar j-shaped curve.

259
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:14,260
And again, the control here is between 22 and a half.

260
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:23,739
The relative hazard ratios and BMI are at 22.5 and we see an increase with increasing BMI and

261
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:29,140
increased with of people who are in the lower category for BMI following the same kind of pattern.

262
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:38,080
That's the overall pattern. If we look at the European cohort, North American cohort, Australian and New Zealand,

263
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:43,090
East Asian, there's some differences here, but they follow a similar pattern.

264
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:52,719
Now here's South Asia and we find a little bit of a flatter curve and smaller figures for people who are having this higher BMI,

265
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:59,050
indicating there's a much lower prevalence of having this high level of BMI in this particular population.

266
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:05,980
So in this particular study, we're seeing a similar type of relationship.

267
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,980
So what about people who have bigger frame sizes?

268
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:22,840
What about African-Americans? Well, this was another study that looked at just African-Americans.

269
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:33,610
And I'll say right now, you'll find a lot of disparity in BMI and risk of all cause mortality in studies done on African-Americans,

270
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:42,010
comparing them to white individuals. This study was the biggest one I can find in terms of the number of participants.

271
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:48,970
And this is actually data coming from seven different prospective studies.

272
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:57,460
But we had a large number of individuals, about 75,000 males and 81,000 females.

273
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:05,200
And we're looking again at all cause mortality stratified by sex of men in the top, women in the bottom.

274
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,940
And we're looking at the baseline at baseline.

275
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:21,100
We had no chronic illnesses here. And we also have controls now for education, marital status, alcohol consumption, physical activity.

276
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:28,720
And models included all participants, and they were further adjusted for cigaret smoking status.

277
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:42,970
So so this is the dark line here represents healthy never smokers and the dotted line represents all participants.

278
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:49,000
So you can see a similar type of relationship in terms of this.

279
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:57,130
Instead of being a j-shaped curve, we kind of have a U-shaped for these different age groups and in women,

280
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:07,950
but we're seeing an increase in all cause mortality as we're going up higher levels for both men and women.

281
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:19,060
So there are there needs to be more studies in this population.

282
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:25,120
You'll find many fewer studies in the African-American population with regard to these types of relationships.

283
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:38,320
All right. Now, how does this relate to metabolic disease?

284
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:50,950
I showed you this figure earlier, and it looks at a population of people with different races and ethnicities in Ontario, Canada.

285
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:57,520
So we're looking at people who are South Asian and Chinese, black, white.

286
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:02,200
And we're looking here the incidence of diabetes per 1000 person years.

287
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:12,880
And you can see that there are differences here in terms of when somebody with a certain BMI is diagnosed with diabetes.

288
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,080
And we're looking at here body mass index on the x axis.

289
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:22,420
And this incident, diabetes per thousand person, years on the Y axis.

290
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:34,840
And we see differences in race and ethnicity so that individuals that have this greater incidence of the South Asian group,

291
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:47,140
even though in this particular scale they have just a BMI of just 24, we're starting to see this this increase in the Chinese population.

292
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:52,690
We see this increase occurring at 25% of the population.

293
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,740
We're seeing this increase at around 26 for the blind.

294
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:05,079
So there are racial differences related to the incidence of a chronic disease associated with obesity.

295
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,940
In this case, it's it's type two diabetes we're talking about here.

296
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:23,560
Yeah. You know, there were hypotheses as to whether this is more genetic related or more lifestyle and dietary pattern related.

297
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:28,930
Because, like, for instance, South Asians eat a lot of white rice, all of the above.

298
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:39,400
Okay. So in this particular group, here's the here's the notes here associated with this, and you can look up the study.

299
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:46,870
So that's kind of information. You can just guess in terms of why there might be these differences.

300
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:52,960
But it's probably due to all all of the things that you mentioned, not just genetics,

301
00:40:53,890 --> 00:41:00,550
lifestyle factors, socioeconomic factors, dietary factors and so on.

302
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:11,850
I remember you have gone over saying that the second generation of Asia who came here, they start to experience syndrome.

303
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:17,010
So when acculturation, that's a process of acculturation.

304
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:24,510
And you can you can we have exported or there has been the exportation of our lifestyle and other societies throughout globe.

305
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:38,580
When that happens, we see this type of relationship where if you adopt this lifestyle of a positive energy balance and a lower physical activity,

306
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,610
less reliance on traditional foods, and we see this type of relationship all over the world.

307
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:55,450
So. Okay, so an increase is associated with an increased all cause mortality.

308
00:41:55,450 --> 00:42:01,870
But we're talking about some of these other details later in terms of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and so on.

309
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:10,720
Later in the semester. What happens if you start out with a group of people who are at risk of type two diabetes?

310
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:18,860
Have you talked about the diabetes prevention program and medical discussions that we actually got today?

311
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:26,810
Well, this was a classic study looking at this.

312
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:33,590
And in this particular study, we started out with people who were at risk of developing type two diabetes

313
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:38,480
based on their family history and their current fasting blood glucose levels.

314
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:52,399
So these individuals had anywhere from a fasting blood glucose of 95 to 100, but it wasn't didn't reach the threshold for fasting, but glucose,

315
00:42:52,400 --> 00:43:05,930
I would put them in the diabetes category five, their past blood glucose, and they took an enormous sample in terms of the demographic population.

316
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:14,450
In other words, not only white people, but they took African-American, Hispanic Americans, Asians and American Indian as well.

317
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,360
And they had a large number of people that they included in this particular study.

318
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:30,650
So they had these participants and they randomized them and they put them in the three different groups.

319
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:35,750
They had individuals in the intensive lifestyle group.

320
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:42,680
John discussed in more detail later people who are given metformin on a daily basis.

321
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:52,790
And then people who were given a placebo and may have been given advice or were given advice in terms of diet and physical activity.

322
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:07,670
So in the intensive lifestyle group, they reduced their caloric intake, reduced the amount of fat in their diet,

323
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:15,740
and they reduced the caloric intake and it depended on how much calories they reduced depended on their goals.

324
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:22,580
And this particular the goal of the study was to induce about a set at least a 7% loss in their current body weight.

325
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:31,940
Many of these people, I can't remember the exact number for that BMI of these individuals, but I believe it was 34.

326
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:35,960
And again, we'll talk about this in much greater detail when we talk about diabetes.

327
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:43,500
And the other thing that this group did was they exercise 30 minutes a day, five days a week.

328
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:49,980
BLOCK And primarily, when you see the word intensive lifestyle goals,

329
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:58,560
it usually means that not only are these recommended, but people are meeting regularly to monitor this.

330
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:05,970
So they're meeting with dietitians to go over what people of the past two weeks,

331
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:14,730
how much physical activity based on perhaps some kind of a monitor, a pedometer that would prove that they've been exercising this amount of time.

332
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:24,870
And people are meeting in groups together and having a group of people who are at risk of diabetes and trying to

333
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:33,270
prevent them from getting this condition is a powerful influence in terms of people encouraging one another.

334
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:42,600
The terms of the metformin control group were given this at four months,

335
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:49,170
twice daily and then given advice, but they didn't have the same kind of intensive intervention.

336
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:57,420
And the people in the placebo group, they were given advice that they weren't having this in terms of this intensive.

337
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:11,650
Portion of the trial. So I should also mention that intensive lifestyle interventions vary quite a bit.

338
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:18,550
They're not there's not just one thing, and they're changing and getting better as time goes on.

339
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:29,800
All right. So what were the main findings so that people were followed up for four years in this particular publication from 2022?

340
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:34,750
I should also mention here that they're still following up this group,

341
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:42,880
and I'll mentioned what has been seen lately in this group in terms of whether or not these interventions work long term.

342
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:54,370
So even though diabetes and the people that were just given a placebo on advice, their cumulative incidence is about 35%.

343
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:06,520
For people that were given metformin, their cumulative incidence of diabetes was less than 30%, but significantly different than the placebo group.

344
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:15,040
The best group in terms of preventing diabetes was the lifestyle intervention.

345
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:23,800
This is after four years of follow up and as I mentioned before, this study is they're still monitoring these individuals.

346
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:28,990
And we'll talk more about this in detail about these differences.

347
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:39,530
So in terms of how much the waste lifestyle intervention affected long term weight loss?

348
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,620
Well, in the Lifestyle Intervention Group,

349
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:53,780
38% of the people in this group were able to achieve that weight loss goals with 7% of their body weight to maintain that weight loss, about 38%.

350
00:47:55,070 --> 00:48:04,280
So under that, I've seen other studies and this one is often cited as lifestyle intervention being effective.

351
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,930
So about 38% of the people in this particular cohort were able to achieve that

352
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:13,640
weight loss goal and benefit in preventing the development of type two diabetes.

353
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:19,590
As I've already mentioned, maintaining weight loss is hard.

354
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:28,010
It's very difficult for people. There are many people who couldn't achieve that goal, but they still benefited from the lifestyle intervention.

355
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:36,620
Okay, so if you were to look at the number of people on follow up in terms of the percent of people who are still in this group,

356
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:46,250
about 92% of people were followed up for a return of the four year time period for follow up assessment.

357
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:55,400
Okay. So it has to do with the amount of people involved with group meetings and counseling and so on.

358
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,470
Okay. Yeah. So you mentioned there were some.

359
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:09,770
Just wanted to be clear on this part, but the people who were in the lifestyle group might not have had weight loss.

360
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:17,390
Still benefited, you know? Okay.

361
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:23,800
So everything I guess I just wondered as far as the like the randomization.

362
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:30,079
Is there a reason that they didn't do something that like combined treatment with metformin and in terms of lifestyle?

363
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,540
Because I just feel like since they were doing the study anyways,

364
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:42,470
it would have made sense to see how they might have interacted or so it was even more beneficial in terms of why they didn't.

365
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,920
None of these individuals had diabetes.

366
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:56,840
So the idea that you would get somebody who's kind of in the pre-diabetes range, metformin was was novel at this time in terms of preventing diabetes.

367
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:00,740
After this study was done, it's it's more common to see that.

368
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:05,750
But usually you don't prescribe a drug unless somebody reaches that threshold.

369
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:13,669
Now, so were these people that were they're at risk of type two diabetes based on their family history and their fasting glucose.

370
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:19,940
But they did prescribe metformin for some or some of them. Yes. So say, why didn't you have metformin plus lifestyle?

371
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:23,300
Well, yeah, I just feel like it would have made sense to have four different groups because then

372
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:27,650
they could have like established whether like like if the curb would have been,

373
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:32,540
if the line would have been the same for intensive lifestyle and intensive lifestyle plus metformin,

374
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:37,940
then it would be like metformin doesn't add anything, but maybe it would mean even like step down.

375
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:45,790
So I don't know, I just feel like it would have been a good idea. Hindsight's 2020, so perhaps perhaps that that has been done.

376
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:53,750
I know that's the other thing I can tell you about the format is that it causes a little bit of weight loss all by itself.

377
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:58,970
Okay. Well, we'll talk about the study in much greater detail.

378
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,460
So metformin reduces glucose output from the liver.

379
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:13,440
And in that way it can control what goes on in spaces, and it does a lot of other things.

380
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:20,129
And we're learning more and more about exactly what meth market is very inexpensive and it's not on patent.

381
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:25,550
And, you know, it's very I think it's a very affordable drug. There are some side effects of that.

382
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:31,970
So that's something to consider as well. Okay.

383
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:43,069
All right. So we've heard an alternative introducing this alternative idea that it's the stigma associated with having a higher

384
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:50,630
BMI that suspects that's the cause of all of these associated conditions of chronic diseases associated with obesity.

385
00:51:51,140 --> 00:52:00,590
And Linda Bacon, now, Lindo Bacon was the person who wrote the book about their health at every size.

386
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:09,560
And she wrote an editorial in The Scientific American that proposes a different hypothesis.

387
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,190
Okay. So let's walk through this.

388
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:18,380
So obesity, weight, stigma and chronic disease.

389
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:24,800
So some have argued that weight stigma alone causes chronic disease associated with obesity.

390
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,679
And I would say that the weight stick that makes everything works and makes everything worse.

391
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,140
Clearly, stigmatization is wrong.

392
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:46,190
There are many factors that affect somebody's weight, and you shouldn't shame people or do anything to make them feel bad about their current size.

393
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:55,240
So if this is true, if it's just stigma alone, we shouldn't see an increased prevalence.

394
00:52:55,820 --> 00:53:01,990
Metabolic disease and populations where obesity is valued over is value over thinness.

395
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,140
So where would this place be?

396
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:14,920
Well, if you look at the regions through the Pacific Pacific Islanders, they had a very high BMI, had a really big body shrinks.

397
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:28,360
So in Samoa in 1978, before this adoption of the Western style diet was introduced.

398
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:37,040
The average BMI for men was 27 and the average BMI for women was 31.5.

399
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:45,770
And here here in 2013, we have the importation of a Western style diet,

400
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:54,230
and we see an increase in BMI for both men and women that occurred during this time.

401
00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:01,670
The impact that have on practices like type two diabetes, did it increase the prevalence?

402
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:12,770
Okay. So here is graphs looking at the prevalence of Type two diabetes mellitus.

403
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:22,669
The a portion of this figure in men and women on the B portion of the figure and we're looking

404
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:32,180
at these lines that have been drawn and the dotted line corresponds to projections up to 2020.

405
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:36,080
This was published in before this time.

406
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:44,700
And we see that with the increase in the prevalence of obesity and women,

407
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:53,090
the increase in the prevalence of type two diabetes in men and women in this particular location.

408
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:10,430
Now, when we look at age specific type two diabetes, we see the same kind of association.

409
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:20,140
We have an increase in type two diabetes no matter the age with time in these individuals.

410
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:25,249
So the prevalence of type two diabetes is increased along with the increased prevalence

411
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:32,450
of obesity and people living in Samoa during this particular period of time.

412
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:38,989
So we're seeing an increase in the prevalence of obesity and type two diabetes in the society

413
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:44,510
where having a higher BMI is valued and people with bigger frank sizes to begin with.

414
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:56,979
Yeah. I've seen the show. I mean, I don't know what what you were saying was introduced, like the more Western ideals,

415
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:02,950
because I know this guy timeline goes kind of far, so I don't know how to read it.

416
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:10,299
So here's so we're talking about here's the 1978 to 2014.

417
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,480
The dash lines indicate projections. Uh huh.

418
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:21,660
Okay. So when was like in Samoa, the western ideals starting not ideals.

419
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:27,640
The diet. The diet. Did it change it? It started to change in the late seventies and early eighties.

420
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:37,150
Now, people in Samoa, um, I guess said that the preference is to have a high BMI if you don't have a high P,

421
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:40,710
I hope you're somebody who has a BMI of less than 25.

422
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:46,300
You're viewed as somebody who has a disease that is not the preferred body size in this particular culture.

423
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:55,960
Now, when Samoans emigrate to New Zealand, Australia and the United States, then is when that is when they experience weight stigma.

424
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:05,770
But within Samoa in which this data was collected. No, this is the preferred body size, along with the introduction of a Western style diet,

425
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:17,860
which are also introduction of Western media that might influence any type of factors like eating disorders.

426
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:27,220
I don't know. I don't know. But the experience in living in Samoa and living in other cultures is very different.

427
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,670
I would just. Yeah, like what you saying?

428
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:38,330
Because we talked about another class about a study done in Fiji where the introduction of media that perpetuated the same idea.

429
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:42,190
So just kind of wondering if something similar could have happened.

430
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:51,810
I don't know. Just to bring that up where we see the increases, I'm like, was media also a focus on people becoming more aware?

431
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:59,730
I don't know about about how that is it's I'm I do know that when you look look at studies where

432
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:04,420
the interviewed or children had been interviewed about how they feel about the body size.

433
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:08,920
And you compare Germans to Samoans the Samoan children like.

434
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:19,000
Yeah I'm big you I have higher BMI that's what I'm supposed to be big or the Germans are they feel bad about having a higher BMI.

435
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:26,950
So cultural there's a big cultural difference here. Okay.

436
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:33,910
So if weight stigma is required for negative health consequences of obesity.

437
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:41,620
Animals who lack the ability to perceive weight bias should not develop obesity related disease.

438
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:50,610
But I don't necessarily think that way to take my work fired for negative health consequences of obesity,

439
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:54,220
but it definitely can exacerbate the consequences.

440
00:58:55,870 --> 00:59:04,360
So if you have someone entire week going to a doctor's office and they are stigmatized for their weight,

441
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:10,780
then they, like you, might associate doctor's offices with that or experience.

442
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:19,330
And then if they do have a health condition like type two diabetes, then they won't go back to the doctor at that time.

443
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:28,600
Weight stigma affects outcome sequences, not necessarily causing them, but making them worse, which I think I would agree with that.

444
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:40,060
Okay. So I've shown you lots of data on animal models, high fat diet versus a control diet, which is regular chow, which an increase in body weight.

445
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:46,740
You also see an increase in tissue weights. This is mesenteric adipose tissue.

446
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:50,680
This is in quite a lot of post tissue and this is the weight of the liver actually itself.

447
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:55,389
And there's an increase in the mass of these tissues when they're on a high fat diet.

448
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:59,290
Like a high fat diet. Well, animals love it.

449
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:08,950
It's like cookie dough. They will eat this stuff and they will overconsume calories in response to being presented with this stuff.

450
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:14,379
Yes, it is high fat. It's high saturated fat. And that complicates some of the interpretations of these studies.

451
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:19,960
But the findings are very consistent. We find an increase in plasma glucose.

452
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:24,980
We find a increase in urinary glucose in animals that are in the high fat diet.

453
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:27,910
So we're comparing the open circles with the field circles.

454
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:37,460
We're looking at here, hemoglobin, A-1 C on the high fat diet versus control and then blood glucose where we see as time goes on,

455
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:43,070
the animals that are on the higher fat diet, they have higher blood glucose levels.

456
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:48,640
All right. So what do we see?

457
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:52,750
Do we see a similar relationship in household pets? Well.

458
01:00:54,420 --> 01:01:00,239
We have an obesity epidemic. And household pets and and other species.

459
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:06,360
If we see an increase in body weight, we see an increase in its resistance, altered secretion,

460
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:11,670
metabolic changes in the metabolic rate and normal lipid metabolism and so on.

461
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:20,880
And in particular, in terms of type two diabetes, this is becoming more prevalent in household cats.

462
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:28,490
They also can develop hepatic doses and dogs get diabetes as well.

463
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:35,340
But the expansion of adipose tissue into the pancreas in dogs actually destroys beta cells.

464
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:42,750
And as a consequence, they develop with type one diabetes in response to becoming overweight and obese.

465
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:52,440
And there are certain breeds of animals, cats and dogs that are more susceptible to the problem and type two diabetes as well.

466
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,620
So here are a bunch of conditions.

467
01:01:56,910 --> 01:02:01,650
These are obesity related conditions in dogs and cats that you'll see.

468
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:10,680
So you're seeing a higher prevalence of these now because of we're seeing an obesity epidemic in household pets as well.

469
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:17,690
Okay. So here's a. What information could I find on this?

470
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:26,600
Well, this is based on a survey of veterinarians, and they're looking at the percentage of household pets, cats and dogs who are overweight or obese.

471
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:33,350
And this is based on a different kind of a scale, a body condition scale.

472
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:39,290
And the body condition scale. Household pets range from 6 to 9 being overweight or obese.

473
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:50,000
And in these conditions, these animals would be considered to be overweight or obese.

474
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:56,450
And we're seeing a higher prevalence of chronic disease associated with that.

475
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:06,410
And then the treatment here is to feed them less exercise and more perhaps change their food or put them on a prescription diet.

476
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:10,730
And it works because you can control the dogs or cats or can't.

477
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:20,000
So what does this body conditioning score? Well, it's based on this particular chart where you can feel the ribs of the animal.

478
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:27,829
And this is kind of a subjective evaluation of this condition and household pets.

479
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:33,500
But this is the scale that is used. All right.

480
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:44,440
So to summarize this, in the absence of weight stigma in Samoa, we have an increase in population, but it has a very high.

481
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:54,769
The either BMI increased and that's associated with an increase in type two diabetes in rodents and high fat diet cats,

482
01:03:54,770 --> 01:04:01,430
dogs and several other mammalian species. We also see a higher prevalence of metabolic disease.

483
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:16,240
Okay. So going back to the notion of metabolic health and BMI, and this was a slide that I got from Jeff Horowitz, who talks about this all the time.

484
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:28,060
You're looking at a study published by Rachel Wildman, and actually Gary Powers was an author on this particular paper that worked with both of them.

485
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:34,180
And we're looking here at BMI, normal, weight aware, overweight and obese,

486
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:38,350
and we're looking at metabolically healthy and metabolically abnormal unhealthy.

487
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:43,930
And the criteria for this are listed here at the bottom here.

488
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:51,700
So here's the heart of metabolic abnormalities considered, and then here's the criteria for the size of the phenotype here on the right.

489
01:04:52,930 --> 01:05:07,770
So criticism that BMI is that it is not the best indicator of paucity in terms of chronic disease risk.

490
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:18,910
You have you still have a percentage of individuals no matter what their BMI category, who might be metabolically healthy or unhealthy.

491
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:21,910
So let's look at the normal weight condition.

492
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:32,260
You have 70% of individuals in terms of men and 80% of women who are at a moderate, healthy and a smaller percentage that are not.

493
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,790
Overweight category.

494
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:44,060
You have very similar numbers in terms of having overweight and whether or not you are metabolically healthy or metabolically normal.

495
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:49,939
And then when you go up to a BMI of 30 and over, we see, yes,

496
01:05:49,940 --> 01:06:02,300
there's a greater prevalence of a metabolically unhealthy metabolic than normal, as indicated by Rachael Wildman and the higher BMI category.

497
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:08,870
But you still have some individuals who would be still category categorized as being

498
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:13,670
metabolically healthy based on the criteria that she established in her study.

499
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:22,760
So we're looking here at whether or not BMI can predict metabolic health.

500
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:30,290
And it appears that we still have some people despite having a higher BMI, who are still metabolically healthy.

501
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:42,649
Okay. So but then even in contrast here, if you were to draw a line and look at risk of having metabolic being metabolically unhealthy,

502
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:45,950
you would it would increase as your BMI increases.

503
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,129
It's not the most accurate. It's problematic.

504
01:06:49,130 --> 01:07:00,560
It's not the best way to measure body composition, but it's done clinically because it's easy, it's fast, and it does indicate risk.

505
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:08,330
Okay. All right.

506
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:15,950
So can you have high early in life and maintain metabolic health over time?

507
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:26,600
That's not the subject of this study that the the Whitehall study, the Whitehall study was a study done in the United Kingdom.

508
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:33,290
And in this particular study we went in terms of the cohort.

509
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:36,800
So in 1985 they established this cohort.

510
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:50,420
So you have 10,000 London office based staff, about 7000 men and 3400 women, and they were aged 35 to 45 years of age.

511
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:59,350
55 years of age, sorry. And they were civil servants and they were invited to participate.

512
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,990
And they followed them up about 17 and a half years later.

513
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:16,880
This particular graph represents cumulative survival in terms of those who have had or have not had a cardiovascular disease event.

514
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:20,320
An event could be you.

515
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:27,680
You go to your physician and they say you have arrhythmia or you have a heart attack or you have a significant cardiovascular event.

516
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:32,330
And they following these people over a period of time.

517
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:38,540
So we're looking at age years and we're looking at different groups, metabolically healthy,

518
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:47,449
normally metabolically healthy, overweight and metabolically healthy obese in these lines.

519
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:55,850
And then the dashed lines represent people who start out as metabolically unhealthy and these normal other different conditions.

520
01:08:56,870 --> 01:09:00,530
And as you can see, has a huge increase in age.

521
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:06,440
The number of cardiovascular disease events increases with age for everyone.

522
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:14,420
But the in terms of the cumulative survival, people who have not had a cardiovascular event.

523
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:27,130
People who are metabolically unhealthy have more events and fewer of them have not had if you had a cardiovascular disease.

524
01:09:27,150 --> 01:09:33,920
And so the line goes down and you can see that the lines separate out here after the age of 65.

525
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:41,310
So this indicates that having a higher BMI, even though you are metabolically healthy,

526
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:55,270
you'd see lower survival rates at the higher BMI representing a higher BMI categories and having a higher number of cardiovascular disease.

527
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:00,160
So it's not a stable condition. Yeah.

528
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:08,480
Does it have anything to do with perhaps medical professionals not being trained how to help people with the hierarchy?

529
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:16,230
And I think this is so not being trained.

530
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:21,100
This is something that this data doesn't exist. Yeah.

531
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:32,950
I just I'm a little confused about. So when I interpret this crap, it looks to me that that's what this indicates to me,

532
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:37,750
is that metabolic health is a much more important indicator of survival than BMI,

533
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:48,700
because even the obese, metabolically healthy have a better survival than the metabolically unhealthy normal weight people.

534
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:56,470
So people who are metabolically unhealthy, overweight and obese, they're they're all down here at the table.

535
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:59,890
But even normal weight is still in their normal weight.

536
01:11:00,370 --> 01:11:06,160
Metabolically unhealthy. Yeah. Yes. And so so like, if you're metabolically unhealthy, you go to normal weight.

537
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:15,320
Your survival is going to be according to this. Your survival is likely to be less than someone who is obese but metabolically healthy.

538
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:18,550
Okay. Yes, because that's how I'm interpreting this. I just. Okay.

539
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:22,450
Yes. Metabolic. Metabolic health. It's not a stable condition.

540
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:30,760
And people who are starting out as overweight or obese in this particular factor.

541
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:39,250
The same can be true for diabetes. But remember, in terms of metabolic health, you are starting out at a lower level if you have a higher demand.

542
01:11:39,970 --> 01:11:45,600
Yeah. It's just like all of each, all of the three metabolically unhealthy curves.

543
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:50,500
Like toward the end, they're like identical. So it's almost like if you're metabolically unhealthy, like it doesn't really matter.

544
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:53,950
You might as well. Early on. Early on, there are differences.

545
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:57,370
Yeah. But like as you get. Yeah, I think.

546
01:11:58,330 --> 01:12:04,569
Okay. Similar relationship with type two diabetes and the BMI category and risk of

547
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:10,780
type two diabetes with same as the same type of relationship where over time.

548
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:14,509
So this is again the survival curve. So nobody has diabetes.

549
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:21,280
If you're following them, more people get diabetes. We're seeing a decrease in that cumulative survival.

550
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:31,120
And we see people who have who's metabolically healthy, who are obese, fewer of them are still on.

551
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:35,660
I should say more of them now have diabetes. Okay.

552
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:42,130
And that's where these lines start to intersect in terms of they have to start unhealthy,

553
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:49,660
but they become a greater survival in terms of type two diabetes development,

554
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:55,180
because, again, the dash lines represent people who start out as metabolically unhealthy.

555
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:12,220
All right. So the next thing I'm going to talk about is this notion that fitness can modify somebody's metabolic health regardless of their level.

556
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:17,290
And this is true to some extent. But it's protective.

557
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:26,690
But let's look at the different categories and let's look at the different types of chronic disease associated with it.

558
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,150
We're going to look at diabetes first.

559
01:13:30,230 --> 01:13:40,850
So we're looking at here the odds ratio now being active and being in the normal weight category, insufficiently active or inactive?

560
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:53,870
If you're if you're inactive in your normal range of BMI, this increases your risk of having complications associated in this case, it's diabetes.

561
01:13:54,770 --> 01:14:04,580
Okay. If you look at somebody who's who is in the appropriate category and they're active of this,

562
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:11,810
they're at a lower risk of developing diabetes compared to people who are insufficiently active or inactive.

563
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:18,170
But their risk is still higher than a person who's in the normal weight category.

564
01:14:19,290 --> 01:14:24,860
We look at people who have a higher BMI, who have a BMI of 30 and over.

565
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:34,730
Yes, physical activity does modify that risk, but you're still your odds ratio are still quite a bit higher than the other groups.

566
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:42,920
That's diabetes. Now you're looking at security, if you like, the risk of developing diabetes.

567
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:48,820
Okay. So let's look at hypertension now. Purple.

568
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:52,570
Same type of relationship. Less activity. I'm away.

569
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:57,070
Category. Overweight category. Obesity category.

570
01:14:57,730 --> 01:15:03,910
You are less physically active. It's going to increase your risk of developing hypertension.

571
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:16,400
Fitness modifies the effect that people with a higher BMI, but it's still having a lower exactly why that is.

572
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:25,280
We'll talk about this in subsequent lectures in terms of blood lipids, stats, cholesterol,

573
01:15:25,370 --> 01:15:33,470
to see a similar relationship, but it doesn't have the same and you're not seeing the same size of an effect.

574
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:38,150
So here's an orange here, high cholesterol. And people who are overweight category,

575
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:48,109
the overweight categories elevated and then people who are in this category where you some have some effect of modifying cholesterol,

576
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:53,390
but it's not as potent as what you would see in people who are in a lower category.

577
01:15:53,540 --> 01:16:01,760
Exactly right. We'll talk about that later. Is related to, again, your ability, the function of the adipose tissue.

578
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,270
All of this relates back to the function of adipose tissue.

579
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:12,320
If you overload adipose tissue with too much lipid overflow, you're going back to the bathtub analogy,

580
01:16:14,690 --> 01:16:21,379
resulting in a topic deposition of lipid that contribute to these conditions with hypertension.

581
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:26,270
There are some other mechanisms that I'm going to talk about. We talk about insulin hypertension.

582
01:16:30,230 --> 01:16:34,250
So can you be fit and fat? Well, the story's debated.

583
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,010
There are studies that looked at prospective studies,

584
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:45,969
looking at people's initial cardiovascular fitness at a young age and in different categories, and then following them throughout their lifespan.

585
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:54,440
And you find a similar relationship. People who have a higher BMI, who have high cardiorespiratory fitness, then longer,

586
01:16:55,340 --> 01:17:00,230
people who have a low BMI, who have low cardiovascular fitness, all that is long.

587
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:05,000
So fitness is certainly important and this topic is continuous, these debates.

588
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:12,290
What seems clear is that obesity carries a substantial health risk.

589
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:18,500
So being fit and having obesity can certainly improve their health status compared to being unfit.

590
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:26,150
But it's unlikely to completely research to reverse the negative health consequences associated with having kids.

591
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:32,930
So being physically active may be more important than having a high fitness.

592
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:35,060
This is a relationship that I didn't talk about,

593
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:43,160
but just being physically active seems to be the most important thing in terms of exercise, recommendation or for anyone.

594
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:52,730
Just a quick question. Going back, one slide. So in there, categorizing people as overweight and obese, are they only using BMI as a factors?

595
01:17:52,730 --> 01:18:01,950
Because like there are people who have very, very low fat or fat percentage but are like qualify as obese because they have so much muscle.

596
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:07,400
This is a huge group of people and this is just human.

597
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:11,000
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

598
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:14,690
I was just curious what the insufficiently active active was.

599
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:21,740
So if you were to if you're an epidemiologist and you get lots of data in terms

600
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:26,750
of people's physical activity based on maybe how many steps they take a day,

601
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,130
you want to put them in different groups.

602
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:37,910
You do stuff like this, but people that are sufficiently active to meet the criteria for physical activity 30 minutes a day,

603
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:42,800
people who don't meet that for but are not completely inaccurate would be put into other categories.

604
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:49,550
So the criteria set based on the populations today are like the study that was just based on recommendations.

605
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:52,880
Yeah. Okay. I'm going to end right here.

606
01:18:54,060 --> 01:19:03,140
If you'd like to see your exam, I have them in alphabetical order. The grades are on the back page and they're doing for grades.

607
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:15,560
Okay, just keep that in mind if you think you need to get the exam back to me after you're done in alphabetical order.

608
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:31,530
I think that was pretty cool. Yeah.

609
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:40,309
I mean, I actually think I'm going to say something like that,

610
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:57,830
but then also think about it like I know going it's our responsibility to make government part of our.
