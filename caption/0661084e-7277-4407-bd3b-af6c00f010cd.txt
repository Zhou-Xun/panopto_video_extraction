1
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,810
And I want to read to you.

2
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,250
Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. Isaac passed.

3
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:39,170
Here. The the.

4
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,841
I. Yes, I.

5
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:55,669
Oh yeah. I thought I could first go over the recap from the previous class and then I

6
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:59,029
have some announcements before we get into the meat of today's discussion.

7
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:07,519
Okay. So years of life lost.

8
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:11,619
Again, we're going to be going over these calculations in discussion this week.

9
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:20,899
But just to prime your best years of life, lost is where you subtract when somebody died versus some standard life expectancy.

10
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:25,129
And the answer is actually we use a worldwide standard of life expectancy.

11
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:31,158
And, you know, I think that they changes over time.

12
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:35,988
But for a long time, they kind of used Japan as an example of a pretty large country,

13
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:47,389
which has had a pretty high life expectancy and therefore is an example of a place which, you know, has a life expectancy that we could try to attain.

14
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:53,429
Of course, there's, you know, substantial differences in life expectancy across different countries.

15
00:03:53,429 --> 00:04:00,389
And we will talk about that in today's class. Okay.

16
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:04,128
Four years lost to disability.

17
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:06,438
The answer is one is death.

18
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:13,009
And so again, you'll be talking about what these weights actually mean in discussion this week, but this is just something to keep in mind.

19
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:15,769
So zero is death and one is full health.

20
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:22,339
This is an example of utility weight that is often used in something called a quality or a quality adjusted life here,

21
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,898
just to confuse you a bit, but we will be talking about polys later on in the semester.

22
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:33,019
But for now we use dailies. Where are dailies where one is death and zero is for how?

23
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:38,759
In the largest development bank is the World Bank.

24
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:43,029
The Federal Reserve. This is just the United States Central Bank.

25
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:46,319
The International Monetary Fund is not a development bank.

26
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:55,619
This more so has to do with. It's a fund that exists to try to make efficient, different currency exchanges.

27
00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:00,209
But it's not a development. But you often hear about it a lot.

28
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:04,229
And I think historically the IMF has had a European outside its head.

29
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:14,899
Whereas the World Bank has had an American capital. That transitions us into talking a bit about the World Bank.

30
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:21,889
You all had really wonderful questions last time, and so I kind of delved into this a bit myself.

31
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:28,039
So the United States and the World Bank, what is the connection between them?

32
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:32,659
So, you know, there is a pretty formal connection between them.

33
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:41,209
The World Bank is part of the the US Code of Federal Regulations.

34
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:51,379
The US Secretary of Treasurer is on the World Bank's Board of Governors and typically the head of the World Bank is an American citizen.

35
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:59,229
Okay. And there's some really interesting links here that I will go through.

36
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:12,188
One, somebody asked me. Somebody asked me, what is the situation of shares in the World Bank?

37
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:16,779
Like who is who has the largest shares in the World Bank?

38
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:19,539
And how does the United States compare to other countries?

39
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:26,169
This worked on my desktop, but apparently this is like the worst website ever where you can't see anything.

40
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:32,889
But if I remember correctly and maybe some of you on your phone or something can actually view this better than this.

41
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:36,409
Which, again, this is. This is. Well, I guess this works.

42
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:41,629
Okay. So the United States has about 16% of the shares.

43
00:06:42,109 --> 00:06:48,499
Japan, 8%. China, 6%. Germany, United Kingdom, France, around 4%.

44
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:57,648
And other countries less than that. So the United States isn't like an overwhelming number, but, you know, is the highest number.

45
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:01,399
And certainly for for the purposes of setting policy and such,

46
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:06,859
it is a pretty high percentage and it's voting power is pretty much the same as it's total.

47
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:18,469
Sure. Another thing that was asked of me was, um,

48
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:28,709
how much does the United States spend in the World Bank versus in other other types of of of foreign aid funding?

49
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:40,529
So on this website, it lists out how much the United States is giving in overseas development assistance.

50
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:50,659
And so that is related to health care, and that is around somewhere between like $8,000,000,012 billion each year.

51
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:55,198
I believe in more like in 2021 and shot up a lot because there is a lot of COVID vaccine related things.

52
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:04,259
But I think in 2022 is around 12 billion and you see that around 20% of that is multilateral aid.

53
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:08,789
And that'd be something that goes through like the World Bank or maybe the United Nations, something like that.

54
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:16,019
Whereas bilateral aid, again, this would go through U.S. aid or some other thing.

55
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:19,589
They would have a bilateral agreement that is about 80%.

56
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:29,999
And if you look at like how much does the United States give for overseas aid in health compared to other countries?

57
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:34,049
This is a chart which shows that. So, again, the United States around 10 to 12 billion.

58
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,149
The next biggest countries are the UK and Germany, which give around 3 billion.

59
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:46,319
And then, you know, less for for other countries. This is I believe this is limited to looking at OECD countries.

60
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:51,249
So this is kind of like high income countries in the United States and Europe.

61
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:57,929
So it's not a comprehensive list of every single country, but this is what we have.

62
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,049
The other thing which I thought was kind of interesting looking at was because, you know,

63
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:08,938
this is limited to what's the overseas development assistance that's related to health.

64
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:14,939
So like global health aid. So the again, the United States gives 12 billion, but you could look at like of all aid,

65
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:20,789
which is given internationally, what percentage is marketed towards health projects.

66
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:27,429
And in the United States Senate, that's about 30%. So this is.

67
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:31,899
Here they say like 29 million, but it really is a percentage. I don't know why they have million.

68
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:37,749
It should be a percentage. So basically of the amount of money that the United States spends in overseas assistance,

69
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:44,619
29% of it is for health related projects, which seems which is high by international comparisons.

70
00:09:44,979 --> 00:09:49,359
And so I don't know what these other countries are spending things on or, you know, like what what else?

71
00:09:49,749 --> 00:09:57,879
You know, there's a variety of like economic energy, environmental overseas aid, which is given.

72
00:09:58,569 --> 00:10:01,718
So health isn't like the only thing that people spend on internationally.

73
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:08,319
But the United States, I guess historically has spent just a lot internationally on health related projects.

74
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:17,849
And then finally somebody was asking what percentage of or like how does the United States compare to other countries?

75
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:21,269
So you can like look at, you know, like these these numbers.

76
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:25,589
And, you know, the United States seems to be doing a lot.

77
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:29,789
And partially that's also just because we have the largest economy globally.

78
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:34,138
But you can look at like, what is the percentage of the gross national income?

79
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:38,639
And we'll talking a bit about more about, you know, what the Gini means in a future class.

80
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:46,049
But in general, like what of the budget of the United States, what percent is spent on overseas development assistance?

81
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:50,639
And in the United States, it's around 0.2%.

82
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:57,599
So the UN a while ago put a target of 0.7% and only a few countries actually exceed that.

83
00:10:57,599 --> 00:11:02,379
So these generally are smaller countries in Europe, in northern Europe especially.

84
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:12,149
So Norway, Sweden, Denmark have a high proportion of their country's budget, which is given to overseas development assistance.

85
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:20,289
The United States, not so much. But again, like just because we have a pretty large economy to begin with, it just looks like we spend a lot.

86
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:25,409
So, I mean, I would argue that we probably could be spending more, but I think also as part of this class,

87
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:30,329
we're going to be talking about like what is the efficiency of these international projects?

88
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:38,099
A lot of it, if it comes with a lot of strings or if it is like requiring people to change policies in different countries,

89
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,489
you know, it maybe it's not the best use of resources.

90
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:45,719
So again, in general, I think, you know, the more money that we're spending on on health,

91
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:52,449
especially for thinking about health infrastructure, that's great. But. There could be counterarguments.

92
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:59,179
I hear their questions about this, like foreign aid and World Bank.

93
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:06,799
I think you all raised some really interesting points last time. Okay.

94
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:13,849
So a couple of students brought this to my attention. And I keep I'm forgetting to tell you about it, but I want to talk about our textbook.

95
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:19,429
So there is a textbook. We're using the third edition of the Jacobsen Introduction to Global Health.

96
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:23,209
If you want to buy it like feel free.

97
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:30,558
There is also a fourth edition which is out there, but I have read through the fourth edition and it has a lot more stuff on like Covered,

98
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,819
but I didn't think it was super necessary to switch over to a new edition.

99
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:44,249
And beyond that, the library has an electronic subscription to the third edition, which I think is great for you students to take advantage of.

100
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:47,688
But I believe some of you have had trouble accessing it.

101
00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:52,859
And one of the reasons is that the library is part of its license with the publisher.

102
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:58,789
There's a limit to how many students can be concurrently accessing the materials at one period of time.

103
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:08,509
One thing that you may have noticed as part of the textbook page through the website is that you can download individual chapters.

104
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,629
But I would never tell you.

105
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:19,999
I would never tell you to work with classmates and to split up downloading chapters and just share them because the publisher wouldn't like that.

106
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:24,529
So don't do that. Um.

107
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:32,399
Any other question that the textbook. Okay.

108
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:36,659
So today we are going to be talking about health metrics.

109
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:41,679
So health metrics are getting to those ideas of disease burden.

110
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:49,509
So we talked about DALYs on Monday and on Tuesday we're going to have a broader discussion.

111
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:54,569
You know, DALYs aren't the only thing. There are other measures that are out there.

112
00:13:55,019 --> 00:14:03,148
And then in discussion this week, you are going to be calculating, uh, DALYs and then we're going to be talking today about,

113
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:12,029
you know, like, how can we use those DALYs to prioritize the problems that exist in global health and how we can do.

114
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,049
How we can decide what problems we should be actually focusing on, like where where should our foreign aid be going to?

115
00:14:18,979 --> 00:14:26,839
How should countries be developing their health care systems in the most efficient way to counter the most problematic issues facing their country?

116
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:36,129
Okay. So vital statistics is a simplistic killer term.

117
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:41,079
It's a very specific it's a very particular term. And it really has to do with like births and deaths.

118
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:45,459
I think that's those are the big things. But, you know, like other major life events.

119
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:48,159
Um, but yeah, so vital statistics,

120
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:55,839
things of birth and deaths and I think this is one of the things that is one of the core functions of a government is be

121
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,759
able to collect information on how many people have been born in the country and how many people have died in the country.

122
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:07,449
Obviously, the birth rate is looking at the number of births and, you know, the denominator can be whatever we want it to be.

123
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:11,169
But oftentimes we have it per 1000 people, the death rate.

124
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:14,769
We can also see the mortality rate. That's the annual number of deaths.

125
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:18,729
And again, that could be through 1000. It could be 10,000, it could be 100,000.

126
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:22,539
So these rates, you always need to specify what the denominator is like.

127
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:28,719
If somebody said the birth rate of a country was ten or 12.

128
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:34,699
I wouldn't be able to interpret that. Like you need a denominator. There's no set.

129
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:42,698
You know, 1000 is the convention, but that isn't necessarily the case. Okay.

130
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:48,789
So we could look at a crude death rate and we could look at an age standardized death rate.

131
00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:50,139
So let's talk about this a bit.

132
00:15:50,859 --> 00:16:00,699
A crude death rate is just calculating how many people died in the past year over how many people are there in the population.

133
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:06,758
So you see things like the U.S. and Germany.

134
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:15,099
And Germany has a really high crude death rate, whereas places like, you know,

135
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:23,829
in Nigeria and Ethiopia actually have a lower death rate, which seems a bit counterintuitive.

136
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:36,999
Does anyone have an idea of why the crude death rate would be pretty high in a place like Germany and pretty low in a place like Nigeria?

137
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:43,519
Yeah. Yes.

138
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:47,889
So basically, this is an issue of an aging population.

139
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:51,959
So the biggest predictor of whether you die is how old you are.

140
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:55,399
So the older that you are, the more likely you are to die.

141
00:16:57,169 --> 00:17:04,279
So in populations like the United States and Germany, and especially in places like Europe and Japan,

142
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:10,639
which have a highly aged population, their crude death rate is just going to be very high.

143
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:15,979
And that's just because, you know, there's more people who are very old in the population.

144
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:24,809
So one thing we can do is an age standardized death rate. And basically, this is a way where we where we standardize over age.

145
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:28,559
So we look, you know, among people, 0 to 5.

146
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,069
How many have died? Between five and 15. How many have died?

147
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:32,908
15 or 25.

148
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:43,079
So you break the population into these chunks of ages and into these strata, and then you look at within these strata, what is the death rate?

149
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:48,148
And then you can kind of average across the different strata and there's, you know, a few different standardization methods.

150
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:50,849
So you don't need to remember that in depth.

151
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:57,059
But the whole idea behind each standardization is that we are controlling for the age structure of the population.

152
00:17:57,569 --> 00:18:00,239
So when you control for the age structure of the population,

153
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:11,459
the the death rate in the US and in Germany is much lower than in places like Iran or India or, or Ethiopia.

154
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:15,839
So I think this age standardization is really important.

155
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:19,229
I bring this up for a couple of reasons.

156
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:26,699
One is, you know, like just comparing a crude death rate unless I mean, maybe this is important if you're thinking about, you know,

157
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:32,279
prioritization of certain health services or thinking about, you know,

158
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:36,568
what would the funeral services industry need to be like in one country versus another?

159
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:38,729
Then, you know, looking at the crude death rate is important.

160
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:44,939
But if you're looking you're wanting to compare across populations, doing an age standardized death rate is important.

161
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:49,769
The other thing is that since you can standardize in a number of different ways,

162
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:55,589
it's always important to get your age standardized rates from the same source.

163
00:18:55,619 --> 00:19:03,539
Like I wouldn't necessarily trust like age, standardize, comparing and like an age standardized source for the United States from,

164
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:11,609
you know, the CDC versus for Iran from like their equivalent of a public health organization.

165
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:13,979
Just because, like, you can standardize things in different ways.

166
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:17,369
So if it's like on the same website or if it's in the same journal article or whatnot,

167
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:20,549
they presumably have the same way that they're doing that standardization.

168
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:30,089
But just, you know, whenever you start standardizing things, it becomes difficult comparing across different websites or different sources of data.

169
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:37,109
But in general, this is what you should be using, especially if you're, you know, in general for comparing across countries.

170
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:48,949
Okay. Life expectancy is is is a great number, which is this good number that we use in global health for a number of reasons.

171
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:53,938
One is we we have pretty good vital records in many places.

172
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:59,189
You know, not all countries have a good vital registry,

173
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:06,509
but but many do in many middle income countries and even many low income countries will have vital registries.

174
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:09,599
So they have information on who's died within a population.

175
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:13,249
And then from that we can just calculate this life expectancy.

176
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:20,809
So life expectancy is just much easier to calculate as a measure compared to some other things,

177
00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:25,939
which we just don't have information from on such a comprehensive level.

178
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:34,058
And of course, I think this probably should be the goal, like we want to live as long as possible.

179
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:42,188
And I think, you know, if one country has people and citizens who are living longer than another country, it's probably a good sign to that country.

180
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:46,839
It's a sign that that country has a good health care system. There's a good environment, so on and so forth.

181
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:52,118
But beyond looking at health, life expectancy, we can think of like a healthy life expectancy.

182
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:59,079
Sometimes it's called hail. In the past, I think people said this was like a it's like a health adjusted life expectancy.

183
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:08,888
But sometimes we just say healthy life expectancy. And basically this is where you subtract out the years lost to disability in somebody's life.

184
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:20,289
So say that somebody, you know, they died at age 90, but maybe the last 50 years of their life, they had major clinical depression.

185
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,688
So they didn't die of major clinical depression.

186
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:30,039
But from all we know, from the mental health literature, having major depression can be a significant disability.

187
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:35,349
And as a result, this individual's healthy life expectancy would be lower.

188
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:42,609
So if we're trying to compare across countries, it might be useful to use this healthy life expectancy number because that also takes

189
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:45,699
into account the amount of disability that an individual has across their lifespan.

190
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:53,609
Okay. So if we look at life expectancy across birth, we see, you know, some broad trends.

191
00:21:53,619 --> 00:22:03,909
Generally, the highest numbers are in Western Europe, Canada, East Asia, Australia, New Zealand.

192
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:09,489
The United States is sort of like a second tier country in terms of our life expectancy.

193
00:22:09,489 --> 00:22:15,839
We're kind of more in line with Central and Eastern Europe than we are with our peers in Western Europe.

194
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:19,269
So I would say in general, we're not doing so great with life expectancy.

195
00:22:21,189 --> 00:22:23,679
Life expectancy has increased over time.

196
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:34,179
And I would say kind of one of the big exceptions is here in the United States, we've had life expectancy decrease in the past few years.

197
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:38,979
And that was that was something that you all were we're brainstorming reasons why the first day of class,

198
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:48,189
if there are wars in a country or large political or civil strife, you also see that life expectancy can decrease.

199
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:55,539
Okay. So I think this is like a more recent.

200
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:02,299
Image. So I wanted to go over this.

201
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:08,608
So if we look at the United States again, in recent years, we've been declining.

202
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:14,889
That's not great. So where we're at now is kind of where we were at in the middle of the 1990.

203
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:20,788
So again, we're backtracking a lot, and that's very different than a lot of other countries.

204
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:26,599
So here are, you know, are countries which have a similar levels of economic development.

205
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:29,789
And again, we'll be talking about critiques of what development means.

206
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:35,429
But theoretically, we should think that we should have similar trends as they do.

207
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:43,679
The interesting thing I would have to say about this is if you look at the United States in 1980, we were sort of middle of the pack.

208
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,419
We were sort of like an average high income country in terms of our life expectancy.

209
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:53,059
But then we just did not see the improvements that other countries did.

210
00:23:53,069 --> 00:24:00,028
So, you know, by the late eighties, early nineties, we were falling substantially behind other countries.

211
00:24:00,029 --> 00:24:10,049
So for instance, Austria in 1980 had about a year less of life expectancy than we.

212
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:17,849
But at this point in time, Austria has, I believe, five years longer life expectancy than the United States.

213
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:24,468
So, you know, this isn't something that just like. Has always been in existence.

214
00:24:24,469 --> 00:24:32,509
Like we we actually performed pretty well as a country relative to other countries in like the 6070s and eighties.

215
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:38,569
And it really has been in recent decades where we've sort of plateaued and regressed.

216
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:48,099
Does anyone have any strong thoughts of like what happened in like the eighties and nineties that that made us not do so well?

217
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:57,919
Yeah. Yeah.

218
00:24:57,999 --> 00:25:04,559
So we can certainly think of, like, specific epidemics which are going on, like the HIV epidemic.

219
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:07,679
Yeah. I think that that certainly hit the United States pretty hard.

220
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:19,319
Any other thoughts? Yeah. So it is very interesting thinking about like how does our, uh,

221
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:26,019
how does our lifestyle and how does like these modifiable characteristics in the United States compared to maybe Europe?

222
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:29,759
So you mentioned tobacco. Are there any other, like, behaviors?

223
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:33,549
Yeah. Right. That's totally fine.

224
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:41,419
Got. So I think you're trying to think of like maybe being a bit more of a militaristic

225
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:47,449
society and maybe there's something there with people dying as part of that.

226
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:51,629
Certainly, I think that does contribute to a certain extent. Yeah. Yeah.

227
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:56,839
Like the war on drugs and all. Privatization.

228
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:08,929
Health care. Yeah. So I think there was, you know, in the sixties with President Johnson, he had introduced it.

229
00:26:08,949 --> 00:26:10,599
What was it, the Great Society program.

230
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:15,968
There's all these government entitlement programs which were to alleviate poverty, increase access to health care.

231
00:26:15,969 --> 00:26:25,469
But a lot of that kind of was reversed. But there was another hand that was up in this area and I wanted to get back there.

232
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:39,909
I was just. Economic policy is a lot more about quality.

233
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:54,659
Yeah. So I think here in the United States, we have a lot more we are much more willing to accept inequality compared to a lot of other countries.

234
00:26:56,009 --> 00:27:01,959
And so I guess the idea is that for some people, maybe there is really great health care.

235
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:08,938
Maybe they have like a very high life expectancy for a certain like a small segment of the US population.

236
00:27:08,939 --> 00:27:14,009
But equally on the other side there's a lot of people who just like do not have that access and.

237
00:27:14,979 --> 00:27:23,319
I do think, you know, there was a shift in thinking about this in the Reagan area and that's like completely dunk on conservative ideas because,

238
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:28,058
you know, there potentially could be some positive thought processes there.

239
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:33,279
But I do think there was a huge change in how the government also was disbursing funds.

240
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:42,639
Prior to the eighties, there was sort of a system of giving local health departments a pool of funds where they had you know,

241
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:48,489
they had own their own decision making abilities to decide what they were going to do with that that parliament.

242
00:27:49,449 --> 00:27:54,699
But starting in the eighties, there was this idea of getting block grants to individuals.

243
00:27:54,699 --> 00:27:56,528
So basically the federal government was saying, oh,

244
00:27:56,529 --> 00:28:03,069
let's spend money on this specific thing and you can't really be using the money for other, other things as well.

245
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:08,829
I think this went hand in hand with with with increased privatization of our health care sector.

246
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:16,429
But basically, we're we're more constrained in the United States to dealing with issues,

247
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:22,639
into responding to health care, health care problems, which, you know, is very unfortunate.

248
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:32,139
Okay. So we could also look at healthy life expectancy.

249
00:28:33,229 --> 00:28:42,319
So these charts are looking at total life expectancy and oh, and I the other thing that I was going to mention about like behaviors.

250
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,849
So tobacco use, it kind of depends on what European country you're looking at.

251
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:53,149
But in a lot of places, actually, tobacco use is much higher in in in other countries than in the United States.

252
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:59,599
That's sort of been like a a shining example of public health in the United States is that we have been able to decrease tobacco use.

253
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:03,079
But again, it depends. It depends on what comparison we're actually doing.

254
00:29:03,499 --> 00:29:07,339
But if you think about, like, you know, exercise patterns,

255
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:13,329
how people are commuting to work and how much like activity they get, what kind of foods we are eating, what are we drinking?

256
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:19,759
I think in general, the sum of that makes us have worse behaviors here in the United States compared to other countries.

257
00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:31,149
Okay. So if you look at life expectancy, this chart shows overall what is the life expectancy and then what is healthy life expectancy?

258
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:36,849
Sort of subtracting out the average years that people live with disability.

259
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:42,608
So here in the United States, it was like around 76 years for total life expectancy,

260
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:48,069
but maybe around something like 66, 67 for healthy life expectancy.

261
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:54,218
We have like a number of other disparities that we potentially are looking at here.

262
00:29:54,219 --> 00:30:00,669
For instance, like in almost every country, men have a lower life expectancy than women.

263
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:10,299
Does anyone have any thoughts on why that's the case? Yeah.

264
00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:20,419
Yeah. Great. And so I'm just summing up to class if you can hear.

265
00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:25,699
So like injuries, access to care, chronic illness and tobacco use.

266
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:32,449
Yeah. So tobacco use generally in every country, including the United States, is higher among men.

267
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:38,889
Any other thoughts? Yeah.

268
00:30:38,889 --> 00:30:46,329
So I think there you could think of like social things, uh, in terms of, you know,

269
00:30:46,329 --> 00:30:52,208
what kind of environmental exposures do, do people have in their occupations?

270
00:30:52,209 --> 00:30:59,099
You know, generally men are much more likely to have jobs in construction, for instance, than women.

271
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:06,189
So some of these really, uh, these jobs which are more dangerous are more likely to be filled by men.

272
00:31:06,349 --> 00:31:12,278
Um, there sort of is, maybe we can think of it more like the toxic masculinity side of things about like,

273
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:16,779
are you going to go to a doctor if you have a problem?

274
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:24,099
And I think generally men have like a greater tolerance for not going to a doctor, even if something is very serious.

275
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,629
Um, there is also more biological things you could think of.

276
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:35,108
And there have been people who have who postulated that there is sort of this advantage to having more estrogen in your body.

277
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:42,939
So, yeah, I just. Are there studies that show what factor like what disabilities?

278
00:31:44,189 --> 00:31:49,169
Like affect on healthy life expectancy, like depending on the country that would be related.

279
00:31:49,169 --> 00:31:59,149
So there definitely are there definitely are studies out there which look at what are the the I'm the main factor.

280
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:04,289
Yeah. So oftentimes they'll talk about what are like the risk factors driving disability.

281
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:12,538
So actually next week we have a librarian coming in and we'll be talking about this Global Burden of Disease report,

282
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:21,179
which I brought up briefly on Monday. But one of the things you'll have you get access to is the Global Burden of Disease website.

283
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:25,349
And part of that website is looking at different countries. What are the different?

284
00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:31,679
I mean, you could think about what are the different disabilities there, but they also look at what are the sources of those disabilities,

285
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,849
including like use of tobacco products, use of alcohol, like environmental exposures, things like that.

286
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:41,029
So that website is out there. Okay.

287
00:32:41,329 --> 00:32:45,198
But yeah, in general, we see that in high income countries in the United States and Europe,

288
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:49,759
we have higher life expectancy than middle income countries like China, Brazil and Iran.

289
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:55,819
And we have and those have higher life expectancy than low income countries like Ethiopia, Nigeria.

290
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:58,349
Okay.

291
00:32:58,349 --> 00:33:07,079
So I'm going to skip this, but this is basically just another website which was projecting out, you know, what is life expectancy going to be like in.

292
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:18,259
In in ten years. And I think they were modeling that there was going to be these substantial gains in places in Eastern Europe and in Europe,

293
00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:22,579
whereas the United States is increasingly going to fall behind other countries.

294
00:33:24,589 --> 00:33:28,039
Okay. So I would love for you to do a breakout.

295
00:33:29,329 --> 00:33:33,379
So this is something that you can do with people around you, or you could do it by yourself.

296
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:38,899
I have two websites here and I'm hoping that these QR codes were let me know if they do not.

297
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:45,409
But basically, this is a list of all of the U.S. states by life expectancy.

298
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:49,719
And then this is a list of all countries by life expectancy.

299
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:52,669
So I would like you to choose three different states.

300
00:33:53,549 --> 00:34:00,499
You can choose whatever you want, but it kind of like a mixture of a state which has high life expectancy, low life expectancy.

301
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:05,539
I believe this is a CDC website and you can order the table by like high to low.

302
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:11,659
So kind of pick out a few different states to see how long people live in those

303
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:15,259
states and then see like what is the country which is most comparable to that state?

304
00:34:18,459 --> 00:34:22,289
All right. I'll give you a couple of moments to look that.

305
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:31,508
Yeah. After.

306
00:34:42,443 --> 00:34:49,583
So I think looking at these, I am I'm always a bit humbled.

307
00:34:51,973 --> 00:34:57,733
And one of the things is there's sort of this idea of like United States exceptionalism and,

308
00:34:57,733 --> 00:35:01,153
you know, like we have a great economy for some people, things are going really well.

309
00:35:01,663 --> 00:35:08,053
But if we look on a like on the whole on what life expectancy is like in the United States.

310
00:35:08,683 --> 00:35:17,082
And we delve down into like a specific state. We we we see like some first off, there's substantial differences across the United States.

311
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:23,443
So I think places like West Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi have some of the lowest life expectancy.

312
00:35:23,443 --> 00:35:29,253
I think Hawaii, Minnesota are higher up there.

313
00:35:29,263 --> 00:35:33,313
Michigan is sort of middle, maybe like bottom half.

314
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:38,113
But if you look at like what the comparisons are, you know,

315
00:35:38,113 --> 00:35:43,963
like Washington State and Thailand having very similar life expectancies, to me, that's very shocking.

316
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:50,833
Um, places like Florida and Panama or Michigan being comparable to Argentina or Hungary.

317
00:35:51,643 --> 00:35:54,823
This is just another reason why I think.

318
00:35:56,093 --> 00:36:02,542
It's important to have like this global health paradigm because in the international health perspective, we would just be thinking, Oh, like, what?

319
00:36:02,543 --> 00:36:07,403
What are we doing here in the United States? And let's push it to what to to other countries?

320
00:36:07,403 --> 00:36:13,213
But we see all these examples where maybe we're not doing the greatest enough

321
00:36:13,223 --> 00:36:17,603
research for other countries which have lower levels of economic development.

322
00:36:17,603 --> 00:36:23,153
They're seemingly punching above their weight in terms of life expectancy and health care outcomes.

323
00:36:25,063 --> 00:36:32,323
Okay. So some other terms which are important to keep in mind, morbidity is the presence of illness or disease.

324
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:36,103
So, uh, that is, is morbidity.

325
00:36:36,103 --> 00:36:41,953
Mortality is death. So morbidity refers to a wide range of things like you could think of morbidity from,

326
00:36:42,223 --> 00:36:44,953
from the common cold, you could think of morbidity from COVID 19.

327
00:36:45,283 --> 00:36:51,283
Um, but that just refers to like any type of illness or is mortality or fatalities refers to deaths.

328
00:36:53,473 --> 00:36:59,503
I talked about this before. In terms of morbidity, we can break that into incidence and prevalence, whereas incidence is.

329
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:05,263
The new cases of disease within a certain time period in prevalence is the total existing cases.

330
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,153
And here's just an example of that.

331
00:37:07,903 --> 00:37:15,222
We could do a survey and let's say we did at the end of the year and in this village of 100 people, 20 of them had HIV.

332
00:37:15,223 --> 00:37:29,263
So the prevalence then of HIV is 20%. If next year we did another survey, we could maybe find that eight additional people were infected with HIV.

333
00:37:30,513 --> 00:37:36,673
So this means the prevalence is 28% because that's the people 20% already had it.

334
00:37:36,693 --> 00:37:40,413
8% now have it from the past year.

335
00:37:40,713 --> 00:37:46,793
But the incidence is the number of people who got in the past year over everyone who is susceptible that year.

336
00:37:46,803 --> 00:37:50,403
So it's not eight over 100. It's actually eight over 80.

337
00:37:51,773 --> 00:37:56,873
Does that make sense? Okay.

338
00:37:57,413 --> 00:38:03,983
So let's think we have this information, see that we're gathering information about life expectancy, about morbidity, about mortality.

339
00:38:04,463 --> 00:38:11,043
Um, what do we do with that? Like, how do we decide to construct goals in health care?

340
00:38:11,063 --> 00:38:14,633
We could think about that within the United States. We could think about that globally. What do we do?

341
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:21,653
So prioritization just has to do with like what are the priorities that different groups, different stakeholders have.

342
00:38:23,273 --> 00:38:31,073
And I think prioritization refers not just to coming up with the goals, but coming up with like tangible steps to create solutions.

343
00:38:33,213 --> 00:38:38,372
This is something that we are not going to be talking about too much in this class, but we will later on this semester.

344
00:38:38,373 --> 00:38:39,693
So again, just priming you a bit.

345
00:38:40,113 --> 00:38:49,893
But one thing to keep in mind when we are prioritizing what goals we should be focusing on is that there is always the question of expense.

346
00:38:50,193 --> 00:38:56,373
So we should in general, anybody is more inclined to take an action if it is cheaper.

347
00:38:57,063 --> 00:39:02,702
So later on in the semester we're going to go over this ICER the incremental cost effectiveness ratio,

348
00:39:02,703 --> 00:39:11,103
which is a formal way of quantifying how expensive a new intervention is compared to an old or an existing intervention.

349
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:18,233
But for now, let's just talk about some other other ways we could do prioritization.

350
00:39:18,713 --> 00:39:26,213
So one of these is called pieces, and that's an acronym referring to Population Action, Cooperation, Equity and security.

351
00:39:26,663 --> 00:39:33,953
So the population part of this is thinking about who is coming down with the illness, what populations have the greatest need.

352
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:38,303
The action has to do with resource allocation.

353
00:39:38,693 --> 00:39:42,593
So what are the best interventions like? Is there an action that is available?

354
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:47,683
Like maybe there is this disease which is sweeping the country.

355
00:39:47,693 --> 00:39:51,443
Maybe it's a horrible disease, but if there's nothing we can do against it, there's no action.

356
00:39:51,443 --> 00:39:57,263
It's not a priority then. Cooperation has to do with like who are the different stakeholders?

357
00:39:58,433 --> 00:40:01,283
Who is the one who can really take action?

358
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:13,532
An equity lens is looking at what our who are the vulnerable groups, including children and other marginalized populations.

359
00:40:13,533 --> 00:40:16,653
And we can also think about like a historical perspective of justice.

360
00:40:16,953 --> 00:40:20,283
And who has been most affected in the past by this condition.

361
00:40:20,523 --> 00:40:23,913
Has that persisted to the present day through health disparities?

362
00:40:24,963 --> 00:40:28,952
Security is that we could think of like biosecurity. Governments love this.

363
00:40:28,953 --> 00:40:34,233
You know, anybody from conservatives to liberals will be jumping on security.

364
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:39,333
So what are the greatest threats to peace we could think of? Like national security we could think of?

365
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:42,423
Is this does this have implications for the functioning of our government?

366
00:40:44,253 --> 00:40:48,153
So this is how we think about priorities. So like all of these issues together.

367
00:40:49,973 --> 00:40:59,632
So there have been a number of of thinktanks and nonprofit groups which have come together to think about what are the best buys.

368
00:40:59,633 --> 00:41:09,293
So there is this Disease Control Priorities project. And basically they came up with ten, ten things which should be the priority of any country.

369
00:41:10,613 --> 00:41:14,423
Or ten. These are the best facts. These are these are the things that that country should be investing in.

370
00:41:15,203 --> 00:41:19,433
So there's vaccination. And so a wide range of pediatric vaccinations.

371
00:41:20,153 --> 00:41:25,793
Treatment of pneumonia. Diarrhea, especially among young kids. These are, you know, big killers of kids.

372
00:41:26,063 --> 00:41:34,163
So if there are cheap things that we can do to prevent or treat pneumonia or diarrhea, um, control the tobacco products.

373
00:41:34,523 --> 00:41:38,452
This could be through, um, you know, age based laws.

374
00:41:38,453 --> 00:41:42,353
It could be through taxes. There's comprehensive control of HIV, aids.

375
00:41:42,353 --> 00:41:45,743
This could be through promotion of condom use and other safe sex practices.

376
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:54,713
Um, provision of antiretrovirals, including pre-exposure or, um, post-exposure prophylaxis.

377
00:41:55,163 --> 00:42:00,173
We could think of nutrition supplementation for mothers and children within a malaria endemic areas.

378
00:42:00,173 --> 00:42:05,363
Distribution of insecticide treated bed nets is good traffic regulation.

379
00:42:05,363 --> 00:42:10,943
So making the streets safer for individuals treatment of tuberculosis is one.

380
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:18,353
Um. Keeping newborns warm and clean is one. And use the medication to prevent heart disease.

381
00:42:18,563 --> 00:42:24,353
Uh, this could be anything from aspirin, although there's some controversy of whether that actually is working.

382
00:42:24,353 --> 00:42:28,073
Statins, other things like that. Um. Okay.

383
00:42:28,993 --> 00:42:37,453
So these are the essential public health services. We already talked about these before, but what I would like you to do in groups.

384
00:42:39,603 --> 00:42:43,742
I will give each of you, uh. Best Buy.

385
00:42:43,743 --> 00:42:50,793
So, um, maybe in the way back, like the back half of this row is one the front half of this ta.

386
00:42:51,123 --> 00:42:56,583
And then here I'm going to split you into like the back half over there would be three.

387
00:42:57,273 --> 00:43:04,382
The back half over there is four up here five and then the back half over there, six up here.

388
00:43:04,383 --> 00:43:08,143
Seven. So those are just like general things.

389
00:43:08,143 --> 00:43:12,792
But feel free to group yourself how you want and you don't need to meet us like a big group.

390
00:43:12,793 --> 00:43:16,303
But like with the people around you and with the number that I signed,

391
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:23,413
you think about how does this Best Buy relate to essential public health services and pieces?

392
00:43:23,773 --> 00:43:29,683
So, you know, for one of them, for instance, we're not I didn't assign use to medication to prevent heart disease.

393
00:43:30,073 --> 00:43:34,873
How I would think about that I'd be thinking about like populations. I think this is generally older adults.

394
00:43:35,653 --> 00:43:45,013
I'd be thinking about potentially equity if like health disease was or heart disease was a bigger problem in certain populations.

395
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:46,903
And I'd be thinking about, you know,

396
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:54,103
what of the essential public health services are related to treatment of or prophylactic treatment of cardiovascular disease?

397
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:58,063
And there's a number of these which potentially could could work with them.

398
00:43:58,273 --> 00:44:02,502
So, again, I'm just wanting you to spend 5 minutes talking about this.

399
00:44:02,503 --> 00:44:07,873
Uh, does that make sense? Okay, we'll reconvene at five.

400
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:22,293
30. I.

401
00:44:37,313 --> 00:44:46,053
I think that's obviously something.

402
00:44:52,043 --> 00:45:07,273
Yeah. Yeah.

403
00:45:09,183 --> 00:45:23,943
Yeah. I think.

404
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:57,913
They? Yes.

405
00:46:08,653 --> 00:46:14,113
Also this is.

406
00:47:30,623 --> 00:47:47,913
Obviously. And with all.

407
00:47:58,183 --> 00:48:15,923
Is. There.

408
00:48:32,613 --> 00:48:37,443
Yeah. Yeah.

409
00:48:44,273 --> 00:48:52,603
Okay. So I'm just going to ask and I'm going to stare at each corner of the class.

410
00:48:53,803 --> 00:48:58,573
And I am just going to ask, you know, you did a bunch of different things,

411
00:48:58,573 --> 00:49:03,943
but I just want you to point out one of the essential public health services, which relates to your best buy.

412
00:49:03,943 --> 00:49:08,353
So in the back vaccination, did you what essential public health said?

413
00:49:08,473 --> 00:49:13,363
You know there could be many but just maybe explain in depth one of the are not in depth but

414
00:49:13,363 --> 00:49:17,263
just what is one essential public health service that you think relates to vaccination.

415
00:49:21,843 --> 00:49:28,173
Yeah. Anybody for vaccination.

416
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:39,513
So. And I couldn't pick on anybody.

417
00:49:39,513 --> 00:49:42,513
But like for me the vaccination you.

418
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:47,193
One thing we can think about is mobilizing community partnerships. One thing we've realized, for instance,

419
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:56,012
with vaccination is that it is hard to just like just forcing people to get vaccination and just telling people that vaccination is the right thing.

420
00:49:56,013 --> 00:50:00,093
People don't necessarily think logically about that, but working through community partners,

421
00:50:00,393 --> 00:50:07,353
we can identify the best ways to roll out new vaccines, get treatment of pneumonia and diarrhea.

422
00:50:07,413 --> 00:50:10,713
How does that relate to the subsequent clusters? Yeah.

423
00:50:24,183 --> 00:50:32,133
Yeah. So you're just saying that there could be various policies in place or programs for how to treat pneumonia or diarrhea, things like that.

424
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:37,563
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.

425
00:50:37,563 --> 00:50:41,103
Definitely. I'll get control of tobacco products in the back.

426
00:50:41,133 --> 00:50:45,873
Any thoughts on that? Yeah.

427
00:50:46,933 --> 00:50:55,293
We're partnering. I.

428
00:51:07,793 --> 00:51:11,263
Yeah. So you brought up a couple of ones, you know, like informing people, that'd be one.

429
00:51:11,273 --> 00:51:15,113
Like you could do that through schools. You can mobilize community partnerships that could be like different school

430
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:19,222
based settings and laws and regulations that could be related to tobacco taxes.

431
00:51:19,223 --> 00:51:23,573
So great, great option options there.

432
00:51:24,113 --> 00:51:28,283
What about HIV AIDS? Comprehensive HIV AIDS control? Any thoughts on that?

433
00:51:36,653 --> 00:51:40,883
See there have been some which haven't been picked out, but certainly like surveillance.

434
00:51:41,663 --> 00:51:46,763
I think HIV AIDS is considered a notifiable infectious disease in the United States.

435
00:51:46,763 --> 00:51:53,213
So if there is a case each day which is diagnosed, it will be reported to a health department.

436
00:51:55,473 --> 00:51:58,743
Nutrition supplementation. Yeah.

437
00:51:59,913 --> 00:52:04,622
I think the two things like the Fed surveillance is a big part of monitoring and identifying

438
00:52:04,623 --> 00:52:09,782
issues to make sure that one is receiving necessary supplementation for nutrients.

439
00:52:09,783 --> 00:52:17,493
And then the seventh one where like health services become available when necessary and like linking people,

440
00:52:17,503 --> 00:52:19,103
I guess I think equity is a big part of it,

441
00:52:19,153 --> 00:52:25,203
just linking people to the necessary health services and informing them about how they can receive these supplementation.

442
00:52:25,863 --> 00:52:28,412
Yeah. And I mean, I think that's a big part, at least here in the United States.

443
00:52:28,413 --> 00:52:33,872
And and I think many countries actually do this much better than than us is part of an institutional birth

444
00:52:33,873 --> 00:52:42,693
is not just making sure that infant is is born in a clean and hygienic setting with trained birth attendant.

445
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:50,012
But it is, um, making sure that breastfeeding is working, is making sure that the kid is thriving.

446
00:52:50,013 --> 00:52:56,193
All of those things are really important prior to releasing the kid and the parent from the hospital.

447
00:52:58,003 --> 00:53:02,353
Okay. Distribution of insecticide treated bed nets.

448
00:53:02,593 --> 00:53:07,783
Any thoughts on that from the audience? Yeah.

449
00:53:09,703 --> 00:53:13,403
Well, I kind of thought it would be like maybe also.

450
00:53:21,553 --> 00:53:32,993
We? For malaria. Yeah.

451
00:53:32,993 --> 00:53:36,382
And I think you raise a good point, like what is health care? What is the provision of health care?

452
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:41,872
Because sometimes within a community, it might be something which doesn't doesn't really seem to be health care.

453
00:53:41,873 --> 00:53:45,473
But, you know, if something like an insecticide treated bed net,

454
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:50,843
that is a great way prevent poor for preventing the spread of vector borne diseases like malaria.

455
00:53:52,163 --> 00:53:58,613
And so the provision of of these bed nets within a community could be very highly efficient,

456
00:53:58,613 --> 00:54:05,903
more so than what we think of as a traditional medical approach, like the provision of antimalarials or things like that.

457
00:54:06,653 --> 00:54:12,743
Okay. And then finally, traffic regulations. Um, any linkage to essential public health services?

458
00:54:13,463 --> 00:54:17,843
Yeah. Um, we were talking about how it is a number of things.

459
00:54:17,843 --> 00:54:21,913
So enforcing laws and regulations is the right track.

460
00:54:22,373 --> 00:54:26,273
It is there to protect the health and ensure safety.

461
00:54:26,273 --> 00:54:37,253
And then you're also talking about some cases like what would qualify as a Best Buy and um brought up because the collaboration aspect.

462
00:54:39,753 --> 00:54:44,663
Um. And that's something that. I guess like the preventive aspect is.

463
00:54:45,493 --> 00:54:49,823
I think a lot of people. Like being a visitor.

464
00:54:50,593 --> 00:54:56,052
Yeah, exactly. So like, who are the people who could play a role in doing something?

465
00:54:56,053 --> 00:55:01,542
And I will say that I realize that not all of you are going to or I don't think

466
00:55:01,543 --> 00:55:04,963
all of you will go into a career which is specifically public health focus,

467
00:55:04,963 --> 00:55:06,493
although if that just happens, that's great.

468
00:55:07,273 --> 00:55:12,013
But you know, if there are some of you who go into urban planning, you know, it'd be great to keep that in mind.

469
00:55:12,073 --> 00:55:15,253
Like, what are the public health implications for things you do?

470
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:19,483
Um, and I think traffic is an example like here in the United States.

471
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:27,643
Injuries from traffic are some of the leading causes of disability and deaths among young adults.

472
00:55:28,003 --> 00:55:32,113
So this could have a huge impact on population health.

473
00:55:33,103 --> 00:55:37,812
So whatever you do, maybe you don't think of yourself as being a public health practitioner in the future.

474
00:55:37,813 --> 00:55:42,583
But I think much of what people do actually fits within this essential public health services paradigm.

475
00:55:45,463 --> 00:55:56,263
Okay. Um. I guess like it beyond these these specific prior to these Asian strategies, they want to further emphasize equity and security.

476
00:55:56,533 --> 00:56:07,033
I guess those are part of pieces, but equity really is looking at projects which can address injustices in the past to reduce health disparities.

477
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:11,142
So, you know, we could have a goal overall of increasing health.

478
00:56:11,143 --> 00:56:14,593
We could have a goal of increasing life expectancy here in the United States.

479
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:20,562
But what if, after ten years, we find that life expectancy on average has increased,

480
00:56:20,563 --> 00:56:25,813
but it actually has decreased in certain groups, like maybe it's just increased a lot among white Americans,

481
00:56:25,813 --> 00:56:34,183
but it has decreased or stagnated among maybe black Americans or Hispanic Americans that maybe if our goal is to increase life expectancy,

482
00:56:34,183 --> 00:56:39,013
seemingly we did that. But if we had an equity perspective, we'd think that maybe there is some problem with this project.

483
00:56:41,963 --> 00:56:47,663
Okay. So briefly, I want to talk about the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals.

484
00:56:48,023 --> 00:56:55,762
The Millennium Development Goals were developed in the nineties and basically there were eight goals that the U.N. put together.

485
00:56:55,763 --> 00:57:05,722
And they put the goals were to eradicate hunger, achieve universal primary education, promote gender equality, reduce child mortality,

486
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:14,063
improve maternal health, combat certain infectious diseases, ensure environmental sterility, and improve global partnerships for development.

487
00:57:14,573 --> 00:57:18,863
So these were just learned of lofty goals, but under each of these goals, there were specific targets.

488
00:57:19,223 --> 00:57:25,373
And, you know, a bunch of research was done to look at like how much it had these goals been achieved.

489
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:31,673
And a lot of policymakers or certainly a lot of thinkers at the United Nations,

490
00:57:31,673 --> 00:57:41,753
but even policymakers within low and middle income countries were thinking about how they can develop policies and programs to towards these ends.

491
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:46,782
Okay. So the Millennium Development Goals had eight goals.

492
00:57:46,783 --> 00:57:50,833
And under those goals there were there were different targets and different indicators.

493
00:57:51,673 --> 00:58:01,933
The Sustainable Development Goals are the new goals which have existed from 2015, and the end point for the Sustainable Development Goals are 2030.

494
00:58:02,803 --> 00:58:06,403
And we have increased the number of goals. We have increased the number of targets.

495
00:58:06,703 --> 00:58:09,793
There are many different indicators, so there's just a lot going on.

496
00:58:10,783 --> 00:58:19,033
I would say with Sustainable Development Goals there is this is sort of a link of the 17 different ones.

497
00:58:20,273 --> 00:58:25,753
There's a bit more of a focus on the environment and sustainability, I would say.

498
00:58:28,633 --> 00:58:32,263
But uh, and the other thing is like the Millennium Development Goals,

499
00:58:32,263 --> 00:58:39,183
where we're kind of falling under that international health approach of like we hear in high income countries, we're doing fine.

500
00:58:39,193 --> 00:58:42,733
Like how can we improve the life of people in low income countries?

501
00:58:43,123 --> 00:58:46,663
But for Sustainable Development Goals, it's kind of like, how can we improve throughout the world?

502
00:58:48,273 --> 00:58:59,023
Um, I will say like with Sustainable Development Goals, there isn't necessarily like one goal related to disease, like with,

503
00:58:59,023 --> 00:59:04,323
with the Millennium Development Goals or sort of like one with child maternal health and um,

504
00:59:05,053 --> 00:59:08,893
and one with like these big infectious diseases like malaria and HIV aids.

505
00:59:09,253 --> 00:59:15,593
Um, instead, for the Sustainable Development Goals, there are targets related to health.

506
00:59:15,613 --> 00:59:21,133
So like the overall goals might not be super health related, but like the targets underneath the goals are.

507
00:59:21,733 --> 00:59:25,983
So for instance. Goal two is zero hunger.

508
00:59:26,163 --> 00:59:31,503
But there's certainly that has health implications. There is like this target related to child nutrition.

509
00:59:33,113 --> 00:59:42,003
For six, it's clean water and sanitation. But there is a target related to the provision of drinking water and improved sanitation measures.

510
00:59:42,573 --> 00:59:47,733
So things like that are. Are are imbued within the Sustainable Development Goals.

511
00:59:49,633 --> 00:59:57,462
One thing I would like to say is that a lot of these goals neglect the neglect of these neglected tropical diseases.

512
00:59:57,463 --> 01:00:04,093
So there is a certain number of parasites or protozoa.

513
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:12,583
There's viruses, bacteria and helminths or worms which are highly prevalent throughout the world,

514
01:00:12,583 --> 01:00:18,553
and especially in many low and middle income countries. And they just haven't received a lot of notice.

515
01:00:18,793 --> 01:00:24,493
And part of the reason is because, you know, there might not be like a huge number of people who die of these.

516
01:00:24,823 --> 01:00:29,983
But oftentimes, people could be chronically infected or they could be like reinfected throughout their lives.

517
01:00:30,523 --> 01:00:37,933
And as a result, this this could have a huge impact on on the burden of disease within an area on the dailies.

518
01:00:38,413 --> 01:00:47,113
But they just really aren't a focus of a lot of disease prioritization efforts, including the millennium or the Sustainable Development Goals.

519
01:00:47,113 --> 01:00:51,852
But I wanted to mention them to you here, because in this class we don't have a lot of time to talk about them,

520
01:00:51,853 --> 01:00:58,843
but I do think that they are important to think about. The other thing is Peter Hotez, who is a physician,

521
01:01:00,463 --> 01:01:06,883
has written a lot about these neglected tropical diseases and he likes this term blue marble health,

522
01:01:06,883 --> 01:01:09,643
which I guess is sort of a poetic interpretation of global health.

523
01:01:10,123 --> 01:01:15,523
And one of the things that he was mentioning in his book is that neglected tropical diseases are, of course,

524
01:01:16,513 --> 01:01:25,423
a huge burden in places like in certain countries in sub-Saharan Africa, in places like Ethiopia and Somalia and India.

525
01:01:26,113 --> 01:01:30,123
But they're also huge here in the United States, in particular in the Southeast.

526
01:01:30,133 --> 01:01:37,873
So places like Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi can have a really high prevalence of certain, you know, worm diseases.

527
01:01:39,193 --> 01:01:44,202
So when we think of neglected tropical diseases, again, this tropical is like a bit of a misnomer.

528
01:01:44,203 --> 01:01:51,523
And oftentimes we just like apply it to things which are different than here in our in our beautiful temperate climate or however we want to say that.

529
01:01:51,523 --> 01:01:57,943
But that's all to say, like neglected tropical diseases are an important thing throughout the world,

530
01:01:57,943 --> 01:02:01,333
even if they're not really reflected in the in these goals.

531
01:02:04,623 --> 01:02:13,143
The last thing I want to talk about is migration. So there is a target about migration in the Sustainable Development Goals.

532
01:02:13,173 --> 01:02:20,523
Basically, they say, facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration, reduce transaction costs of remittances.

533
01:02:22,303 --> 01:02:29,263
But it's sort of a controversy of what do you do with migrants in the Sustainable Development Goals?

534
01:02:29,273 --> 01:02:33,642
So like, if there is a country which is collecting all these statistics on who has disease,

535
01:02:33,643 --> 01:02:40,663
who's dying, who's being born, what do you do with migrants in your population?

536
01:02:41,353 --> 01:02:42,762
And you can think of migrants as a whole,

537
01:02:42,763 --> 01:02:48,822
but especially you could think about undocumented migrants because they may or may not have worse health outcomes.

538
01:02:48,823 --> 01:02:51,763
And we'll talk to you. Actually, in some situations, they may have better health outcomes, but.

539
01:02:53,743 --> 01:03:03,283
This is all to say that like some of the sustainable development goals are kind of ambiguous in relation to migrants and in relation to migration.

540
01:03:04,723 --> 01:03:08,263
And there have been some thinkers who are.

541
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:17,302
Who who who argued that migrants are sort of left behind and sometimes that they have poor health outcomes.

542
01:03:17,303 --> 01:03:22,913
It's just not clear how they are being dealt with in terms of the targets, in terms of the indicators.

543
01:03:25,463 --> 01:03:33,603
And there could be some things that we do in our economy like, you know, increase funding a militarization, increase conflict.

544
01:03:33,623 --> 01:03:37,973
Those things could, you know, be exacerbating problems in migration.

545
01:03:38,063 --> 01:03:42,563
They could be indirectly affecting the sustainable development goals.

546
01:03:42,563 --> 01:03:46,073
And they're just really isn't a clear perspective of that within the sustainable.

547
01:03:48,893 --> 01:03:52,493
Okay. That is what I have for you today. I'll stay up here in case you have any other questions.

548
01:03:52,493 --> 01:03:55,913
Otherwise, we look forward to seeing you in discussion this week.

549
01:03:56,273 --> 01:03:59,962
And there's no class on Monday because that's MLK Day.

01:03:59,963 --> 01:04:03,773
I hope you take part in some of the university sponsored events.

551
01:04:04,103 --> 01:04:10,282
And then on Wednesday we are on Zoom. We have a librarian who's going to be sharing some electronic resources.

552
01:04:10,283 --> 01:04:13,733
And it's just easier to do that until we have.
