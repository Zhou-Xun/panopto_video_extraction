1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:06,210
That's not mine. I was like, and I'm leaving now. Oh, that's not good.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:24,330
All right. Okay.

3
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:31,080
So when it comes time for Zoe's turn, she's going to tell you guys, someone is going to advance this list for her,

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,430
and she'll just say next time, so who's going to be the fighter dancer? Great.

5
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:46,740
And you guys can start whenever. Okay.

6
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:58,600
Yeah, whatever it is. Is it? You know? Okay, well, let's give them a minute to be having trouble making it all the way across campus.

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:05,580
No big deal. He's also not talking. Well, wait just a minute.

8
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,320
It's okay. No, no. Nobody forgets.

9
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,530
Okay. I'll tell you the story of the worst thing that happened last year. I want to hear.

10
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,910
It was time for presentations. And somebody was on there.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,190
Like the group was on the phone and the person wasn't there. And I hope I'm not, like, cursing anybody by telling this story now.

12
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,880
But so this person, it might have been for my graduate level class, it doesn't matter.

13
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,810
It was supposed to give a presentation and suddenly there's like a flurry and someone's on the phone and there's, like, a big freak out there.

14
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,530
Like, she got a car accident here, and, like, they hand me the phone, and this poor student is, like,

15
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:47,519
crying on this phone because she had parked on the street out there on an observatory and opened her car door to get out and somebody,

16
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,480
like took the car door off. And I was like, Oh, no, you're fine.

17
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:00,419
Never worry about it. Like, we will switch the order. You can go, your group go last if you make it, it's fine.

18
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,020
If you don't, we'll work it out somehow. Doesn't matter.

19
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,139
Like your group muddle through and we'll figure it out. Like, this is just one of those, like, lightning strikes kind of things.

20
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,320
Like, this is not what you need to be worrying about. Like, stay there for the cops.

21
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,450
So, like, I called my dad and I called, like, I'm like, do not worry about us.

22
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,360
Like, if you show up, you show up, and if you don't, we'll figure it out. And no one's going to get a bad grade over it.

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,320
Just stay there and deal with your car. But, like, wow, I was like, I don't know.

24
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,860
I don't know what I'm supposed to say about this.

25
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,880
She in a presenting. She did. She made it. Wow.

26
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,660
I know that she's like mentally well, like, I don't know about that, but she did fine.

27
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,100
I don't know if she was mentally well, but she presented on her cancer adequately and I believe the group out of that.

28
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:50,250
So like whatever she she pushed through and then my other like horror story about presenting

29
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,820
as I have a I had a girl in my a woman in my program of she was doing her defense.

30
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,309
So it was like a huge, big deal. Right. And it has to be public.

31
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:06,210
And you have to have people who are like you have to have non committee members there to make it a public dissertation.

32
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,729
So she was supposed to be giving her dissertation and it was pre cloud, so she had it on a thumb drive.

33
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,670
She put in the computer and brought up her slides and then the fire alarm went off

34
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,809
and everybody went outside and it turns out it was actually like a chemical spill,

35
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,150
one of the labs. And so no one was allowed back in the building.

36
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,780
And the worst part about scheduling a dissertation is getting all of your committee members in the room at the same time when they're not.

37
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:33,900
Nobody's traveling and nobody has teaching or another meeting or something like a three hour block for the exam.

38
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,700
And the thing is like impossible. It's like the logic puzzle of the universe is getting everybody to be there.

39
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,930
So but she left her thumb drive in the computer.

40
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:51,970
And so there was no access to her slides. But Elizabeth, my advisor, her advisor, found another room in the hospital, a different building.

41
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,380
She managed to call all the committee members because they were like all outside.

42
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,680
So she managed to find them all, like calling them on their cell phones, get them all to go over to the hospital.

43
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,299
And she rounded up some other students like you're coming to listen to this because it's a public institution.

44
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,840
Get in the room. And she's like, just do it without slides. It's fine.

45
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:15,459
And so she gave it was short because she didn't. But it was basically like Elizabeth always has the best dissertation defense she's

46
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:24,310
ever been to because it was just telling what was going on right in her own words.

47
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:34,390
Yeah. Yeah. This is what we found. What I did with the last four years of my life, let me tell you about it, was that she just thought it was so okay.

48
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,000
Give it a go. All right. So, yeah, we're going to start.

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,250
So we're going be presenting on pancreatic cancer today. My name is Josh Ryan.

50
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,950
Family. If.

51
00:07:17,590 --> 00:09:33,020
And. So next, we're going to be getting into some statistics about pancreatic cancer.

52
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,840
So on the left, right here, that here. Yeah.

53
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:44,929
Let's turn out the specs. On the left, there's the incidence map.

54
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,960
And then on the right is the mortality map.

55
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,390
And these are these are pulled from global can.

56
00:09:51,650 --> 00:10:00,890
So what we can see here is in 2019, there are almost about 460,000 new cases and there are actually about 430,000 deaths in 2019,

57
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,120
which I think is really interesting to point out how those numbers are very similar.

58
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:12,740
And I think that goes to show the mortality of pancreatic cancer and how it is a very deadly cancer.

59
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,760
This accounts for only 2.5% of cancers globally.

60
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:24,020
So that's kind of like the global prevalence. I think something really interesting to note here is that about over half of

61
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,580
cases are coming from developed countries as opposed to undeveloped countries.

62
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,469
And some reasons for that could be, which I'm going to talk about a little bit.

63
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,610
Some of the risk factors include like smoking and some behavioral factors.

64
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,290
So those factors might be happening more and developed regions like in the United States or Europe,

65
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:46,129
as opposed to Africa, which has a much lighter rate,

66
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,390
are much lighter shading and a lower prevalence or lower incidence and lower mortality

67
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,790
in the highest rates are coming from Europe and the lowest are from Africa.

68
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:01,100
Another reason for this could be that pancreatic cancer happens when you're a lot older in life.

69
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:08,750
So like after age 70, your likelihood of being diagnosed increases by about six times.

70
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:14,360
So if your life expectancy isn't until like 70 and you're all new people are only late or 50,

71
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,240
it kind of makes sense that you might not be getting diagnosed.

72
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,560
And also just diagnostic tools as well might not be available in less developed regions.

73
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:30,740
So these are the stats in the United States. So as you can see, incidence and mortality are on the rise.

74
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:38,610
So in 2022, it's pretty clear that there will be about 62,210 new cases and to that has a rate

75
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:46,800
of about 13.3 per 100,000 per 100,000 people and about 49,830 deaths in 2019.

76
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,160
And so that number, those numbers are a little different.

77
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,709
But when you look at the rate, it turns out to be about 11, 11.1 per 100,000 people.

78
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:04,740
So again, like this rate between incidence and mortality is very similar, which again shows kind of the mortality rate of pancreatic cancer.

79
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:10,169
And then in 2019, there were over 89,000 people living with pancreatic cancer.

80
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:14,850
So that is the prevalence in the United States. Next,

81
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,360
where we get into some risk factors and these are divided into modifiable and

82
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,160
non modifiable risk factors increase your likelihood of getting the cancer,

83
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,300
but it doesn't mean that if you have this risk factor that you're hundred percent going to get these cancers.

84
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:33,630
Was the way you talked about before those mechanisms that cause carcinogenesis these all can fuel to that as well.

85
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,150
So modifiable risk factors could be smoking. So it's shown about 25%.

86
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,730
Pancreatic cancer cases can be directly caused by smoking, excessive alcohol use.

87
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,970
This isn't just like one drink a day or one drink a week.

88
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,169
This is about three drinks per day. So it is excessive alcohol use and then diet.

89
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,330
There's a couple conflicting studies going on with that. Some say that red meat,

90
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:05,100
a red a higher diet containing a diet containing a higher red meat consumption can lead to an increased risk of getting pancreatic cancer.

91
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,440
But there are some studies that have found that that is not true. So there is some conflicting evidence there.

92
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,179
I just want to point that out. Non modifiable risk factors. These are things that you really can't change.

93
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:24,239
They're kind of what you're born with, so age. So your risk, as I said before, increases about six times between once you hit the age of 70.

94
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:33,450
So between the ages of 70 and 75, your risk is six times greater than what it would be between 50 and 55 gender.

95
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,260
So males are more likely to get pancreatic cancer than females.

96
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:47,010
Race in America, black Americans are twice as likely to get pancreatic cancer and have rates twice as high as white Americans.

97
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,930
Also, previous infection, specifically age pylori, could lead to this.

98
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:59,160
There's also a genetic risk in the BRCA2 gene, and that accounts for about 10% of all pancreatic cancer cases.

99
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:06,090
And then I put obesity in italics because some people say it's not modifiable.

100
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:10,080
Some people would say it's modifiable about obesity, has some genetic links towards it.

101
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:17,850
There are things we can do to obese or to decrease obesity, like emphasizing healthy diet and exercise.

102
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:25,710
But there are genetic factors that cause obesity as well. So it's important that we don't just automatically make that a modifiable risk factor.

103
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:35,640
And also previous chronic diseases like diabetes or a previous chronic pancreas infection could increase your risk for that.

104
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:42,600
And as public health professionals, they want to think about where we can intervene on these specifically on those modifiable risk factors,

105
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,490
because those are things that we can change.

106
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,959
But there are ways that we can intervene as public health interventions or public health professionals that

107
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:54,150
will also decrease those non modifiable risk factors when we think about the social determinants of health,

108
00:14:54,270 --> 00:21:28,050
which we're going to talk about next. So the current treatments offered for pancreatic cancer are surgery, either palliative or curative.

109
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:35,460
Radiation therapy, which uses a combination of drugs and X-rays to target the cancerous tissue.

110
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,179
Chemotherapy, which uses a combination of medications.

111
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:47,579
Drugs like Gonzales and five two chemo. Radiation is a combination of both and targeted therapy targeting specific metabolic

112
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,800
pathways like tyrosine kinase inhibitors to inhibit further cancer growth.

113
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:56,490
So the two types of surgery, like I said, are palliative and curative.

114
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:08,790
Most of the time, patients that receive diagnosis aren't able to get curative surgery because by the time that they open up and perform surgery,

115
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:14,370
the gastroenterologist might see that the cancer is too far gone and metastasize to other parts of the body.

116
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,180
For 10 to 15% of cases, they are curative surgery.

117
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,960
Most of the time they use the Whipple procedure.

118
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:29,340
Seeing in the diagram, what they do is they remove the head of the pancreas, parts of the digestive system like the bile duct,

119
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,910
the body of the pancreas, and they resection it off so that the food can pass to the digestive system.

120
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:46,510
These treatments don't come without their side effects for people that end up surviving the diagnosis and the treatment.

121
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:53,049
First of all, the changes in bowel function, for example, they don't have any more of those pancreatic enzymes,

122
00:22:53,050 --> 00:23:01,390
so they have to take enzyme supplements prescribed to them by their doctor, nurse, gastroenterologist, like David said.

123
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,520
They don't have it. They don't produce insulin.

124
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:10,370
So most of the time when they come after when they receive chemotherapy and surgery, they end up having diabetes.

125
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:16,450
So at the talk to a specialized dietitian, that will give them the proper information on nutrition.

126
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:24,620
Alter digestion, they might face bloating, pain, loss of appetite, extreme weight loss.

127
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,650
So they'll also have to consult a doctor for this.

128
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:36,890
Nerve damage, including neuropathy, comes about because the tumor will likely pinch down or press on adjacent nerves.

129
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:43,250
And using chemotherapy, removing that nerve tissue also damages nearby cells.

130
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,970
Fatigue comes about with loss of muscle tissue and weight loss.

131
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:51,350
So sometimes they'll get other types of treatment.

132
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:56,570
I've heard acupuncture saying that some of the literature, but there is not that much.

133
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,130
Research behind that.

134
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:09,890
So currently we know that the survival rate, five year survival rate is very low for people that have received the pancreatic cancer diagnosis.

135
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:19,280
And it's important to note that most of the cases our cat course are caught at late stage metastatic stages.

136
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,930
So that means that by the time they have symptoms like jaundice and weight loss and pain,

137
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:31,700
it's already at a place where tertiary prevention can lead to a lot of side effects in morbidity and mortality.

138
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:38,420
And so the NIH funded a research group called the Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium.

139
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:45,460
And this is made up of different hospitals and research facilities like M.D. Anderson of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

140
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:55,910
And what they're looking at is finding early detection, specifically at those apms, those neoplasms, pre-cancerous lesions.

141
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:05,990
And so some studies show that there is a 17 year window between the first mutation and the formation of the primary tumor.

142
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:13,730
So finding the cancer early on is important and early intervention and clinical treatment.

143
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:23,670
So what they're looking for are noninvasive biomarkers and combination imaging techniques.

144
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:31,970
Like David said. Currently imaging techniques and bloodwork are being used to find it, diagnose the cancer.

145
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:44,610
This is usually at late stage. So using a combination of those markers, molecular biomarkers and imaging, they hope to find the cancer early on.

146
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:50,460
Maybe it's pre-cancerous lesions, not at a stage where it's already metastasized.

147
00:25:52,790 --> 00:26:02,780
So what they hope to find specifically are in blood, saliva, urine, some sort of biomarker that indicates that the cancer is present.

148
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:14,450
This can be found with at exfoliating tissue tumors that filter out into the blood and other secretions,

149
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,530
whether it be proteins or enzymes that are secreted by these tumor tissues.

150
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:25,790
However, this comes at a cost because there is not much known about these apms or machines

151
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,079
and they don't really know how to distinguish between a cancerous lesion,

152
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:39,290
a benign and a cancerous lesion. So one limitation is they may find a diagnosis for ipman, but most of the time it's already cancerous.

153
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:46,700
And also removing that that cancer lesion can lead to mortality and morbidity that would

154
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:55,040
have not have been there unless they went in unless they opened the diagnosis later on.

155
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:05,820
So another really interesting area of ongoing research before I talk about significant research

156
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:13,410
findings in the 21st century is the potential for A.I. technology in detecting pancreatic cancer.

157
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:20,159
So there was a recent study that was published in the radiology journal that showed

158
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:26,760
that A.I. has demonstrated effective detection of pancreatic cancer in C.T. scans.

159
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:33,300
And this is significant because CT scans are the primary detection method for pancreatic cancer,

160
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:37,890
but misses about 40% of tumors that are under two centimeters.

161
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:44,360
And research has shown that A.I. has the potential for more accurate detection than the human eye.

162
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,060
So this could be interesting to see where this goes in the future.

163
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:56,500
Even though screening doesn't, as David talked about, doesn't do all that much in decreasing the burden of pancreatic cancer.

164
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,990
It's. Often caught too late.

165
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:05,170
This could potentially help to lessen the burden a bit.

166
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:10,030
And there's been a lot of significant research findings in the 21st century,

167
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:16,600
advancing the potential for effective treatments and identification of pancreatic cancer.

168
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:25,720
And one of the most significant findings that we looked into was the development of a mouse model of pancreatic cancer in 2002.

169
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,210
And this was significant because it was the first mouse model that was developed of pancreatic cancer.

170
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:35,080
And it's still used today to test pancreatic cancer therapies.

171
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:43,660
And it's helped to show that different subtypes of pancreatic cancer can switch between a slow growing type and a more invasive type,

172
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:49,600
and provides opportunities for investigation into factors that influence the aggressive nature of the disease.

173
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,980
So we found that really interesting.

174
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:59,919
And something else that was significant in the advancement of research of pancreatic cancer was the Pancreatic Cancer Genome Project in 2008,

175
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,970
led by researchers at Johns Hopkins.

176
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:11,230
And they looked into the linkage of genetic predisposition to cancer expression within this project.

177
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:17,650
And this was promising because it gave a lot of insight into the genetic complexity of pancreatic cancer.

178
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:23,050
And it's presented a lot of information that's become really important in developing new cancer treatments.

179
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:30,220
And something really interesting about this project was that it looked into the the gene pathways in pancreatic cancer.

180
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:36,850
So it found that a core group of regulatory gene pathways and processes are affected in pancreatic tumors.

181
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:47,800
And these pathways that are linked to cell maturation, tumor evasion and damage control were found to be mutated in 67 to 100% of the tumors studied.

182
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:54,069
So this showed researchers that there could be potential benefits in looking into

183
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:58,270
how to target the pathways in pancreatic tumors instead of just individual genes.

184
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:06,160
And so that was something really significant that came out of this project that is being used to try to devise new cancer treatments.

185
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:17,560
Then also in 2013, researchers discovered that a Phase three trial demonstrated that treatment that uses a combination

186
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:24,100
of two chemotherapy drugs can be more effective than treating metastatic pancreatic cancer,

187
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,839
like the first attempt at treating the cancer than just one drug.

188
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,900
And this has become a new standard of treatment.

189
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:36,250
So that's been important in the development of the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

190
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:46,900
And then also in 2018, the Lustgarten Foundation, which is a nonprofit that funds a lot of pancreatic cancer research.

191
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:58,930
They found that pancreatic cancer organoids, which are basically just like like tissue cultures from stem cells that can demonstrate,

192
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:09,100
that can replicate a lot of the complexity of an organ that could demonstrate like how the organ would respond to different treatments and stuff.

193
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:13,360
They found that the ORGANOIDS can predict therapeutic responses.

194
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:24,790
So this has been a really significant research finding and target and figuring out more individualized and precise treatments

195
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:32,109
for pancreatic cancer because they can quickly see how people's like specific tumors will respond to specific treatments.

196
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:37,570
So it's a more accurate, precise, like individual individualized approach that they found research.

197
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,590
So that's it for our presentation. But we want to thank you all for listening.

198
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:50,540
And then we kind of just wanted to have if anyone wants to discuss anything, I want to run up or have any questions for us.

199
00:31:51,200 --> 00:32:05,390
We'd love to address those now. Yeah, go ahead.

200
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:22,250
And they started using that. From what I read, it was still in a testing phase.

201
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:27,380
I think they're still trying to see if it can be effective.

202
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:35,990
But it's looking promising. So what you guys are thinking question questions.

203
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:37,450
I want to make one clarification.

204
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:45,870
So, David, you mentioned screening and you mentioned that there are some high risk groups like chronic pancreatitis patients,

205
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,900
people with certain familial syndromes that will get screening.

206
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:54,780
But do we do any kind of population based screening currently for take that cancer?

207
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,210
Okay. So surveillance and screening are different, right?

208
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:33,850
So we definitely do surveillance in the sense that we are counting all the cases and the deaths.

209
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:39,760
But screening like secondary prevention for screening is defined as does everyone take a stab at defining screening.

210
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:47,230
It's an asymptomatic individual. Yes. You were doing something to look for the disease in people really healthy and asymptomatic.

211
00:33:49,670 --> 00:34:02,450
That's right. Yeah.

212
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:05,680
Like we don't really have a screening program for the general population.

213
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:11,170
They're kind of throwing whatever they can at the wall for people who are really high risk, but we don't really have anything.

214
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:16,870
And that was your your area of ongoing research is that you're going to they're looking for trying to screen for the pre neoplastic lesion,

215
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:27,399
which would be ideal. Right. So then I'm going to challenge you a little bit because you said in the global you said two things.

216
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:33,969
You said that the difference could be the difference in the rates between, say,

217
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:37,810
the lowest, you know, the lower lower income countries like Africa and the U.S.

218
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,580
One of the differences could be lack of screening. Yeah. Yeah.

219
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:45,970
And that won't answer it. The other thing you said is that the age distribution is different.

220
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:50,350
Yeah. And go back to your slide real quick and look at what it says at the top.

221
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,500
Your maps. So what does that say right there in the title?

222
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:04,110
It's yesterday's incidence rate. So this age difference is an age distribution of the populations.

223
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:12,220
Explain any differences in that map? No, not in the map, but it still could be a reason why late.

224
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,470
You see more cases in developed countries, though. Correct.

225
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:18,890
But the differences that are shown here are ages already taken.

226
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,710
Good. Okay. Awesome.

227
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:29,660
That was not only like picking at eight points and the screen, I think I know I'm going over and over the screening thing that is,

228
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:36,290
I think it's because I actually like this is something I really had to be like schooled on and in my Ph.D. program even.

229
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,750
Right. So like, you guys are undergrads, but we're going to get you early.

230
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,560
But it's it's one of those like the distinction between using because the same tests are often used as a screening test and as a diagnostic test.

231
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:50,630
And being very careful in your language about which one it is is important.

232
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:56,270
Right. And and being and when there is screening in like high risk people,

233
00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:01,840
but there's no general population screening program, I think it's also important to be really clear about that too.

234
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:06,410
So I'm being picky about it, but I'm just trying to help you guys be precise.

235
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:13,940
Yeah, I was just wondering, given that it is that age standardized mortality rate, why do we really think that there is?

236
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,840
Between the high.

237
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:29,740
Like I think what was talked about a little bit from what I read and is like, I think I would think about if we took age out of the picture.

238
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:39,910
I think about your health behaviors and like the risk factors, the modifiable ones being smoking, drinking and diet.

239
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,220
I think there might be a higher red meat diet in the unit or in more developed countries.

240
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:54,309
But for sure, smoking, at least if that smoking was happening at higher rates in like the between like the forties and sixties in developed

241
00:36:54,310 --> 00:37:00,250
countries and then less in those are people who are like in their twenties or younger twenties of thirties,

242
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:05,020
and now these individuals are into their seventies. Like that makes sense why they might be.

243
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:13,860
Like they might be being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer because they were there.

244
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,260
Smoking has had time to like.

245
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:24,549
Like developing their body and their bodies feeling the effects of it now developing cancer versus in more undeveloped countries,

246
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:28,240
they have a sense of okay, they have their smoking timeline is different than ours.

247
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,229
I think like tobacco companies are still trying like now markets on developed

248
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:37,720
countries because they're starting like have it not as good luck in developed areas.

249
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,020
So I think that might be reason why.

250
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:49,930
Also, even though age is still standardized, like I still think like if you have a higher part of your populations living longer,

251
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:56,080
like you can't get in, you're not getting diagnosed with this cancer before age 70 and not a lot.

252
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,940
But when your population are, yeah, there could still be kind of a competing risk.

253
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:05,560
Yeah, that isn't completely taken up. Like I don't think you can just take age just because age here it might take out.

254
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,040
You think you can take it out, at least in large part. Okay.

255
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:15,100
But I would say that number I would also say probably like, what are the symptoms of someone with advanced pancreatic cancer?

256
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:21,330
Weight loss, jaundice. Yeah.

257
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:30,090
And they got some pain. And I mean, if you're in a really undeveloped place, you might not have the diagnostic resources to diagnose that.

258
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:34,110
So people might just be getting sick and dying at home without ever being diagnosed.

259
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:38,430
Right. So part of it is just most cases, I bet. And yeah.

260
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:41,670
Reporting is harder to do in rural poor areas. Yeah.

261
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:48,870
Or nonspecific as well. Yeah. It's kind of nonspecific symptoms and like people get sick and then, you know,

262
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:54,269
they may not seek care at the hospital and especially if they're very elderly, they live in a rural area.

263
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:56,160
They have sort of these nonspecific symptoms.

264
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:03,430
And then they might just write home about it without going to a hospital, being diagnosed, and therefore having it reported in these statistics.

265
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:10,610
I would guess is part of it too. I also don't know exactly how you diagnose pancreatic cancer,

266
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:17,770
but it's really deep in there and you probably need some sort of specialized equipment to actually diagnose it and do all of that stuff,

267
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,399
so and do all the biopsy and everything.

268
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:27,380
So I bet there's a lot of like cases of it that just kind of go undiagnosed in places with poor medical systems.

269
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:32,450
And I guess that's why your wording is important because like what I say when I was saying

270
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:37,910
one of the reasons why it's like lack of or lack of screening is the lack of diagnostic.

271
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:41,780
Yes, that is correct. That is right. Yes. Yeah, yeah.

272
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,290
Yeah. How with the lack of established cancer breakthroughs, if not.

273
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:56,440
Everything. Like I'm asking you if there were more developed and established in registrations.

274
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,710
Yeah. In the countries they are in the less developed countries.

275
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:07,920
Yeah. Yeah. I mean probably I think if that were the case, you would see that for all cancers that it was lower in those places.

276
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,910
Right. And you don't see that necessarily.

277
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:16,330
I think that's always important to think about, but I think it's probably it's a combination of all of these things.

278
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:22,550
Right. But if it were really just a lack of registration, all cancers would appear to be lower in those in those less at all places.

279
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,600
Does that make sense? Yeah, that that's always important to think about that.

280
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,929
That's all right. I want to make sure we leave time for our other group.

281
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:35,140
So great job, guys. If you want to stay on, you can or you can listen to the recordings later.

282
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,480
But let us know. Are you guys David in the way? Are you guys going to stay on, do you think?

283
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:59,400
All right. All right.

284
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:03,610
We will share our screen then. So when you guys pull up your go ahead and pull up your slides,

285
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,799
which is going to be like a and then I in process of like logging out and logging

286
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,300
back in and then it didn't work and then you have to do it three more times. But that's just how Google is.

287
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:31,910
So. Good job, guys, dealing with the last minute online changes.

288
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:40,159
It does. It does. So, you know, I know we all describe that email about what viruses it has, you know, virus.

289
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,270
Thank you. Like, whatever whatever the thought is just now taking notice.

290
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:52,400
And so, you know, if somebody's sick of the digital presentation, we can obviously can take care of it.

291
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,350
Right. So we will we will all muddle through together and try not to get each other sick.

292
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:10,410
Sound good? All right. I thought have was a very long.

293
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,559
Oh, my goodness. You're going to have to change it at one point.

294
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,290
And I didn't want to change it entirely. I just added more to hide there.

295
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,770
That's a recipe for disaster later on. Yeah. Yeah.

296
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:31,000
I actually pay now for this service that, like, keeps track of all your passwords for you.

297
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,040
It'll actually generate random passwords for you.

298
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:39,010
And so you have like one master password to get into the the service and it has like a that's really nice.

299
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,420
Yeah. I decided I was throwing money at the problem. Like, I can't anymore.

300
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:49,150
My friend has got hacked. He's like, I use the same password, so.

301
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:54,009
Oh, yeah, that's like my biggest. Yeah, yeah. Like, all right.

302
00:42:54,010 --> 00:43:06,000
Can you share your screen instances? It. Yes. Yeah.

303
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:13,570
Okay. I can do that. If you like it, can you go?

304
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:17,140
Thank you for that, David. Sorry. Sorry I left. David's here. I apologize.

305
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:25,030
And you can make. You can make the call if you need to. All right.

306
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,200
Great. Awesome. So today our group is going to be discussing ovarian cancer.

307
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,690
And just to give a brief overview of what ovarian cancer is.

308
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:37,870
It refers to cancers, tumors of the ovaries, which may originate from the ovary itself or from a nearby structure,

309
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:45,260
such as in tubes or the inner lining of the abdomen. So just to give an overview of the scope of cancer in the U.S.

310
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,550
This chart shows incidence, the incidence over time.

311
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,170
So ovarian cancer is the second most prevalent biological cancer following breast cancer.

312
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,420
And over time, as you can see, there's been a study,

313
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:04,700
a decrease in ovarian cancer incidence from 12 in 100,000 people in 1975 to 8 in 100,000 people in 2017,

314
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:10,010
which can be attributed to pharmaceutical developments impacting reproductive risk factors,

315
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:17,480
factors such as uptake in oral contraceptives and changes in the use of hormone or hormone replacement therapy.

316
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:21,380
This isn't like the entire picture, but those are definitely two factors that play a role.

317
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:28,490
And then in terms of ovarian cancer mortality in the U.S., you can also see a decrease.

318
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:34,520
And ovarian cancer is often ranks fifth in cancer deaths for women.

319
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:47,720
And despite ovarian cancer being one of the more lethal cancers, mortality has decreased from 6.4 deaths in 1980 to 4.2 deaths per 100,000 in 2017.

320
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:52,489
And this can be attributed to the decrease in incidence that we saw earlier and

321
00:44:52,490 --> 00:45:00,350
also increases in better treatments and more research into ovarian cancer.

322
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:05,870
So this shows the incidence of ovarian cancer globally.

323
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:14,660
And as you can see, there are high concentrations of incidence around Eastern Europe, Northern Asia, places like Indonesia and Japan.

324
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:21,440
However, lower incidence among places like South America and also Africa and parts of Asia.

325
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:33,270
However, when compared to mortality, you can see that some of the places that had high incidence, such as Indonesia, also have high mortality.

326
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:38,520
And Eastern Europe is consistent with high mortality and high incidence.

327
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:46,319
However, Japan and Western Europe tend to have lower mortality when Africa,

328
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:51,930
which had low to moderate incidence, tends to have moderate to high mortality,

329
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:58,980
which is consistent with what we learned in class about lower income countries having lower incidence but higher mortality.

330
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:05,280
And this could be due to a lack of resources and a lack of access to diagnostic tests.

331
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:10,849
Yes. We're talking about risk factors and causes of ovarian cancer.

332
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:13,190
And I guess you define risk factors as behavioral.

333
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:19,819
But as I mentioned, later on, there will be some risk factors that don't necessarily fall under the scope of behavior, one of which is age.

334
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:30,020
And the median age that causes the peak of incidence rates for women is around the age of 65 and particularly particularly is during postmenopausal.

335
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:37,190
For most women. One specific behavioral risk factor that was noted that we talked about briefly is hormone replacement therapy.

336
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:46,370
And it was seen in like a 2007 cohort study that around 300,000 UK women that were fall through after five years of follow up.

337
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:53,180
Of those 100,000, 30% of them were current users, HRT, and 20% of them were passed users.

338
00:46:53,450 --> 00:47:00,620
And within the follow up, we saw that there was an increased risk of them getting ovarian cancer than those that never started HRT.

339
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:05,540
However, it's important to note that actually in a 2015 study, which was a meta analysis,

340
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:12,380
that women who had survived ovarian cancers or recurrent patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer that were using HRT,

341
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:18,620
had no increased risk of survival, had no increased risk in terms of survivability or tumor recruits.

342
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:21,079
And this is just something important and interesting to note,

343
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:27,470
because hormone replacement therapy is often told or given treatment for one of these severe menopausal symptoms.

344
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:33,590
So these people can often use these benefits for these symptoms.

345
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:39,020
Additionally, another thing that we defined as behavioral was as we talked about,

346
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:43,700
of course, there are also genetic factors linked to whether or not people to become obese.

347
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:51,410
How are we just talking? You just defined it in terms of risk factors for diet, amount of exercise that could be.

348
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:57,680
I guess, like fixed and like, whether or not the person decides to.

349
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:03,890
I'll change these habits of which we saw on Global Cannes 2020.

350
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,390
Ovarian cancer is still one of the top ten common cancers caused by obesity.

351
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:13,030
And another risk factor that is behavioral is smoking on people down.

352
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:17,300
Current smokers of past smokers have a slight increased risk of ovarian cancer than people that do not.

353
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:26,210
In terms of genetic causes, we see that people that have the one and or BRCA2 mutation have this very strong chance of getting ovarian cancer.

354
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:36,380
Specifically for people that have cancer syndrome known as H, people who have, according to the CDC, people who have had a 39% increase.

355
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:39,050
She ends up getting more than cancer by the age of 70.

356
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:47,000
And even people that don't have age back and still have the mutations, the people that are that have the BRCA1 mutation have 44,

357
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:55,040
44% increased risk of getting cancer and people with the BRCA2 mutation have a 60% increased risk by the age of 80.

358
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:00,560
And this is also important to know just because of genetic mutations such as the BRCA1,

359
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:06,860
BRCA1 and two mutation is also seen in other types of cancer, such as breast cancer.

360
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,360
And it was seen in a 2005 cohort study that people that had breast cancer and the chances

361
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:15,890
of getting a brain cancer was also an increased risk for both types of mutations.

362
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,759
Next, we'll be talking about some protective factors.

363
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:25,129
And we just want to note that there is no specific prevention towards ovarian cancer in getting it.

364
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:30,950
But these protective factors may limit the risk of getting it, one of which is the use of oral contraceptives.

365
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:39,920
It was seen in a study that people for younger users that use oral contraceptives have a 20% decreased risk of getting it by after five years of use.

366
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:46,340
And this risk is not determined by the formulation or the type of the oral contraceptive.

367
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:51,920
So typically we see that any type of oral contraceptive use is good or in terms of protection,

368
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:57,620
other medical procedures seen also as to the location or having your tubes tied.

369
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:01,570
And we see that there is around a 39% decrease of getting ovarian cancer.

370
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:06,110
And the theory behind this is that this woman's the amount of blood flow that goes to the ovaries,

371
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:11,300
thus limiting the amount of hormones, growth factors and infection that could occur in the ovaries.

372
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:17,600
Another type of medical procedure is a prophylactic to be or remove of the ovaries.

373
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:22,790
And so usually the broken tubes. This is an 85 to 95% decrease.

374
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:28,640
However, this is only typically recommended to people with the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation as it's a very invasive.

375
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:32,389
And in terms of pregnancy, pregnancy and breastfeeding,

376
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:38,209
we hear that people are women that are multiple carriers have a 50% decreased risk of getting ovarian cancer.

377
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:46,220
These women that do not have kids. And within a full meta analysis, it would seem that breastfeeding breastfeeding reduces the risk of cancer by 24%.

378
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,830
So in terms of prevention efforts for primary prevention has and to discuss

379
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:56,880
their measures that are shown to decrease the risk of getting ovarian cancer.

380
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:01,350
However, these measures are not typically recommended for the sole purpose of ovarian cancer prevention.

381
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:05,580
So, for example, the use of oral contraceptives is a proven protective factor.

382
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:06,209
However,

383
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:14,160
a 2013 study found insufficient evidence to recommend the use of contraceptives solely for the primary prevention of ovarian cancer in average women.

384
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:20,700
Meaning that if the only reason that you would like to take or oral contraceptives is to prevent ovarian cancer,

385
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,070
they didn't find a significant benefit in doing that.

386
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,770
And like most other cancers, one of the biggest risk factors for ovarian cancer is family history.

387
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,719
Therefore, education about the prevalence and symptoms of ovarian cancer and also increasing

388
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,470
genetic testing are the best practice for primary prevention in ovarian cancer.

389
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:44,610
Looking at secondary prevention, there is no recommended screening test for ovarian cancer in those who have symptoms.

390
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:49,379
The current test used to diagnose diagnosed ovarian cancer was given a D rating

391
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:53,910
by the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force when used without symptoms,

392
00:51:54,180 --> 00:52:00,240
when used and a population without symptoms were not known to have high risk hereditary cancer syndromes.

393
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:05,900
And the test administered is a transvaginal ultrasound or a test for the tumor marker.

394
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:06,990
C 8125.

395
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:17,190
And the reason that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend it is because that is because those who returned a positive result,

396
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:23,130
the majority of them did not have ovarian cancer. So that had a high rate of false positives.

397
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:30,749
However, the diagnostic test is administered by parent. When patients experience symptoms such as irregular bleeding, irregular discharge,

398
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:34,740
pain or pressure in the public area, abdominal or back pain and bloating.

399
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:40,740
And as you can see from these from these symptoms, prevention in this area is a bit difficult,

400
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:47,130
especially due to the normalization of these symptoms in people who ran straight.

401
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:54,930
So they're often overlooked by both providers and patients when trying to diagnose ovarian cancer at this stage.

402
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:03,780
And then in terms of tertiary prevention, the treatment for ovarian cancer has traditionally been a combination of chemotherapy and surgery,

403
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:08,880
primarily with surgical staging of the affected tissue tumor, debulking and subsequent chemotherapy.

404
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:14,130
And these are all aimed to increase survivorship and prevent the cancer from spreading to other areas.

405
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:22,330
So there are also a lot of major health disparities both nationally and internationally in focusing on this graph.

406
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:31,450
This is an age specific incidence and mortality incidence and mortality rate within the U.S. from 1975 to 2004.

407
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:38,590
And we see specifically that black women are often more highly at risk of developing and dying from ovarian cancer,

408
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:44,020
according to the same study that this graph came from. Black women have the lowest incidence rate yet,

409
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:50,500
the second highest mortality rate across the U.S. and they also have the lowest five year survival rate of around 36%.

410
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:58,600
Additionally, these are black women also are least likely to be diagnosed with Clearasil or very clear XL ovarian cancer,

411
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:02,530
which is the early stage of the disease, which is only 2.4%.

412
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:04,690
And in general, ovarian cancer.

413
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:14,230
People who have Medicare or Medicaid insurance are less likely to receive germline testing than private insurance at privately insured patients.

414
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:20,620
And germline testing essentially is an examination for inherited mutations that people can have within their bodies.

415
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:23,049
And not only is it detrimental for ovarian cancer,

416
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:29,290
but other types of cancers also have other genetic mutations that increases the risk of getting those cancers.

417
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:35,440
And another study also pointed out that if you are either black of low socioeconomic status,

418
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:43,899
non presently insured or have preexisting health conditions, you are less likely to receive guideline adhered treatment showing.

419
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:50,530
There's also the social determinants that could decide whether or not you get the proper treatment and health care access.

420
00:54:52,330 --> 00:55:01,090
In terms of what internationally we see on the global scale in 2020, projected to 2040 on low HDI,

421
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:09,670
medium HDI countries have a lot a larger increase of the number of cases and deaths compared to high HDI in very high HDI countries.

422
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:17,020
And this just shows that there is a lack of health care to these lower HDI countries.

423
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:22,690
Specific countries that are around have 100% increase the number of cases.

424
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:32,170
And looking again at the data table and more specific on while most populations across the world are having it increase by the time of 2040,

425
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:40,240
particularly Africa, Latin American, Caribbean and Oceania have the highest number of changes of cases as high as number,

426
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,300
highest change in number of cases by the year 2040.

427
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:48,760
Hence showing that there is a disparity in the terms of lack of proper diagnosis,

428
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:54,970
whether or not these people are getting health care access and whether or not these testing and treatments are given to these people.

429
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:04,000
So as Ali mentioned, it's pretty hard to catch ovarian cancer early on if it's called stage one, chance of survival are pretty good.

430
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:08,969
But because ovarian cancer can be asymptomatic for years, it's really hard to catch early on.

431
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:13,379
And the reason that we say in asymptomatic is that we just want to reinforce that

432
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,980
early stage symptoms are super general may include things like abdominal bloating,

433
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,980
frequent urination and feeling full pretty quickly.

434
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:27,120
And even as you progress to later stages, it's still very general symptoms such as changes in your volume and back pain.

435
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:34,380
So for people who menstruate, these are pretty standard monthly symptoms and it's pretty general enough where it's hard to believe that physicians,

436
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:41,430
general physicians, might dismiss their patients, especially if they're patients of color who have a lot of distress in the medical community.

437
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:50,570
So I just also want to note three different types of ovarian cancer epithelium,

438
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:59,660
which takes up the majority of ovarian cancers and also stromal cancer in terms of cancers, stromal cancers make up about 1% of cases.

439
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:03,740
These are from ovarian cells that make hormones. And in terms of cancer, certainly exons.

440
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:10,580
But the majority of ovarian cancer is occurring in ovarian cancer cells, which are tumors that are on the outside of the ovary.

441
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:22,120
So as we also mentioned, diagnostic tests are pretty hard to cut or they're not a standard compared to the standard thing to test for.

442
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:28,659
So because as humans are able to get past gastrointestinal issues that patients have, they do perform the following diagnostic test.

443
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,250
That definitely takes a step to get there.

444
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:38,800
So they include doing a pelvic exam and an ultrasound and then also doing a 125 blood test from the genetic test at your local physicians.

445
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:45,970
But truly, the only way to determine whether a growth is cancer is to remove a piece of it, and that's there through a CT scan and surgery.

446
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:49,270
And so this procedure is the biopsy approved variant cancer.

447
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:55,510
The biopsy is most commonly done by removing the tumor during surgery, so that rate requires an invasive surgery.

448
00:57:56,050 --> 00:58:02,350
And so there are definitely a lot of pitfalls here. Rapid growth, ovarian cancer usually prohibits early detection of it.

449
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:06,310
Most of these tests have a pretty poor or positive predictive value.

450
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:14,140
It's low incidence around the world. And then there are a lot of positives like we talked about, and that causes psychological and financial distress.

451
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:19,090
And then ultimately, the biggest pitfalls are you have to have an invasive surgery in order to diagnose this cancer.

452
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:24,740
So I also think it's important just to know the different types of stages of ovarian cancer,

453
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:32,479
because treatment does vary pretty greatly in sort of survival rate. So for stage one, the cancer is within either one or two in your ovaries.

454
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,490
And it also found on the surface of it as well.

455
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:42,080
And after you sort of have the surgery, surgeons go in and sort of double the tumor, which means they go in and remove as much as possible.

456
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:45,890
And that's how they're able to biopsy it and continue to treat it.

457
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:54,459
And next steps. So after it's sort of biopsied and taken in most ovarian cancer cases,

458
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:58,390
treatment includes some sort of removal of an internal organ as seen on the board.

459
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:05,290
So you can either have a hysterectomy which is in the uterus and effectively remove all the ovaries and it's all can go for up to me.

460
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:10,360
But, you know, it's pretty much say it's proof that it's the removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes.

461
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:15,520
So clearly, this is very hard for patients because not only are they diagnosed with cancer,

462
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:20,480
but they also have committed of any chance of fertility, especially in later stages.

463
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:28,120
And it's also harder for younger patients. About 25% of ovarian cancer patients are within the standard fertile range.

464
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:36,160
So they have many more years of fertility. Had it done when diagnosed in a sex life, which ultimately gets taken away when it gets removed.

465
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:46,370
So once a cancer is diagnosed and biopsy for the different stage and grade, there are a few different types of treatments that can be done.

466
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:55,640
Usually a tumor is developed as soon as the initial surgery is done to remove anything visible and depending on the stage of stage one and stage two,

467
00:59:56,450 --> 01:00:03,829
after a tumor is developed, they go in with either intravenous chemotherapy or intra abdominal chemotherapy.

468
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:08,620
And those are the top two factors. And then just depending on the stage and grade and like how young you are,

469
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:13,009
surgeons can do different types of treatments or oncologists can do different types of treatments,

470
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:16,070
and those include hormone therapy, radiation and chemotherapy.

471
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:20,089
Radiation is particularly useful for younger patients who want more years of fertility.

472
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:23,480
It sort of preserves having your internal organs removed.

473
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,550
And then this is just a demonstration of stage two.

474
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:34,600
So this is just having cancer cells that are progressing into the fallopian tubes and then also going to the bone,

475
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:38,620
to the bladder and the stage also to try to remove as much of the tumor as possible.

476
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:42,620
That's usually followed with 3 to 6 rounds of chemo, just depending on how bad it is.

477
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:50,950
For Stage three, the theory goes sort of from the localized, localized region to the regional type.

478
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:56,050
It goes into the vagina, into the uterus, and it has no spread into the lymph nodes.

479
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:01,570
And this usually includes stage three cancer. This is where most ovarian cancer cases are diagnosed.

480
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:09,700
And this usually includes having chemo before your initial surgery, sort of to reduce as much as the chemo or as much of the tumor as possible.

481
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:14,910
Then you go and sort of try to remove as much as possible and you go in three more rounds.

482
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:23,610
It's, you know, usually on average. And on stage for the show, the distance or the distance tumors.

483
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:25,830
And this sort of has spread to all different parts of the body.

484
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:30,930
And this is usually when they start using platinum chemotherapy to kill as much as the tumors as possible.

485
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:35,820
And usually they try to prolong life here.

486
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:40,890
But it's really like a Jason King scenario because obviously the worst mortality rate.

487
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:49,540
And this is sort of this year. Five year rates. 60% of all ovarian cancers are diagnosed at least stage three.

488
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:55,329
So 25% are diagnosed under age 45. And all sort of localized stage one.

489
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:58,210
Stage two, the five year survival rate is pretty good at 93%.

490
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,970
But as most cases are diagnosed at that stage, three regional survival rates about five years.

491
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:07,960
And the distance the stage for the five year survival rate is 30%.

492
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:16,510
So life after treatment is still pretty tough because ovarian cancer has a very high rate of reoccurrence.

493
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:20,590
So probably the next two years of your life probably involves going to doctor's visits,

494
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:24,970
getting imaging tests, doing the blood tests for the 125 marker.

495
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:33,130
And usually when you have an internal organ removed, it means that your menopause starts on average 5 to 10 years earlier,

496
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:36,600
and this happens abruptly overnight as soon as the organ is removed.

497
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:44,650
So this causes serious mental and physical changes for people and not usually requires getting some sort of therapy, both mentally and physically.

498
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:49,270
So we're trying to regain a patient's sex life, having a better quality of life after treatment.

499
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:55,959
And there's a lot of growth in the ovarian cancer community because they usually feel like they're plugged in with other gynecological cancers,

500
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:02,950
especially breast cancer, and they really want more research, sort of how to deal with their own treatment and survival after treatment.

501
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:09,050
Okay. So getting into the current research areas,

502
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:15,470
so obviously there's a lot of issues with kind of the screening that is available in the diagnostic testing.

503
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:19,759
So the current research focus is really kind of improving these screening methods

504
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,330
and developing something that really works specifically for ovarian cancer.

505
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:28,850
So Sacha touched a little bit on survival rate and how early stage localized ovarian cancer

506
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:33,860
does have a very high survival rate and a very successful treatment rate if it's found early.

507
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:37,280
But obviously, like we've said, that's not usually the case.

508
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:46,220
So the success rate of treatment, if ovarian cancer is found at stage one, is 90%, but only 20% of cases are able to be detected at stage one.

509
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:53,389
So the impact of kind of having a more successful early detection method would be extremely significant.

510
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:58,220
But because of the small size of the tumors, this has proved to be really difficult so far.

511
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:04,010
And this kind of disparity between success rate of treatment and cases detected

512
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:08,900
at stage one shows that really crucial research need for screening improvements.

513
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:13,220
Okay. And then so to address this gap,

514
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:21,530
current research is focused on kind of narrowing in on more accurate biomarkers and being able to detect ovarian cancer at early stages.

515
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:31,600
I found this really disturbing image in a paper about kind of the different biomarkers and the different places that biomarkers can be found.

516
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:34,490
So kind of shows like the variety of research that needs,

517
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:38,510
needs to occur and kind of all the things that need to lead there to find something that's really successful.

518
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:46,460
So we've talked a little bit about how C.A. 125 is kind of the current biomarker.

519
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:56,090
It's pretty well established and play a role in the development of ovarian cancer and is elevated in about 80% of advanced stage ovarian cancer cases.

520
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:07,310
But it's been proven that testing for just elevated C1 25 expression alone is not reliable just by itself to attack, to detect early stage disease.

521
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:14,660
And then along with it not being reliable to find in all cases, it also can be elevated for a number of other reasons.

522
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:25,520
So this graph from the C1 25 study shows that kind of the different levels of C1 25 expression in different stages.

523
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:30,590
So you can kind of see how levels are definitely more elevated in later stage cancer.

524
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,389
So you can see how that to be a little more accurate,

525
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:40,070
but it's not super specific and very cut and dry by itself in especially in those early stages because it's not really showing a lot of expression.

526
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:51,080
Another study also tested 28 different biomarkers in comparison to SEER 125 in regards to being effective on their own, in spotting ovarian cancer,

527
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:52,639
especially at earlier stages,

528
01:05:52,640 --> 01:06:00,380
and concluded that there were there was no singular biomarker by itself that showed a better performance than just see 125 alone.

529
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:08,149
And this finding really suggests that kind of the current and future direction of studies would have a lot

530
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:15,440
more success identifying early stage ovarian cancer by kind of testing combinations of other biomarkers,

531
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:23,780
along with C1 125 and maybe creating a type of like biomarker panel to kind of narrow it and be a little bit more specific, capturing more cases.

532
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:25,310
Okay.

533
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:35,930
So one example of a really promising study tested whether elevated levels of auto antibodies against the Tp53 gene would kind of be more effective,

534
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:41,670
either on its own or combined. The Tp53 gene is another commonly mutated cancer gene.

535
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:45,350
This is something that we've talked about before in class in regards to other cancers.

536
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:53,150
So this team looked at whether Tp53 could kind of act similar latest SIA 125 or be used in conjunction.

537
01:06:54,110 --> 01:07:03,800
And the study ended up finding that only about 20 to 25% of individuals who had ovarian cancer were showing elevated tp53 autoantibody levels.

538
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:12,590
But for that specific kind of subset of people, it was actually showing really substantial lead time over just 125.

539
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:19,880
So you can kind of see between these two plots here, it's Tp53 on the left and then C1 25 on the right.

540
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:24,080
So you can kind of see how the difference in how effective they are on their.

541
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:33,380
But kind of for that subset of cases, it was a little bit more specific for the tp53, the people who showed that elevated expression.

542
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:39,920
So the paper kind of concluded with the authors suggesting that the findings could contribute to maybe that idea

543
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:47,300
of a future panel of biomarkers and kind of getting maybe one step closer to having a more specific panel.

544
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:56,189
So the public health implications of this research and if it were to be successful, is obviously really important.

545
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:57,950
It really can't be overstated.

546
01:07:57,950 --> 01:08:08,180
So we covered earlier how primary and secondary prevention methods are either nonexistent or ineffective or really just not proving to be successful.

547
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:14,210
So that leaves millions of women at risk for the second most deadly gynecologic tumor.

548
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:24,140
And additionally, this research on potential biomarkers is something that could really hugely impact research towards other cancers as well,

549
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:27,800
and something that could contribute to screenings in other cancers.

550
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:35,120
So genes like K one, 25 and TB 53 are definitely associated with a lot of other cancers.

551
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:39,530
And the idea of this panel is something that could definitely lend itself to other

552
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:42,950
cancers outside of just ovarian and something that could be maybe applied elsewhere.

553
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:51,259
It's also really significant because there are no current screening methods that work reliably on tumors that

554
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:58,130
are as small as the average stage one or two epithelial ovarian tumor because they're so extremely small.

555
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:04,580
So this makes screening research pretty unprecedented and very exciting kind of in that field of cancer research.

556
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:12,440
And even finding one more specific biomarker and narrowing down that test a little bit could eventually be considered a public health

557
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:18,080
breakthrough and is definitely something that kind of deserves more focus than what the current scope of research is even going.

558
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:24,460
And that I think it's it adds up to pushes.

559
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,540
If there's anything about the public messaging.

560
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:50,650
Also. Sure.

561
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:57,580
Yeah. So what we found is that, um, I mean, so essentially the research that I found was that, you know,

562
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:03,069
doctors are really like recommending prescriptions for oral contraceptives in

563
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:07,680
cases where the patient just wants to reduce their risk of ovarian cancer.

564
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:12,519
I think it also is correlated with breast cancer reduction.

565
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:17,980
So, um, if that was like the sole reason, then that's not really something that they were recommending it for.

566
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:26,200
But if there were other reasons like know planning or, or I mean I know it's even prescribed for acne, stuff like that.

567
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:31,930
Then kind of like a side benefit could be great reductions in cancer.

568
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:35,499
So that was like the messaging that we found around.

569
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:41,080
It is like if the sole purpose is for primary prevention of cancer, it's not really recommended for that.

570
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:49,880
Just like there is no specific they haven't seen as to how oral contraceptives themselves are.

571
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:58,250
But the theories and hypothesis behind it is that people that are currently in oral contraceptives have fewer options.

572
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:02,570
So that's a limited amount of cell division that happens in the ovaries.

573
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:07,010
And obviously, as we've talked about before, cancer.

574
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:13,760
So if you have operations at a woman's body, then it's probably a less than.

575
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:21,690
Yeah. So I think part of the issue too is I didn't quite catch what you said.

576
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:24,750
Did you say that associated increased risk of breast cancer?

577
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:29,040
I said decrease by increase. Oh, increase. Oh, yeah. Sorry. That's my bad.

578
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:35,040
So I think that's part of why this if you do the math, breast cancer is more common.

579
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:43,040
So even if it increases risk of breast cancer a tiny bit, then you've got you're treating it maybe more cases.

580
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:51,209
It's, it's, it's complicated, right? So, um, a lot of people, I think I mentioned this a little bit before we were talking,

581
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:56,040
but it maybe the breast cancer group, when you guys get to your presentation, we'll talk more about this.

582
01:11:56,040 --> 01:12:03,809
I don't know. But the issue with oral contraceptives is that the women who are the age to be getting breast cancer now,

583
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:10,980
so say a woman is like 70 right now when she was in her twenties and thirties, that would have been help me with math.

584
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:18,809
The eighties, seventies and eighties. And so the the pills that were available then have like much different hormone levels.

585
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:23,400
Right? So like now we're taking we've really changed the formulation of oral contraceptives

586
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:26,730
so that like if you were to start an oral contraceptive now as a 20 year old,

587
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:33,270
it's a much lower estrogen level. Right. It's just a totally different, different drug, really, in some ways.

588
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,110
So we don't really know what the increased risk is.

589
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:44,220
It's a little bit confusing, right, because the data we have is kind of almost about a different drug than we would be taking right now.

590
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:50,490
So there are people who really do argue that oral contraceptives should be used as primary prevention.

591
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:54,060
I mean, there are researchers who really believe that, and we'll say that strongly,

592
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:58,710
but there are people who are really worried about this potential tradeoff with breast cancer.

593
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:02,370
So I think it's just kind of like, well, hey, if you want to take it for other reasons,

594
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,620
it may also be helping with ovarian cancer, and that'd be great, but we're not going to tell you to take it just for that.

595
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:20,330
It's wrong. I made a mistake. But you said that, like, 20% of cases are diagnosed in stage one.

596
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:24,280
Do you know the percentage of cases in the other stages?

597
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:29,769
I don't. So it's at least 60% is diagnosed in stage three.

598
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:34,780
But the readings were between like 60 and 75% on stage during stage four.

599
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:39,190
And so, like doing the math, it's probably like around 70% stage two.

600
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:48,240
You can find that to us here, but. I think I'm going to.

601
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:55,140
I know you mentioned testing for a combination of doctors.

602
01:13:55,490 --> 01:14:00,160
You know how feasible. The general population.

603
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:05,450
Oh yeah.

604
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:15,000
It wasn't really in a lot of the research, especially because like kind of like the study that I was talking about with the type 53 and C 125.

605
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:21,030
They're so early on, I think that they that like type of panel like really doesn't exist.

606
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,209
So I'm not sure in terms of cause I don't think they've really gotten that far,

607
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:29,850
but I'm not really sure if something like that exists for another cancer or maybe if there's like kind of something comparable.

608
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:34,620
But it wasn't I don't think they had really gotten to that point in most of the studies that I was looking at.

609
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:39,090
Not for screening. Yeah. Do you have things like that for like diagnostic testing?

610
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:45,720
So what I'm thinking of is they'll sometimes do like from the biopsy specimen of the tumor.

611
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:51,870
They'll sometimes do like a genetic sequencing. There are even like on an ankle type D X and there's like these,

612
01:14:51,870 --> 01:15:01,080
these commercial panels that exist where they'll run like genetic sequencing of the genetic changes in the tumor tissue to see if any,

613
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:05,430
because there's certain profiles that are associated with increased aggressiveness.

614
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:11,940
For example, they'll do this with prostate, for example, when they're trying to decide how aggressively to treat a smaller tumor.

615
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:17,339
So but like blood biomarker panel, I mean, they'll do it with urine.

616
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:23,309
There's a urine test for prostate cancer. So I guess what I'm saying is they exist for diagnostic reasons.

617
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:24,830
Once you're diagnosed with a tumor,

618
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:32,610
sometimes these things exist to try to determine tumor aggressiveness and like whether how aggressively you should treat that.

619
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:38,040
I am unaware of any panel that exists like that for the purpose of screening,

620
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:43,169
and you're correct in thinking that cost is going to be an issue because if you're going to start doing it to everybody,

621
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:48,600
it has to be pretty low cost, right? Um, so that is going to be a conversation.

622
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:55,259
But first you have to have something that works. Like the first step is to find a thing that actually works to reduce ovarian cancer mortality.

623
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,630
And then you have to think about cost benefit, right?

624
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:04,170
So yes, so that will be part of the conversation someday if they actually come up with anything that works.

625
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:08,159
Once we figure out that it works, then we could figure out how much it costs.

626
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:13,229
Right? Um, I had a quick thing I wanted to, to clarify.

627
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:17,130
So the debulking surgery that you mentioned, you were talking about that mostly for stage one and two.

628
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:22,380
Do you know if they do that for later stages, too? Oh, they do, yes. Do you know why?

629
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:28,019
Just to remove as much as you had to remove as much as possible, but also like for stage four,

630
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:31,319
that's a little bit like closing the barn door after the horse is already out.

631
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:36,650
But what'll happen and you kind of alluded to it for stage two, but it happens even worse than stage three.

632
01:16:36,670 --> 01:16:45,239
Four, is that you'll actually get adhesion on to like the bowel and the tumor will actually grow and then adhere to nearby things.

633
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:51,479
Right. And so that's where a lot of that abdominal pain comes from and painful bowel movements and pain payment eating and stuff

634
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:59,969
is because the tumor will actually kind of adhere to the abdominal wall and to the to the to the intestines and stuff.

635
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:03,150
And so it starts to kind of bind everything up in there.

636
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:05,309
And so the debulking actually increased.

637
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:11,850
It like reduces a lot of the symptoms and makes patients more comfortable in addition to whatever effect it may have.

638
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:16,710
Probably it's having more effect on actual outcomes earlier on.

639
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:19,110
Right and stage 3 to 1 patients,

640
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:26,430
but they'll still do it in stage four just to like make the patient able to have bowel movements and things more normally.

641
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:31,790
My my understanding is that it's a it is one of the more painful cancers.

642
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:39,370
Because of that, that tendency for it to start to stick to everything and kind of glue everything together.

643
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:51,590
Which sounds awful, but. All right.

644
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:55,730
And that's questions. Great job, everybody.

645
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:03,580
All right, Ali, early next week is the Tuesday before.

646
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:10,190
I can't believe it's Thanksgiving next week already. Oh, my gosh. All right. Well, we will see you guys next Tuesday.

647
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:14,770
And if you're traveling or whatever, I will see you.

648
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:24,300
Have a great Thanksgiving. Don't forget to sign in.

649
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:30,470
Why? Why is this happening?

650
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:40,060
Well, I think like I did, too, and I was like, oh, and you have to catch me doing, like, this weird movement so that I look like a complete lily.

651
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:47,660
It's like, oh, yeah, everything is better frozen. Yeah, apparently I actually take a protein David in.

652
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:53,299
So we were like that still at least. Yes. Oh, that's really awkward.

653
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:57,379
Okay. Thanks. Thank you for that.

654
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:58,280
Really appreciate it.
