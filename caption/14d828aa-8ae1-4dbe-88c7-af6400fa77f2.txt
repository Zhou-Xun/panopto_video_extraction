1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,500
Okay? Mm hmm.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,590
Excuse me. All right.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:17,430
So next up, I would like to go through some of the stuff that from the works that kind of wrap up the antivirus workshop.

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,110
Um, so I have questions for you.

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:33,870
So I think everybody, all of the groups had, um, I was following all the way through here from the year.

6
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,560
So maybe. Okay. And then I'm going to.

7
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,290
All right. So now some people are going to watch this after the fact.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,020
So I think everybody ended up identifying that if you take this study that we started with,

9
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:03,950
if you take the case study and you ask, what is the kind of the big, compelling open question that's left by this study?

10
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:15,110
Like everybody came up with, the fact that we still don't we still cannot establish from this study to what degree adenovirus is a cause of hepatitis.

11
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:26,680
Now. I know I was really kind of centered in on this terminology, hepatitis of unknown etiology.

12
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:36,430
But really from a case definition perspective, you could just say hepatitis B could be specifically be talking about looking for an association,

13
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,630
hepatitis An ideology, or just saying hepatitis defined.

14
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:48,080
So in order to figure out where to go from next, I think it's important to first start with this study.

15
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:54,620
How would you describe if you had to pick a study designing for this study, what would you what would you call it?

16
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,760
It's not a randomized controlled trial. It's up in the air and out of the area.

17
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:24,400
Some groups had it. Some groups were slightly off. Now that they said that, nobody's going to say anything.

18
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:33,650
All right. How many? Maybe we'll just do a small raise here so that you can understand.

19
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:40,660
I think that this is a cross-sectional study. So this is not a cross sectional.

20
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:46,720
So you could have done a small risk. This is actually a case series.

21
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,670
And I'm going to tell you how, you know,

22
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:57,159
one cross sectional studies still of the defining aspect of cross sectional said it would be is that you grabbing

23
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:05,229
all of the data without any ability to document whether the outcome happened first or the exposure happened first.

24
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:10,959
And that's kind of happening here. You're identifying hepatitis in your data, identifying if they had no virus in the blood at the same time.

25
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,790
So you temporalities matched up. That's true.

26
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:23,050
However, cross sectional studies still aren't able to fill out an entire two by two table of information in this study we have.

27
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:32,920
So this question right here is big question. In order to ask this question, we have to figure out hepatitis B who don't have hepatitis.

28
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:39,250
Are there controls people who have had no virus and people who don't have that no virus?

29
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,510
This paper right here evaluates this.

30
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,120
They take everybody that has hepatitis and figure out how many of them have adenovirus.

31
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:55,870
Now, what this does not tell us maybe the distribution between everybody is positive or negative.

32
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,100
Maybe the percent positivity is exactly the same in people that have the case,

33
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,830
in which case we have a lot of bad no virus and people have don't have an association.

34
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:14,440
Right. Because of missing these 12 information. So this is why this is a case serious and it's not a cross-sectional study.

35
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:22,060
So so what key to think about kind of the hierarchy of of study designs for evidence?

36
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:32,260
Where would you go next? You know, so, yes, you could go to a cross sectional, say design that where you would want to go next.

37
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,830
Really in this kind of situation is that case control.

38
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:46,480
Now, a few groups kind of backed into two different groups, backed into the idea of case control by virtue of a really large cohort study.

39
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:54,970
And then I wanted I want to talk about a few things, a few reasons why I wouldn't do that in this in this scenario.

40
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:01,180
And one of the reasons is it's really specific to this paper in the situation itself.

41
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,670
So and this is sometimes the difference between taking a cohort study and a case control study sometimes comes out as the feasibility issues.

42
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:17,320
So what the paper describes is that in early earlier this year,

43
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:29,080
they released a health alert and said anybody that has children with this definition of hepatitis in any hospital across the United States,

44
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,040
please identify them, do this, work out and report it to CDC. So you are doing a national level surveillance.

45
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:42,820
Anybody in? And if a kid has hepatitis, like if a kid has symptoms of hepatitis, they're probably going to end up getting medical care.

46
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:50,710
So anybody that's coming attention to the entire US medical system is coming into this paper.

47
00:05:50,980 --> 00:06:00,970
You know, we tell that I think the cutoff was October and it was October 1st through June 15th, and they had 296 children.

48
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,270
So that's the entire country. There are 206 children.

49
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:11,350
So in order to do a bigger study using a prospective cohort or retrospective correlate things like the whole world.

50
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,479
So like this is an example of an extremely rare but extremely rare.

51
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:23,350
So when it has be extremely rare, you just have to start with the case control and give up and you will do anything

52
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,470
like perspective and longitudinal just because of the incredible rarity of it.

53
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,090
And in infectious disease epidemiology, the case control.

54
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:39,370
This is why you see this. We see a report of something interesting and then we immediately go to a case control next because there's always

55
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:46,810
this there we always have we often we often have this tension between a very common virus and a very rare outcome.

56
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:54,510
And so case control becomes usually your next step in infectious organs.

57
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:02,580
So. All right.

58
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:13,680
So now you've got a case control study that has ants asking this question and filling out the cells in this to Beijing table.

59
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,780
So my question for you is who?

60
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,210
Okay, so you're going to identify cases.

61
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:30,480
Everybody got their identified cases of hepatitis and find out whether or not they have no virus and how who was who goes here?

62
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,610
Who do you test for? And a virus that does not have hepatitis.

63
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,520
How would you find them? So there are a lot of different strategies and different groups.

64
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:45,540
I wanted to talk about. All of the strategies were right.

65
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,370
So don't hesitate to tell me what your strategy works. They're just different.

66
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:07,870
He said, we're going to get the hospital because so a lot of groups have hospital controls, which means you find another child.

67
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:15,220
I would assume you would like for another child of a similar age who's hospitalized for something other than hepatitis.

68
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:26,680
There is. So that is definitely one strategy, because you're assuming that these children are hospitalized as well.

69
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,790
What are some worries? What are some things that could go wrong with that strategy?

70
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:45,490
Like how much do we think that this population, this hyper personalized, hepatitis negative population,

71
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:54,580
reflects the source population from which these adenoviruses associated hepatitis cases are rising?

72
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:03,030
So these hospitalized kids all have something else going on with them. They all have some other sort of disease or condition.

73
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:14,520
Right. So they may not be they may be kind of more or less reflective of if you think about like the whole U.S. population of children.

74
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,880
Very small, specialized subgroup of them are going to be eligible to enter into your control group.

75
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:26,250
So you could also think about having a strategy to identify community controls

76
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,190
that would have been tested for some other reason or go get them tested,

77
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:39,779
you know, truly to figure out if how prevalent you really want to find out how prevalent is have the virus in the

78
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:45,360
general population of children that have no disease going on to try to benchmark what you're seeing.

79
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:53,160
So you could also go get go recruit a bunch of age. So that is most.

80
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,910
Now, most fellow citizens are probably going to use hospital as controls.

81
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,319
Epidemiologically, it's not the best idea, but it's the most feasible idea.

82
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,460
And it's the one that, like all clinician epidemiologists at a hospital, straight, go straight.

83
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:13,799
But I just wanted you to remember that giving community controls, it's an it was a really good strategy for for really trying to answer it.

84
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,070
Phil, is that new to this comparison book?

85
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:30,210
So one of the groups I appreciated, they really highlighted the fact that they looked for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the blood.

86
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:38,310
Now, how I want how does that fit into this question right here?

87
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:44,339
How would you take your causal question in a state that incorporates SARS-CoV-2?

88
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,660
And I don't know if somebody from that group wants to talk about what they were thinking. I actually don't remember which group it was.

89
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,640
If anybody else wants to do a job. Stephen King that raises.

90
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:14,730
But in determining what you we want to try to restate this this causal association in light of the fact that some of these kids have had SARS-CoV-2,

91
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:20,810
some of them have it. We want to understand what that relationship is. What are some things we would want to understand about that relationship?

92
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,930
Just take it out of take your mind out of the dark world.

93
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:34,080
And just in words, what are some things that could be important by the fact could be important about the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is around?

94
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:44,560
You think the big things like the possibility of co-infection with both, which could potentially lead to a more severe outcome with hepatitis?

95
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,560
Yeah. So I think that co-infection.

96
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:59,530
So I think changing this to be antivirus, almost adding an exposure group have a C antivirus plus SARS-CoV-2 is the way to think about that.

97
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,570
I think another thing that's sort of inherent in what you're saying, though,

98
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:12,010
sort of changing the risk of severe outcome wouldn't necessarily require theoretically, wouldn't necessarily require co-infection.

99
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:23,080
It could be a sequential infection. It could be if you had a C to a virus.

100
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,560
Does this change the relationship of hepatitis now?

101
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,540
What would that what would you call that?

102
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:39,310
In epidemiology world, we have a third factor that's fundamentally changing the relationship between our exposure and our outcome.

103
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,840
Those of you that are having a 600 exam seven, what is that called effect modification?

104
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:55,540
Yes. So actually what that four did that was talking about SC two, they were actually talking about evaluating effect modification in their right.

105
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:06,970
So where you're going to do is you're going to ask the question among people that have had a history of people that are SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive,

106
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:15,970
what is this relationship look like? And then look at the relationship again among people who are antibody negative.

107
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:22,209
And you can also do that by virtue of doing regression and evaluating the interaction

108
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:28,660
term between SARS-CoV-2 and what where are you going to be multiplying your regression?

109
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:39,130
Course your main exposure and your model, the amount of time.

110
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,450
So. Right.

111
00:13:46,890 --> 00:14:00,120
With this, I want to just point out, start to notice that this study is using blood samples to do their PCR surveillance for other virus.

112
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,640
And it's because they are looking for my roommate adenovirus.

113
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,730
They're looking for a virus infection of that high, the quantities that you're able to pick it up in the blood.

114
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,780
Different viruses have different viremia patterns.

115
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,740
Not all viruses have a lot of viremia.

116
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:24,750
And viremia shedding through things like the stool or the respiratory tract usually lasts longer than your nails.

117
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,760
So for to assess SARS-CoV-2 question, you actually need to be looking at antibodies.

118
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,860
I wouldn't be looking for the virus itself using. So.

119
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:39,340
All right. Any questions about that?

120
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,700
To the discussion. Okay. Excellent. Well, some really good, really good answers.

121
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:56,520
Through that. Right.

122
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:08,500
Three rerecordings today because I'm going to. Well, maybe I'll just. As much as the all scares me.

123
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:18,380
That's all right. So I am going to be helpful if you could see.

124
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,720
So I'm going to end talking about worker pox viruses.

125
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:29,150
I specifically wanted to end talking about smallpox so we could end on a success story.

126
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:39,739
We'll end on a whim. But then talk a little bit about how what we know about smallpox and about what we know about viruses in general.

127
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:46,610
Some of the open questions around impacts that I want you to kind of take away from from the lecture.

128
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,680
And then that's what we. Yeah, so.

129
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:03,520
So I used to teach this as part of when I used to teach 605 the infectious diseases class as an example of eradication.

130
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:09,850
Anything. You know, sometimes we get confused talking about the difference between eradication and elimination.

131
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:19,030
They seem like they're the same word, but they're not. Eradication means global.

132
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:23,560
Elimination means the virus has left the surface of the earth.

133
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:29,620
We do not have it anymore. And local eradication?

134
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:34,149
Eradication, we usually term it as elimination.

135
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:41,410
We've eliminated it in an area. But when we eradicate it, we try to we try to reserve that for kind of total global eradication.

136
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:51,190
The eradication technically is defined as purposeful reduction of specific disease prevalence to the point of continued absence of transmission.

137
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:55,330
And so you have to maintain zero for a while before you can say that you have

138
00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:00,340
eradication within a specific area by a means of a time limited campaign.

139
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:10,570
So one of the key elements of eradication is if you were to stop doing what you're doing, the disease won't come back.

140
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:17,920
Theoretically now we've never seen we've only twice successfully done this smallpox and rinderpest.

141
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,380
Right. So and I'm not going to teach you about Rinderpest today, but maybe such.

142
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:33,040
So the so think about actually has a for this morning would were announcements from China about changes to their ZERO-COVID policy.

143
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:40,540
Now that doesn't mean what we call an eradication strategy because you stop doing what you're doing, you're going to start to have more cases.

144
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,510
Right. So it's it's more of a like a changing and eliminate.

145
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,380
But reducing an elimination strategy is what we would call that.

146
00:17:49,230 --> 00:18:00,430
So as I mentioned the put a permanent reduction to zero in worldwide incidence and intervention measures are no longer needed.

147
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,050
Once you reach eradication so that you reach eradication, you don't have to do anything.

148
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:18,620
So when can a disease be eradicated? Now it's a mixture of biologic factors, socio social factors, economic factors.

149
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,880
You both need this baseline, biologic and technical feasibility.

150
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,000
You need a pathogen that actually can be eradicated.

151
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:35,000
So the environmental or animal reservoir either has to be nonexistent or it has to be something that you are able to eliminate.

152
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:41,660
So with Rinderpest, there was an animal reservoir, but we were able to eliminate the infection within the animal reservoir.

153
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:47,090
And then you have to have control techniques that work to actually do the eradication.

154
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,810
An example of a virus that does not have an animal reservoir is influenza B.

155
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:59,809
We do not identified a viable animal reservoir for influenza B and remember,

156
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:04,280
really early in the semester I mentioned that we might have accidentally eradicated

157
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,630
the B Yamagata strain of influenza B because nobody can find it anymore.

158
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,850
And one of the reasons that is theoretically possible is that there is no animal reservoir.

159
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:22,430
So there is often this is often a very expensive and it's a globally coordinated campaign.

160
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:29,000
When we talked about polio and everything that's been going has been challenging with the polio eradication campaign,

161
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,810
a lot of it comes down to do you have public and political support,

162
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:39,770
not just globally, but do you have public and political support in each individual area where eradication efforts need to happen?

163
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:46,100
And then the second piece are cost benefit aspects is a very, very, very, very expensive efforts.

164
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,430
And so you need alignment of resources to be able to do that.

165
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:56,620
Yeah. So I'm just a little confused. Polio is considered eradicated, right?

166
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:03,790
So polio, too, was one of the subtypes of polio was considered eradicated.

167
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:13,180
The other one, the other subtypes still had additional. Well, it was it was considered like moving towards eradication.

168
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:21,640
The other subtypes had not yet been eradicated. So it's sort of like we were kind of mid campaign to try to get there only we were first.

169
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:29,590
So for polio to to truly be eradicated, we need it removed from the vaccine which everybody intended to do.

170
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:34,840
And then you need it to have sustained zero transmission in the absence of the intervention.

171
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:41,140
So that's where it failed. So in the absence of the intervention, that would be like people not getting vaccinated.

172
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:46,240
Right. Right. So we couldn't say it's eradicated now because there are cases.

173
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:51,820
Yeah. Now because a lot of the cases are vaccine derived.

174
00:20:51,820 --> 00:21:01,810
It does mess with the definition a little bit. Right. But there is point is and it is also, you know, it's like the subtype you'll see with smallpox.

175
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:09,069
All smallpox was eradicated. This is a subtype, you know, different training of different of trying to get rid of individual subtypes.

176
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,540
It's much more.

177
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:24,170
So here are some past endeavors of the disease eradication, yellow fever, the very long eradication campaign lasting all the way to 1977.

178
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:34,370
It did not work, and it was a largely around vector vector elimination or vector control strategies for mosquito control strategies.

179
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:43,680
We talked a bit about some of the some of the products that were being used, didn't have longevity in terms of being environmentally tolerable.

180
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,360
And so yellow fever eradication failed yours.

181
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:52,340
This is a bacteria yaws eradication.

182
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,440
It was interesting that it failed. It's been revived.

183
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:01,379
It really is mass administration of antibiotics in affected areas.

184
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:07,470
And it's probably fairly feasible if there could be enough kind of political and economic support behind it.

185
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,169
Malaria, that was a official eradication campaign which failed.

186
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:19,650
That's actually the basis for the formation of the CDC, was that they were supposed to run the malaria eradication campaign.

187
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,379
It didn't work. And but smallpox worked in Rinderpest.

188
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:31,530
Where it. All right. So here is a picture of some people with smallpox.

189
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:42,150
Smallpox. A few of the important things to know about smallpox so far, but it was about 100%.

190
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,960
If we start to talk about the symptomatic fraction is 100%.

191
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:52,740
So almost everybody gets clinical disease if they get infected with very little asymptomatic disease.

192
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,500
The you have both rapid spread, but you also had fomite spread,

193
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,360
particularly when there is contact or fomite contact, drug contact for my contact with lesions.

194
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:11,690
And then here are the the list of symptoms that you would have with small pox and a very high case fatality rate.

195
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:22,180
So the case fatality rate of up to 30%. Here are the countries that as of 1967 where eradication efforts really took off.

196
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,070
These are the countries that had endemic smallpox.

197
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,560
So the eradication strategy started with a mass vaccination step strategy.

198
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,629
Now, the mass vaccination strategy was not successful,

199
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:47,530
partially because you need really 100% coverage of smallpox vaccine in order to do full eradication.

200
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:54,430
And even if you get to that, that 80, 95%, you were still having these pockets of transmission happening.

201
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,220
Also, it was just phenomenally expensive to do mass vaccination everywhere that was being targeted.

202
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:05,290
And then there were vaccine production issues as well.

203
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:14,080
So vaccine pipeline issues. And so in 1966, there was this shift to what's called a surveillance containment strategy.

204
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:23,230
Some of this is going to kind of probably reflect true and sort of some of the things that you've seen in the last couple of years in the pandemic.

205
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,960
And but there are kind of critical differences that you'll you'll notice, too.

206
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,170
So they shift to a surveillance containment strategy.

207
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:40,340
So a surveillance containment strategy also, this is all the vaccination component is called ring vaccination.

208
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,840
We talked about ring vaccination with some of the Ebola stuff that we talked about.

209
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,189
But you do active case spending, you do isolation of the cases.

210
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:57,579
And then here's the critical thing. You actually vaccinate everybody in the surrounding area of the case back in the day before.

211
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:02,420
SARS-CoV-2 is as transmissible as it is, and it is still a little bit of a lower RTI.

212
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:10,030
There was actually this was discussed as a potential feasible goal for public health that we would

213
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:16,149
have areas that would have high SARS-CoV-2 when we had them in the very beginning or we had very hot,

214
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:22,059
spotty outbreaks. So you'd have like Grand Rapids would have a lot of cases and then it would stop and then Holland would have a lot of cases.

215
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:29,500
And then you could actually prob try to use community level surveillance containment to try to deliver vaccine.

216
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:40,120
And it's still like it is an underlying theme in some efforts, but obviously it's not going to be as effective as it was for smallpox.

217
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:49,010
So evolution of vaccination tools really was necessary to be able to support

218
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,330
something as nimble and flexible as a surveillance containment strategy requires.

219
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:58,670
So the original vaccination tool was the project injector.

220
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:05,690
So it comes in this big box. You put the box on the ground, you put up this kind of like pump handle,

221
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:12,770
and you use your foot to pump up the jet injector to get enough pressure in the injector.

222
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,000
And then you put the that this device on the arm.

223
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,049
And you do because smallpox has to be delivered, intradermal has to be delivered into the skin layer.

224
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,480
It can't be like an injection into the muscle.

225
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:33,170
And it's your muscle injection like we use with other vaccines. So in order for that to happen, yes, they're carrying around the specs.

226
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:37,940
Every every dose they're getting, they're pumping it up and then they're like administering like that.

227
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,270
Also, this kind of just looks scary, right? Like, look at that.

228
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:47,360
So what changed was the development of the Viper.

229
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:53,389
Figured I forget a needle eradication would not have happened without the introduction of the bifurcating needle.

230
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:57,799
This is sort of like one of the most one of the easiest,

231
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:04,220
technologically simple technological advances to change the history of the world with a needle, with a little space in it.

232
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:15,020
Right. And the space is calibrated so that it picks up exactly the right amount in the drop that it holds is exactly the right amount of antigen.

233
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:20,660
And you use that to poke the antigen into the skin layer rather than using this big thing.

234
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:25,129
Now, this is like incredibly portable. Right. Just get one of these needles out to places.

235
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:28,330
And it's also incredibly easy to administer.

236
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:37,700
So this is also where we start to see this idea of training community health workers to do broad, broad, nimble strategies of response.

237
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,870
Right. So so that's another kind of key element of the surveillance containment.

238
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:49,410
So in actually kind of going back to here, one of these posters from these surveillance containment things.

239
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,770
Surveillance, the active case detection is super important.

240
00:27:54,770 --> 00:28:02,960
And you had to make it worthwhile for because obviously because there's an isolation strategy that comes with starting to identify cases.

241
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,450
You can see we saw this play out in the US.

242
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:11,400
You know, people are not going to want to tell you when they have smallpox, but you have to know early because you got to bring the resources in.

243
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:17,030
And so they they were really heavily incentivizing, not reporting people,

244
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:25,970
but reporting that there was a case in your area so they can bring in the the ring vaccination.

245
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:41,940
So smallpox in the 20th century is estimated to have been responsible for between 300 and 500 million deaths in 1967 alone.

246
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,430
It was estimated to be responsible for 15 million cases and 2 million deaths.

247
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:54,919
And by 1975, not even less than ten years later, we the last naturally occurring case,

248
00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:05,780
a very major and the last case of smallpox in general is believed to be detected in 1977 to 10 years later.

249
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:14,740
So ten years really was a ten year long campaign for complete eradication.

250
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:20,240
And this is a virus where all of the variables were lining up to be able to eradicate this.

251
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:28,860
And here is the WTO eradication announcement that came out in May to it is very dramatic.

252
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:34,530
The WTO declared solemnly the world and its people have won freedom from smallpox.

253
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:40,110
So an inspiring quote.

254
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:44,190
All right. So here are the key here, the reasons this was possible.

255
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:49,920
One, the vaccine effectiveness, the smallpox vaccine is very, very good.

256
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:56,069
Remember I said that the vaccine effectiveness, essentially, if you take that herd immunity back of the envelope calculation,

257
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:59,070
your vaccine effectiveness has to be higher than the herd immunity threshold.

258
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,390
So you have a very high vaccine effectiveness.

259
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:11,160
They were able, especially through surveillance, containment, they're able to do a high proportion of vaccination in the population,

260
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,610
particularly when you had cases that needed to be contained.

261
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:21,120
They could get complete coverage of the population in that in that particular network.

262
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,110
Right. Incredibly genetically stable virus.

263
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:32,090
So once they made a vaccine, that was the only vaccine they had they had to make because it's a pox virus.

264
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:39,120
Virus, very stable. There was no animal, whereas viral vector cases were easily identifiable.

265
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:45,720
And this is twofold. One is it was a very characteristic disease.

266
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,950
You don't often have smallpox, but think you might have something else.

267
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:54,070
You don't have smallpox and be like, oh, maybe just a cold. Like, it was definitely.

268
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,560
And remember, I mentioned that almost nobody was asymptomatic.

269
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,180
So if there are cases, they literally had a sign on their face saying that they were a case.

270
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:08,880
Right. And so it was very, very easily easy to identify people and to do this ring vaccination strategy.

271
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:16,980
The transmission is actually relatively inefficient compared to some of the viruses we really wish we could eradicate.

272
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:25,500
And so that meant that the herd immunity threshold came down and was easier to exceed with the vaccination efforts.

273
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:33,479
Here is a big kicker. People were not contagious until they were symptomatic and they had a rash.

274
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,430
And at that point they were generically bedridden. So they were symptomatic.

275
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:44,070
They would actually self isolate because of the effects of the disease before they were transmitting it to other people.

276
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,540
This is a big flip of some of the other viruses that we deal with.

277
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:55,080
Right. They're actually already knowing that they shouldn't be circulating in the general population before they were infectious to other people.

278
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:00,210
And then also, seasonality helped because there was clear seasonality.

279
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:05,730
Once the world understood seasonality, they could prioritize resources in advance,

280
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:11,520
saying these months we have to be here, these months we have to be here. And it was that that was helpful.

281
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:20,729
So if you go through this list, kind of pick your favorite virus that you wish you could eradicate and think about.

282
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,870
I mean, I've been asked so many times when we're going to eradicate COVID.

283
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:31,250
So let's just talk about SARS-CoV-2. Right. The vaccine that very, very efficacious.

284
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:36,899
I mean, it's it's it's markedly reducing infection, death and hospitalization.

285
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,330
But it's not going to it's not an eradication strategy.

286
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:47,790
There's a high there's not a hyper person's in 5% of people who a booster and it's not genetically stable.

287
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:57,470
There's this is going rather badly but there is a clear many animal vectors, including deer, like all of the deer, in fact, in Michigan are infected.

288
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,700
So that's not going to be easily identifiable cases. No.

289
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,000
I've been sick three times. I thought it was COVID every time and it was all these other different viruses.

290
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:11,610
Right. It gets confused with other viruses, relatively inefficient transmission.

291
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:15,450
That's not true. People are not contagious until they are symptomatic.

292
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:23,580
Never been better. This this is the problem with the first six months of public health pandemic response for the COVID 19 pandemic.

293
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:32,250
The fact that you could be transmissible not just for a day or two, like with flu or with RSV, but for weeks before you get symptoms.

294
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:38,920
That was bizarre. And really, I think that was really like a fundamental myth.

295
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:46,380
We have not seen viruses act like that in the past and that was like a fundamental surprise that really threw out the playbook.

296
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,400
So and then and maybe look at the seasonality.

297
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:54,480
I think we've got one good one out of the list working in our favor.

298
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:58,799
So you can see why it's so hard to eradicate and eradicate a virus.

299
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:11,250
But maybe I'm not big. I know. But but but we did one that was so find another virus that rinderpest and then finally, you know,

300
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:16,229
but sort of this is the the mental model you want to think through when you're sort

301
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:20,880
of thinking about what what levers that you have to control the virus and how.

302
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,879
What else should be added to that eradication list?

303
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:30,430
And you can see how polio doesn't meet all of these and some of the challenges we are seeing with the polio campaign,

304
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:41,739
because asymptomatic transmission is one of them. But but, you know, it's a very genetically stable virus, very efficacious vaccine.

305
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:46,420
So you have some of these things kind of put polio on the list for candidates for indication.

306
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:56,110
However, the caveat to smallpox is that now remember, when we tried to get rid of polio type two,

307
00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:01,750
there was also this effort to get rid of it from the vaccine and to eliminate it from the freezers of the world.

308
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,860
We don't actually have political access to all of the freezers of the world.

309
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,280
So is smallpox actually gone?

310
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:16,810
It is to some degree an open question. And but it is it is you know, it doesn't cause clinical disease.

311
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:23,350
Is it somewhere where there could be an accident or an act of aggression involving smallpox?

312
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:30,610
Probably. And now, you know, now we've got the technology to just send our sequence and make, you know, make a virus where we couldn't before.

313
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:34,600
So I always reason for vigilance.

314
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:41,349
So as we expand what we know, I want to end on impact.

315
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:46,570
So we started to span what we know from smallpox to impacts,

316
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:56,560
sort of that's kind of the next the sort of the next era of this or the viruses story that we've just entered in now.

317
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:05,890
So we've got kind of a similar incubation period, a similar presentation for you about pro drone with lesions.

318
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:17,110
And we've got the your kind of standard viral clinical characteristics and then very similar look to the lesions for anthrax versus smallpox.

319
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:24,219
Now if you look at a website that has not been updated, I have a small soapbox to give to about that.

320
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,380
But if you look in the website, there's not been updated.

321
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:40,580
The it will say that smallpox is the primary kind of clinical orthodox viruses and these others are reserved for largely animal.

322
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:45,729
You know, they have animal reservoirs and they have animal you know,

323
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:52,570
they are largely meant to be animal viruses with occasional spillover outbreaks in humans.

324
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,260
That is no longer the case dealt with with anthrax.

325
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,510
And then here's some current details about the lesions right here.

326
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:10,959
So before I forget my soapbox about that, to remind me to tell you about myself afterwards, it so maps history.

327
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,320
So it was first identified in 1870.

328
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,720
It was actually identified during during smallpox eradication campaigns.

329
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:26,410
There was so much look for PAX like illnesses that this other virus was identified as part of those.

330
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:35,170
There were sporadic cases, some continued outbreaks in the DRC, throughout central West Africa since the seventies.

331
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:44,919
There are there were a few cases in the United States in 2003 because of the importation of poached animals into

332
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:51,790
the US and actually spread to a couple of people that handled animals and then to the contacts of those people.

333
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:59,830
But then the most recent major outbreak prior to the current one was in 2000 1718.

334
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:05,320
There was a large outbreak in Nigeria that had linked cases in the UK, Israel and Singapore.

335
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:10,060
So some travel associated cases in 2022.

336
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,300
Now what we have now is a multi-country outbreak.

337
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:23,379
You know, it does appear from patterns that travel is probably some part of the initiation and the spread of like the acceleration of this outbreak.

338
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:28,300
But it is not clear travel. Where were you? And it probably never will be.

339
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:36,550
So there is it is pretty certain that there is an animal reservoir.

340
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:42,580
It is not yet determined who the reservoir or which animal population is the reservoir.

341
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:48,250
There's not a clear answer for that yet, but that is what's leading to the sporadic do not a transmission.

342
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:58,180
You may have some human to human transmission in people living at that animal human interface and then you can have you.

343
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:01,690
Now we're having this acceleration of increased human to human transmission.

344
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:08,829
Now, this bottom line here is just sort of representing what I've mentioned before,

345
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:15,940
that there was this animal importation with in the US that caused a small outbreak.

346
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:29,930
So there's been some there's this great review paper, if you're interested, that just came out a few weeks ago and it's lined up.

347
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:36,830
What was classically understood about impacts and what is now kind of the characteristics of impacts.

348
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:41,510
So it is less geographically limited.

349
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:50,690
It is, you know, in communities that were having sporadic outbreaks that were likely outbreaks linked to this animal human interface,

350
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:55,370
you were seeing a lot of outbreaks affecting children and young adults.

351
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:02,460
Now we do have this circulation and we see a lot of circulation in young men who have sex with men.

352
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:07,850
It doesn't mean that it's specifically as it's still a contact,

353
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:14,930
contact and fomite mediated transmission largely through little, you know, the ability to transmit versus droplets.

354
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:22,579
But we don't think that's a major transmission, though. And but it's likely, as we sort of learned with HIV,

355
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:32,450
it's likely that that's moving through these social networks more than it's a particular it's particularly linked to sexual activity.

356
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:41,690
So, you know, kind of a continuation of sustained human to human transmission being observed.

357
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:50,750
And then the incubation and prodromal stage is we're getting a little bit more description of that, remember,

358
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,430
and the bottom and we sort of have actually these clades are all being renamed by numbers and not by places, which is great.

359
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:09,349
But remember, I've talked about a few other viruses as viruses are first either first discovered or you're first having these limited outbreaks,

360
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:13,249
but you're seeing these clusters, your case fatality rate is going to be incredibly,

361
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:17,840
incredibly high because you're not really if you're only going in when you think there's an outbreak,

362
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:23,180
you're not really getting a full sense of everybody that's infected as we've started to do more and more surveillance.

363
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,840
The case fatality rate we would expect to drop and it is dropping.

364
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:34,939
It is dropping a lot, though. And so this is going to kind of lead to this open question of whether this virus is

365
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:40,670
fundamentally different in some ways than the viruses that we saw clusters of before.

366
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:46,620
So here's the distribution of international cases per the W.H.O.

367
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,870
Remember, at this stage in a pandemic, there's going to be a huge surveillance bias.

368
00:41:51,350 --> 00:42:00,200
And what you're seeing here but in the United States, it's interesting that there is a peak and we're definitely seeing things come down now.

369
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:05,830
Straight intervention strategies, there's treatment strategies, there's isolation and then revaccination.

370
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:11,960
So both vaccination of high risk people, but then also great vaccination is being used for this.

371
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,680
As you look at the the outbreak. R.

372
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,640
T It's actually dropped produce. It's usually here in the U.S.

373
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,020
So open questions.

374
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:38,110
One is infectivity higher in this outbreak than previous outbreaks, or did we just not fully understand the infectivity of impacts before?

375
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,610
So what kinds of things what kind of things can we do to answer?

376
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:50,940
How would you you are you are the the head of a major a major public health organization.

377
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,690
And the president is just asking this question, what are the kinds of things you could do to answer this question?

378
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:03,830
In fact. What is the true infectivity?

379
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:33,770
So I'm going to give you a clue. Let's see where we look to infected people for Ebola.

380
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:36,800
So in Ebola,

381
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:46,580
we started with a we looked up some papers that talked about starting with clusters of people where they identified a first person that's infected.

382
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And they're looking at everybody in the household with Ebola and looking at risk factors for getting infected with that other from the other person.

383
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:00,290
You can do the you know, you have to do this in a household. You can do this in other types of networks as well.

384
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:06,410
So you could find a network where there is one known infection. And then you've got documented contacts with that person.

385
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:12,770
And how many of those contacts are getting infected? And those types of studies we would do to try to get at infectivity.

386
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:27,510
So here is here is a hypothesis that has been circulating that I think is very intriguing with very with not a lot of support.

387
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:33,469
So what is the impact of declining smallpox immunity that might have provided

388
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,790
cross-protection against and by since have access for several further pox viruses?

389
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:46,790
Is the fact that we had been widely using a smallpox vaccine until fairly recently and then we stopped using it?

390
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:52,699
Does it mean that there were some level of protective antibodies in the population that

391
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:58,550
was allowing this that was kind of stemming the ability for this emergence to happen?

392
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:05,660
That might have changed. And does anybody have any ideas about what types of things they can do to try to get at this question?

393
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:09,020
Give me, like four grand ideas in case you want to get vaccinated.

394
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,720
Yeah, I think older population is still.

395
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:22,930
Yes, you could do it based on vaccination history. You could also do sero surveys as well.

396
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:30,530
And especially I'm thinking back to like those HIV zero surveys that we read the paper about to define which groups

397
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:36,260
of the population we think still have antibodies and then overlay that on top of the study that you've described.

398
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,280
You can add more more robustness to it.

399
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:55,090
What is vaccine effectiveness overall and what is the effectiveness of ring vaccination versus mass vaccination against masks?

400
00:45:56,050 --> 00:46:03,340
And so this really is getting at and we didn't do any direct, indirect and indirect effect studies.

401
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:10,990
I don't think in this class, but this is really getting at this idea of how do you measure direct protection and indirect protection.

402
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:19,100
So direct protection is how protected are you if you are vaccinated against an orthodox virus and then you get exposed to anthrax?

403
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:23,030
Indirect protection is how protected?

404
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:25,389
It's a it's a riff on herd immunity.

405
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:32,590
How protected are you by living if you are living in a heavily vaccinated network, very heavily vaccinated population.

406
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:41,290
And so you can do that by really just comparing, you know, one community to another community to sort of seeing based on vaccination rates.

407
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:48,970
And however you define community, there's a lot of variation there. How does vaccination rate correlate to protection?

408
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:57,730
Oh, and actually they took that back. We did. This would be very similar to the studies on HPV vaccine in genital warts.

409
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:03,910
Same same kind of pattern today with this. All right.

410
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:09,700
Any questions? All right. Those are some books.

411
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:19,830
Oh, yes. Thank you. Oh, so every year I do a lot of my slides have data from 2016 and 17.

412
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:27,340
And I swear it's not because I didn't update them this year. Every year I go back and I pull the most recent surveillance data from the

413
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:31,990
last year to update my slides right before I post the slides on the website.

414
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:40,479
And obviously I haven't had this class in two years. The data is exactly the same as the last time I taught this class.

415
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:46,810
For almost every lecture, like the surveillance world for virology has been gutted.

416
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:52,990
So I am hoping I am trained you to the point where you can go out there and start to fill these holes because

417
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:56,710
there are all these important viruses out there that are doing things that we're not watching right now.

418
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:01,580
So I just wanted to point that out. Like, there's a lot of there.

419
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,900
There's work to be done. So I hope I hope you already do that.

420
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:12,610
And they also I just wanted to close quickly with saying, you know, I actually came to this class with a little bit of nerves.

421
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:19,670
I have a time almost every semester since 2008, so not teaching for two years and then coming back, I was little,

422
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:26,440
especially teaching about virology in the middle of a pandemic seemed like a big ask and it has been a

423
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:31,120
wonderful experience and I really appreciate how engaged and how wonderful you've been to work with.

424
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:35,559
So thank you for giving me a soft landing time back to the department.

425
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:41,350
So good luck on your exams. I look forward to reading your papers and have a wonderful break.

426
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:42,190
Thank you.
