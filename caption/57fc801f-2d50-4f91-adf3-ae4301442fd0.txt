1
00:00:02,885 --> 00:00:13,655
This is the lecture that did not get recorded on last last week, and it is on laboratory detection and identification epidemiology of mycobacteria.

2
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:18,935
And as it says on the first slide, many of these slides were donated to me by a dear friend.

3
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:23,705
Dr. Gerri Hall was the director of the microbiology laboratories at Cleveland Clinic.

4
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:32,195
Unfortunately, she had an early demise due to cancer, but before that happened, she donated all these slides to me.

5
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:35,425
So going on to the next slide?

6
00:00:35,425 --> 00:00:45,235
So this is I always keep this picture in my talks on mycobacteria, this is what tuberculosis was like before the age of antibiotics.

7
00:00:45,235 --> 00:00:51,955
It was when there was no therapy except the rest cure for people who had tuberculosis.

8
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:59,065
So here is an anxious mother or aunt, or even a maybe a grandmother waiting to see what is going to happen to her loved one,

9
00:00:59,065 --> 00:01:02,935
but probably knowing what will happen next slide.

10
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:12,415
So we thought we had cured tuberculosis. We didn't have any problems with it until it came back and it came back.

11
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:19,785
TB why it's back? Well, it was back because of increasing antimicrobial resistance in tuberculosis.

12
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:26,115
Next slide. So what are our responsibilities as clinical microbiologists?

13
00:01:26,115 --> 00:01:33,945
What in Michael Bacteriology? Well, we have to determine how much afier acid fast bacilli testing is appropriate for our facility.

14
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:39,795
And if you don't do all of it, you need to send your specimens out to another laboratory.

15
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:46,005
If you don't do susceptibility testing or to another laboratory, if you don't do complete identifications.

16
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:56,345
Excuse me. We need to understand what methods are available for direct detection of tuberculosis and when should they be used.

17
00:01:56,345 --> 00:02:06,155
We need to process acceptable specimens as rapidly as possible, and that usually means within 24 hours of obtaining the specimen,

18
00:02:06,155 --> 00:02:12,695
we have to use broth culture media in addition to solid culture media, to decrease the time to recovery.

19
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:17,555
We have to identify M. tuberculosis as quickly as possible,

20
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:25,805
and that generally means within two 24 hours of identifying acid fast bacilli in a in a specimen,

21
00:02:25,805 --> 00:02:31,145
we need to be able to do a molecular test to say whether or not it's in tuberculosis.

22
00:02:31,145 --> 00:02:39,335
We also have to be able to detect possible resistance to antimicrobial resistance to TB as rapidly as possible.

23
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:43,325
And it's very clearly it's known that more many,

24
00:02:43,325 --> 00:02:52,385
many laboratories that can identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis and do Michael Bacteriology do not do the susceptibility testing for these isolates.

25
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:59,045
And then the isolate would have to be sent to a reference lab or to your local public health laboratory for that test.

26
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:05,795
And then, of course, identify Mott's appropriately. And Mott's are mycobacteria other than typical tuberculosis.

27
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:14,705
So the mass of the organisms that we used to call atypical mycobacteria, and of course, we need to detect resistance when indicated.

28
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:37,155
Next slide. So some general considerations about Mycobacterium these are aerobic, non modal nonperforming bacilli, meaning, of course, the rods.

29
00:03:37,155 --> 00:03:43,065
The cell wall contains a high content of lipid and those lipids are called McCulloch acids.

30
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:47,395
And these are what caused the mycobacteria to be acid fast.

31
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:56,715
They bind with basic dyes, which is the function in the APHIS smears that makes de colorization very, very difficult.

32
00:03:56,715 --> 00:04:03,195
They are gram positive and they're not gram negative, but they are gram positive. But because of their mycology acids, they're very,

33
00:04:03,195 --> 00:04:14,565
very difficult to stain with Graham S. So most once we know we have an acid fast bacillus, we generally don't do a gram stain on it.

34
00:04:14,565 --> 00:04:19,995
So we have a classic classification of Mycobacterium species, and as you know,

35
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:27,675
everything has changed in the last several years because of molecular techniques, but this has stayed just about the same way it was.

36
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:33,105
We have tuberculosis complex and there are other acid fast bacilli, N.M. tuberculosis complex.

37
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:36,975
Besides MTB, so AM Bovis is in there and some other ones.

38
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:42,555
But then we have the Runnion classification, and Dr Runnion was an infectious diseases physician,

39
00:04:42,555 --> 00:04:48,565
actually a pulmonologist who specialized in mycobacteria and these are called they can be called.

40
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:58,135
The Runnion classification also be called looking for moths mycobacteria other than typical tuberculosis or NTM non tuberculosis mycobacteria.

41
00:04:58,135 --> 00:05:02,235
So there's four groups in the running classification. We have Group one.

42
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:06,735
Those are the photo chroma genes and the photo curmudgeons grow up.

43
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:13,515
Buff colored initial isolates are both colored, but when exposed to light and then re incubated,

44
00:05:13,515 --> 00:05:17,595
they become the colonies become kind of an orange color group.

45
00:05:17,595 --> 00:05:19,065
Two are the Scottish chromatin said.

46
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:27,345
Here we think about Mycobacterium scrofula, cesium, and these isolates are always orange when they're first isolated on Augur and they stay always.

47
00:05:27,345 --> 00:05:31,335
That Orange Color Group three are the non chromosomes.

48
00:05:31,335 --> 00:05:37,275
They don't buff color, they don't have any color. They're very slowly growing mycobacteria.

49
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:43,185
And here M. Avium complex is is the key group of organisms in Group three.

50
00:05:43,185 --> 00:05:45,465
And then, of course, Group four are the rapid growers.

51
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:55,755
So instead of taking 12 days or so to see growth 12 to 20 days actually to see growth of M. avium complex in some other organisms in group three,

52
00:05:55,755 --> 00:06:04,815
the rabbit growers can be can grow much, much more rapidly, and you may see growth in four to six days, certainly in less than a week.

53
00:06:04,815 --> 00:06:13,035
And here are the one of the groups that we always talk about is Mycobacterium 04:02 Adam Complex going on to the next slide.

54
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:15,735
So non TB back to Michael bacteria,

55
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:23,595
the ATM's non-typical is mycobacteria or the Motts column what you want just so you know what you're talking about general characteristics.

56
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:32,775
They're present everywhere in the environment. They can be normal flora, on skin, on the respiratory tract, that GI tract and so on.

57
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:39,735
They can be acquired if they're not normal flora. They can be acquired by inhalation, ingestion or trauma.

58
00:06:39,735 --> 00:06:49,515
Someone having an accident out in the in the outside and there's their wound is infected with non tuberculous mycobacteria.

59
00:06:49,515 --> 00:06:55,155
So the running classification that I already talked about is based on phenotypic characteristics.

60
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:58,335
So we have for the chromatin signal above color, you expose them to light,

61
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:05,085
they turn yellowish orange scotto curmudgeons are always colonies are always orange colored, non chroma genes.

62
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:13,125
The colonies are kind of buff to a pale yellow. And then we have the rapid growers and there are various ski schemes for classification.

63
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:18,205
But most people use the running classification. Next slide.

64
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:22,795
So let's talk a little bit about slowly growing non tuberculous mycobacteria.

65
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:29,725
These, as I've already said, are classified based on ability to produce those orangish red or carotenoid pigments.

66
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:35,395
So we have photo curmudgeons and go to Cronje's, and the photo chromosomes are slowly growing.

67
00:07:35,395 --> 00:07:43,765
They produce pigment when exposed to light. I've already told you that so and here we have Mycobacterium maranon and Mycobacterium consortia.

68
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:48,445
These are two major pathogens that are in the photo chromosomes.

69
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:52,195
Then we have the Scotto chromosomes. These are Morsell. These are slowly growing.

70
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:56,155
Also, they produce pigment, whether they're in dark or light.

71
00:07:56,155 --> 00:08:00,985
And here we have the most well-known Scotto. Chromatin is actually a contaminant.

72
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:04,765
Most very rarely does it ever cause disease.

73
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:16,045
It's usually considered one of the non very has very little pathogenic pathogenic tick problems with Mycobacterium Gordon.

74
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:20,605
But it can cause disease if it gets into the right situation. But that does.

75
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:25,075
That happens very, very rarely. Next slide.

76
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:32,995
So then we have a non photo chromosomes, and here we think about Mycobacterium avium complex, also called mak mak bacterium avium complex.

77
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:39,715
Generally, we we think there are multiple species in here and the classification is very, very confusing.

78
00:08:39,715 --> 00:08:42,295
What about the epidemiology and pathogenesis?

79
00:08:42,295 --> 00:08:53,395
Well, this is a very, very important pathogen, both in immunocompromised persons and in immuno competent people.

80
00:08:53,395 --> 00:09:05,635
It is a major pathogen in persons who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus who have HIV, and it's everywhere in the environment.

81
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:10,255
What kind of diseases do these organisms cause? They cause pulmonary infections.

82
00:09:10,255 --> 00:09:19,285
They cause disseminated disease in that's disseminated disease can include blood bone marrow, the lungs, the liver, the lymph nodes.

83
00:09:19,285 --> 00:09:25,735
Various tissues throughout the body can be infected with these organisms.

84
00:09:25,735 --> 00:09:33,145
Next slide. So next, we're going to talk about the characteristics of the rapidly growing non tuberculous mycobacteria.

85
00:09:33,145 --> 00:09:43,225
So in these organisms, when there's some when they're grown on subculture colonies appear in seven days or less.

86
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:46,255
If it's a subculture from one culture to another culture,

87
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:53,335
so initial isolation may appear in in seven days or less and definitely less time if it's a subculture.

88
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:57,865
The initial isolation rate how rapidly it can be isolated is based on the initial.

89
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:05,545
If you've got a lot of organisms there, it will take less time to grow if there's only a few organisms that will take more time to grow.

90
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:14,365
And unlike other mycobacteria, they can grow on your routine bacterial logic media such as blood sugar and chocolate agar.

91
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:22,765
What about their epidemiology and pathogenesis? They can cause disease both in healthy people and in people who are immunocompromised.

92
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:29,875
As I said before, they are ubiquitous. They're everywhere in the environment, and they're also nosocomial pathogens.

93
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:37,765
There have been outbreaks associated with open heart surgery or wound infections, other skin and soft tissue infections.

94
00:10:37,765 --> 00:10:47,035
They can cause pulmonary infections in patients who have cystic fibrosis, and they can cause infections who in patients who have indwelling lines.

95
00:10:47,035 --> 00:10:53,245
What about the spectrum of disease due to the rapidly growing non tuberculous mycobacteria?

96
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:57,565
Well, we've already talked about they can cause wound infections,

97
00:10:57,565 --> 00:11:05,635
but then we have to consider the fact that one of the other non cultivator available mycobacteria is Mycobacterium leprae,

98
00:11:05,635 --> 00:11:10,855
and it causes leprosy or, as it is known now, Hansen's disease.

99
00:11:10,855 --> 00:11:19,825
There is no in vitro culture for this. For Mycobacterium Leppert, we cannot grow it in tubes with any type of culture media,

100
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:26,605
but it can be cultured in armadillos and mouse footpads, and I don't know who found all this out.

101
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:36,395
There is a PCR and amplified test, which is used to detect Mycobacterium leprae in tissues.

102
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:44,735
Do we have it in the United States? Yes, we do. It is rare in the United States, but there's approximately one million cases worldwide.

103
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:49,205
How is it transmitted, it's transmitted person to person through inhalation.

104
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:56,015
Somebody coughs and then somebody inhales the Mycobacterium leprae that have been exhaled

105
00:11:56,015 --> 00:12:01,655
through contact with skin lesions that can be discharged through nasal secretions.

106
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:10,325
The immune response controls the infection, as well as damages to skin and skin and nerves, so patients immune response is pretty good.

107
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:15,465
There will be less damage to the skin and nerves. If their immune response is not very well,

108
00:12:15,465 --> 00:12:21,485
it will be an overwhelming infection with overwhelming damage to skin and nerves and the damage to the skin and nerves,

109
00:12:21,485 --> 00:12:26,045
particularly to the nerves, results in sensory impairment.

110
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:30,875
So when we talk about leprosy, we have we know that there are two different types of leprosy.

111
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:37,175
We have tuberculosis, leprosy, which is localized infection, and we have La Providence leprosy,

112
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:41,795
which is disseminated and that is the worst form of leprosy.

113
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:46,865
Next slide. So now we're going to go back to M. Tuberculosis complex,

114
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:53,165
and because of our friends who do molecular microbiology and molecular testing we now

115
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:58,935
have and tuberculosis now has several isolates within the complex of M. tuberculosis.

116
00:12:58,935 --> 00:13:04,655
We have tuberculosis. We have M. Bovis subspecies bovis.

117
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:09,815
We have M. Bovis Subspecies Capri, and it was first isolated from deer.

118
00:13:09,815 --> 00:13:15,695
As you might expect with that name, Capri Bovis was known to previously be in cows.

119
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:21,815
We have Bovis BCG, which is our BCG that we use for various purposes,

120
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:30,595
including immunizing people with Mycobacterium Africanism Micro Canetti II and Panopto.

121
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:38,335
Going on. There are other non tuberculous mycobacteria that certainly need to be aware of them, many of them.

122
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:44,035
So in the rapid growers we have down here on the bottom underneath the line,

123
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:53,035
we have Mycobacterium 9:56 complex, Mycobacterium Saloni eye abscesses and mutagenic genica of above them.

124
00:13:53,035 --> 00:14:02,425
We have Mycobacterium M. CIMIC or Doni Zul Guy and SSI, Scrofula, eSIMs and o-P and Zenobia.

125
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:12,505
And then on the right hand side avium into cellulari Haemophilus Genovese slot them and also-rans and the

126
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:20,005
species that are above this line take a lot more time to grow than do the ones the rapid growth below the line.

127
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:29,455
Next slide. So there is a modified Runnion's scheme for characterizing and identifying mycobacteria,

128
00:14:29,455 --> 00:14:34,805
it's based on major phenotypic characteristics such as growth rate and pigmentation types.

129
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:42,625
So we have pigmented slow growers, non pigmented slow growers, we have pigmented rapid growers, non pigmented rapid growth.

130
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:46,435
And then those isolates are solely isolated from the environment.

131
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:51,625
They don't cause human infection. And this was all published by Dr Tortola in 2003.

132
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:56,185
Include micro reviews. Next slide.

133
00:14:56,185 --> 00:15:03,145
So let's talk a little bit about Mycobacterium avium complex. This is a renowned group three organism.

134
00:15:03,145 --> 00:15:11,755
It is the most common non tuberculosis organism, a group of organisms responsible for pulmonary and disseminated disease.

135
00:15:11,755 --> 00:15:20,515
It is also avium complex is also the Mycobacterium that is associated with the AIDS disease.

136
00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:24,535
It's also associated with wecould can be isolated from people who are certainly

137
00:15:24,535 --> 00:15:29,725
not immunocompromised but may have underlying lung disease and lung disease.

138
00:15:29,725 --> 00:15:35,545
And please remember these isolates in Runyon Group three are extremely resistant to therapy,

139
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:43,365
so patients have to be treated not with one or two drugs, but with three, four or five drugs to start out with.

140
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:52,635
Next slide. So we have thanks to our friends in molecular biology, several new species of Mycobacterium, and they're shown here on this slide.

141
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:56,925
Murali Neill, Aurum, Nova, Castries, Palu, Stripe and a PD.

142
00:15:56,925 --> 00:16:03,405
I've already mentioned it. Step to come. Share a side note named after Dr. Sherriff's M. Qazi.

143
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:13,785
I am. I like organisms Mycobacterium triple-X, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, subspecies Canetti and subspecies capri,

144
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:21,775
Mycobacterium dusky and Mycobacterium molinsky named after Dr. Lewinsky.

145
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:27,805
Next slide. So let's now talk about the diseases that Michael bacteria cause.

146
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:30,715
And so the first one, of course, is going to be tuberculosis.

147
00:16:30,715 --> 00:16:39,535
It is a major pathogen in the Mycobacterium species, and it primary causes primarily causes pulmonary disease.

148
00:16:39,535 --> 00:16:45,415
So the first infection is generally easily treated. A person converts their skin test.

149
00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:50,035
They have no changes on chest X-ray.

150
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:56,065
They're going to be put on A. Mycobacterial therapy for many months, but that should be in it.

151
00:16:56,065 --> 00:17:04,945
But if if the initial infection goes on, it will cause a change where it sets up disease in the lungs, it's called the GOEN complex.

152
00:17:04,945 --> 00:17:09,625
And what this is, bacilli are taken up by macrophages and they circulate throughout the body.

153
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:15,865
They're usually cleared by the reticulum endothelial system when they get back to the lungs.

154
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:22,585
They're lodged in the eight pieces of the tops of the lungs. And this results in a positive skin test.

155
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:29,695
If there's no active disease, it is known as a latent infection and it still should be treated, still must be treated.

156
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:37,445
You cannot say, no, I'm not going to get sick from it. I don't know. You need absolutely. Patients need therapy at this point.

157
00:17:37,445 --> 00:17:47,285
Next slide. So then we have reactivation, disease and reactivation disease occurs when the lesions that are in the APC's of the lung,

158
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:55,025
the tissue encasing the vassily breaks down. And this can cause active disease and can disseminate throughout the body.

159
00:17:55,025 --> 00:18:00,065
It can also be transmitted to others by coughs or sneezes and so on.

160
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:11,645
And if the lungs have cavities, if there's a lesion, so there's a cavity there, that tissue is irreversibly destroyed, it cannot be regenerated.

161
00:18:11,645 --> 00:18:16,815
There can also be exogenous re-infection by droplet nuclei from some other person.

162
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:24,265
So you, a patient, may have two different strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in their body.

163
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:28,345
Next slide. If there is disseminated disease,

164
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:37,915
this is what I meant to the term before miliary disease and any single organ or many organs can be involved in miliary disease.

165
00:18:37,915 --> 00:18:42,115
There will be lymphatic involvement now.

166
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:47,935
Tuberculosis is not considered to be a communicable disease threat unless the disease

167
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:52,285
is present in a location where the bacilli can be released into the environment.

168
00:18:52,285 --> 00:19:01,435
So coughing, sneezing, sneezing, talking, breathing, all of that you can release the bacilli into the environment.

169
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:05,515
If you have a lesion in your spleen where it can't get out, you're not infectious.

170
00:19:05,515 --> 00:19:11,765
You still need to be treated. The patient still needs to be treated, but it's not infectious.

171
00:19:11,765 --> 00:19:13,205
Next slide.

172
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:21,425
So let me go back to that previous slide, unless it can be released into the environment so patients to be treated, because if you let it go,

173
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:29,075
it may spread to different tissues in the body where it can be released into the environment and infect other people.

174
00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:32,705
So everybody needs to be treated. Next slide.

175
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:39,755
So a form of tuberculosis, a form of that diseases cervical, facial, lymphatic, nice.

176
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:48,095
And it's not generally caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but it may be caused by Mycobacterium scrofula, cassiem or avium complex.

177
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:54,215
And these cause about 80 percent of the diseases of cervical faciale of that night, as are due to these two organisms.

178
00:19:54,215 --> 00:20:02,195
They cause scrofula, and these are generally the enlarged anterior cervical chain of lymph nodes.

179
00:20:02,195 --> 00:20:05,795
And they are painless, but they can get very, very large.

180
00:20:05,795 --> 00:20:12,665
They may open and drain, and if they open a drain when they finally heal, there will be extensive scarring.

181
00:20:12,665 --> 00:20:23,395
How is it treated? It's treated by surgical excision of the infected nodes and A. My mycobacterial therapy is mandatory.

182
00:20:23,395 --> 00:20:31,015
Next slide. Then there's a disease called swimming pool granuloma, and this is caused by Mycobacterium Marinov,

183
00:20:31,015 --> 00:20:36,085
so you should be able to remember that Maranon goes along with water or swimming pools.

184
00:20:36,085 --> 00:20:44,845
And this is a Runnion Group one photo curmudgeon, and it causes granulomatous diseases of the extremities,

185
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:52,135
and it can be obtained from warm water pools, hot tubs, fish hatchery tanks, aquariums and so on.

186
00:20:52,135 --> 00:21:01,285
And there have been several outbreaks over the last many years where fish tanks were contaminated with Mycobacterium maranon.

187
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:07,405
People who are working with the fish tanks got infected, didn't wear gloves in the water and so on.

188
00:21:07,405 --> 00:21:14,605
It causes a spore trick Lloyd type of infection, which is the lesions on the on the skin that may spread, may not heal.

189
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:20,665
The optimal temperature for growth for this organism is 30 to 30 to 32 °C.

190
00:21:20,665 --> 00:21:25,135
It will grow much more slowly at 37 at body temperature, 37 degrees centigrade.

191
00:21:25,135 --> 00:21:33,775
But because it likes that lower temperature, the lesions are commonly on the outside of the body.

192
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:39,385
Next slide. So here's a picture of swimming pool granuloma and you can see these lesions they may open and drain.

193
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:45,855
But with appropriate therapy, these will all heal.

194
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:54,225
Next slide. So there can be other types of other cutaneous infections caused by Mycobacterium species, Mycobacterium also-rans,

195
00:21:54,225 --> 00:22:02,655
which we don't have in this country, cannot be acquired so far in this country causes cutaneous and subcutaneous infections.

196
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:07,125
It only occurs in Australia and tropical countries.

197
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:15,465
The lesion will progress from an itchy nodule and then it will necrosis, and it will result in severe deformity.

198
00:22:15,465 --> 00:22:20,805
And then, Michael, back to him, him often we only see an immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients.

199
00:22:20,805 --> 00:22:23,895
It requires human source for growth.

200
00:22:23,895 --> 00:22:30,705
So if you have a specimen and you're working it up and it's not growing and the doctor comes down and says, Why is it going?

201
00:22:30,705 --> 00:22:35,025
I need to know what to treat my patient with. He's my patient is immunocompromised.

202
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:41,915
Oh, so we need to put it on something that has Hemon in it so we can get it to grow.

203
00:22:41,915 --> 00:22:47,075
Next slide. So what about patients with cystic fibrosis?

204
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:55,175
Well, not the non tuberculous mycobacteria can cause a lot of disease in people who have cystic fibrosis.

205
00:22:55,175 --> 00:23:01,595
They have a higher risk of developing lung disease due to the non tuberculous mycobacteria and the species that

206
00:23:01,595 --> 00:23:10,295
generally cause this problem include in patients with cystic fibrosis include avium complex Mycobacterium abscesses,

207
00:23:10,295 --> 00:23:15,725
a rapid growth, Mycobacterium Consi and Mycobacterium fortuitous.

208
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:21,605
Also a rapid grower. So if you think about what group these are and Mycobacterium avium is in Group

209
00:23:21,605 --> 00:23:29,795
three abscesses and for two of them are in group for Kansas's in Group two.

210
00:23:29,795 --> 00:23:35,765
So we need to use oxalic acid in addition to sodium hydroxide to get rid of the Pseudomonas

211
00:23:35,765 --> 00:23:41,735
aeruginosa that we know are is in the the sputum of patients who have cystic fibrosis.

212
00:23:41,735 --> 00:23:51,155
Patients with cystic fibrosis have very, very sick mewe, quite sputum, and we need to use oxalic acid to break it down.

213
00:23:51,155 --> 00:23:54,995
Oxalic acid will help get rid of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa,

214
00:23:54,995 --> 00:24:01,115
and then we use the sodium hydroxide to further break down the sputum so that we can process it appropriately.

215
00:24:01,115 --> 00:24:06,155
We may have to use Burkholderia Select Auger to isolate the rapidly growing non

216
00:24:06,155 --> 00:24:11,165
tuberculous mycobacteria because Burkholderia cepacia Burkholderia select auger,

217
00:24:11,165 --> 00:24:15,335
excuse me, has antibiotics in it to allow growth of of Burkholderia,

218
00:24:15,335 --> 00:24:28,295
but to suppress the growth of other routine bacteria that are not mycobacteria treatment of non tuberculous MICHAEL.

219
00:24:28,295 --> 00:24:33,185
Bacterial infections in patients who have cystic fibrosis can be very, very difficult.

220
00:24:33,185 --> 00:24:42,025
But if they're not treated. Lung transplants can fail due to the presence of the acid fast mycobacteria.

221
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:51,025
Next slide. So we're getting back to tuberculosis and transmission of tuberculosis, TB is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

222
00:24:51,025 --> 00:24:55,915
It is spread by airborne particles that contain Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

223
00:24:55,915 --> 00:24:59,615
These are these airborne particles are called droplet nuclei,

224
00:24:59,615 --> 00:25:04,375
and I know I've told you this before, but I'm going over it again so that you remember it.

225
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:14,435
Droplet nuclei may be expelled when a person with infectious TB coughs or sneezes and doesn't cover that cough and doesn't cover the sneeze.

226
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:23,945
People who are at the highest risk of becoming infected from another infected person, maybe a family member, a friend, et cetera, are close contacts,

227
00:25:23,945 --> 00:25:29,255
so that person who's infected needs to wear a mask, needs to be treated,

228
00:25:29,255 --> 00:25:36,725
needs to be isolated for the first three to four weeks of their therapy person with TB infection, but not disease.

229
00:25:36,725 --> 00:25:42,035
So there's no lesions are not infectious.

230
00:25:42,035 --> 00:25:48,535
This is known as latent tuberculosis infection. LTBI.

231
00:25:48,535 --> 00:25:52,855
Next slide. So let's talk now about pathogenesis of TB.

232
00:25:52,855 --> 00:26:04,605
So. If you had a group of 100 people, oops, excuse me, if you had a group of 100 people with infected with tuberculosis,

233
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:11,265
10 percent of these people will develop active disease at some point in their lives,

234
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:17,895
and there are certain conditions that increase the risk that TB infection will progress to disease.

235
00:26:17,895 --> 00:26:25,875
Next slide. So common sights of TB disease 85 percent of all cases are in the lungs and in the pleura of the lungs.

236
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:36,105
Others common sites of TB disease, central nervous system, the lymphatic system, the genital urinary system, bones and joints.

237
00:26:36,105 --> 00:26:43,185
And then if you have miliary disease, it could be in all of these sites or several of them.

238
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:49,125
Next slide. So what populations have a high prevalence of TB infection,

239
00:26:49,125 --> 00:27:00,075
so could be close contacts of people with infectious tuberculosis, Foreign-born persons from areas where TB is common?

240
00:27:00,075 --> 00:27:07,725
And then medically underserved low income populations, including high risk racial and ethnic groups,

241
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:12,915
and then, of course, the elderly who may have been infected and never developed active disease.

242
00:27:12,915 --> 00:27:22,635
And then as they age, their immune system becomes less competent and they get active tuberculosis.

243
00:27:22,635 --> 00:27:27,765
So going on, so I have a chart here that I copied off the internet.

244
00:27:27,765 --> 00:27:34,235
A person with latent TB TB infection versus a person with TB disease to show the difference.

245
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,875
So a person with latent TB infection has no symptoms.

246
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:44,175
A person with TB disease has symptoms that may include a bad cough that lasts three weeks or longer.

247
00:27:44,175 --> 00:27:52,845
Pain in the chest coughing up blood or sputum and sputum is thick mucus material, not saliva weakness or fatigue.

248
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:57,225
Weight loss. No appetite. Hence, the weight loss.

249
00:27:57,225 --> 00:28:05,535
Chills, fever and profuse night sweats. If you go back to a person with late latent TB infection, they don't feel sick.

250
00:28:05,535 --> 00:28:12,405
They cannot spread TB bacteria to others because there's no way for it to get out of their body usually has a skin test or a

251
00:28:12,405 --> 00:28:20,025
blood test result indicating TB infection since they have no symptoms as a normal chest x ray and a negative sputum smear,

252
00:28:20,025 --> 00:28:27,645
but needs absolutely needs treatment for latent TB infection to prevent TB disease.

253
00:28:27,645 --> 00:28:33,315
Now, a person's symptoms of a person with TB disease, they usually feel sick.

254
00:28:33,315 --> 00:28:41,745
They may spread TB bacteria to others. They usually have a skin test or a blood test result that indicates that they're infected

255
00:28:41,745 --> 00:28:47,535
may have an abnormal chest ray chest X-ray or positive sputum smear or culture,

256
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:54,105
and absolutely needs treatment to treat tuberculosis disease.

257
00:28:54,105 --> 00:29:03,015
Next slide. So screening systemic symptoms of TB, and I know I keep going over this over and over, but this is very important information.

258
00:29:03,015 --> 00:29:08,125
The symptoms systemic symptoms of tuberculosis include fever.

259
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:17,725
Chills, night sweats, easy fatigue, ability to get way more tired than anyone should, just from not doing hardly anything.

260
00:29:17,725 --> 00:29:21,775
Loss of appetite and and weight loss.

261
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:33,555
So those are the systemic symptoms of tuberculosis. So the purpose of screening again, we screen with the man to tubercular and skin test,

262
00:29:33,555 --> 00:29:37,875
and this is used to identify infected persons at high risk for disease who would benefit

263
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:45,485
from preventive therapy and also to identify persons with TB disease who need treatment.

264
00:29:45,485 --> 00:29:50,585
They can also be persons can also be screened with chest radiographs or sputum smears

265
00:29:50,585 --> 00:29:55,355
to identify people who have TB in places where the risk of transmission is high,

266
00:29:55,355 --> 00:30:00,915
such as the lungs. Next slide.

267
00:30:00,915 --> 00:30:05,385
So there's an asset that we can do in the laboratory, it's called the quantifier and or the Teesport test.

268
00:30:05,385 --> 00:30:14,775
It's an interferon gamma release assay also known as ERA. It AIDS it's used in help diagnosing MTB infection,

269
00:30:14,775 --> 00:30:20,235
but does not differentiate MTB infection from a latent TB.

270
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:25,695
OK. It measures person's immune reactivity to tuberculosis.

271
00:30:25,695 --> 00:30:33,945
And what the how this test is done White blood cells from people infected with MTB will release interferon gamma and then that is.

272
00:30:33,945 --> 00:30:41,025
And then, when mixed with antigens derived from that organism, if a person is not infected with TB,

273
00:30:41,025 --> 00:30:45,525
they don't have any interferon interferon gamma and the test will be negative.

274
00:30:45,525 --> 00:30:54,705
And it's important to note that prior BCG vaccination does not cause a false positive Ygritte test.

275
00:30:54,705 --> 00:31:04,395
Next slide. So I have mentioned the Selasi documents many times in Class Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute, which is not part of CDC.

276
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:12,645
It's an independent institute. They have a document in 48, a laboratory detection and identification of mycobacteria,

277
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:17,775
and it is the information in this document that all laboratories use to determine

278
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:23,205
how they're going to identify mycobacteria and how far they're going to go,

279
00:31:23,205 --> 00:31:29,705
which is going to do AFB smears and send the rest on or what they're going to do.

280
00:31:29,705 --> 00:31:42,995
Next slide. So in this document, it as it mandates that from specimen, once a specimen is released and received in the microbiology laboratory,

281
00:31:42,995 --> 00:31:47,795
you have to do testing within 24 hours of that specimen collection.

282
00:31:47,795 --> 00:31:51,935
So first of all, the specimen has to be processed and concentrated.

283
00:31:51,935 --> 00:31:57,665
So we use it and acetyl cysteine to break down the sputum and two percent sodium

284
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:02,375
hydroxide to get rid of the other normal flora bacteria that will be in the specimen.

285
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:08,945
The two percent sodium hydroxide may kill off a few mycobacteria, but most will make it through from that point.

286
00:32:08,945 --> 00:32:14,705
Microscopy is done and generally a floor chrome slide floor chrome stain issues first.

287
00:32:14,705 --> 00:32:20,585
And if it is positive, there has to be done within 24 hours of receipt of the specimen in the laboratory.

288
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:29,825
If that is positive, there has to be an amplified test nucleic acid amplified test done within another 24 hours of specimen collection,

289
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:39,965
and that's only done on respiratory specimens. So from the microscopy point, we, of course, we don't expect to see all mycobacteria on the smear.

290
00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:48,485
So all specimens need to be set up in culture. And the culture is it's done both with broth, a culture of fluid,

291
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:55,115
so there can be automated detection of of growth on a machine and then a solid organ.

292
00:32:55,115 --> 00:33:06,545
Slants are also set up, are also inoculated. Broth based is will detect growth within 14 days or less of receipt of the specimen in the laboratory.

293
00:33:06,545 --> 00:33:12,215
And we need to be able to identify and tuberculosis complex within 21 days of specimen

294
00:33:12,215 --> 00:33:16,715
receipt and is identified generally with molecular assays or with DNA probes.

295
00:33:16,715 --> 00:33:21,035
Now we may have so few organisms there that we don't get any growth initially,

296
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:29,165
and that's why we set up solid organ slants also so that we can actually observe the

297
00:33:29,165 --> 00:33:34,415
what the growth looks like on the tubes that we have more pure growth to work with.

298
00:33:34,415 --> 00:33:43,265
And then we can set up any growth that is M. Tuberculosis. We set up antibiotic susceptibility with the first line drugs that are drugs to.

299
00:33:43,265 --> 00:33:45,825
I've already mentioned these drugs to its broth based testing.

300
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:51,035
We can do automated testing and this should be done within the first 30 days of specimen receipt.

301
00:33:51,035 --> 00:33:54,095
And then if resistance is detected,

302
00:33:54,095 --> 00:34:01,265
the organism needs additional susceptibility testing and that generally is done in a reference lab or in your state public health laboratory.

303
00:34:01,265 --> 00:34:06,275
And this is all taken from. I borrowed this entire slide from Karen Carroll.

304
00:34:06,275 --> 00:34:14,825
She's one of the authors on this GCM article Royal role of the Clinical Microbiology Lab in Diagnosis and Management of TB in low prevalence settings,

305
00:34:14,825 --> 00:34:19,385
which is certainly what we have here in Michigan. Next slide.

306
00:34:19,385 --> 00:34:25,415
So I've mentioned at highest levels of service before, if you're a level one laboratory,

307
00:34:25,415 --> 00:34:29,945
collect good specimens, that's the most important thing that you can do.

308
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:33,635
And don't be afraid to say this is not a good specimen. There's no white cells.

309
00:34:33,635 --> 00:34:38,315
It's just it's saliva and it's not sputum. Get good specimens.

310
00:34:38,315 --> 00:34:42,665
And if you don't do the smears there, make sure you ship them to a laboratory.

311
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:46,895
They can do all the testing very, very rapidly. If you do do smears,

312
00:34:46,895 --> 00:34:51,425
you need to do a minimum of 10 to 15 per week so that you can keep your proficiency

313
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:57,395
up if you're a Level two laboratory under the American Thoracic Society,

314
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:02,525
levels of service guidance collect good specimens, do microscopy and once again,

315
00:35:02,525 --> 00:35:09,035
15 to 20 per week set up cultures and identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

316
00:35:09,035 --> 00:35:13,685
You can do susceptibility testing, but it's not mandatory.

317
00:35:13,685 --> 00:35:18,035
It's also OK to send it out to another lab to do susceptibility testing.

318
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:25,805
And then if you're a Level three, perform all procedures, identify all Mycobacterium species and do susceptibility testing.

319
00:35:25,805 --> 00:35:33,065
Next slide. So now let's talk a little bit about how well AFB cultures perform.

320
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:39,095
So the American Thoracic Society suggests that a lab perform AFB procedures only if they

321
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:46,385
regularly perform at least 10 to 15 AFB smears per week and at least 20 AFB cultures per week.

322
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:53,225
And I think I mentioned this on a previous slide. CDC recommends smears be turned around in 24 hours.

323
00:35:53,225 --> 00:35:58,205
That means within 24 hours of getting the specimen the lab, you have to process it.

324
00:35:58,205 --> 00:36:08,855
Perform your AFB smear, read it and report it, and then MTB needs to be identified in less than 21 days.

325
00:36:08,855 --> 00:36:12,905
And if you're doing susceptibility testing that needs to be available within

326
00:36:12,905 --> 00:36:19,265
28 days and these days are from receipt of the specimen in the laboratory.

327
00:36:19,265 --> 00:36:21,725
If of course you don't do susceptibility testing,

328
00:36:21,725 --> 00:36:31,055
it needs to be sent out to a public health lab or another clinical lab that does susceptibility testing that can do it within this timeframe.

329
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:38,885
Next slide. So here we have a schematic. And this is a flow chart for specimen processing of mycobacteria,

330
00:36:38,885 --> 00:36:44,435
and the very first thing at the top of the slide is is this specimen a sterile specimen or a non-sterile specimen?

331
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:50,795
Celestial specimen most commonly is tissue obtained at surgery or spinal fluid.

332
00:36:50,795 --> 00:36:58,715
So if it's spinal fluid centrifuge and use the sediment, if it's tissue, you need to grind up the tissue, then centrifuge it and use the sediment.

333
00:36:58,715 --> 00:37:05,045
If it's a non sterile specimen, you need to liquefy this, such as sputum to liquefy it with and still cysteine.

334
00:37:05,045 --> 00:37:10,415
Decontaminate it with sodium hydroxide hydroxide, neutralize it with a buffer of water,

335
00:37:10,415 --> 00:37:17,435
and then centrifuge it again so that you have some sediment to work with to inoculate the tubed media and to set up your smear.

336
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:26,795
And the two media should be at least one liquid culture and a minimum of one solid agar medium, but most people do two or three.

337
00:37:26,795 --> 00:37:31,655
So if it's the liquid, it's either a backpack committed a to check.

338
00:37:31,655 --> 00:37:39,005
Other companies have come up with other systems, goes onto a machine. The machine tells you it, miss it, incubates on the machine,

339
00:37:39,005 --> 00:37:48,825
it shakes on the machine and it tells you when there is growth so that there are some really fine machines here in this group.

340
00:37:48,825 --> 00:37:56,375
They're they're continuously more moderating the incubator at 37 degrees for up to six weeks if growth is detected.

341
00:37:56,375 --> 00:38:04,265
Then you confirm by AFB smear and then you reenact late, solid media going over to here to the right hand side of the slide nightlight.

342
00:38:04,265 --> 00:38:10,115
In addition to the liquid media solid media, Lowenstein LJ Auger could use LG.

343
00:38:10,115 --> 00:38:16,445
I'll go with RNA Algeria with pyruvate, but most places do LG Auger and then they do a Middlebrooks 7H turn.

344
00:38:16,445 --> 00:38:23,735
They incubated at 37 degrees for eight weeks and the the the slants are examined weekly or twice weekly.

345
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:28,645
If growth occurs, you confirm it by an AFI smear and then you go on through the process.

346
00:38:28,645 --> 00:38:36,795
Next slide. So we've talked about a little bit about processing specimens, what specimens we actually use well,

347
00:38:36,795 --> 00:38:46,455
respiratory specimens are the most common cause sputum expect created or induced bronchial alveolar lavage fluids, pleural fluids or lung tissue.

348
00:38:46,455 --> 00:38:51,105
We can get other tissues and body fluids. Generally, urine is not a very good good.

349
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:53,025
It's not the best specimen you can get.

350
00:38:53,025 --> 00:38:59,625
But if the physician thinks the patient might have mycobacterial infection of the urinary tract, yes, definitely to test urine.

351
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:04,995
But other tissues throughout the body, commonly lung tissue or surface wounds and so on.

352
00:39:04,995 --> 00:39:09,945
Skin if there's cutaneous disease, if if the patient is HIV positive,

353
00:39:09,945 --> 00:39:19,005
oftentimes blood needs to be cultured for mycobacteria and not in a routine blood culture system, but in blood used in mycobacterial culture system.

354
00:39:19,005 --> 00:39:27,995
And also, if the patient's HIV positive, they should. We should have stool specimens submitted to the laboratory for a for AFB culture.

355
00:39:27,995 --> 00:39:33,365
Next slide. So this is out of the cap inspection document, remember,

356
00:39:33,365 --> 00:39:40,325
I told you the Cap College of American Pathologists licenses clinical laboratories in all all areas of the laboratory,

357
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:46,415
whether it be anatomic pathology, clinical pathology, and they have guidelines for what you should be doing.

358
00:39:46,415 --> 00:39:54,605
So cap. Am I see DOT three one one zero zero says the laboratory should recommend collecting three sputum specimens for acid first music,

359
00:39:54,605 --> 00:40:00,155
culture and patients with clinical a chest x ray findings compatible with tuberculosis.

360
00:40:00,155 --> 00:40:02,955
These three in bold. This is a very important part.

361
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:12,485
These three samples should be collected over an eight to 24 hour period of time and should and should include at least one first morning specimen.

362
00:40:12,485 --> 00:40:18,755
Specimens must be delivered to the lab promptly. Specimens that cannot be processed within one hour of the time of collection should

363
00:40:18,755 --> 00:40:23,885
be refrigerated during transport to and storage in the lab prior to processing.

364
00:40:23,885 --> 00:40:27,695
And this will decrease the overgrowth with contaminating organisms.

365
00:40:27,695 --> 00:40:30,515
As I've mentioned, if you're getting a a plus sputum specimen,

366
00:40:30,515 --> 00:40:36,735
there's going to be a lot of other contaminated organisms from the patient patient's throat and mouth.

367
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:43,755
Next slide. So we've talked a little bit about the disease that tuberculosis causes, it causes growing granulomas.

368
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:51,045
And so what you see here, this is a granuloma. And you can see inside the granite granuloma, these cells are dead.

369
00:40:51,045 --> 00:40:54,675
But what you see out here are white blood cells around the outside.

370
00:40:54,675 --> 00:40:59,085
They're trying to wall it off and they're trying to make it go away,

371
00:40:59,085 --> 00:41:05,025
but they're not doing it very well here because this this lesion looks like it's getting larger and larger.

372
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:10,155
You cannot see on a histopathology slide acid fast bacilli.

373
00:41:10,155 --> 00:41:15,975
But if they were to do an acid faster and you could see it, see them inside that granuloma.

374
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:23,235
Next slide. So when we process specimens for smears, we can do a couple of different kinds of stains.

375
00:41:23,235 --> 00:41:33,645
We can do the typical acid fasting. It's either the zeal Nielsen, which you have to put the stain on the slide and heat it up a bit or a Kenyan stain,

376
00:41:33,645 --> 00:41:38,565
or we can do it or mean, wrote a mainstay in the SEAL Nielsen or the Kinion.

377
00:41:38,565 --> 00:41:43,605
The acid fast bacilli will be read and that's what you see here. With these red bodies in the tissue.

378
00:41:43,605 --> 00:41:50,625
Those are acid fast bacilli. They're readily Kaval Fuchs, and it uses that as a stain.

379
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:58,845
They can be yellow green if we do a fluorescent stain such as you see down here and they might be blue off of methylene blue stain is used.

380
00:41:58,845 --> 00:42:02,835
So but down here is a fluorescent stain, and that's an alarming Rotimi stain.

381
00:42:02,835 --> 00:42:08,945
And you can see the mycobacteria are this yellow green, yellow green fluorescent bodies.

382
00:42:08,945 --> 00:42:18,695
Next slide. So then how do we examine, interpret and report this slide, we can't just look at one or two or 10 fields we have to look at.

383
00:42:18,695 --> 00:42:24,035
Thirty three hundred, excuse me, 300 oil immersion fields need to be scanned.

384
00:42:24,035 --> 00:42:28,175
If you can scan, do a low power scan, you can do this and left less time.

385
00:42:28,175 --> 00:42:37,605
Most labs don't have enough microscopes that they can have do a low power scan at three hundred a minimum of 300.

386
00:42:37,605 --> 00:42:41,765
A low power scan with enough magnification, excuse me, enough magnet magnification.

387
00:42:41,765 --> 00:42:48,335
You can see the acid fast bacilli. If you see positive smears, it must be quantified as you see in the table below.

388
00:42:48,335 --> 00:42:54,005
Take this table taken out of a C-list pocket or out of an AC manual,

389
00:42:54,005 --> 00:43:01,655
so the sensitivity of the acid fast smear ranges from 20 to 80 percent, but it greatly depends on the quality of the specimen.

390
00:43:01,655 --> 00:43:05,345
So spit gives you that 20 percent.

391
00:43:05,345 --> 00:43:10,655
Maybe sputum gives you that 80 percent and culture method comparison.

392
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:15,155
So the specificity is high, but you can have cross-contamination or environmental contamination.

393
00:43:15,155 --> 00:43:19,775
So if you see one or two, remember, you have to check 300 field oil immersion fields.

394
00:43:19,775 --> 00:43:27,585
You'll see one or two AFB in 300 fields. That's doubtful requests.

395
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:28,925
Another, another specimen.

396
00:43:28,925 --> 00:43:38,705
You can't call in just one or two c one to nine in 100 fields or with with the acid fasting, or two to 18 over 50 fields with floor chrome.

397
00:43:38,705 --> 00:43:48,925
It's one plus, and you can see as the numbers get higher, the more that you see per field, you increase for two plus three plus or four plus positive.

398
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:55,375
Next slide. So what about the sensitivity and specificity of AFB smears?

399
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:59,345
The sensitivity is variable. It's not a hundred percent. Nobody ever said it would be 100 percent.

400
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:05,575
We can never expect it to be 100 percent, but you can increase the sensitivity with certification.

401
00:44:05,575 --> 00:44:14,575
So if you centrifuges few samples samples at at least 3800 times, do you increase the sensitivity?

402
00:44:14,575 --> 00:44:21,415
So there are pros and cons for doing this side of centrifugation.

403
00:44:21,415 --> 00:44:26,785
So couple of papers one in JKM by Saxon Air,

404
00:44:26,785 --> 00:44:33,475
says there were six or seven positives with centrifugation and 34th out and they bleached before processing.

405
00:44:33,475 --> 00:44:41,875
Photos said 20 of 26 showed more bacilli after certification and six only seen after centrifugation.

406
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:49,105
And then Gale Woods and Co. said in 1995, 46 of 47 were positive by both.

407
00:44:49,105 --> 00:44:53,905
Only one additional was picked up by centrifuge centrifugation.

408
00:44:53,905 --> 00:45:03,715
And that is centrifuge the broth culture tube. So specificity ninety nine point three to ninety nine point nine percent for Mycobacterium species,

409
00:45:03,715 --> 00:45:11,995
but this doesn't tell you that it's Mycobacterium tuberculosis. If you see CCORDING, that may increase the specificity, but most times you don't see.

410
00:45:11,995 --> 00:45:18,145
All you can say is acid fast bacilli present. Next slide.

411
00:45:18,145 --> 00:45:22,195
So these there's some examples of this is mostly fluorescent up here on the left hand side,

412
00:45:22,195 --> 00:45:29,305
on the right hand side, right upper and right lower are your routine acid fast bacilli in the upper?

413
00:45:29,305 --> 00:45:36,145
You see them and that in and there's a little bit of courting going on here in the bottom one.

414
00:45:36,145 --> 00:45:42,975
And on the left hand side, you see a positive fluorescent stain left hand on the bottom.

415
00:45:42,975 --> 00:45:51,615
Next slide. So it's not that easy, because there are other organisms that can contain my colic acids and make things somewhat confusing.

416
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:57,465
So cell walls containing my colleague Cassidy either present or absent in this chart.

417
00:45:57,465 --> 00:46:02,505
Bacteria can have my colic not as much as as Mycobacterium, but can have some colic.

418
00:46:02,505 --> 00:46:10,395
Acid include no cardia, wrote a carcass DTA Gordon here and Sucre Marella.

419
00:46:10,395 --> 00:46:19,935
And then cell walls generally do not have mycobacteria, but I've seen one or two Corynebacterium that were very, very weakly acid fast.

420
00:46:19,935 --> 00:46:26,505
So but streptomycin is actin on my sister metaphors. No cardiaques isn't or Sokovia do not have my colic.

421
00:46:26,505 --> 00:46:31,535
Acids, Karani bacteria is kind of on the dividing line. Next slide.

422
00:46:31,535 --> 00:46:38,195
So here is ccording, and you can see the picture on the right to crumpled up to see anything.

423
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:47,385
But even though it's not pinkish red, you can see how the acid fast bacilli stick together and this like huge, intertwined chords.

424
00:46:47,385 --> 00:46:52,305
Next slide. So what about no cardiac species?

425
00:46:52,305 --> 00:47:02,145
They can be picked up. You can see on the left hand side the Graham say, you can see these beaded chains and those are beaded gram positive rods.

426
00:47:02,145 --> 00:47:07,785
And then if you do an acid fasting, sometimes you can see them and sometimes you can't, but you can see them here in.

427
00:47:07,785 --> 00:47:12,795
But it's hard to differentiate them in this at this particular acid fasting.

428
00:47:12,795 --> 00:47:17,765
OK. Next slide.

429
00:47:17,765 --> 00:47:24,665
So what? I've mentioned that the ideal specimen is a sputum from deep in the lungs, but it's also going to be contaminated.

430
00:47:24,665 --> 00:47:34,445
You need to decontaminate it and concentrated. So I've also mentioned that still specimens such as CSF are often concentrated.

431
00:47:34,445 --> 00:47:41,285
This should be concentrated to increase recovery. Spin them at three thousand to thirty eight hundred GS for 15 minutes.

432
00:47:41,285 --> 00:47:50,075
Non-Status by site specimens all they have to be decontaminated to kill non Mycobacterium species bacterium fungi as much as possible.

433
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:56,705
You may still get some contamination, but not as much as if you didn't decontaminate them and then concentrate to increase recovery.

434
00:47:56,705 --> 00:48:00,335
And here's the steps for decontamination are shown here.

435
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:05,855
You treat the sputum if it's sputum within still cysteine and sodium hydroxide

436
00:48:05,855 --> 00:48:10,415
to break up the mucus coated nature of the specimen and to decontaminate it.

437
00:48:10,415 --> 00:48:15,275
You can also, if it's a thinner, doesn't need to be as it's not a thick sputum specimen.

438
00:48:15,275 --> 00:48:20,015
You can use sodium hydroxide alone two to four percent to break down whatever you quite can't.

439
00:48:20,015 --> 00:48:26,015
Characteristics There are some labs use oxalic acid to reduce Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

440
00:48:26,015 --> 00:48:32,705
If the specimens are from patients with cystic fibrosis, it will do a good job of breaking down acts,

441
00:48:32,705 --> 00:48:38,765
breaking down the mucus nature, and there is variable sensitivity.

442
00:48:38,765 --> 00:48:43,655
Of Mycobacterium two issues to these decontamination methods.

443
00:48:43,655 --> 00:48:49,145
Generally, you don't kill off all of the mycobacteria with these procedures, but you may kill off some of them.

444
00:48:49,145 --> 00:48:57,785
So you should monnett. Your lab needs to monitor contamination rates. You should see some contamination of your mycobacterial media.

445
00:48:57,785 --> 00:49:06,965
Three to five percent is what is expected. You should have some import only growing up if you have high degrees of contamination at 30 40 50 percent,

446
00:49:06,965 --> 00:49:13,085
that's way too high and you're not doing enough to decontaminate the specimens.

447
00:49:13,085 --> 00:49:23,465
Next slide. So once we have the specimens processed, concentrated, decontaminated and concentrated,

448
00:49:23,465 --> 00:49:29,975
we need to inoculate our media and we can use a variety of different types of broth culture media.

449
00:49:29,975 --> 00:49:32,375
It should also always be broth culture media.

450
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:41,735
In addition to solid agar media, so many two places use the midget system that is inoculated broth culture to put it into a machine.

451
00:49:41,735 --> 00:49:46,775
And if mycobacteria, there they will, the media will fluoresce after a few days back,

452
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:53,135
tech backed healer and first Sitrick have similar types of systems, then conventional media backup.

453
00:49:53,135 --> 00:49:57,845
I think I've already mentioned Loewenstein Jensen Media and should use Middlebrook Agar also.

454
00:49:57,845 --> 00:50:02,405
And then there is a micro colony method, but it's not used in very many laboratories.

455
00:50:02,405 --> 00:50:11,515
It's extremely labor intensive. It may be used in research facilities, but that would be about all.

456
00:50:11,515 --> 00:50:16,465
Next slide. So here are some here's the back check for 60, inoculate the bottles.

457
00:50:16,465 --> 00:50:23,515
Put it in here. The machine will tell you when it's positive we have a Versa trek bottle, a back tiller bottle and so on.

458
00:50:23,515 --> 00:50:33,205
And so with the the the some of the the BD midget when it flew, when TB grows midget fluorescence.

459
00:50:33,205 --> 00:50:36,685
And that's kind of nice because it's nice to be able to see that fluorescence in the lab.

460
00:50:36,685 --> 00:50:41,125
If nothing else, you know which exactly which tubes to take out and work with.

461
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:45,205
Next slide. So micro colony, I mentioned that before.

462
00:50:45,205 --> 00:50:46,675
So if you take a plate you got,

463
00:50:46,675 --> 00:50:56,785
you have to be working in a BSL three type containment facility in a laminar flow hood with masks, gloves, gown, the whole bit.

464
00:50:56,785 --> 00:51:03,115
Take it and inoculated plate. Put it in the laminar flow hood and you're working with gloves and a mask on,

465
00:51:03,115 --> 00:51:09,235
and you can take the top off the plate and look to see if you have mica colonies now.

466
00:51:09,235 --> 00:51:16,135
The best way to do that would be to have the microscope inside the hood, which is pretty much impossible, but you can use a magnifying glass.

467
00:51:16,135 --> 00:51:20,515
And as long as you keep the magnifying glass in that area, you don't have to worry about it.

468
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:26,935
You can. You can hold up the plate and use a magnifying glass in the hood and see whether or not you see any micro colonies.

469
00:51:26,935 --> 00:51:29,425
And this is what you might see at 10 to 12 days.

470
00:51:29,425 --> 00:51:37,405
If it's a conspiracy, I will grow more much more rapidly and you'll see much more growth as you see here on the right hand side of this slide.

471
00:51:37,405 --> 00:51:46,775
Next slide. So let's talk about blood cultures, we can do blood cultures for systemic Michael, bacterial infections.

472
00:51:46,775 --> 00:51:51,245
And we have to use an isolated system. This is a licensed certification.

473
00:51:51,245 --> 00:51:56,435
And so what we do is we give blood. We put it in the lysis in a in an isolated tube.

474
00:51:56,435 --> 00:52:05,765
It lysis the white blood cells and then you centrifuge it and then you plant the sediment on solid media.

475
00:52:05,765 --> 00:52:13,145
You can put it into your liquid media. Also, you can use a wide variety of different types of media.

476
00:52:13,145 --> 00:52:21,005
But remember the rapidly growing mycobacteria? Those that are in Group four may appear in routine blood culture bottles without any additional work.

477
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:28,025
As I'm showing you here just as a positive blood culture and we'll grow out as aerobic gram positive bacilli.

478
00:52:28,025 --> 00:52:38,205
So remember, whenever you're working with positive blood cultures and your subculture and all those bottles, everything has to be done in a good.

479
00:52:38,205 --> 00:52:47,025
Next slide. So incubation of mycobacterial cultures have gone over this a little bit, but let's do it again.

480
00:52:47,025 --> 00:52:54,795
All specimens except blood should be planted in a broth. Five drops is approximately half of a milliliter.

481
00:52:54,795 --> 00:52:58,575
It's five milliliters, as well as two to three pieces of solid media.

482
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:03,705
And you should inoculate each each piece of solid media with at least three drops.

483
00:53:03,705 --> 00:53:11,445
Or you can use plates which then need to be taped up and placed before being placed in the incubator, and there'd be three drops incubated at 37.

484
00:53:11,445 --> 00:53:16,425
You can do if it's a skin, a sample of skin, the extremity.

485
00:53:16,425 --> 00:53:17,745
You can also do room temperature,

486
00:53:17,745 --> 00:53:27,705
additional plates at room temperature to look for Mycobacterium M. also-rans or hemophilia as as additional organisms

487
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:36,915
that can grow at room temperature other than those at room temperature you incubated at 37 degrees centigrade.

488
00:53:36,915 --> 00:53:43,425
In oxygen, except for Middlebrook Media, Middlebrook Media, so this is different from the L.J,

489
00:53:43,425 --> 00:53:53,445
but Middlebrook Media needs five to 10 percent CO2 incubate for six to eight weeks before you sign off the culture as being negative.

490
00:53:53,445 --> 00:54:00,015
Growth will usually occur depending on how heavy the infection load is two to three weeks.

491
00:54:00,015 --> 00:54:05,355
But you incubate for six to eight weeks before you discard its negative.

492
00:54:05,355 --> 00:54:10,875
So what time to expect for a positive culture and tuberculosis of it's in broth?

493
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:16,815
Less than two weeks. A 10 to 12 days, usually in less than three weeks on solid media.

494
00:54:16,815 --> 00:54:22,215
If it's avium intracellular, it goes a little bit more rapidly five to seven days in broth.

495
00:54:22,215 --> 00:54:26,415
But on solid made, it takes more time, usually four to six weeks on solid media.

496
00:54:26,415 --> 00:54:33,825
The rapid growers say they got that name by growing rapidly. They're quite variable anywhere from three days to six weeks in broth.

497
00:54:33,825 --> 00:54:38,445
But if you transfer them to solid media, they should grow up in less than five days.

498
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:43,035
Mycobacterium Casesa and Miriam, you generally take about two weeks.

499
00:54:43,035 --> 00:54:51,525
The other non tuberculous Mycobacterium species varies with the organism and the concentration of organism in the specimen.

500
00:54:51,525 --> 00:54:57,525
And then we have Mycobacterium gene events, which is an extremely slowly growing Mycobacterium.

501
00:54:57,525 --> 00:55:01,755
It often takes four to six weeks or more than four to six weeks before we see

502
00:55:01,755 --> 00:55:08,235
growth and the the broth will grow faster than the solid media and once again,

503
00:55:08,235 --> 00:55:18,375
remember, may take less time is smears are positive and there are more than just one or two organisms in there that you see on the smear.

504
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:25,305
Next slide. So this is an example of what Loewenstein Jensen Media looks like,

505
00:55:25,305 --> 00:55:30,075
if you look at the lower right hand corner, you see the media is generally kind of this greenish blue color.

506
00:55:30,075 --> 00:55:33,105
This is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, it's labeled correctly.

507
00:55:33,105 --> 00:55:40,335
And what we always say about Mycobacterium tuberculosis is rough and buff, so it's buff colored and the colonies are rough looking.

508
00:55:40,335 --> 00:55:48,075
Now we have Chroma genes and photo chromosomes and go to curmudgeons always grow up in this orangish color.

509
00:55:48,075 --> 00:55:57,345
No matter what media they're on, they're always in this orangish color. A non pigmented buff color is this color here on the left hand side?

510
00:55:57,345 --> 00:56:05,445
OK. Next slide. So how do we identify mycobacteria?

511
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:15,265
So. Then we have conventional biochemicals, we have DNA probes, we have a variety of different methods, we can do conventional biochemicals,

512
00:56:15,265 --> 00:56:22,335
they will take more time, but this is what everything else is based on nice and test if it's nice and positive.

513
00:56:22,335 --> 00:56:29,965
You call MTB complex, if it's nice and we set all these up it at once to to make sure that we're not missing anything,

514
00:56:29,965 --> 00:56:35,515
we do a niacin nitrate catalyst. We look for pigmentation. We look to see how rapidly there is growth.

515
00:56:35,515 --> 00:56:36,085
And to do this,

516
00:56:36,085 --> 00:56:43,735
you have to check the plates two or three times a week to see how how are the last two or three times a week to see when growth shows up?

517
00:56:43,735 --> 00:56:48,565
We look at see what temperatures they grow at, whether or not they're positive for urea,

518
00:56:48,565 --> 00:56:54,295
Earl, Sulfur Taste, Telluride, etc. We have AQ probes, which are DNA probes.

519
00:56:54,295 --> 00:57:00,745
They are not available for every species of Mycobacterium, but they are available for the most common ones.

520
00:57:00,745 --> 00:57:08,845
So there are AQ probes for tuberculosis complex M. Avium intracellular Larry M. Gordon and M. SSI.

521
00:57:08,845 --> 00:57:16,375
Those are the most common ones. And if these are negative, then you follow up by biochemical testing.

522
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:23,815
Places like Cleveland Clinic used to do a lot, and other institutions also used do a line probe assay for 16 species, plus the genus.

523
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:28,405
At time I got this slide. It was not FDA cleared. It is now FDA cleared.

524
00:57:28,405 --> 00:57:34,625
You can do HPLC to identify isolates, but even better than that, now we have maldi-tof.

525
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:42,985
So as long as you're working in a proper containment facility, you can process positive culture for MALDI-TOF.

526
00:57:42,985 --> 00:57:45,235
That means putting it on the stainless steel plate,

527
00:57:45,235 --> 00:57:52,075
adding the chemicals and then putting it into the machine that has to be back in the BSL three also.

528
00:57:52,075 --> 00:57:57,235
And then, of course, this PCR testing for some isolates and sequencing for everything.

529
00:57:57,235 --> 00:58:02,885
But most labs will not do sequencing. It's too expensive and too time consuming.

530
00:58:02,885 --> 00:58:08,375
Next slide. So here's photo Croma Jones without the light. They're both colored with light exposure.

531
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:15,955
They get kind of orange ish. And it's this is not the best side, but I hope you can see that these are kind of orange ish colonies.

532
00:58:15,955 --> 00:58:20,965
Next slide. So conventional identification of MTB, we look for a rough and buff.

533
00:58:20,965 --> 00:58:26,395
Here we see here positive niacin and a positive nitrate.

534
00:58:26,395 --> 00:58:37,895
That's MTB. Next slide, so for full identification of of AFB, you have to be able to identify these groups, you have to.

535
00:58:37,895 --> 00:58:46,085
Well, we just just on the previous I told you how to identify MTB complex, but if that's negative, then you next thing most common,

536
00:58:46,085 --> 00:58:55,325
you look for avium intracellular car avium complex, then the photo chromosome ends and there you have to have two tubes for four each culture.

537
00:58:55,325 --> 00:59:01,385
One you incubate at a lower temperature, one at a higher temperature and the one at lower Typekit you exposed to light.

538
00:59:01,385 --> 00:59:08,285
Also, Kansas II, Marinho and Simi. And you do that with the lower temperature tube.

539
00:59:08,285 --> 00:59:13,865
And then you compare it to the growth in the higher temperature tube for the rapid rapid cause, which is group for you.

540
00:59:13,865 --> 00:59:21,005
Look, you think of them from sterile sites. There may have many isolations from different tissues and different specimens.

541
00:59:21,005 --> 00:59:30,545
They will be smear positive and only AFB will be present. Celestial sights blood is a common one or tissues deep tissues for other sterile sites.

542
00:59:30,545 --> 00:59:39,335
We need repeated isolation of the isolate, smear positivity and then whatever the physicians request with a good reason and

543
00:59:39,335 --> 00:59:45,925
writing papers may or may not be a good reason that's up to your laboratory to decide.

544
00:59:45,925 --> 00:59:54,895
Next slide. So what is it clinically significant non tuberculosis Mycobacterium, so it's non TB, it's it's nice.

545
00:59:54,895 --> 01:00:06,065
It has niacin, nitrate negative, three positive samples with negative smears for AFB, or two positive samples and one positive smear.

546
01:00:06,065 --> 01:00:13,235
Or if it's a bronchial wash specimen, you only have one specimen culture positive or AFB smear greater than two plus.

547
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:19,235
So a lot of organisms seen on the AFB smear or if it's from a sterile site, the same thing.

548
01:00:19,235 --> 01:00:25,715
And this all comes from the American Thoracic Society. Next slide.

549
01:00:25,715 --> 01:00:30,035
Well, what I mentioned HPLC, what about HPLC to identify mycobacteria?

550
01:00:30,035 --> 01:00:35,975
This was published by Dr. Kellogg and his research lab in 2001 and Joel Clinical Microbiology.

551
01:00:35,975 --> 01:00:40,025
They analyzed 370 stock isolates of Mycobacterium species.

552
01:00:40,025 --> 01:00:48,035
88 percent of them were given their species name by the Sherlock Michael Bacteria Identification System,

553
01:00:48,035 --> 01:00:54,395
and the overall predictive value of accuracy was 85 percent, but the range was 27 percent 100 percent.

554
01:00:54,395 --> 01:01:01,025
It could identify some that we have difficult or difficulty identifying, or they're more unusual species,

555
01:01:01,025 --> 01:01:06,335
and these include Mycobacterium slot of Mycobacterium mammal Anse and Mycobacterium mutagenic.

556
01:01:06,335 --> 01:01:12,125
But it could not differentiate between colony and abscesses.

557
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:20,075
The cost of the equipment is great, and $50000 in the service contract is generally about 4000 or more per year.

558
01:01:20,075 --> 01:01:32,075
The test cost, though, is very low. It's ten dollars and 94 cents per specimen tested, versus twenty six thousand fifty eight cents for a probe.

559
01:01:32,075 --> 01:01:42,525
Or over $42 for a biochemical I.D. They didn't say the turnaround times, but it said to be a very rapid test.

560
01:01:42,525 --> 01:01:50,895
Next slide. So but after HPLC came my friend maldi-tof and HFP ID, I love MALDI-TOF,

561
01:01:50,895 --> 01:01:58,755
so MALDI-TOF stands for matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spec maldi-tof mystic.

562
01:01:58,755 --> 01:02:05,115
And you can get mass spectral fingerprinting from mycobacterial cells.

563
01:02:05,115 --> 01:02:10,275
So studies show its works with 90 percent 97 percent.

564
01:02:10,275 --> 01:02:14,205
Almost 100 percent of the growth from LG Science work very well.

565
01:02:14,205 --> 01:02:16,335
And 77 percent from Midgard,

566
01:02:16,335 --> 01:02:26,775
probably because we have some contamination with other bacteria got correct identification of 311 strains of AFB, no misidentifications.

567
01:02:26,775 --> 01:02:33,495
It took only minutes for an answer, and it is inexpensive once you have the equipment in your laboratory.

568
01:02:33,495 --> 01:02:41,925
It is a serious alternative for mycobacterial identification, and I'm sorry I missed misspelled ID there.

569
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:47,925
This is published by Lowton. John Glenn Micro. In 2010, there was an 9H study that was published.

570
01:02:47,925 --> 01:02:55,125
In 2011, they looked at a database of 42 clinically relevant species, and these were extracted from solid auger.

571
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:58,995
All Mycobacterium tuberculosis were identified to complex,

572
01:02:58,995 --> 01:03:06,405
and they got species level identification for all but one Mycobacterium concessione and three related pairs.

573
01:03:06,405 --> 01:03:15,565
And they did use cell growth media for colonies that were identified, and this was published by S'éleve in JKM in 2011.

574
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:21,395
Next slide. So what about molecular identification methods for Mycobacterium?

575
01:03:21,395 --> 01:03:25,985
Well, we've already talked about MALDI-TOF multiple ToF is actually proteomics.

576
01:03:25,985 --> 01:03:34,175
There are AQ probes as a DNA probe, so I mentioned those before and they're available for tuberculosis and avium into salary megadonor

577
01:03:34,175 --> 01:03:39,815
and AMCON's RCI and these can be followed by up by biochemicals if they're all negative.

578
01:03:39,815 --> 01:03:45,395
I've mentioned the line probe assays. There are two different line probes assays commercially available,

579
01:03:45,395 --> 01:03:48,875
but they're manufactured outside of the United States, but they're distributed here.

580
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:55,355
One is the line pro by immuno genetics and one is genotype Mycobacterium by Heyn Life Science.

581
01:03:55,355 --> 01:04:00,365
Then we have amplification assays, sequencing and whatever else has been put on the market.

582
01:04:00,365 --> 01:04:07,595
So there are a number of commercial and homebrew brew amplification assays I would always stick with.

583
01:04:07,595 --> 01:04:18,425
Commercial commercial amplification of application assays are available commercially because they have gone through DNA review and then sequencing.

584
01:04:18,425 --> 01:04:20,255
If your lab is doing sequencing, they can do that.

585
01:04:20,255 --> 01:04:27,265
Also here in Michigan, the state lab does sequencing on all mycobacterial isolates submitted to them.

586
01:04:27,265 --> 01:04:33,715
Next slide. So we've talked about probes for Mycobacterium species, this is an AQ probe made by Hologic.

587
01:04:33,715 --> 01:04:37,225
It targets RNA. You could do in solution hybridization.

588
01:04:37,225 --> 01:04:44,365
It takes about an hour and a half, uses an academic master label on the probe and it measures in real,

589
01:04:44,365 --> 01:04:49,555
excuse me, in relative light units, and it's measured in this luminous emitter.

590
01:04:49,555 --> 01:05:00,605
If the if the in the processing the non-hybrid ice probe is removed via hybridization protection, this other assay the HP assay.

591
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:10,885
So you're sure you're not measuring any of the non-hybrid ICE probe when you get a positive unit of positivity in relative light units.

592
01:05:10,885 --> 01:05:24,055
Next slide. So how do we report results with AQ probe if the tbie probe is positive reported as positive for tuberculosis conflicts by probe?

593
01:05:24,055 --> 01:05:30,625
This includes tuberculosis and bovis, M Africanism and Microbe.

594
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:36,445
Yes, I am avium complex Mac probe is positive report is positive for Mycobacterium avium

595
01:05:36,445 --> 01:05:44,525
intracellular complex by probe and includes Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium it.

596
01:05:44,525 --> 01:05:53,935
If you intracellular excuse me if the AMCON's Haci or M Cardone probe is positive, report whichever's positive by that name.

597
01:05:53,935 --> 01:06:05,045
If all probes are negative, proceed with biochemical HPLC or sequencing, however you do the rest of your identification process.

598
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:11,195
Next slide. So here we have my friend maldi-tof.

599
01:06:11,195 --> 01:06:20,405
If Michael Bay, two species have been added and verified in the database database for the for the MALDI-TOF in use in your laboratory,

600
01:06:20,405 --> 01:06:25,025
use it for identification of isolates. I can't say it any any simpler.

601
01:06:25,025 --> 01:06:29,285
You can be you can use other molecular tests for identification or you can send it to public

602
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:35,045
health or other reference labs for identification and the necessary susceptibility testing.

603
01:06:35,045 --> 01:06:40,385
And remember, most of the public health labs only do susceptibility on tuberculosis complex.

604
01:06:40,385 --> 01:06:48,705
If it's one of the other Mycobacterium species, it needs to be sent to a reference lab.

605
01:06:48,705 --> 01:06:56,055
Next slide. So this is the line probe assay and what you do as you process your specimen and you

606
01:06:56,055 --> 01:07:02,715
put a drop on here and you see where you get a bar indicating that this organism say,

607
01:07:02,715 --> 01:07:09,145
say, I am me, I was present in the specimen. Next slide.

608
01:07:09,145 --> 01:07:14,905
So genotype Michael Bay Turnpikes, which is part of Haitian life science from Germany, has two different products.

609
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:20,965
They have a genotype Mycobacterium S.M, which has all the common species of Mycobacterium,

610
01:07:20,965 --> 01:07:28,255
and they have genotype A's, which has 17 additional species in addition to these.

611
01:07:28,255 --> 01:07:36,745
And so you can excuse me to 17 species, and some of them are the same as these and some of them are different.

612
01:07:36,745 --> 01:07:41,455
So then we have pyro sequencing, and this is the equipment for pyro sequencing.

613
01:07:41,455 --> 01:07:52,105
And if you go over here to the next slide, you can see if you pyro sequenced and isolate, you get this graph and it tells you what is.

614
01:07:52,105 --> 01:08:00,085
It's picking up in the graph. Electric pyro sequencing. And then you computer would ID like pyro sequencing?

615
01:08:00,085 --> 01:08:11,805
That patient has this. It tells you that it matches M. tuberculosis, but not an intracellular.

616
01:08:11,805 --> 01:08:17,955
So rapid recovery, rapid, I'd do it however you can, but get there accurately.

617
01:08:17,955 --> 01:08:24,165
There's no need to do a test that is rapid if you can't do it accurately.

618
01:08:24,165 --> 01:08:28,185
Next slide. When to send out unusual isolates?

619
01:08:28,185 --> 01:08:37,335
Well, if they're negative, there's no sequence biochemically an inert or the information that the lab turned out just wasn't helpful,

620
01:08:37,335 --> 01:08:42,915
or there was no answer from all this. Ask the lab to send it out all the reasons to send out to a reference.

621
01:08:42,915 --> 01:08:47,565
Lab physician requests repeated isolation from sterile sites.

622
01:08:47,565 --> 01:08:54,975
Curiosity academics such as paper writing. But I will say it is important to update the literature and what you ask for.

623
01:08:54,975 --> 01:08:58,695
You ask for sequencing. If it's for a research project, you may.

624
01:08:58,695 --> 01:09:05,275
Your research lab may have to pay for the sequencing. Next slide.

625
01:09:05,275 --> 01:09:11,245
So I'm going to talk a little bit about therapy, and then we'll cut this lecture off.

626
01:09:11,245 --> 01:09:22,735
So MTB therapy, multiple drugs are typically used to treat and to prevent the selection of resistant organisms, which can develop very, very quickly.

627
01:09:22,735 --> 01:09:27,355
You can use susceptibility testing results to modify empiric selection of drugs.

628
01:09:27,355 --> 01:09:36,215
So even though it takes two to three weeks before your MTB susceptibility testing is finalized, once you get those results,

629
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:43,565
you have a patient on and two other drugs and it's resistant to I.A. and one other drug, you have to replace it with at least.

630
01:09:43,565 --> 01:09:51,515
Two or three other drugs. Duration of therapy for TB is usually six to nine months.

631
01:09:51,515 --> 01:09:56,885
People who convert their skin test and are disease free, they have nothing on a chest X-ray.

632
01:09:56,885 --> 01:10:07,735
The specimens are negative, can take iron prophylaxis and that iron prophylaxis for new skin converts is generally six to nine months.

633
01:10:07,735 --> 01:10:14,485
What about susceptibility testing for the non-typical is Michael Bay to most labs, as I said before, do not do it.

634
01:10:14,485 --> 01:10:18,625
It's sent out for most organisms to a reference lab.

635
01:10:18,625 --> 01:10:23,825
However, rapid growers can be tested using more conventional methods such as broth, microevolution or etus.

636
01:10:23,825 --> 01:10:28,345
But once again, if you don't have the right containment facilities, you should not be doing this.

637
01:10:28,345 --> 01:10:39,895
And then what about prevention and prophylaxis? If anybody converts a skin test and some labs will offer BCG as a vaccine if people want to take it?

638
01:10:39,895 --> 01:10:48,525
It does contain the live attenuated strain of M. Bovis, but I don't know many labs that are doing that at the present time.

639
01:10:48,525 --> 01:10:56,115
The bigger issue is work in a safe environment. Work with all the containment that you can possibly get, whether it's.

640
01:10:56,115 --> 01:11:09,625
Lab gowns, gloves properly wearing a mask in a room with one pass air, working in a hood and so on.

641
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:16,545
So what data do you need to keep in your AFI lab for ongoing analysis, how many specimens were processed?

642
01:11:16,545 --> 01:11:21,805
Total and percent AFI smear positive and smear negative specimens.

643
01:11:21,805 --> 01:11:28,405
Total percent total in percent of AFI culture positive from smear negative and smear positive specimens,

644
01:11:28,405 --> 01:11:30,535
so yes, you will have some that are smear negative,

645
01:11:30,535 --> 01:11:40,265
but you can may still grow acid fast bacilli from them total and percent cultures belonging to the MTB complex and non tuberculous mycobacteria.

646
01:11:40,265 --> 01:11:48,915
The average time to detection of HIV positive cultures, whether they're smear positive or they're smear negative.

647
01:11:48,915 --> 01:11:58,305
What is the bacterial contamination rate? And you absolutely need to have the record of the technician or technologist who processed the specimen,

648
01:11:58,305 --> 01:12:04,035
since that is that is the person who's going in and out of that hood.

649
01:12:04,035 --> 01:12:11,235
And we need to keep that record on hand. Did they do a good job? Did they make mistakes and did they convert this skin test and a record of all

650
01:12:11,235 --> 01:12:15,315
specimens processed in a batch to make sure there wasn't cross-contamination?

651
01:12:15,315 --> 01:12:24,295
Record of the negative controls and the incubation temperature and these are all listed in the Selasi docket in 48.

652
01:12:24,295 --> 01:12:32,965
So I'm sure we all in this day and age know what this is, this is a a mask and we have to be very safe when we work with them.

653
01:12:32,965 --> 01:12:36,535
Tuberculosis, when we're working with in the on Michael Bacteriology,

654
01:12:36,535 --> 01:12:42,835
we don't know if the specimen is going to have him tuberculosis, M. avium and Consi or B not have anything in it.

655
01:12:42,835 --> 01:12:47,845
So we have to have that not all the right kind of containment in the building.

656
01:12:47,845 --> 01:12:51,505
We're working, we have to have good containment for our breathing and that means we're going to be

657
01:12:51,505 --> 01:12:57,505
a self three laboratory or a BSL two with BSL three practices where a lab gown,

658
01:12:57,505 --> 01:13:03,795
you don't take out of the laboratory, you wear it in 95 mask.

659
01:13:03,795 --> 01:13:11,585
And when wearing an N95 mask, you need to be fit tested to make sure that you're wearing it correctly.

660
01:13:11,585 --> 01:13:14,825
Next slide. What is the role of the health department?

661
01:13:14,825 --> 01:13:22,985
Their role is to identify and treat all patients with TB disease, ensure that patients complete appropriate therapy.

662
01:13:22,985 --> 01:13:28,025
They also need to identify and evaluate contacts to people with infectious TB and offer therapy

663
01:13:28,025 --> 01:13:38,545
as appropriate and screen high risk groups for TB infection and offer therapy as appropriate.

664
01:13:38,545 --> 01:13:47,275
Yeah. OK, so what are the TV trends, the United States? Well, while TV is declining in some populations, high rates persist among some groups,

665
01:13:47,275 --> 01:13:53,095
and the local epidemiology will certainly affect the trends in individual areas.

666
01:13:53,095 --> 01:14:01,375
Thirty four states have achieved the annual rate of less than three point five cases per 100000 population,

667
01:14:01,375 --> 01:14:12,525
and that was the elimination target for the year of 2000. I don't know how many achieved it by 2010 or 2020.

668
01:14:12,525 --> 01:14:19,735
So here we have reported TB cases in the United States 1982 and through 2014.

669
01:14:19,735 --> 01:14:30,655
And this was updated as of June 2015. And you can see that TB cases in 1982, we had over 25000 TB cases.

670
01:14:30,655 --> 01:14:42,415
There was a dip and then it went up in the low 1990s along with our AIDS epidemic, and then it came on down, came on down more and more.

671
01:14:42,415 --> 01:14:43,825
And it's still continue to go down.

672
01:14:43,825 --> 01:14:56,945
But it's the curve is getting flatter and flatter, and we're not seeing decreases as rapidly as rapidly as we did in the late 1990s.

673
01:14:56,945 --> 01:15:06,035
Next slide. Here we have TB incidence overall and among U.S. and foreign born persons by here in the United States 2000 through 2015,

674
01:15:06,035 --> 01:15:16,055
and this is a CDC document that they put out in 2016. So the top dotted line is among TB among foreign born persons,

675
01:15:16,055 --> 01:15:25,535
a solid line is overall the overall TB incidence and then the bottom line with the dashes is among U.S. born persons.

676
01:15:25,535 --> 01:15:36,695
And you can see among U.S. born persons the case. The number of TB cases per 100000 has gotten great its way down by 2014 and 15.

677
01:15:36,695 --> 01:15:49,185
However, we still need to work on the cases in other people and make sure that they are getting appropriate therapy for tuberculosis.

678
01:15:49,185 --> 01:16:02,445
Next slide. So TB case rates United States 2014, you can see the the states in blue had greater than three cases per 100000 population.

679
01:16:02,445 --> 01:16:08,445
There was only two states Arkansas and over there on the East Coast, Virginia,

680
01:16:08,445 --> 01:16:19,965
Maryland that had very high cases and most of the country had less than three killed three or less cases per 100000 population.

681
01:16:19,965 --> 01:16:27,795
I should say also, Alaska and the Hawaiian Islands have greater than three cases per 100000 population.

682
01:16:27,795 --> 01:16:34,415
As the District of Columbia and New York.

683
01:16:34,415 --> 01:16:45,065
So what are the. This is data from CDC also tuberculosis case counts and incidents by U.S. Census division and state for 2014 and 2015.

684
01:16:45,065 --> 01:16:53,945
And on the left hand side, we have a number of reported TB cases and on the right hand side, we have TB incidence per 100000 persons.

685
01:16:53,945 --> 01:17:01,535
So. You can see that on the left hand side, it goes down through the different parts of the United States.

686
01:17:01,535 --> 01:17:08,855
2000 New England, Middle Atlantic West, north central, south Atlantic, east, south, central west, south, central mountain and Pacific.

687
01:17:08,855 --> 01:17:16,865
So in 2014, there were nine thousand four hundred six cases of TB reported 2015 nine thousand five

688
01:17:16,865 --> 01:17:21,775
hundred sixty three thirty one point seven percent increase in the number of cases.

689
01:17:21,775 --> 01:17:28,485
We look at the incidence then per 100000 population in 2014 and 2015 2014,

690
01:17:28,485 --> 01:17:38,535
the incidence was two point nine cases per 100000 in 2015, three cases per 100000 and the percent change was 0.9 percent.

691
01:17:38,535 --> 01:17:46,425
Next slide. So then if we look at East, North Central, because that's where Michigan is and we look at the same types of data,

692
01:17:46,425 --> 01:17:53,025
in 2014, we had seven hundred thirty seven cases in east, north, central and Michigan had 105.

693
01:17:53,025 --> 01:17:55,935
In 2015, Michigan had 130.

694
01:17:55,935 --> 01:18:04,905
Why are by the number of reported cases in the East North Central Group went up to 802 with the percent change was positive 8.8 percent.

695
01:18:04,905 --> 01:18:16,845
If we look at TB incidence per 100000 population in 2014, one point one cases per 100000 population in in Michigan and in 2015,

696
01:18:16,845 --> 01:18:22,815
one point three percent change was twenty three point seven percent increase.

697
01:18:22,815 --> 01:18:28,905
And that is not good. That's not the way that we want to go with tuberculosis. Next slide.

698
01:18:28,905 --> 01:18:33,075
So I was able to find this slide on the CDC website.

699
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:41,385
Overall, TB incidence United States 2020 and so Wyoming did not report any TB cases.

700
01:18:41,385 --> 01:18:47,475
I asked my cousin, who's a physician in Wyoming, I said, really know TB and in Wyoming, he said, Don't tell anybody.

701
01:18:47,475 --> 01:18:58,365
So many states did have some. The light green met the 2025 target, which was one point three case per 100000 population or below.

702
01:18:58,365 --> 01:19:01,275
You can see many states, including Michigan, did that.

703
01:19:01,275 --> 01:19:10,575
And then in the darker green we had above the 20 25 average, but below the national average of 2.2 cases per 100000.

704
01:19:10,575 --> 01:19:15,205
And the states that are in Black California. Oh, Washington.

705
01:19:15,205 --> 01:19:17,595
No flashing, no. California, Texas.

706
01:19:17,595 --> 01:19:28,825
And over here on the East Coast, Baltimore, District of Columbia and different cities were above the national average,

707
01:19:28,825 --> 01:19:40,405
so they had more than 2.2 cases per 100000 population. So what factors contribute to the increase in TB morbidity?

708
01:19:40,405 --> 01:19:44,455
Increased immigration from high prevalence countries is very important.

709
01:19:44,455 --> 01:19:52,915
Lack of health care infrastructure in other countries, the HIV epidemic, the amount of TB went up dramatically when HIV started.

710
01:19:52,915 --> 01:19:59,455
Now, with better care for persons who are HIV positive, that rate of TB has decreased substantially.

711
01:19:59,455 --> 01:20:04,285
And then, of course, the development of multidrug resistant tuberculosis.

712
01:20:04,285 --> 01:20:09,145
Next slide, so reported cases of tea by country of origin in the United States,

713
01:20:09,145 --> 01:20:15,535
among cases among U.S. born and foreign born persons are declining, but much less so in foreign.

714
01:20:15,535 --> 01:20:21,385
Born in 2002, foreign born persons first accounted for the majority of U.S. TB cases, 51 percent of the cases.

715
01:20:21,385 --> 01:20:32,395
In 2009, it was 59 percent in foreign. Born in the the 1993 through 2009, that 10 year time period, more than 10 years time period.

716
01:20:32,395 --> 01:20:40,945
TB in four more persons was roughly level. In U.S. born, it dropped from 17000 to four thousand five hundred seventy one people, which is great.

717
01:20:40,945 --> 01:20:45,385
But we need to do better for everybody. Next slide.

718
01:20:45,385 --> 01:20:52,585
So here we have another slide on trends. It goes from 1993 through 2014 and the Green Dotted Line.

719
01:20:52,585 --> 01:20:57,475
The green triangle is a percentage of total cases and the yellow bar orange bars are the number of cases.

720
01:20:57,475 --> 01:21:03,235
And you can see the numbers were fairly steady between 1993 and 2008,

721
01:21:03,235 --> 01:21:10,065
and then they started dropping somewhat, but not as much as I would like them to drop.

722
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:19,725
Next slide. So when we talk about areas where there is a lot of tuberculosis, you think about the U.S. affiliated Pacific Islands,

723
01:21:19,725 --> 01:21:26,655
so we have Palau, Guam, Northern Marianas, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia and American Samoa.

724
01:21:26,655 --> 01:21:30,615
And you can see the Clal and Federated States of Micronesia.

725
01:21:30,615 --> 01:21:37,515
Their case rate is greater than 50 per 100000 population, whereby if you look at Northern Marianas and Gawande's,

726
01:21:37,515 --> 01:21:45,475
it's ten to forty nine point nine and over here in American Samoa, it's less than nine point nine cases per 100000.

727
01:21:45,475 --> 01:21:51,605
Next slide. So what about case rates in U.S. affiliate Pacific Islands in East?

728
01:21:51,605 --> 01:21:58,165
I know this is 2014 and we're now much later than that, but I couldn't find any more current data on U.S. overall.

729
01:21:58,165 --> 01:22:07,705
Three cases per 100000 Hawaii nine point six American Samoa 1.8 per 100000 Palau sixty six point one cases per 100000.

730
01:22:07,705 --> 01:22:13,825
Guam thirty four point eight North the Northern Marianas forty four point seven.

731
01:22:13,825 --> 01:22:19,645
Take a deep breath with this last two Federated States of Micronesia one hundred and fifty six point one cases per 100000,

732
01:22:19,645 --> 01:22:29,465
and in the Marshall Islands 212 cases twenty twelve point seven cases in in the Marshall Islands per 100000 population.

733
01:22:29,465 --> 01:22:37,745
So what about TB case rates by race and ethnicity? So the green bar is our Asian population.

734
01:22:37,745 --> 01:22:50,745
The red bar is the white Caucasians. The purple triangles are black or African Americans, and the gray bar is the average.

735
01:22:50,745 --> 01:22:54,395
It was, excuse me, the native or Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.

736
01:22:54,395 --> 01:23:00,725
So you can see overall, the case numbers for most groups are going down.

737
01:23:00,725 --> 01:23:09,385
However, we need to be do better with our Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders.

738
01:23:09,385 --> 01:23:17,705
Next slide. So we reported TB cases by age group and so very low rates, if a person is less than 15 years old,

739
01:23:17,705 --> 01:23:27,145
five percent 15 to 24, 10 percent 25 to 44, 30 percent 45 to 64 years old, 31 percent.

740
01:23:27,145 --> 01:23:38,935
And then people who are 65 years old, their case rate of reported cases by age group is 24 percent of this total of 100 percent.

741
01:23:38,935 --> 01:23:45,595
And so much of this reflects people who were infected at a very young age.

742
01:23:45,595 --> 01:23:49,195
Next slide. So this is a very old man from 2013.

743
01:23:49,195 --> 01:24:04,615
Tuberculosis in Michigan and Southeast Michigan is kind of a hotspot, as is are certain places in the tip of the of the mitten and then up in the U.P.

744
01:24:04,615 --> 01:24:08,905
And here we have a comparison of TV cases among foreign born persons in the United States.

745
01:24:08,905 --> 01:24:14,365
And it is slowly getting better in 2014 versus 10 years ago.

746
01:24:14,365 --> 01:24:22,355
But I'll be interested in see what shows up in 2020 for.

747
01:24:22,355 --> 01:24:30,995
Actually, I said that incorrectly, it's getting worse in 2014, there are some areas that are better, but several areas of the of the country in 2014,

748
01:24:30,995 --> 01:24:40,535
including the the middle, the East and Middle East part of the United States certainly has more cases than they had in 2004.

749
01:24:40,535 --> 01:24:50,375
Sorry about that error. Next slide. So here we have two cases and incidents by origin of birth 1993 through 2020.

750
01:24:50,375 --> 01:24:54,705
And you can show that the purple line down at the bottom are non-U.S.

751
01:24:54,705 --> 01:24:58,625
It's a non-U.S. born rate. The that's the blue line.

752
01:24:58,625 --> 01:25:07,005
Excuse me, the purple line is the U.S. born rate. The blue bars are nine U.S. born persons and the pink bars are U.S. born persons.

753
01:25:07,005 --> 01:25:18,045
It's getting better for everyone. And the rate in the United States is staying very low, but we still have work to do a lot of work to do.

754
01:25:18,045 --> 01:25:22,545
Next slide. Oh, you've already seen this as a duplicate.

755
01:25:22,545 --> 01:25:25,815
And here we have countries of birth for foreign born persons with TB.

756
01:25:25,815 --> 01:25:36,265
This is an old slide from 2005, but you can see that the red is Kenya the this green bar, green lines.

757
01:25:36,265 --> 01:25:47,595
That's India and certain other countries Southeast Asia, particularly Mexico and so on, still have a lot of tuberculosis.

758
01:25:47,595 --> 01:25:55,665
And so going on, we've this factors contributing to the burden of disease in minorities, so in foreign countries,

759
01:25:55,665 --> 01:26:00,335
for more people, disease may result from infection in the country of origin, not from infection.

760
01:26:00,335 --> 01:26:02,265
Here, once they hit the United States,

761
01:26:02,265 --> 01:26:08,595
some minority groups have a higher proportion of risk factors for exposure and for progression from infection to disease.

762
01:26:08,595 --> 01:26:13,425
And this is, of course, linked to lower socioeconomic status in crowded housing.

763
01:26:13,425 --> 01:26:19,355
Much, much greater risk of increased TB risk. Next slide.

764
01:26:19,355 --> 01:26:26,645
So here we have an ad in HIV co-infection with TB in the United States 1993 through 2012.

765
01:26:26,645 --> 01:26:32,525
And you can see the pink for aged 25 to 44, and the reddish far maroon bar is all ages.

766
01:26:32,525 --> 01:26:37,385
The numbers have come down, but they're not down as far as we would all like to see them.

767
01:26:37,385 --> 01:26:45,415
But certainly we have done a great deal to decrease the incidence of TB in persons with HIV.

768
01:26:45,415 --> 01:26:50,485
So what about multidrug TB, it's a serious public health concern.

769
01:26:50,485 --> 01:26:54,295
It's decreased in foreign born and u.s.-born, but much more in the U.S. foreign.

770
01:26:54,295 --> 01:27:00,955
This is an older side. I didn't have time to update this as of 2010, but you can see the red bars are foreign born.

771
01:27:00,955 --> 01:27:10,485
We still have it. It seems to be in rather a steady state if you just draw a line across the center there, but it needs to come down.

772
01:27:10,485 --> 01:27:15,975
And then, of course, extensively drug resistant TB, I don't know if you can actually see this is rare type of MDR-TB.

773
01:27:15,975 --> 01:27:23,595
It's resistant isoniazid or Fanfan, the fluoroquinolones and one of three injectable second line drugs.

774
01:27:23,595 --> 01:27:30,015
We don't have any apparent trend for XDR TB in the United States.

775
01:27:30,015 --> 01:27:36,795
Next slide. So what is TBE cost? This is in 2020 dollars 19.

776
01:27:36,795 --> 01:27:44,415
The costs for a case of not MDR TB versus MDR-TB versus XDR extensively drug resistant.

777
01:27:44,415 --> 01:27:50,265
So direct treatment costs for non MDR-TB is about twenty thousand two hundred eleven dollars.

778
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:57,225
For MDR multidrug resistant TB, it's much higher 182 over one hundred eighty two thousand dollars,

779
01:27:57,225 --> 01:28:03,215
and if it's XDR extensively drug resistant, over $500000.

780
01:28:03,215 --> 01:28:18,845
If it's the cost of societal with without deaths in the United States or for non MDR TB is twenty four thousand six hundred dollars for MDR-TB,

781
01:28:18,845 --> 01:28:30,575
goes up to cost US society three hundred forty seven thousand three hundred twenty four dollars and the cost for XDR TB is over $700000.

782
01:28:30,575 --> 01:28:37,235
And then societal cost without deaths. Non MDR over $67000.

783
01:28:37,235 --> 01:28:47,015
MDR four hundred nineteen thousand five hundred thirty dollars is an average and then for XDR TB over 800 thousand dollars.

784
01:28:47,015 --> 01:28:57,995
We need to do better. We need to do much better. So a little bit on just before we finish up Michigan TBP in 2021,

785
01:28:57,995 --> 01:29:04,995
there were 136 people with TV in Michigan and the case rate was one point four per 100000 people.

786
01:29:04,995 --> 01:29:11,595
Michigan counties in TV cases and rates from 20, 27, 2017 to 2027.

787
01:29:11,595 --> 01:29:15,045
You can click on this line and it will show you the data.

788
01:29:15,045 --> 01:29:24,735
It was updated in January 2022 by the Health Department contains TBE case numbers and rates by county averaging from 2017 through 2021.

789
01:29:24,735 --> 01:29:32,595
If you have any questions, let me know. There's also an infographic on TB from 2019 and an infographic on take on tuberculosis.

790
01:29:32,595 --> 01:29:37,215
I will try and get this. Hopefully, I can do that. Nope, can't do it.

791
01:29:37,215 --> 01:29:40,755
OK, you'll have to do it on your own next to the last slide.

792
01:29:40,755 --> 01:29:47,475
SUMMARY Our main responsibility in the official lab is to use best methods for isolation of Mycobacterium species,

793
01:29:47,475 --> 01:29:51,435
especially tuberculosis, as rapidly as possible.

794
01:29:51,435 --> 01:29:57,225
Broth should always be included in mycobacterial cultures, not just agriculture, but broth cultures also.

795
01:29:57,225 --> 01:30:05,175
Rapid methods have been developed for identification of MTB and mont. mycobacteria other than typical tuberculosis.

796
01:30:05,175 --> 01:30:10,635
Laboratories need to remain diligent about their use and flexible as new technologies arrive,

797
01:30:10,635 --> 01:30:18,285
and MALDI-TOF should be used if available and if it can be used carefully without any hazards for identification.

798
01:30:18,285 --> 01:30:23,725
You must be aware of the epidemiology and the history of tuberculosis.

799
01:30:23,725 --> 01:30:29,827
And then thanks. This is a long lecture. Thank you for listening to it.
