1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:06,450
Hi everyone, and welcome back to Part Two of letters of recommendation. Again,

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,300
this is Krystle, using she/her pronouns at the University Michigan School of Public Health Careers Office.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,370
In this part of the session we'll be thinking about what makes a really strong letter of recommendation?

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,990
Which can be good information for you to have, particularly if you're drafting your own,

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:28,680
but also as you're thinking about brainstorming, the different types of information that you'll be including for your recommender.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,910
Finally, it can also be a great frame of reference for you as a future professional when you're

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,140
reviewing your own letters of recommendation or writing ones for other people.

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,300
We know that you're going to be the leaders of public health,

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,870
and so there will come a time when you are going to be writing your own letters of recommendation to support other people's candidacy,

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:52,510
either in jobs or in their applications. So let's take a look.

11
00:00:52,510 --> 00:01:01,160
So the typical structure is that this is going to be a business letter, very similar to a cover letter in where you will have a header with your name,

12
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:09,210
a date in which it's turned in, some contact information for the place that the individual is applying and a very formal greeting, such as dear,

13
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,170
the name of the person, followed by a colon, not a comma.

14
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:20,370
Fun fact, in professional writing it's always a colon, not a comma, because a comma is considered too personal.

15
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,400
The weird things of grammar. Here we are.

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:31,410
This letter should be structured fairly simply, with four to five paragraphs that include an introduction and a conclusion.

17
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:39,450
It should be at least one complete page, unless otherwise stated in the description of what is required from the letter.

18
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,600
If available, we want to use organization letterhead,

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,530
because this makes us look a little bit fancier and a little bit more formal. And should include relevant position titles and appointments,

20
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,180
including professor, faculty, PHD,

21
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:02,200
so those, like, honorariums and titles that people will often have associated with their names in higher education.

22
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:09,360
A pro tip on this one is that if you add a picture of your signature, it helps it to really stand out as a polished document.

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,590
An easy way to do this is to either sign on a touch screen using a pen,

24
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:22,800
we don't recommend using your finger, because it tends to tends to turn out a little bit grainy or having a saved photocopy of your actual signature.

25
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,990
A good way to do this is to write it on a blank note card with a thick black gel pen and then, having a friend do it with you,

26
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:35,280
hold up your note card, you have your friend shine their flashlight on the note card from the phone,

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,180
and then you're going to place your phone to take a photo above the flashlight looking down on the note card.

28
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,750
The flashlight is important because it helps us to be able to remove the background

29
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,830
on the back of your signature and really make sure that it stands out as a proper,

30
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:58,980
just black text ink line on the document. What I like about having it saved as a picture, is then you can also resize it so it can fit whatever

31
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,810
space you have available at the bottom, and it'll be useful for cover letters moving forward.

32
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:11,630
So just a pro tip to help you both in the cover letter and the recommendation situations.

33
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:19,490
This is what a typical document will look like. Again, you will notice that it is in business format, where it's completely left justified,

34
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,630
there is no indentations, there are only lines separating our paragraphs,

35
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:28,160
and it's all single spaced. If you are thinking about using letterhead,

36
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,610
make sure that the font is matching or at least similar between the letterhead and the text of the body, because that makes it look consistent,

37
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:39,320
and anytime we can do that in an application process, the better.

38
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:46,700
If you have questions, there are lots of templates that are available out there. I would just caution you against making sure that it's not too fancy.

39
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:52,430
If there's a lot of color, a lot of different graphics, it's really hard for an application to load those,

40
00:03:52,430 --> 00:04:00,230
and so we want to stick to something simple. Sometimes the date looks a little bit different or the top of the header looks a little bit different,

41
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:07,950
but we still want to include as much of that information as possible.

42
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:14,580
Alright, so content. Here is a sample idea of what would go into each of the paragraphs.

43
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,630
The introduction is often typically what we would see in an introduction.

44
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,840
It is kind of, who are we talking about as an individual? How long has the recommender known you,

45
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:32,550
in what capacity, and what is that person's current role? In describing so much about the recommender and not necessarily the recommendee

46
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:42,270
in this introduction, it gives the recommender some validity to be able to speak on your qualifications for the program or within the application.

47
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,490
The introduction, if you want to pro tip here, could end with a concluding statement,

48
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,960
if we think similar to a thesis statement in any type of academic writing.

49
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,740
So that thesis statement will outline what the reader is going to talk about

50
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,410
in the body paragraphs. So that could be an example such as below,

51
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:07,500
I will highlight, name of person who's being recommended, qualifications for the position

52
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,770
through demonstrating their skills in paragraph one, paragraph two, paragraph three.

53
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:20,880
What that does, is it makes the letter very scannable and so that the readers of your applications don't have to do a lot of work to be able to

54
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:28,650
see that you truly are the best fit for the position or the program, because you have the skills and qualifications that they're looking for.

55
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,110
So let's think about those body paragraphs.

56
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:37,800
We can also think about these as detailed paragraphs where the recommender is going to be providing specific

57
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,850
examples about the skills and qualifications that you have that will meet the position or program's requirements.

58
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:54,540
We want to make sure to name those skills or experiences as they relate to the position and give examples and how the reader knows that to be true.

59
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:00,240
We want to make sure that we are giving these specific examples, because anytime we have just a list of attributes,

60
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:08,070
it's not going to go over as well as saying these are the concrete things that I know about this applicant, based on their past performance.

61
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:13,200
Examples are always much more powerful, because they can demonstrate our ability to do the job,

62
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,690
just not stating that we have the skills to do the job.

63
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:23,630
If you find yourself in a case where maybe you overcame a challenge or had weaknesses in an area,

64
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,650
we want to make sure that the letter of recommendation is also addressing those.

65
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,820
It's okay to not be a perfect applicant, because none of us are perfect,

66
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:39,470
and so this can actually be to your benefit when you're showing an active ability to improve yourself or your qualifications for the job,

67
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:46,490
because that shows a commitment to continuous learning, which is always desirable for just about any employer.

68
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,440
And then finally, we could also note for the letter recommendations that if the individual who's

69
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,690
being recommended has overcome any challenges, or hardships, or unexpected things,

70
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:04,100
that made the example a little bit harder to achieve, the recommender can note this to make you stand out even farther as someone who's willing to go

71
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,980
above and beyond to achieve the expectations that they're looking for. In the body paragraphs,

72
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,720
we should again follow a fairly strong structure where we have a topic sentence that is

73
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,400
giving an outline of what is within those paragraphs, and then a concluding statement

74
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,870
at the end of each paragraph that is going to wrap up the main details of what has

75
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:29,030
been said and the evidence that has been provided to prove that topic sentence.

76
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,350
And then finally, we're going to be wrapping up with a conclusion.

77
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:39,110
The conclusions should start with a restatement of the thesis or retelling of the main points in the body paragraphs.

78
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:44,120
That makes the entire letter very, very scannable, which is great for a reader, because then again,

79
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,030
they don't have to do a lot of work to know that you're going to be the best candidate for the position.

80
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,010
We want to make sure, if possible,

81
00:07:52,010 --> 00:08:00,890
that the recommender is also noting if they would recommend you for a similar position if they had the agency to hire or to accept you.

82
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:05,390
So a common example, could be if there is a faculty member that you were asking to write

83
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,950
a letter of recommendation and they don't have a grad program that you're looking at,

84
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:15,380
but the faculty member could note that they would recommend you for a master's program

85
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,570
in their school if they were able, or if they would hire you on as a research assistant,

86
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:27,560
and that's what you're applying for. When possible, it can also help to a letter of recommendation to stand out,

87
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,530
if there is a comparison between you and how that recommender has seen other students in your capacity.

88
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:41,750
So, for an example, Miss Chang is in the top five percent of students with whom I've worked with in my seven year career. Notably in this statement,

89
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,550
there's two different qualifiers, the five percent and seven years.

90
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,530
The more specific the statement, the better,

91
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:55,220
because that helps the reader to really understand what is the context in which this person is recommending you.

92
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:01,970
So, again, there's a lot of flexibility, but really we want to focus on, are there specific details that will provide evidence on why you are

93
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,980
going to be the best candidate for either the position or the program that you're applying to?

94
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,330
And we want to make sure to have a very straightforward structure that will allow

95
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:17,680
the reader to easily gain the information and details that they're looking for.

96
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:24,770
So a few notes on style. We want to make sure that, of course, the spelling and grammar of this letter are impeccable.

97
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:32,570
We want to remember that Grammarly, spell check, etc., will not accept all of our changes and sometimes it just misses them.

98
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:39,020
One of my favorite jokes in public health is that we want to make sure that you always have one T on your but instead of two.

99
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,510
So make sure to do those careful read-throughs to ensure that your document is really polished.

100
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,650
A good way to do this is to read it out loud to yourself slowly and to someone who

101
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:54,740
really understands your past experience, and can speak honestly to you.

102
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:01,010
We want to make sure additionally, outside of really having a stand out document, is that this is honest.

103
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:05,180
It's really easy to overexaggerate or under sell your experience.

104
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,890
And so that's again, where it can come in

105
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:14,030
helpful to have a good conversation with your recommender and yourself about what is it that you would like to have them focus on,

106
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:21,470
and how can you maximize the past opportunities as they relate to what the current program is looking for?

107
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:29,930
Again, we want to make sure that we are specific as possible and to avoid generalities and cliches. So those examples really stand out,

108
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:39,500
instead of listing someone who has a long list of qualities that may relate to the position, but without specific examples on how it is true.

109
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,010
Finally,

110
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:49,830
we want to make sure that we're infusing, as much as possible, field-specific language, and or the organization's mission/vision/values.

111
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,420
Anytime you can have a relationship between the documents that you're using

112
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:58,160
to apply for the program and the language that that program or position uses,

113
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,390
the better it is that you're going to stand out.

114
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:08,180
And finally, the pro tip here, is that honest, written from the heart, genuine letters are easy to read.

115
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:15,320
Oftentimes, a reader can tell when there is an honest, genuine part that is writing for a letter of recommendation.

116
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:22,920
These really stand out amongst the readers and help you to shine amongst the application process.

117
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,020
Next, we're going to be looking at just some additional advice and some common questions that we get as a part of this presentation.

118
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:35,260
So it's a little bit hodgepodge. But hold with me, because I'm sure that you'll have a good couple tidbits here.

119
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,770
First, we always get questions about the confidentiality notice.

120
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:43,690
Many times, when you're submitting a letter of recommendation, there will be a box that says,

121
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:50,650
I waive by rights to be able to read this letter. This typically, is after the letter has been submitted.

122
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:55,990
That's not saying that you can't be a part of the process or read and approved the letter beforehand.

123
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:02,380
It's just, that you're waiving your right to see the final document, after it's turned in.

124
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,600
Likely there is some kind of submission timestamp or a signature seal that encloses

125
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,740
these letters to make sure that we haven't read them after they've been submitted,

126
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:20,080
but it is possible to read them beforehand. We can make sure to always read these waivers before you sign them to make sure that you're

127
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,400
understanding the specific terms and conditions, because not all of them are the same.

128
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,540
And Krystal is not a lawyer, so I can't give you any type of legal advice,

129
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:34,780
I'm just giving you some things to look for when you're reading through that waiver.

130
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,410
The next thing that we often get questions on is, how do I say thank you?

131
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:44,760
My writer of my letter of recommendation has really come through for me.

132
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:53,510
Maybe they turned-around in a pinch, maybe they gave me a stellar recommendation with tons of examples and followed all the pro tips for writing,

133
00:12:53,510 --> 00:13:00,730
and so how do I say thank you? I would say first, most common is to follow up with an email.

134
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,290
It's absolutely appropriate in most cases and can be quite personal,

135
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,700
especially if you put some time and thought into how you're writing that appreciation

136
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:16,360
email. A good way to follow up with this is to also provide the recommender with updates.

137
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,900
And so, where are you in the application process? Have you heard back?

138
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,470
Have you not heard back? Did you turn everything in?

139
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,900
Oftentimes, the people that are writing your letter of recommendation for you are really invested in you as a human being,

140
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,790
and so they like hearing about your progress and where you are

141
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:37,480
as things stand. As a letter of recommendation writer myself,

142
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:45,020
I know it's sometimes just really sad to write these letters and spend so much time and effort and emotion in them and then just to never hear back.

143
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,900
Like, I don't know if they got the program. I don't know if they were successful.

144
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:55,030
And so we do recommend giving them a little bit of a follow up as much as possible,

145
00:13:55,030 --> 00:14:01,210
but then also trying to continue that relationship. You'll never know when you'll need a letter of recommendation in the future,

146
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,550
and so you want to make sure that you're protecting that moving forward.

147
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:11,070
On that note, I would remind you that all letters of recommendation have a two sided relationship.

148
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:15,630
You can also give back to your person that is writing for you by sending them messages,

149
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,490
following up on their research interest or even just keeping in contact.

150
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:26,760
We want to make sure that we are also potentially following up on their advice and to do items.

151
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:34,110
Oftentimes, these people who are writing our letters of recommendations can easily transition into a mentor or advocate role.

152
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:42,640
And so when you're able to create this two-sided relationship, then you're helping to foster something that you could potentially use in the future.

153
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:48,550
If you're worried about the time commitment for this, I would encourage you to try to figure out some kind of system on how you're

154
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:53,650
going to provide professional updates to your network.

155
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:59,230
Personally, I send out a update email around the end of the year because it just feels appropriate,

156
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:06,280
everyone's reflecting on the end of the year and how things went. And then I also send out one on my birthday, because why not?

157
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,820
I like sending people some information about who I am. Most of the time,

158
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:16,690
I only post it on my LinkedIn profile, and people can view it if they want to or they can ignore it if they want.

159
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:23,680
And then I have an individual follow up with each of the people that I would consider mentors at various stages in my careers.

160
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:32,530
So this includes one of my favorite faculty members, my undergraduate thesis advisor, my grad school advisor, my grad school practicum person.

161
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:39,370
And then one of my first bosses who really just invested in me as a professional and really made sure that I was set up to succeed.

162
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:44,290
And so that's only five emails, as opposed to everyone in my network.

163
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:50,380
And so, it can be a little bit intimidating when you first think about this two-sided relationship factor,

164
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:57,730
but if you're intentional about the ones that you're fostering and the way that you are engaging in your network, it's definitely doable.

165
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:05,710
And then finally, you can see these links for additional resources and tips about letters of recommendation and moving forward.

166
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,540
So that's it for me.

167
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:15,670
Best of luck on presenting yourself and your best way that you can, using those evidence and key points to show your skills and qualifications

168
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,560
in a letter of recommendation. Take care.
