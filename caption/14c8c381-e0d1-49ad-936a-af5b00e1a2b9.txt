1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,459
This is really a new topic today. We'll talk about a waste water pest.

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,490
Epidemiology is a new topic.

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:20,670
We we we as a inquiry hear from the research and we think it's also very likely.

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,980
So we think about the urban water cycle.

5
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:33,230
But think about the urban water cycle. Think about the water over one cycle.

6
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:40,230
So what we have. Think about other words, like, what do we have?

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,650
The infrastructure and the sources are cleaning process, distribution and monitoring and testing.

8
00:00:51,630 --> 00:01:01,330
Okay, so we have all these materials, right? So you think about all three, the typical other water cycle we have.

9
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,730
So we have 51. Some plays have grown more to the surface.

10
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,860
Water is where we get our water to drink.

11
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,970
Right. And also, that's also a place for this stretch. For the suits to dissent.

12
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,440
So that's one big component of the urban development.

13
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,040
You need to find the source of the water you can use. Okay.

14
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:34,600
Either or you can hear from someone. Right from one and then withdraw the water from the surface of the water.

15
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:43,140
Retrieve it. We choose them so that we can provide safe and clean water.

16
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,070
To the puppet. To the album Arabesque. Right.

17
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,980
And then within all these buildings, we have all these visual areas we have, and then we also produce.

18
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,700
The whistleblower lawsuit will produce. Right.

19
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,140
The studio will produce. So what we do with that?

20
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,780
Which is it? Before discharge into our son's law.

21
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,860
And we also have the Oval Office, and we also have a stonewall.

22
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,460
So we had heavy rain. Heavy snow. We cut them. Through the pipes.

23
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,709
To the Civil War or sometimes a diffuse infrastructure.

24
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:35,910
What we want to do is for. Right.

25
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,720
So that's the the typical over one cycle we have.

26
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,830
So now. With it in terms of the regulations laws we have in the United States.

27
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,220
So for each sector, what are we what do we call? What do we regulate?

28
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,500
What laws we regulate the each sector for surface water, what we have.

29
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:05,060
So clean water at the surface water, including the width, was tremendous.

30
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:14,240
Stormwater management. All this under the Clean Water Act so that we would be able to maintain.

31
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,350
Ethically. I've also thought of something. Especially if many of your.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,300
And then on the other, of course, we have. Genealogical process.

33
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,520
That's under the. But you don't have to.

34
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:40,260
So if you want to act right to use the Safe Drinking Water Act to regulate.

35
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,770
To provide a clean and safe water. We use a model based approach for.

36
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,880
Now, when the water get into the buildings, the building runs.

37
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,360
Like in a hospital, you in these area, all these goodies.

38
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,640
Do we have any regulations coming in the work for this year?

39
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,500
Once it gets into the building. Mm hmm. Okay, so we don't really test, right?

40
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,010
So we have these guidelines. Okay.

41
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,820
We have the individual association guidelines.

42
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:23,300
CDC provides them with guidelines. Okay.

43
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:29,650
Everyone like the swimming pool, all these. We don't really have the regulations like this, but.

44
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:40,959
So we have the code. We have the guidance. In terms of the how can we manage the water quality in these as a typical global war cycle?

45
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,040
We have, but not quite. So traditionally.

46
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,150
Right. Traditionally, we consider the suits.

47
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,900
To produce on a daily basis as a waste. Right.

48
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,370
That's the one we are doing. Okay. So we consider that as a waste.

49
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:07,280
So before discharge into the water, what we used to do, we just remove the components.

50
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:17,780
Okay. Remove the contaminants. So the issue they always I mean we have we one of the focus is to remove the or get any matters.

51
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:30,270
Right to remove the organic matter. So removes some of the nutrients and the remove the positive bacteria organisms.

52
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,230
So with a wet, hot human process, that's not what we do. Right.

53
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:41,820
That's a typical designed was what you apply. Is to remove contaminants from the water.

54
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:47,070
Before you do studies of some sort. So that we can maintain our quality.

55
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,660
I mean, this works very well in the practice. So.

56
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,890
Still we consider the latter, such as the west of the west.

57
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,530
Now with the water because of warm water concepts with the water.

58
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:14,320
One more concept. Especially like in some areas, like the lack of the surface, the water, the lack of the groundwater.

59
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,540
What they need to do. We recycle the waste water.

60
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,580
Okay, so is it all not only consider the waste water as a waste.

61
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:33,770
But if that's the concealer, what other resources? Look at the one resource.

62
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,020
It is alternative resource for the water supplies.

63
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,460
Okay. So the water supplies. Of.

64
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:50,370
Because they cannot find suitable sums of water in many cases, even in some areas, for example, every four.

65
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:56,430
However, we probably should also give this technology away. Okay.

66
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,870
To recycle the waste water. So that's the truth.

67
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,870
We do not consider the waste water as just a waste.

68
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:13,770
We consider that other resources, you get resources not only just for the water.

69
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,510
But also we consider the wastewater as a resource for.

70
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,960
Energy. Okay. The reason for that is we have all this organic matter, right?

71
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:34,470
With organic matter in the water. We use my coldness to degrade them.

72
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,450
We put the bubbles, the oxygen to digest them.

73
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:47,130
And then we know that we have that increase, that the produce the heat produce the CO2 can produce the energy.

74
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,050
Now. Can we recover the energy from that?

75
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:00,430
So I said, can we remove the contaminants before getting surface water can recover the algae from.

76
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,460
Okay. That's the new concept of consider the West.

77
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,760
What are the resources and also missions? Okay.

78
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,410
We have the first one into the water. We have the library in the war. Can we use that as a resources for the nations, for the regions?

79
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:26,810
We do already apply this right when we have the suits, the citizens.

80
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:32,270
The song is the soldier. We have you some time.

81
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,139
We applied to the field, to landfill, to land, to the land, to the farmers.

82
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:44,960
So to the farm so that they can provide this the nutrients and other elements to recondition the soil.

83
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,930
As a practice already, that's already used out the resources. Okay, but now can we do this even more than that?

84
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,590
We can just separate them. We come from that.

85
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,430
One of the work has been done, has been ongoing, is really to separate the urine from feces.

86
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:12,130
Okay. So now when you think about these processes, we have economies together both in terms of the treatment process.

87
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:20,330
If you separately root, for example, and the quicker you can get some, you should do some of this from the US and a separate from faces and then less.

88
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:27,230
Then footprints make a big area we use for wastewater to be shrink can be used is much of less.

89
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,340
Okay. So that's in terms of the now, what's the health aspect?

90
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:41,530
Okay. What's the health aspects associated with this? That's all engineering you, Rambow versus LBJ.

91
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,670
We can think about to get the resources from the West or use West for other resources.

92
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,360
And we also can use a water recycler to reclaim water.

93
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:57,440
When you do the recycling, usually the treatment is the key. You cannot.

94
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,220
We would have to do an advanced treatment to remove the contaminants from the wastewater before we can use the source.

95
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,250
I mean, Singapore, for example, has been do a tremendous, fantastic job to do this.

96
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,640
They almost recycle every drop of the wastewater.

97
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,670
Singapore is a city that almost recycle any every drop of the wastewater.

98
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,160
Because they did produce the water water for the new water.

99
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:33,209
So what they do is actually the concept they have is when is it true the water to the waste water and

100
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:38,240
then the blended with the groundwater with the selling water at the source for drinking water which with.

101
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:46,670
Okay. Instead of use that as a source source of the drinking water source, the president stated and to this does wait.

102
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:55,120
But there's another issue that we need to think about from the health health concerns, especially for the reclamation required of the water.

103
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:02,680
And that's the the virus. When you do the treatment of this, it's very difficult to get rid of the virus.

104
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:11,620
Some of the virus in the water. Okay. So they have to do further documents in hard to remove the virus eradicate of the virus from that.

105
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:20,770
So that's that's the concept of the paradigm shift in terms of not only just consider the wastewater of the West,

106
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,050
we also consider the wastewater other resources. Okay.

107
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:31,010
And the resources. Now come back to this topic.

108
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:38,730
The weather, what they're gonna get as another part of this shift is really we're not conceding the waste water sewage system,

109
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:44,610
other other waste collection. We consider this other information.

110
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,230
Source. Source for the information and a source for the health information.

111
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,300
And also a source for other social behavior information.

112
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,760
So why would you do this? Why would you do this? So look over here.

113
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:13,440
We have the residential area, this building, all this.

114
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:19,020
We have this sewage collection system. Right. We have all these pipes connect to the sewage.

115
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:26,000
Okay. The suit. From residual from.

116
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:32,990
The various areas where. All the waste we produce.

117
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,380
The surgical produce will be collected through the pipes.

118
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,639
And then we'll deal with them all through the future.

119
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,100
The wastewater treatment plants to do so. How these later will go.

120
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,370
Pipes already built. Right. Well, good.

121
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,210
So the c most of the open. See do that.

122
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,740
They are in charge of to maintain these pipes.

123
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,490
Make sure that the world. Okay.

124
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,180
So every time when you flush your toilet. You know, it'll go somewhere.

125
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:17,990
Okay. You don't really worry about where it goes. Go somewhere. And that's in the through the public system.

126
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:27,250
We know in some places that we have a simpler social system. The social system is separate from the from the stormwater.

127
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,060
And some places we have a combined solar system. So you have the water from.

128
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:42,790
The the storm mixed with the sewage and then transported into the water supply.

129
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:49,350
That's the the the the the practice I especially the old developments or areas

130
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:54,780
with a new development most now they require specific resources in the old city.

131
00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:02,540
For example, we have this combined solar system. Think about this now.

132
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,180
Think about it. Take a minute to think about this. So.

133
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,520
When you flush the toilet. You can already give the information.

134
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,400
But. But into the sewage system.

135
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:26,340
So, you know, that's the when President Nixon, president of the United States, went with these foreign countries.

136
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,830
Okay. When you visit foreign countries, you collect the all that euro officials.

137
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,230
Okay. On the airplane. Keep it.

138
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:42,430
Bring them back. Okay.

139
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:49,150
That's the practice. Why is it? Why is it?

140
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:56,130
Because they can through that information they can get this and they get the health information that.

141
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,570
As a national secrets. Right.

142
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,880
The health status of the is.

143
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,900
This was a group that discussed classified information.

144
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:19,469
So they don't want the other. For a boy to have that information.

145
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:26,640
How we can use that information. And also they you also think about it.

146
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,810
Okay. So so that's a practice. I mean, that's a project.

147
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:35,370
But that also means that, yes, we do have this information collected.

148
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:44,760
So you can consider this. I don't know to the urination system we have.

149
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:51,810
I just assume we have important fights. So sometimes when you go to see the physician, they will take the urine materials,

150
00:15:52,450 --> 00:16:00,050
the surfaces with your nose, and it will test on the packages or other metabolites indicators.

151
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,540
Sure you can give us information from the from the blood,

152
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:14,530
but some for some of some of these health diagnostics, they use the fecal material and also the urine.

153
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,610
Right. So that's pretty common. And this is.

154
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:26,670
So what I mean is that. I mean. That means you have this information.

155
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:33,510
You can study the health status of individuals.

156
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,740
Based on the waste you produce. Okay.

157
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:49,720
Based on what you produce. Now think about it, okay?

158
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:54,150
Think about it. Well, the criticism always moves together.

159
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:04,200
Can we use this? As indicated, that we find some information about the health status of the community.

160
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:16,420
Okay. About the community. So that's the principle basis of Western water based epidemiology.

161
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,910
Okay. That's it. QUESTION What is the epidemiology that it's really now we can.

162
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,290
Probably use the sewage discharge.

163
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,330
To find some indication of the presence of a community.

164
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,820
Okay. I. Like an individual.

165
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:51,070
Great. The good thing is now. We don't really collect the individual information pieces.

166
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,850
All everything's mixed, right? Everything's mixed up.

167
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,669
Okay. Everything is mixed. So we are not kind of individual information.

168
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:07,130
In fact, we cannot currently individual information, but it is very similar to the individuals.

169
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:19,790
But if you think about all let's see on the dorm respectively, a dorm or even the university campus in Houston, Michigan, or some apartment buildings.

170
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,590
Can we get the information from this? Okay.

171
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,540
Can we get a break from this to see what's going on in that building?

172
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:35,180
Good. I'm not doing. So it happened in practice.

173
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:40,490
In fact, for me, I just mentioned, you know, the fact that the head of the nation,

174
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,600
when you visit the foreign countries, you know, they will connect all their you in the fecal matter.

175
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:52,750
They will not leave it. I bring them back to the. To be treated.

176
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,740
So this is really the basis for the Orbis.

177
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:10,130
What have they been used? So what has been used? Legal, illegal drug of abuse.

178
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:20,570
So before now before the marijuana is legalized here in the United States or in the state of Michigan.

179
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:30,590
But if you try to to see how much marijuana is consumed, there's a black market like some of you know, there's a lot of black market.

180
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:38,880
So but we can really get that information. From the puppets.

181
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,560
How can you get the information from the topic? How much? Very well.

182
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,290
I can do the questionnaire and no one really gives the right answer. Okay.

183
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:52,220
Okay. So what they do, in effect. Get you the waste water symptomology you use.

184
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,600
You consume products. Then you become alive.

185
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:00,420
You are discharged. You're going to keep that right.

186
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,120
So as you get into that soup system.

187
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:13,090
You can also use us to collect information about the pesticide or personal care products for organic foods and prizes.

188
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:19,630
Is that how you get the information about what's going on?

189
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:27,590
What how much you you update? So all of this has the metabolome metabolized and then get discharged.

190
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:33,860
So give me information from the wastewater cam back calculates the exposure to this.

191
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:43,980
Especially with disease. Diabetes, allergies, cancer and cancer, sometimes to diabetes, for example.

192
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:52,140
I mean, you can use this, the information about this and also some lifestyle consequences like.

193
00:20:53,890 --> 00:21:02,470
Personal care products, substances or other diseases, given the factors temporary to the populations.

194
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,080
So that has been used, not a widespread use of this.

195
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:17,680
Use a westbeth every venue to monitor, and that's really to monitor just to give information about what's going on in specifically.

196
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,380
Okay. Is this true community? So we may ask why we do this.

197
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:38,440
So why would you do this? So for the public health perspectives.

198
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:46,920
Yes. If you have that information, they can develop some policies that target this population, the protect.

199
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:57,710
Okay. Improve public health. So this is how we do it.

200
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:05,620
How we do it. This is how we do it.

201
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,070
We think about what you want to monitor. Okay.

202
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,090
What do you want to monitor? A drugs, biomarkers or pharmaceuticals, whatever.

203
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:21,649
And then you check with also other data like the endpoint of the course.

204
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:25,310
If you say I want to study the drug use.

205
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:31,840
And then you think about what's the population make of the some mental health issues.

206
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,140
Okay. And then we click the lawsuit.

207
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:45,810
And then we get that information. And then we also have this the population.

208
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:54,170
Think about explorers, think about excretion. Sometimes you have to alter metabolism and metabolites.

209
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,570
Most of the drugs we use or consume effects cannot be exhibited by our body.

210
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:07,130
That's how we make our body. Make the drugs. Because you want to keep the potency of the drug.

211
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:12,610
So what we do, we make stabilize stimuli so that we can.

212
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:19,470
Maintaining the effectiveness a body through the system.

213
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:24,380
Okay. And then. So it's pretty.

214
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,430
That's a drug development. That's how we do the drug development is really one to build a stable and possible.

215
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:42,750
So we'll have to think about it all the time. We how the pharmaceutical books it was the politics dynamics of the of the drug.

216
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:50,320
So we'll keep our eye as stable as possible. So most of the like, 65%, sometimes 75%.

217
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:58,690
Okay. And then you do the calculation and then you normalize to the consumption to give the data for that.

218
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:05,800
That's that's a process. That's a process. So what's the advantages and disadvantages?

219
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:25,500
Was a one year. Just a one. Just. So I run just as a small a large scale data collection so we can collect the data from a city, a big area.

220
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,130
And you can also collect the data from a specific beauty, even through the dome.

221
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:37,890
Ever. You have the discharge, you have the force. Then you can you can pick from that.

222
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,560
Okay. You can hear from something. Moses.

223
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,780
Pipes. Pipes. Now, of course he's now.

224
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:56,630
We also have the the city it's official city public works has a digital pass system to see where the packages.

225
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:03,890
What are the purposes? The person is very anonymous.

226
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,750
We don't really infringe the privacy.

227
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:17,230
We don't really have the personal data that individuals we don't really give you a house who can't get information.

228
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:28,360
Okay. If you could use the house for the invasion, that's already the ID and then you get get for that.

229
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,410
Okay.

230
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:41,850
But when we go to the for the community bank of the Kemper City, we don't really IRP for that because we can give the person ID from that analysis.

231
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,520
But the good thing is I just mentioned some of these.

232
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,600
The privacy, if you use the epidemiology study, you may not get that vital information.

233
00:25:54,570 --> 00:26:03,300
Okay. Traditionally, ABC News indicated information. So what you can do some with the West with more data, probably provide some more reliable data.

234
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:11,220
In terms of what's going on. Look, there's this political agenda.

235
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:15,300
Okay. And then we also can do the realtime detection with the trains.

236
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:21,840
We can cook the wastewater. And then you can monitor that. If we do the questionnaire, for example, maybe take some time.

237
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:28,309
You wait for the symptoms to develop. I'll take your time and the effects you can do.

238
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:36,720
It's almost like kind of real time fashion, but. Any other advantage you can think of?

239
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:57,060
And the other one you can think of. There's a person I already have know already.

240
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:06,180
Maybe user bias like how you mentioned about like the drugs and like versus questionnaires like they're more prone to lie with,

241
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:12,060
you know, with wastewater you can't really why when it comes to that data and affiliated so to speak.

242
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,020
Right. Right.

243
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:23,220
I mean, you do the questionnaire, for example to detect if the new study and that's you gives like yeah this bias from this study is based on.

244
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:32,520
Okay what's the gist of what is like some some tendencies we have with what epidemiology.

245
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,810
Because it does not offer really fresh sociological information.

246
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:45,180
This could be true. Could be if you some of you may be able to get some information from that.

247
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,600
If we do more of this on this, maybe. But, yes, we don't really care that this.

248
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,700
Okay. But you can think about the area. So we got me to Detroit.

249
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:04,910
For the southern districts. You can take the information from there and then that's associated with the information.

250
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,240
Right. We use zip code, for example, to use the zip code for that.

251
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,480
Okay. Yes.

252
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:16,100
But not much error. Lots.

253
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,760
Much margin of error in quantification. So.

254
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,450
The sewage system we designed. Through what? For what?

255
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,140
To collect all for the wastewater right through the city is not designed for wastewater epidemiology.

256
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:38,290
Okay. So and you can imagine now with wastewater.

257
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,620
We have all this. Everything is mixed together by the mattress company.

258
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:51,380
Now you need to quantify you come from. I'm going to tell you.

259
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:58,390
Okay. You use them, purify them, and then quantify that sometimes.

260
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,140
Most times. It's very. Look, I'm interested.

261
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,840
Thinking about life. You have all the water and I lose this.

262
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:13,670
Okay. So. It's not easy to quantify it.

263
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:19,550
Equity. So you have a room. Okay.

264
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:27,080
This is not really designed for this. Congress is not really designed for this.

265
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:32,020
So you can, for example, probably give some information.

266
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:36,200
But sometimes the information may not be reflects because of error.

267
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:42,610
Many ways, many changes we have in that there's no standardization.

268
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,940
You know what I mean? With a CD, with a big CD. With what?

269
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,140
Many people? 200,000 population. With 1 million people.

270
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,880
How do you really think about right.

271
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:01,510
So how do we really standardize categories?

272
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,780
The results. Okay. Terrorism disaster.

273
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:17,520
And it's not really fun to do it. I just imagine it's not really fun to do it to the wastewater.

274
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:22,960
2 to 4 for this. There's no automation.

275
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,620
You cannot really just use the sensor.

276
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:35,430
But for most of the stuff with interesting health indications, it's very specific compounds.

277
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:46,040
Very interesting. And the sums and it's very difficult to use the automation of the system since it's quantified.

278
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:53,120
So we always need to do is to cook the samples, do the extraction, do the prosecution.

279
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:57,350
And then do the quantification, give a specific reason for that.

280
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:02,090
So it's not that as a simple idea we think it should be.

281
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,310
Let's take a quick break. We'll talk about the coach with a little bit.

282
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:55,460
Okay. So. How can we do the Congress?

283
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:07,640
I mean, we started with the effect of the code, which really promotes or increases the use of the whistleblower vis a vis balance.

284
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:14,540
So basically what specifically has been in place since 1898 is people start to do this.

285
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:21,450
It's really the the pandemic. Make the use of the widespread use of liquid.

286
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:29,190
We do have these testing, individual testing in terms of the codes.

287
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:37,590
So what are the issues we have and we need to remember was issue we have in 2022 some 20 could do one.

288
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:46,950
A of individual testing. We were like little.

289
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:52,570
We didn't have a lot of supplies at first for it. Okay. And you'll be grateful if you can.

290
00:36:53,050 --> 00:37:05,230
Anyone wants to be tested and be tested. But we don't really have these supplies or the the capacity to test everyone at the beginning.

291
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:17,110
Okay. We graduate doing up. But at the beginning, you really there's no way that you really have the testing system available for individuals,

292
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,790
but only that you see the coding and then they may be able to assemble the testing statistical.

293
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:29,050
Okay. But if you want to to this new place, you can go and get tested at the beginning phase.

294
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:35,210
Okay. With the other issues we have.

295
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:43,640
If you want to see who has the widest. The testing capacity.

296
00:37:49,290 --> 00:38:01,100
Do we have a symptomatic people? But most of the effects of majority especially depend on the virus because the majority is asymptomatic.

297
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:07,130
Everything is a virus you may not experience may not. So you will not know that you have.

298
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:16,980
The infection, so we will not be tested. That's also be studied for things like the testing capacity and then also the asymptomatic.

299
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:25,980
And then in some places we now have the restrictions. So if you are physical, you will not be able to do this.

300
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:30,090
So that's the restrictions we have. And some say, I don't want to test.

301
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,510
I don't want public disputes actively, so.

302
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:44,020
So that's all these limitations that we have to face when we look at this case numbers report.

303
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:51,159
But it's on the estimate it's not accurate is on this case from individual testing from the clinical test.

304
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,420
And we know that, yes. Is the estimate of some of the real cases.

305
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:02,070
But if you really want to follow public health measures, we really want to see how widespread.

306
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:08,230
What prevents of the effects on human populations so that we can take some actions.

307
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:17,800
You will be able to get some of this estimation from, for example, hostiles.

308
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,730
How many people get authorized was a base mortality rate.

309
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:25,130
That's also a good information indicator.

310
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:32,890
That's what's going on in the community. You don't really know exactly how many people get infected, but are prepared to do that.

311
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:40,750
So that's really kicking in the wastewater based epidemiology and especially with this virus, because the virus can be secreted.

312
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,910
So the feces through the urine menace of the fishes.

313
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:53,300
Okay. If you give everyone asymptomatic even before you develop symptoms.

314
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,750
You always start. Two secrets. Just a touch of the virus.

315
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:08,819
So the thicker materials. So so that's how the the this started.

316
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:15,540
So you cook the west water and then do a testing to see how much viral particles are in the west.

317
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:24,990
What is. And this virus event, I realize, is pretty stable and critical of the Western world, although it may not be viable.

318
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:29,280
But it's pretty stable in the sense that you can collect them and then you can detect it.

319
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:35,720
So that's how we start with this. I just mentioned already.

320
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:36,250
You know,

321
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:47,210
we have all these issues and one just I'll tell you that we have and and and the also precise in this country in terms of the COVID pandemic.

322
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:55,280
So with this with water, it's not really we can try to bypass these issues, bypass these issues.

323
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:04,399
So that's where we we we start this effect right after this pandemic on the company.

324
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,600
We started this project to use wastewater basically to monitor the COVID.

325
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:15,990
We started as a pioneer project to test the feasibility,

326
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:24,990
and then we receive the big funding from the State Health Department to support the more frequent more than.

327
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:35,940
So what we did, I just measured. So the surge is not really designed for the West when there's a sewage system.

328
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:42,690
So what we did is really we first get some initial case numbers in different locations on campus,

329
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:49,560
and then that's the location we want to monitor with wastewater based epidemiology.

330
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:57,540
And also we need to weigh the way these are feasible to go to kind of what sewage from this building individual good.

331
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:03,070
So this is a map of the case numbers in the locations.

332
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:09,490
And then we identify these. And what also need to check to see whether we can get the sewage samples.

333
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:19,340
With the surge. It's a mixed picture from different location or reddish areas, or it's also just very tenuous physical buildings.

334
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:28,910
How much of the covers of buildings? So it takes quite some effort to really the work hours to identify the feasible locations for something.

335
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,930
So we are working together with City Public Works.

336
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:40,400
They provide the information about the piping. And then we also work with on campus, with the house,

337
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:51,560
with another as involvement of health and safety to identify these pipes that can be used to take the samples.

338
00:42:51,980 --> 00:43:01,360
In fact, when we try to identify to look at this map host that we can't have access to 2 to 2 to be able to carry the samples.

339
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:08,210
We have to walk into the to the who's area of the hospital area or how deep of the wounds.

340
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:15,800
No one really went there and everything is covered by the leaves and tried to identify the mammals that potentially could be used.

341
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:27,610
But that's probably to provide good information. It's a bit off topic, but why does Page have an impact on chemistry?

342
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:33,610
This is not really specific to the to the to the inspiration here.

343
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,440
It's this area in this area is able to.

344
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:46,110
So so that's how we we did to spend some time together with them.

345
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:54,860
And then we spent all the extended effects of the most campus here and then the central campus also of campus buildings.

346
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:02,970
You still remember some we we blame the these schools of campus that's area there's

347
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:08,070
the union here do not really have the justification authority to do anything there.

348
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:17,420
Right. So the rental the rental buildings. But for a lot of us who live in that area, we don't really have a way.

349
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:23,170
To say due to the information. So we we we what do we do?

350
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,989
We go to the correct information. Okay. And with the city.

351
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:35,870
Together with the city. And then when we have redefined the very long night night's high numbers,

352
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:42,740
the U.S. can use that information to disco wisdom that almost than those who say we need some information.

353
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:50,290
Okay. Now, this is a the concept of campus because university can do something.

354
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:56,840
The campus told us to take them strict measures, but they cannot wait to enforce in this building.

355
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:01,700
So what do we do with that information? We're working with city County Health Department.

356
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:08,040
The County Health Department has. I'm Judy is in power. So what will we do then?

357
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:12,480
An illness. Okay to do that.

358
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:17,350
So this is all the arrow we collect, and then we start to code.

359
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:21,090
I mean, first, in fact, four. On a daily basis.

360
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:27,870
So we're still ongoing. So every every day, early in the morning, like 7:00 and.

361
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:35,390
All of this stuff was out there without to kind of sewage samples from all these patients.

362
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:43,860
I'm always the patient and then bring them back to the lab to do the analysis and then to figure out what's going on.

363
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:49,169
And this is how we cook the water samples. So there's two different table one sample.

364
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:53,700
You can switch somewhere, you can create grab samples because one time grab samples.

365
00:45:54,510 --> 00:46:00,960
We also have this ultra sampler. This is kind of all the samples. We have samples 24 or 24 hours.

366
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:08,790
Mix them together as kind of mixture. So the combined compile samples for samples also.

367
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:25,610
And then you come back to to the lab. We do this the the numbers, the numbers, the concentration of the virus penetration.

368
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:30,320
So this is the case number we have to particular cases on onset of cases.

369
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,820
And this is really it was the the viral concentration we have.

370
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:44,600
And and look, this is from the from the October all the way to the June 2021.

371
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:51,250
Okay. And then this is the from the June and then to the October 2021.

372
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:55,640
This is in like the appropriate one. So what you can see here is interesting, though.

373
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:03,430
Because this is different face. Different face will sometimes out and then you have different face.

374
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:16,950
And then this is a. Prod also here from the June 2021 to the October and also by the different locations that you can see.

375
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:20,960
Different locations. So what that mean?

376
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:27,700
So you need to do that. And that's the the Vasquez study was kicking.

377
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,150
And then this is the case number.

378
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:38,550
And then this is the quantity of the the viral particles.

379
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:43,020
Okay. And then this is what's the the different face?

380
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:54,160
And then what you can see here, it's very. The concentration of the virus correlates very well with the case numbers on campus.

381
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:59,590
By shifting to days. So what?

382
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:04,840
I mean, so when we detect the viral particles, probably in two days.

383
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:12,710
You'll see the elevated case numbers on campus. Basically we have got to be early warning.

384
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:28,520
So here is the the the the example here the if you if we find the two days is the best prediction of what's going on on campus.

385
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:42,250
So, Corey, between these A-1 and then. Q Another is also two days, okay?

386
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:47,970
Is two days. So first phase is not really high correlated.

387
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,540
And then the one face like I was do is highly correlated.

388
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:58,020
It's the correlations like almost 0.8 was minus two days.

389
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:03,260
So what does that mean? Yes. So we can see here.

390
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:11,630
The Coalition depend on quite a few factors. So whether we just stick with it, his numbers in due course.

391
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:17,280
Now we do it across, but as a beginning we don't because we don't really have a testing capacity.

392
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:20,850
We don't really have the the everyone testing all symptomatic.

393
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,390
So the case number we have. As writers speaking or actors.

394
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:34,190
And then when the after the June we have all capacity increase, then we'll be able to capture all these cases,

395
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:37,760
most of the cases, so that the correlation becomes much better.

396
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:43,100
Now with that, can we predict the case numbers?

397
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:52,700
So we'll start with with look based epidemiology. What we want to do is really can we predict on campus in terms of case numbers.

398
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:56,510
So here is what we do is we use these numbers.

399
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:03,790
And then we predict. These are the predictions, numbers and the variation we have.

400
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:13,830
It's pretty good. In terms of tradition, we can use a huge number to predict the KISS number on campus.

401
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:28,270
So we have provided two days, around three days warning to the U.S. administration to know if we see a high jump increase of the viral particles.

402
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:31,430
We can see. We probably were how many cases on campus.

403
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:44,589
Likely. And that's the will be very like how likely it will be what the case numbers we have and we

404
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:51,220
can see here this is really the prediction and then the case numbers match the virulence.

405
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,020
We can use this to do that.

406
00:50:53,380 --> 00:51:04,600
So that's really because of this the usefulness of this method for the University of the 2000 21,021 that adopt the measures.

407
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:13,870
Okay. They use the data now as one of the metrics to develop the public policy, to develop policy on campus.

408
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:20,630
So we share the data with the county health department, with state health departments in a real time fashion.

409
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:27,050
We also have the Web page that's providing information about the public.

410
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:33,620
Because the reason we are not provided to the public is interpretation of the data may varies.

411
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:43,580
So we don't want to generate the and the scale of situations people that they feel among the population.

412
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:50,960
So but we make it available to any federal agencies, the local health departments.

413
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:56,330
Q The land owners and all the stakeholders, they have access to the data,

414
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,660
and the university will decide, okay, we'll use this data to as a matter with the place.

415
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:10,970
So that's that's, that's the presence allows is the use, though they'd like to make every time when they have a communication,

416
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:17,510
they will based on the data we have provided, we provide almost of growth of data to them so they can do that.

417
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:22,630
You have this analysis. So that's pretty cool.

418
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:27,220
That's pretty cool. So the newest one, too. Now, to to expense.

419
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:37,300
I mean, at the beginning of this summer. Before September, we get a big surprise from the Michigan Health Departments to do the more frequently.

420
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:41,360
And then you said, yes, pretty small to all of those on campus.

421
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:50,520
So issues, changes and other things and funds.

422
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:54,410
We need the funds to do it. It's not it is not it.

423
00:52:55,670 --> 00:53:02,150
When you people work on it. So. And then. We need to figure out whether it is feasible to create.

424
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:09,740
So we say go to the South Pole or go to the West for whatever.

425
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:14,810
So ask us to do the first. We need to see whether we can do it or not.

426
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:19,590
When we have access. And what did you think?

427
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:24,840
So some of the mamas is on the street in the middle of the speech.

428
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:34,690
Now we can see we have to get the people to go to the streets to criticize on those streets, as we do early in the morning.

429
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:38,240
And then we have the city people with us now. They can come before us.

430
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:46,960
We cannot we don't have the power to block those people, but we have to get the city people to clear the streets for us.

431
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,910
We can criticize. Okay.

432
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:57,420
So that's the whole time. And then they have people every time they come out of paper.

433
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,330
Okay. So that's the other reality we have.

434
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:07,980
I mean, it's crazy to use this, but the the good thing is, at a time when we have this in the peak of the pandemic,

435
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:12,660
people always ask to use a lot more time to see what's going on on campus.

436
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:18,890
There's a lot of you and say, yes, we do, but in fact,

437
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:24,960
they don't really put me in my lab and you pays to do the work we did to do that, but you don't get paid for that.

438
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,219
But we get money from the health department. That's public money.

439
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:35,220
So that's the way how it worked. Um, but that's pretty cool.

440
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:42,469
I mean, that's pretty cool to do this. So in addition to the West, what was happening to you?

441
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:46,520
Was it created, somewhat decimated from the sun, from air, from the surface?

442
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:51,260
And then we provide the information to the see to see where is a high risk area.

443
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:56,390
For example, the gene and the gene is the most high risk area, a high risk area.

444
00:54:56,690 --> 00:55:01,680
And then when we went to have our data that they changed their policy,

445
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:08,960
how they use the students into the gene community frequency, all these events which they are using.

446
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:12,470
So as I would try to minimize the risk, that's one another way.

447
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,010
So okay, we talk a lot about this already.

448
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:27,080
Now the question is, so what is with this open window that, okay, what can we do and what are some other ideas?

449
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,260
Cinnabar.

450
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:44,480
Could they go into developing countries and figure out based on like water quality samples of like rivers and other places that they have discharge?

451
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:54,479
Not necessarily something that's structured. They could still use that as samples in order to gather data about maybe obviously the human waste,

452
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:00,710
but also like maybe the animal waste that could be contributing as a pathway for other food sources in the soil and stuff.

453
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:09,570
That's a good that's a good question and also a good suggestion if it is a as being applied also in the developing

454
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:18,810
countries and even they don't have the education system as we have here or like remote areas like that,

455
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:23,160
they use septic system. What can we do? How can we do that?

456
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:30,840
That's one of the challenges as well, is that can we do it in this area with a dispersed population?

457
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:36,300
Is it feasible to do it? So that's the Christian question also of how to develop method for it.

458
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:43,530
So one of the methods we are doing, for example. In the United States with regular activity.

459
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:47,700
They have two places. In the remote area.

460
00:56:54,690 --> 00:57:02,340
What are the two locations people get together? Schools and bars.

461
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:06,870
Scores and scores. Yes. And some other places.

462
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:17,500
Okay. So. So if you want to do the everyday wastewater epidemiology, you need to go to these places,

463
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:24,070
like go to the schools for the young kids you can visit every Sunday people

464
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:31,810
with you would sampling hospitals would that just below the margin of error.

465
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:36,090
Oh yeah. You would think of the hospitals. Yeah.

466
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:41,190
Is it not even worth doing that because of how varied it would be or so.

467
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:46,360
So yes or no. We thought we do can sample from the hospital, which is what you would do.

468
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:50,740
So you get the information. We look at the antibiotic resistance.

469
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:56,920
The pattern is different from the community. So that's you can probably expect that.

470
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:00,790
So that the army and the and what's going on.

471
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:04,730
So yeah, that's really very, very good.

472
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:11,150
For the hospital, you have different type of patterns. We have patients like because.

473
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:16,520
What I was. You can do with the Western world, with epidemiology.

474
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:26,650
Yeah. So I just tell you one thing we are doing right now is to look at the mental house.

475
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:31,090
I can. Okay.

476
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:36,690
So. Should drug use, substance use become more into that.

477
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:43,260
And then we try to come in with with the with the mental health courses on campus.

478
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:51,089
They're still working with the university to with the with that with the university.

479
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:55,320
How do student health services try to get that information within the.

480
00:58:55,330 --> 00:59:00,530
I didn't be reluctant to provide that information because of the sensitivity of these issues.

481
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:05,430
So but we're trying to figure out whether we can work with them to do this.

482
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:10,860
So what are the challenges of applying wastewater epidemiology think of?

483
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:21,010
What changes we have. We talk about other things, but I not tell you without.

484
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,450
And until you have that chip.

485
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:46,250
No. I already used the compiler to say if you get a water sample, it might be weaker.

486
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:52,280
With 500 meters, the the the wastewater water to calculate the the cost.

487
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:58,960
There's about 500 football. Of course.

488
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:05,050
So I say it's more ever more extensive than the perfume. Okay.

489
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,960
That's just a war on terrorism.

490
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:16,210
And the alternative unthinkable a of times very difficult to quantify to get all this information, to keep it to the enemy.

491
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:22,450
Do you think it's easy to do this to any successful companies which have a direct business?

492
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,450
Okay. With the virus, with parents. We have a great idea.

493
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:32,070
Are you doing it? I didn't do the PCR, the PCR.

494
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:36,060
And then with chemicals, we have to do the LC mass.

495
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:46,109
For that so everybody compounds the interesting. What we do have specimens of products is not easy and you'll see why.

496
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:51,960
Just the test, all of them. Yes, it's a good idea to test, but it's difficult to do it.

497
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,290
Okay. You have to separate in this to the technical.

498
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:58,870
Technical. Technologically, we have a challenge on the web.

499
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:06,140
And then I just mentioned that the Suja system is not designed for what was what basically.

500
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,750
Okay. You need to figure out whether it is feasible to fit.

501
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:15,770
And with the information, you really have this storm coverage as you intended.

502
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:24,730
It's not designed for that. So you have to really work around the existing structure infrastructure to develop.

503
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:30,250
So that's also quite a few changes and other things you can think of.

504
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:42,630
Okay. So what research are needed to improve the use usefulness of what's going.

505
01:01:53,160 --> 01:02:35,280
So what kind of research we need to do? That's the message for differentiating between investments and okay to the methods that you mentioned.

506
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:43,620
Okay. So what do we want to achieve? We really want to estimate, try to predict what's going on in the community.

507
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,420
But when you create the data, if that's going to be able to useful to do that,

508
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:56,890
or if we make the approach we create the data about how representative that's

509
01:02:56,910 --> 01:03:03,610
that's numbers is how strong correlates to what's going on in the community.

510
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:08,730
It's not easy a way to create a bunch of that data with any data.

511
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:15,510
How how strong that correlates to what's going on in the community.

512
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:24,840
It's still a lot of work to do. The study I work with, how comparing how could you compare from one community to the other community?

513
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,400
Every year you have higher numbers, low numbers.

514
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:33,150
How will that represent what's going on in that specific community?

515
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,780
That's also another resource ever used to do.

516
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:43,920
How do we kind of raise the. Right.

517
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:53,040
How do we calibrate that data? So there's a lot of research that still needs to be done on how of the value of the West a little the most.

518
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:04,790
Okay. Any other questions or any thing, any sort you have related to the West African mountaineer I mention?

519
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,810
This is not really a water quality management process.

520
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:13,880
But again, we can use this to take advantage of the systems we have.

521
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:19,170
To improve the health. Okay.

522
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:25,670
And the other and other things you think of. Relation to the West Waterways Epidemiology.

523
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:36,420
Okay. So.
