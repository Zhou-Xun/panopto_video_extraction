1
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:12,140
I would like to accept it to remember and or not.

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:34,040
Every time I saw it, I think that's my fault.

3
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:47,460
That's enough. So that's why you said the assignments are designed to the same.

4
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,510
All right. So before it was just one of those. About everyone else.

5
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,640
Over this time, I'm going to be due on Friday, and I'll say, all right,

6
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:04,620
so I know you now you have a second midterm for 650, so give me a little bit more time for preparation.

7
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,450
So now the homework is going to be it comes out.

8
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,950
All right. So let's get started on today's lecture.

9
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,340
So we're going to talk about order statistics for today and on Thursday.

10
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,520
And in particular, this is a very important statistics that people care about in this random sampling.

11
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:34,589
And we're going to take a look at some distributions that are we can derive from the honor statistics for this course.

12
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,140
We're also going to focus on univariate case and next time we're going to focus on that multivariate case.

13
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:53,130
And the first one is the order statistics recall that the definition for random sample and so they are either random variables

14
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:02,320
independent and identify distributions if they have an idea of the range or any of the random samples denoted by this.

15
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:12,960
The Y one to y and. Since they are indeed, they are independent and go like this.

16
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:24,600
Right. But oftentimes we're interested not just in the medium, the barriers, but also in some other quantities of a general population.

17
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:36,720
For example, you may be interested in the mean the minimum or the maximum or the median or some quantile or even the range of this quantity,

18
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,590
for example. That's why I represented the age when the student or the college.

19
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,989
Then you made me want to reinforce the general population. What is the expectation?

20
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,910
What is that distribution for the mandate? Minimum age entering the college?

21
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,010
What is the distribution for the maximum age and so on, so forth?

22
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,240
All right. Instead of sampling everybody in the population,

23
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:11,250
you can do a random sampling by and the samples and then derive the distribution

24
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,450
for the minimum of this end samples and the distribution for the maximum.

25
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:24,870
And to get a rough idea of what the mean by the general population and what the metrics for the general population, bottom line is.

26
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:32,720
Sometimes you do care about things that are not the mean, the variance that we have looked at before,

27
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:43,590
but rather the statistics that involve the ordering of this random samples and that involves this order statistics.

28
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,920
Essentially, if you think about the minimum, the maximum, the median,

29
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:54,350
the all considering the ordering of this and the samples we want to wire, define the site.

30
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,360
What do I mean by that? So I'm going to start with the case of finding the distribution of any amounts,

31
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,800
and I am going to talk about a more general setting of order statistics.

32
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:20,620
So let's start from the mean. So the man, for example, is defined as this W is the minimum of y one to y it by definition.

33
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,900
First of all, we can see that this is a function of this random sample.

34
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:34,960
So this minimum is essentially a function providing this Y one, two, y, and you've got a bad economy, right?

35
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:43,530
So that's a that's a function since it's a function by definition, it's a statistics is a statistic,

36
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,170
a size as a function of the random variables, as a function of the random sample.

37
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,890
We call it a statistic. It's w it's definitely a statistic.

38
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,950
And the way that we define established is the minimum of this n samples, the minimum,

39
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:08,910
the minimal value of y one to y it and that we call it the minimum, the mean statistic, the mean of this random sample.

40
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,650
So the question is, what is the distribution for this statistic?

41
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:20,330
If it's a statistic, it means it is it has a distribution, right?

42
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,440
If it's a statistic is a random variable as a random variable, it has a distribution.

43
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,640
Then the question is, what is the distribution part of this topic?

44
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:39,720
So that is what we are trying to find any order to derive the distribution path that we can proceed from the CDF function.

45
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:46,300
That's the easiest way to derive the distribution or is to run a variable.

46
00:05:46,380 --> 00:06:02,820
W the mean statistic of this random sample recall that one minus this CDF of W is equal to this

47
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:10,590
probability of w greater than or greater than a given that is small w and that's how we define the city,

48
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:20,160
our function. Right? And now in order to fully evaluate the city of function, all we need to do is to fully evaluate this probability,

49
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,690
the probability of the event such that this w a random variable.

50
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:32,880
This means statistic is greater than a given small that we can take into account

51
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:38,320
how this w is constructed is the minimum minimal value of y went through y.

52
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,870
So the minimal value is greater than somebody.

53
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:52,920
We can have a equivalent expression of that event. And now you going to give us the way to evaluate this probability.

54
00:06:53,550 --> 00:07:08,160
So basically, if the minimum this event w greater than W, the small W is equivalent to the event of minimum Y one greater than W,

55
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,240
that's a cent, but because that's how W is defined in the first place.

56
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,170
And if the minimum of a sequence is greater than a constant,

57
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:28,710
that is equivalent to say every value in that sequence is greater than W, those are equivalent.

58
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:41,640
But by noticing that equivalency between those two events, we can read this probability of w greater than small w as the following probability.

59
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:48,090
That is, the probability of y one greater than W by two greater than W and all the way to Y and greater than the.

60
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,240
And from there, it's not probability.

61
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,550
And why is that? Because they are random sample.

62
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:06,180
I said a random sample means they are I.D. so first of all, they are independent.

63
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:13,380
So the probability of these in a such an obvious event is just the product of individual probabilities.

64
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:20,280
And furthermore, they are identical and distributed, so each one has the same probability.

65
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,610
That is exactly one minus. Why is this?

66
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,380
Why is the CDR function for each random variable?

67
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:44,610
If this random sample a common distribution, a common CDF for this random variables evaluated at this small in time, we have the protocols and terms.

68
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,180
You just have this one minus alpha without note to the power of it.

69
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,580
Now give us the formula or the CDF or one minus out.

70
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,250
What the desired mean statistic.

71
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:07,850
So that's the idea of how we can derive a distribution for this statistic from the CDP distribution of this random samples.

72
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,680
I just taking advantage of how this statistic is defined.

73
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:18,290
No. An equivalent event and fully body with the probability of interest.

74
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,760
Any passion about this derivation.

75
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:39,090
And the key here is to notice the equivalent event and translate the original W greater than W into a equivalent intersection of events.

76
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:46,000
In terms of this y i r. Y j is run up samples for evaluates.

77
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:55,220
So after reorganizing the terms, you can got a CDP or this means statistic to take this formula.

78
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:06,770
And one minus one minus Y down to two the power of M and this app y is the city of Y.

79
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,260
I want the one to it.

80
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,930
It's a random sample. So all of this y I have the same distribution.

81
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,899
They share the same city. Log in small w to the city.

82
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:32,120
Our function for y y minus that take it to the power and one minus the quantity.

83
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:38,360
I gave you that CD4+ or the mean statistic, the small document corresponding y.

84
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:49,790
If you want to get the PDA, assuming that these are run about continuous run of variables, I take the derivative of this idea and I give you the PDA.

85
00:10:50,330 --> 00:11:03,500
Okay, so you can take the derivative of this app w w you got this and times one minus y i w minus why?

86
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:11,360
M minus one times the CDF, the PDA of the random variable y value of is smart w.

87
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:24,950
And for our youth for this course, when we talk about our statistics, um, most of the time we're going to focus on the continuous amount of variables.

88
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,100
You can extend many of these notions to that, this coronavirus.

89
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:36,380
But for simplicity, we're going to focus on the continuous rhinovirus when we talk about order statistics.

90
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:51,230
All right. So we can derive this pdf from Syria by taking a derivative and use integration to go from PDF to Syria.

91
00:11:52,580 --> 00:12:03,100
Right. So then we have the PDF and CDF exploited formula for PDF etc.

92
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:11,650
But this means statistically all we need to know is the distribution function for individual random variable.

93
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,310
Once we know that, we can directly plug it in to this formulas to get the PDF on CBO for the mean statistical.

94
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,770
Any questions? So very similarly.

95
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,310
I'll let you do the exercise of deriving the max statistic.

96
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:46,100
So the max statistic is defined as the max of the maximum of this y one to y again y12y

97
00:12:46,700 --> 00:13:01,100
is ied random sample with pd of y y see the capital y apply then what is the CDB?

98
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:25,500
What is the PDF or this max statistic? About how I derive that EBITDA statistic and follow that lead to derive the distribution marks which.

99
00:14:39,780 --> 00:16:00,320
Just. Okay.

100
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:08,650
You got it. I'll have someone telling me how to drive this car first.

101
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,910
So I would do the derivation for the city out of the that.

102
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,250
Yes. You set it up in the same way by using CDV.

103
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:30,350
So that is probability of Z is less than or equal to very good.

104
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:41,960
And then we break that up in the in terms of the Y so that each Y is less than or equal to very good.

105
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,290
So that's okay. So noticing that this event,

106
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:56,600
this capital Z for this small Z is equivalent to every single random variable in this random sample last hour or two of this small Z,

107
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,220
nowadays they make equivalent equivalence between those two events.

108
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:12,350
You can finish the derivation. So these Z are equal to the small Z is equivalent to Y one that's very small the and 22 and that's already quite small

109
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:23,060
Z all the way to Y and that's all equal to a small Z in every single round variable is not sorry equal to the small z,

110
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,830
then the mass going to be assigned to a small Z and vice versa.

111
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:34,300
And once you have this equivalence, you can use the ID, uh,

112
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:41,420
ID condition for this random sample to break down this probability as the CDF

113
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:53,700
to the power of the CDF of Y value of that small Z to the power and to God,

114
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:00,160
the PDA. We just need to take the derivative of this that CDF or the same.

115
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:05,360
You take the derivative of this guy with respect respective z.

116
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,120
You can do it. This is essentially a positive function, right?

117
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:22,070
To take the derivative that's going to give you, uh, earned times capital C minus one times smaller Y.

118
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:28,490
Obviously that is the formula for the PDA or max statistic.

119
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,410
Yes. I've got it.

120
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:46,570
Any questions? So now let's take a look at an example and see how we can directly use this.

121
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:54,490
Farmers that are we have derived the generic formulas to help us quickly got the distribution for minimum and maximum.

122
00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:06,670
Suppose this y follows x exponential distribution with parameter lambda and we have a random sample y one to y and that follows this distribution.

123
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:16,120
The PDA has three times e to the active lambda times y and the support is y greater than zero,

124
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:22,780
and the survival function or one minus the CDF function is e to the active lambda y.

125
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,740
Recall that I we call this one minus the survival function.

126
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:37,570
So plugging in this formula is the small F of y and the survival function we can directly write out.

127
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,830
That's the PDA or the minimum statistic.

128
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:50,200
Recall that the founder for the minimum statistic is n times the survival function to the power of a minus one times PDA.

129
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:56,290
So that's and times survival action, right?

130
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:03,360
Evaluate this w to the power of the minus one times the PDA functions.

131
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:17,550
Combine message and returns. He will say that distribution for that minimum statistic as this idea function right and what is not distribution.

132
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:28,850
Mention another. Right. I hope you all recognize that's another exponential because again,

133
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:33,740
to say what distribution it is, you just need to focus on the kernel of that function.

134
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:43,280
In other words, a term that involved this argument and all the others are just constant that make the integral equal to one,

135
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:50,030
so that those are not essential part. The essential part is the kernel, which is all this doubling.

136
00:20:50,930 --> 00:21:00,620
So inside in this function that the term that involves W is an exponential term with an active constant coefficient in front of it.

137
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:06,260
So that should remind you of that exponential distribution because of exponential,

138
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:13,670
it has this exponential kernel inside it, so you have this negative constant times.

139
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:24,590
Your argument that reminds us of the expression distribution, this is actually exponential distribution with character and time.

140
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:31,430
So I'm gonna recall what the pdf look like for the exponential distribution.

141
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:42,830
Oh y. It starred Van de Chris.

142
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:50,120
Right. So that's what this is, was alumna.

143
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:58,670
If you like a bunch of random samples from this distribution and hopefully the men on it,

144
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:09,680
we know the distribution for the men is also exponential with parameter and that's lambda, which means it will start it will start much higher.

145
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:23,120
Right. This is lambda and drop much faster so that this that's not going to be the PR function for the minimum and random samples from exponential,

146
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,450
which makes sense.

147
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:35,840
Right? So if you think about taking a bunch, I'll run a sample from this solid line and only calculate only divided with the mean.

148
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:43,340
If you repeat it many, many times, the distribution by the mean should be more should be closer to this y axis.

149
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,380
So have some more have more concentration around zero.

150
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:55,100
So it's super around zero and has a lighter tail compared to the original distribution.

151
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:05,060
In other words, everything is shifted to the left, small, closer to the Y axis, as opposed to the to the to the left.

152
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:10,520
So that's the mean statistically. Similarly,

153
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:25,700
we can do the math statistic by plugging in this formula and times this CDF functions evaluate to the power of a minus one times this PDA function.

154
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:30,290
And to put everything together, you got this expression.

155
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,920
So this is a PDF file, the max statistic.

156
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:42,680
And we do not have a name or this is not corresponding to any distribution family that we have learned before.

157
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,480
This is a PDF or that max statistic. It has.

158
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:51,140
What is it form? So you can draw it and you can also evaluate it.

159
00:23:51,470 --> 00:24:00,590
Evaluate any quantile or any value of interest from this this distribution of that point,

160
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,750
help with the expectation of the maximum variance of the maximum, etc.

161
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:11,270
Got a good sense of how the maximum by the general population going to be.

162
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,380
Or any other distributions. Basically the same procedure.

163
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:30,420
Even the PDF the CDB. You can plug in this formula together distribution for the minimum statistic and the max statistic in the same way some.

164
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:38,879
Sometimes you will encounter that the distribution on the minimum or maximum would be within the same family.

165
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,900
But most of. Okay, so I'll be from a different family of distributions.

166
00:24:46,080 --> 00:25:02,610
All right. Any questions? I always have to talk about the minimum and maximum, and we can extend that definition to the general order statistics.

167
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,840
So that's why I y my own idea from the pdf of apply.

168
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,050
But then we can always alter or run this and run them.

169
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:23,900
After starting the renovation goes from small, the smallest to the largest.

170
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:32,090
We redefine each random variable to be y, parenthesis one, y, parenthesis, two, and so on, so forth.

171
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:39,200
All the way to a y parentheses and such that why parenthesis one is last or equal to y.

172
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,380
Parentheses to last are equal to y parentheses three.

173
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,150
So on so forth. Going to be a ordered sequence.

174
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:55,700
So the actual value of this y one, y two and why aren't going to be the same as the values of the original y12.

175
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:06,680
Why aren't I just ordered? In other words, this one is the smallest, the value of this than numbers.

176
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:16,220
So mathematically, what that means is y one is equal to the minimum of why one to why.

177
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:25,540
That's how life finance is. One is defined and why two to the second smallest apply one to say the smallest amount.

178
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:46,810
A 1 to 1 and all the way to what is the largest volume of the original random sample.

179
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:58,870
That's how these statistics are defined. So if you just look at the values now original by one to win wisdom,

180
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:04,870
fermentation with some fermentation has the same value with this y parenthesis, 12y parentheses.

181
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:09,130
So the value wise they are the same, but the order is different.

182
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:16,260
Of this new statistics, you have to have this particular order.

183
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,520
That one is the last article two, that's how I put a three and so on.

184
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:28,800
So it course. And this new statistics, this new random variables are called order statistics.

185
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,930
All right. Each one of them, by definition, is a function of the original or original random sample.

186
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:42,840
That's why they are our they are still random variables and they are statistics.

187
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,740
They are called statistics because they are functions of the random sample.

188
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,870
Any conceptual way, since there are many variables as there are statistics from the original random sample,

189
00:27:55,170 --> 00:28:00,210
we can derive the distribution for each of them and import all of them.

190
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,080
As long as they are operable, we should be able to drop that distribution.

191
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:10,520
In fact, we have derived the distribution for Y, one and Y already.

192
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:18,050
Right now we're going to say how to derive the distribution for any one of this order statistics.

193
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:27,050
And next time we're going to say how to derive that from distribution for all of those that your distribution, you can easily get the margins.

194
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:36,950
You can also get Y declared and also got that marginal for the parent that's not for the joint is much more comprehensive than the marginal.

195
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:47,600
Now let's focus on the marginal. And so our interested in finding a distribution for any owner statistic y y parenthesis on.

196
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:58,150
Okay. And that's time we're going to look at the choice. But before we go to the next slide, talking about the distribution for wire.

197
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:05,600
Any question about the definition of this statistics? All right.

198
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:22,720
So the formal definition, the former derivation of this, of the distribution for this parse order statistic will be deferred to next class.

199
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:30,820
So I need to get that drawing distribution first and then marginalize that joint distribution to get the marginal distribution.

200
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:38,110
So that's the formal way of doing it. But this class we're going to introduce are informal.

201
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:46,810
In fact, that's a very clever approach to derive this distribution.

202
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,700
And the result is going to be exactly the same at the bottom of the relation.

203
00:29:52,060 --> 00:30:01,750
So this is just the more trickier and trickier and more clever way of deriving this pdf or any order statistic.

204
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,280
But before the derivation, let me just give you the formula first.

205
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,370
Looks complicated in the first class, but it is what it is.

206
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:17,110
And you can see that if you take article one or article two and that just reduces

207
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:23,500
to the PDF function that we have just derived right for the mean statistics.

208
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:35,710
A general formula for any our order statistics is that factorial divided by this two by the product of this two factorial times.

209
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,420
This is the key function or y. Okay.

210
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:47,380
And this is the survival function a lot. And this is the p the PDA function for Y.

211
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:54,610
So all I mean, on the right hand side is the distribution functions for each run of our volume.

212
00:30:54,620 --> 00:31:04,270
The run example, by plugging in this, plugging in the right hand side, you got the distribution on the left hand side, which is our order statistics.

213
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:14,290
Okay. So again, the phone only looks a little bit complicated, but once we once I show you how we can derive this,

214
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:19,570
hopefully it will become clearer why it takes this form.

215
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:33,310
So again, as you can say, if if one of these term goes away, these and factorial over and minus one factorial just becomes a constant and right.

216
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:40,880
And this term goes away. All that's left of this, which gave us the same formula for the minimum statistic.

217
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,620
Alternatively, if you have RNA four and.

218
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:55,100
Then this term goes away again and this becomes and this goes away.

219
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:59,930
And this is exactly the same phenomenon for the max statistic.

220
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:10,490
The generic function that covers the distribution for any order statistic.

221
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:14,720
Yes. So that's the formula.

222
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:23,360
So that's a let's take a look at how we can actually derive that using this informal, trickier approach.

223
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,910
Okay. So in order to derive this idea, first of all, we have to think about what Pedialyte means.

224
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:42,820
So Pedialyte, the value of the Pedialyte at any small light does not give us the probability that actually the challenge of three people.

225
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,220
We can not interpret PDF as a probability. That's a problem.

226
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:52,700
If we can interpret the app as probability, we can use what we have learned a probability to derive it.

227
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:57,590
We can just convert one probability, one event to an equivalent event,

228
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:03,740
which is whose probability is easier to calculate and use that around to calculate the PDA.

229
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,780
Right. Similar to what we have down for the median max statistics.

230
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:19,490
I recall in the Mad Max statistics, the way that we do it is go from the CDP because it has a clear probability interpretation.

231
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,560
But now for any order statistic, we cannot do that.

232
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:33,410
We have to go directly from this PDF option. And again, the challenge part is PDF does not carry a straightforward probability meaning.

233
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:44,500
I want to know and notice that if you multiply a small interval on the x axis to this pdf,

234
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:53,870
then recall that if you have a pdf function that look like this is the area.

235
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,270
So assume this is your this is you are why this is your app.

236
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:10,099
Why? Why the actual value of this PDF function does not mean anything, but if you multiply that value by this small distance,

237
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:20,240
let's call it the UI a small interval, then it becomes approximately equal to this area, the area under this curve.

238
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:29,090
Right. And the area under this PDF function has a straightforward probability interpretation.

239
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:38,640
More specifically this area. I say you get more specific.

240
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,959
This is why this is you are at why. Why?

241
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:53,550
This is why. Plus b y so d y is the distance between this two points of access and then area a shaded area.

242
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:13,930
Is roughly equal to the probability. It's actually exactly the area is exactly equal to the probability of the random variable greater.

243
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:29,530
Now y last y plus the y and we know this area is approximately equal to the pdf value times.

244
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,900
This small interval that the Y.

245
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:40,990
So that gave the pdf value a probability interpretation.

246
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:53,440
Okay. So that's the key. So the key is to introduce this small interval divide the Y, so that you can give it a probability interpretation.

247
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:57,430
And once we have this probability interpretation, as I said,

248
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:07,480
we can use the probability traits that we have learned before the equivalent equivalent event so that we can evaluate this probability.

249
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:14,020
So that's sort of the high lab idea. More specifically, here is how we how are we going to do it?

250
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:24,940
We call that what do we want it to got on the left hand side is the problem is the PDA function for the hours on our statistic y.

251
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,720
Parentheses are okay at this value small y.

252
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:36,460
For the way that we can do it is we separate the entire axis into three intervals.

253
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,940
Y interval is from negative infinity all the way to y.

254
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:49,390
And the second zero is from y to y, plus the water.

255
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,420
And the 30th of all is from Y plus the Y to positive infinity.

256
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:01,210
We can always separate our access into these three intervals.

257
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,630
And once we separate this into three intervals,

258
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:14,860
when we see that since this y currently sets are is the order statistic and we want to evaluate its value,

259
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:26,499
it's this small y that just means the random variable going to take values in the second interval from white line plus B of white oak and mo versus

260
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:37,060
days of hours order statistic not just means there is going to be r minus one values in the first interval and minus R about is in the last interval.

261
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:47,610
Okay. So that is immediate observations from determination of this hour's order statistic.

262
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,070
Any great break down our access into this three intervals.

263
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:59,709
Given that a why are these why parenthesis are is ours order statistic we can directly get the first thing of all going

264
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:08,530
to content are minus one values second interval containing exactly one nine and 13 of all content and minus our values.

265
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:16,390
Okay. And then we can consider how to calculate this probability,

266
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:21,820
the probability of this random variable between the Y and a y capacity one

267
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:30,760
essentially that probability is the PDA of this trinomial trinomial distribution,

268
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:39,340
the trinomial distribution F itself about this distribution, we would talk about this for the random variables.

269
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:58,510
Our Trinomial distribution. The parameter is so the binomial distribution with parameter.

270
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:06,550
And I want I to type three as a generalization of the binomial random binomial distribution.

271
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,460
And instead of having two possible outcomes for binomial.

272
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:20,230
This trinomial have three possible outcomes I want with probability pi one by two up by three and that in trials.

273
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:29,140
These trinomial distribution tells us how the events are distributed among three possible outcomes.

274
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:39,520
So the random Marable going to be one that's 2 to 3 following this trinomial distribution,

275
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:46,360
and that's one plus x two plus three equal to the total number of trial n and the probability of x one.

276
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:57,480
The probability of any experiment out of this, and trials in the first category is pi one.

277
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:05,070
And the probability of the trial with outcome in the second category is two, and in the third category is three.

278
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:14,100
That's how the binomial distribution is defined. With these parameters two and three, we can write out the PDR.

279
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,650
Sorry, the PMO or this trinomial distribution.

280
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:30,420
In other words, for any given value x, y, two, three, we can evaluate the probability of observing x, one, two and three from this trinomial.

281
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,300
Now consider our previous study.

282
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:46,160
That's essentially a trinomial setting because we have own values that we need to put on this axis.

283
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,460
Right. And they can only be one of the F value.

284
00:40:50,620 --> 00:41:01,760
Only be in one of these 3 minutes. So now the probability of this RS order statistic between this small Y and the small white plus

285
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:09,329
t y is equivalent to the event that we have our minus one values in the first one matter,

286
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:14,010
in the second being an m minus R value in the third C.

287
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,570
See other words we find a equivalent event for this probability,

288
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:25,950
and that equivalent event can be evaluated using the power of this trinomial distribution.

289
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,990
So that is one step closer to what do we want to evaluate?

290
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:41,350
So let me be a little bit more specific here. First of all, here is our target.

291
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:55,360
We want to give this a f y are evaluated small y and we know these are my y times e y

292
00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:10,940
approximately equal to the probability of this outlier of small are greater than y y y y.

293
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:22,840
As long as we can have a evaluation of this probability, we can divide by this small d y that the the thumb and our other PDA of the order statistic.

294
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:35,980
Right now we find a equivalent event for this y the hours order statistic between y and a y plus d y that is.

295
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:57,590
The probability of this are minus one one and erm minus are these three numbers coming from a trinomial.

296
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:04,670
Distribution is parameter and pi one into three.

297
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:19,110
So the probability of our on our statistic in the second interval is equivalent to say you have our minus

298
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:26,760
one in the first of all and minus R in the 30 interval and a Y exactly one in the middle interval.

299
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:36,030
That makes sense. So the probability of the hours on a statistic in the second interval is equivalent to say

300
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:41,730
you have R minus one numbers in the first interval and minus R in the third interval.

301
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:46,320
And exactly once in the matrix, those three events are equivalent.

302
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:53,520
And the second event that I talk about is essentially the probability of this

303
00:43:54,270 --> 00:44:01,140
trinomial distribution as a realization of these three numbers are minus one,

304
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,550
one and minus. Right.

305
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:12,330
So next, let's take a look at what are the parameters for this trinomial distribution.

306
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:18,360
Once we know the parameters of this trinomial distribution, then we can fully evaluate this probability.

307
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:23,610
That's just locking in these three numbers to the PM of the Trinomial.

308
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,500
So all we need to know now is what are these properties?

309
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:35,130
I one page one by three and it's fixed and is the total number of points, the total number of values.

310
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:41,700
And we know that. And that is because this is a statistic from a random sample size.

311
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,260
Now, all we need to do is to decide design what is 1.2, 1.3.

312
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:55,530
So chi one is by definition, a probability of.

313
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:14,250
That's a value or a random variable falls into the interval of not having been added to one right.

314
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:23,250
And high two is the probability of a random variable denoted by any Y.

315
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:31,620
These are the random parallel that I'm talking about. Each trial is placing a random variable from the original distribution.

316
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,990
I'll miss intervals then.

317
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:42,989
So pi two is the probability of why any random variable falls into the middle interval,

318
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:53,399
which is why by plus three y and finally pi three is the probability of each random variable falls to the third interval,

319
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,030
which is why plus the y to positive.

320
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:06,110
And we know how to evaluate this. I want pie and pie three.

321
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:15,740
We do. Right. So, Kevin, the distribution for the original random variables, these are all very straightforward to calculate.

322
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:25,310
In particular, pie one is just what was the probability of the random variable taken by the last that small?

323
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:34,090
That's your body, right?

324
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:40,770
This is a CDP of the original amount of arable what you evaluate at this small.

325
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:47,800
That's the probability of a random variable falling to the first interval.

326
00:46:49,780 --> 00:47:00,040
What about PI three? What's the probability of a random variable falling to the third interval and the was greater than its y plus e of y.

327
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:11,420
That wouldn't feel very good when minus the senior evaluator.

328
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:28,640
Why was he all right? And finally, for the middle part again, we can use this notation of this approximation and use the pediatric y times e y.

329
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:36,380
So the middle part is the pdf of this random variable divide of our small life constitutions.

330
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:41,180
Now we have all of this components we can plug into the trinomial.

331
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:47,630
PMMA took out the final result. Recall that the final trinomial piano has this formula,

332
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:53,500
and so it has a constant and factorial divided by as one as to create material

333
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:59,030
times the probability for resolving category one to the problem of s one,

334
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:04,580
so on, so forth. And in our setting, we know P one is this quantity.

335
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:09,110
P two in this quantity, p three is this quantity. What do we just talk about?

336
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:15,170
And I want us to have three taking three. That is our minus one, one and M minus R.

337
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:19,250
So if you put everything in, you can got the left hand side.

338
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:28,810
Is our desire guilty of crimes, DUI and the right hand side.

339
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:37,899
If this piano bar is phenomenal, if there are minus one, one and minus, are it,

340
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:47,500
and that's going to be an factorial high marks, one factorial, one factorial and minus our real times.

341
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:52,440
P one is why two they are minus one.

342
00:48:54,340 --> 00:49:01,210
Why do you why are a one times one minus?

343
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:09,010
Why does you want to the power of and minus r?

344
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:14,410
Okay. So now we have a left hand side equal to the right hand side.

345
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:20,260
And the last step is to just divide the UI on both side, on the White House to zero.

346
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:24,940
Once you divide that evenly on both side goes away.

347
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:31,090
And further, if you have the White House to zero the last half the becomes just apply and one

348
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:36,880
minus half one so that exactly give us the formula for the order statistics.

349
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:47,250
That is how we can derive this PDF function for the horizontal statistic involved.

350
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:54,510
So now let's recall, let's take a look back and how we derive it.

351
00:49:55,990 --> 00:50:05,520
Very demonstrate as to nowadays to give this PDR function a probability interpretation by multiplying this small one.

352
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:12,810
Once we multiply the small divide to the PDA function, we can translate it into this probability problem.

353
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:23,540
And then we find the equivalent event for this Y between small y and a small like, plus the.

354
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:33,300
So they call it event of the order statistic in that interval is you have our minus one events

355
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:42,540
in front of Y minus R events behind this Y plus the Y and exactly y event in the matrix.

356
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,800
But those two are equivalent. But now the final start,

357
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:57,780
the final step is to evaluate the probability of that equivalent event by noticing

358
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:03,660
that the equivalent event is actually a realization of a trinomial distribution.

359
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:10,380
As long as we can calculate the parameters of the trinomial, we can directly plug it in together.

360
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:14,670
That's the probability of the equivalent event.

361
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:19,830
Finally, you put everything together. You got this function. All right?

362
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:24,890
You can think about how this works afterwards.

363
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:34,500
Um, again, it's not a very straightforward way of doing it, but once you've got it, it's a very useful trick for all the derivations.

364
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:44,820
So next time, we're also going to use this. This idea is to derive the drawing distribution, involve only the joint distribution of any pair.

365
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:50,670
And in triplets in family, you can also use the same idea to derive that distribution.

366
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:59,010
So hopefully you can have the picture and the idea behind this.

367
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:06,930
Importantly, this is a very useful trick that has many utilities beyond this case.

368
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:14,200
Any questions? Yes.

369
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:21,580
So based on how we work, how we've come up with this idea there, this means that depending on what the situation is,

370
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:28,020
there are somewhere we can find a platform for this video so that we can start.

371
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:31,780
Like if we were to pick a normal distribution specific number.

372
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,200
If you have a normal distribution,

373
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:45,270
you just plug in the normal PD and the normal city of the normal PD out and you can got the statistic for normal run of our whole normal sample.

374
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:51,219
So this is a generic formula on the order statistics, which is something like that.

375
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:58,990
We wouldn't be able to take it for any form of it. You cannot take what you can't find because you cannot find the closed form from the normal,

376
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:04,240
because you do not know the close form for the CTA, but for normal specifically.

377
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:12,669
Although we do not know the exact formula for the CDP, we typically consider the city up as a known function of the standard normal distribution.

378
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:20,890
But also you can always refer to the table to get anybody about any, you know, any city of any value.

379
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:28,659
So still you can consider that access exclusive function for normal for other distribution.

380
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:36,790
If you can now get an explicit formula for the CDF or for the PDA, then you do not have that close closer form on the order statistics.

381
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:57,880
If I had normals, then variables would support for to change the order statistics when I used the support of this function for the orders.

382
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:07,749
Very good question. The support for the order statistics. So in general for marginals that support for the marginal distribution of the

383
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:12,700
order statistics is the same as the original orders to the original variables.

384
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,620
So we're going to see that a little bit more next time.

385
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:22,930
But if you consider just to look at the very random variable marginally, right?

386
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,970
If you just look at this order statistic, the distribution of the order statistics margin,

387
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:31,660
it can be anywhere in the support of the original random variable.

388
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:37,239
You can consider the extreme case where all the random variables in your random sample

389
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:43,060
is pushed to the maximum of that support or all pushed to the minimum of that support.

390
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:51,670
That will give you the order statistic. Also going to the maximum and the minimum of the original sample that span the entire support,

391
00:54:52,780 --> 00:55:00,580
the marginal and the support a what are are in the same of a support for any random our original random sample.

392
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:08,530
Ah, good question. All right. So let's take a break and come back at 205.

393
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:20,760
This one.

394
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:56,000
You can go. You know, because people just.

395
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:30,910
Some people think I'm talking to you because this is the probably that I want to tell you the property is not even that smart.

396
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:38,550
That's what it is. So we're trying to get away from this.

397
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:46,169
So the family has to have one observation out of yours.

398
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:51,040
And I want to have exactly what either our minus one here.

399
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:55,649
And if that's the case, you have this are statistically.

400
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:59,020
Exactly. And that is an.

401
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:11,830
All right. So then what is the probability of having this random sample distributing as like this one you receivable minus one.

402
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:27,600
Why do you think these are three being and you are completely wrong about why I can be

403
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:44,880
run into one of the reasons we have to find out because you can see the value of that.

404
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:53,040
That's going to be exactly either in this interval and only takes three.

405
00:57:54,750 --> 00:58:00,480
The consequence of that is because you are not going to fail.

406
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:05,430
I'm going to talk about your success then.

407
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:10,110
That's the final phase three trial.

408
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:18,700
This time it takes and then the probability and then the problem.

409
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,520
What is the probability of any amount of trial?

410
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:42,740
And that's what I just happened to be curious about everything else, not to mention the distribution of the problems.

411
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:46,680
What is that deserve?

412
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:07,469
So the answer is, first of all, really strongly,

413
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:27,000
because while I was thinking that these are some of the problems that only interested in the atmosphere,

414
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:46,480
you know, if I did not change these interventions in the past years,

415
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:58,410
you know what you can do if you do not use of this element corporation and use the limited operation for example,

416
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:07,080
in a car in the area is approximately equal to this.

417
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:27,900
And I'm still trying to figure out what you you said it could be following, you know,

418
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:56,860
just to remind people that you don't get your papers, what you are doing, you know.

419
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:30,240
Some people it to see you look so good.

420
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:43,990
I feel like every time she forgot, it's like my only daughter is on the radio.

421
01:01:47,420 --> 01:02:04,330
I wonder if it's just the way it.

422
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:19,110
You know how I feel like, oh, there's nothing else.

423
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:24,560
There's something very sketchy.

424
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:30,630
It's just the fact that think it's from probably the fact that, you know,

425
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:57,370
it's just it's just, I guess what is going on in my office to be open to the public.

426
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:07,030
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

427
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:32,060
You can get that a couple of hours at the same time.

428
01:03:32,820 --> 01:04:26,639
And that's not to say it is controlled by the family, which is going to be impossible just to show you what it's all about.

429
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:40,820
Why is this what you need to do better control.

430
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:58,540
Sometimes you have to cope with people that know what's going on for days.

431
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:11,200
Yeah, right. Before I move on, just once again.

432
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:17,150
Questions about this is how of this informal group.

433
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:26,920
Again, as I mentioned, this is a very clever and useful trait.

434
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,730
Could be, you know, finding other scenarios as well.

435
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:37,280
The key is really noticing the probability of probabilities, statements,

436
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:54,250
interpretation of the idea that you can use all this probability strength to get the valuation of that PD right like this.

437
01:05:55,540 --> 01:06:06,370
So let's look at a few examples. So uniform order statistics assume our random samples are from uniform distributions from zero one.

438
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:18,819
And from what we learned before, we know the PD l function or y is what we're uniform.

439
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:27,910
What is a PDA means is a constant flux one and are y greater than zero less than one.

440
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:34,370
And the CDF function is just a linear function and it's quite a lot.

441
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:44,190
And y greater than zero or less than what we are took out in the order statistic distribution PDA is this

442
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:52,000
plug in these into the formula that we just derived in particular if we have a random sample size and

443
01:06:52,330 --> 01:07:01,150
we can gather our order statistic as in having PD out in this formula and divided by this R minus one

444
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:11,220
and by our Vittorio Hobbs is two times Y to the power of our minus one one minus y to the power and r.

445
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:17,690
And this is especially this part.

446
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:25,730
This is the kernel for a better distribution. And this is for y greater than zero.

447
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:31,490
Less than one. So this is a support for the RS auto statistic.

448
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,610
Getting back to the previous question, the support,

449
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:44,450
the marginal the support for the marginal order statistics is the same as the support for the original mathematical conceptually.

450
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:52,580
The way to think about it is you can always push all your random samples to y strength and also puts them all to the right.

451
01:07:53,420 --> 01:08:00,410
They can cover the entire support as the original retroviral marginal.

452
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:09,160
That is the support for this. Our thoughts are statistically the same of the support for the original retroviral, but that's probably 0 to 1.

453
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:16,160
And this is a better distribution with parameter R and A minus R plus one.

454
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:22,729
Hey. This window for better distribution,

455
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:32,870
we can evaluate the expectation that just to give us the expectation of the hours on our statistics from a normal random uniform random sample.

456
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,680
Just take this per hour, minus and plus one.

457
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:53,320
What that means is if you take a random sample size N and find the expectation of the minimum of the first order statistic,

458
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:56,800
that is what, one over and plus one.

459
01:08:57,370 --> 01:09:05,650
And if you take the expectation of the second owner statistic, that's two over one plus one and all the way to it, take the maximum.

460
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:16,690
If you take the max statistic of this random sample size n, that's going to be an over and plus one as the infinity,

461
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:26,110
that expectation of the maximum and approaching the one and the expectation of the minimum and protein

462
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:37,310
zero and for any size n these expectations on the order statistic cannot be evenly spaced unless 0 to 1.

463
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:45,580
These are direct results from this marginal distribution of the order statistics.

464
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:54,370
Any questions? This is part of a uniform case.

465
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,930
If you change it to another distribution, the results will be different.

466
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:05,800
So there is no generic result of one expectation that our statistics cannot be.

467
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:14,950
It's just for this a uniform case. We happen to have this evenly spaced expectation on our statistics.

468
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:24,400
If you change it to another one, this may not. Another example, the media.

469
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:32,950
So the media is a quantity that is defined by the population.

470
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:44,360
So the medium or in continuous distribution is defined as the quantity and such that as the value.

471
01:10:52,130 --> 01:11:07,520
Media is the value is such that this see this city are functions you value in equal to one or the other words as equal to inverse.

472
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:18,590
So these are the city up for the run of our life, of the distribution, where the sample is drawn from.

473
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:35,930
And so where these see the Intersect, whereas the corresponding value is the median of the population.

474
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:47,080
So median is a parameter for the distribution similar to the mean the barriers.

475
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:52,640
These are all well defined by the population and in practice.

476
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:58,099
Okay, we do not know what the median is for the population.

477
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:06,469
So we need to to use sample median to account to approximate this population here and the

478
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:15,140
sample media for a random sample size n is defined as follows and your sample size is odd.

479
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:28,550
Then the sample median is justified as these order statistics, namely the middle one right being have three random sample size three.

480
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:33,080
That's just the wide parentheses to have a sample size of five.

481
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:39,670
That's just the one parentheses three, the third order statistic and so on, so forth basically is just the middle.

482
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:42,790
One of the owner statistics that is the sample.

483
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:49,969
If and even then we define the sample median to be the average of the middle two because there

484
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:58,790
is no matter what we define it to be that the average of the middle to order statistics,

485
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:05,210
the number two and number two plus one. So you have ten samples.

486
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:13,220
Then we're talking about the median that the median or the average of white five and six.

487
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:23,060
So that's how we define the sample. So as you can see, the sample mean sorry, the sample median.

488
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:35,180
As you can see, the sample median is essentially either the order statistics itself or the calculation that involve order statistics.

489
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:39,410
So it's closely related to the statistics of simplicity.

490
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:48,020
Let's just consider in the case where earnings are. So the sum of median is essentially just one of the order statistics.

491
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:57,810
But if you are and these are, let's say, and is equal to two times and plus one or AM is any integer.

492
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:08,729
So the sample medium of this size in random sample is just one plus one order statistic from the previous slides when no,

493
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:13,620
we can't exactly write out what that order statistic distribution is.

494
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:24,150
Essentially, if you write out the PMO or the meal sample media, that's going to be the PDF on AMP plus one's order statistics.

495
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:28,500
Okay. And if you plug the corresponding values in,

496
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:37,950
that's going to be two plus one factorial divided by amp factorial and factorial times this quantity and that.

497
01:14:37,950 --> 01:14:41,460
Give us a pdf on the sample mean.

498
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:52,440
Again here, we're talking about a sample size up, which is equal to two plus one.

499
01:14:54,130 --> 01:15:05,530
These corresponds to the sample size in this relation to two plus one, in other words is equal to and minus one over two.

500
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:13,120
And this sample size of this is a PDF or the sample medium view.

501
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:30,550
Your sample size isn't. So this is another example showing you that we can actually derive this the distribution for

502
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:42,360
this media statistic directly from this statistic after any question from this statement.

503
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:53,860
So one direct result from this formula, from this medium, small, medium pdf is that if the medium if the distribution is symmetric,

504
01:15:54,220 --> 01:16:03,640
then we can show that the expectation of the sample medium is zero, provided that the sample medium has expectation.

505
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:09,460
In other words, if expectations exist.

506
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:20,800
And so that's the rub, is that if the attention of the media exists, then I expect this is always zero if Y is symmetric.

507
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:26,850
What is the metric about zero? And the proof.

508
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:34,620
If you think about the PDF, all we need to prove is the PDF or the sample.

509
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:39,840
Medium is also a smattering of symmetry and the expectation exists.

510
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:51,450
We can show the means is zero, right? All we need to show is that this simple, mean, simple medium has a symmetric PDA around zero.

511
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:57,810
Take a look at the formula. In the actual formula, we know this guy is symmetric.

512
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:02,940
All we need to show is this guy. So part of this, too, is also symmetric.

513
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:15,490
And that is because if y symmetric then we have have y y equal to negative y and the city of

514
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:25,419
dividing negative y is equal to one minus a city of everywhere smaller about a normal distribution.

515
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:36,210
As a example, the CDF, this is our Y, the CDF at 92 Y is the area of this table, right.

516
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:45,070
Because it's symmetric. We know that shaded area is equal to the shaded area on the right hand side, which is one minus the CDF and Y.

517
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:52,330
So for any symmetric distribution, we always have this relation and we always have these two relations.

518
01:17:53,320 --> 01:18:01,920
The PDA is symmetric and the cap is. Is satisfied, Mr. relation.

519
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:06,330
Okay. Why not give y on the one minus y also?

520
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:10,890
Now I need to this formula.

521
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:18,360
We can replace this one minus a city of y and y by this y value.

522
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:23,160
And then immediately you will notice. And this is a symmetric function.

523
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:32,510
In other words, I am a white is equal to that of negative white is symmetric and the expectation this.

524
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:38,370
You know, the expectation is always zero. You do this?

525
01:18:38,370 --> 01:18:44,790
Integration of wild homes. Mama, why deposit it on an active part?

526
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:56,580
You always have one zero. I mean, conceptually, it's also, you know, also make sense.

527
01:18:57,510 --> 01:19:00,870
That's right. And that sample media should have a mean zero.

528
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:20,540
Three questions. So the next question is, now we know what the medium is.

529
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:22,190
What is the sample medium?

530
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:33,230
Then the next question is what is the probability that the larger of two continuous random variable was a population meeting?

531
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:39,260
All right. So if you have to run the variables, I'd run a variable.

532
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:57,170
Or in other words, a random sample size two, y one and y two, which my idea from this y y was the probability so particular y of equal to one half.

533
01:19:57,380 --> 01:20:02,270
In other words, this small m is the median of this distribution.

534
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:19,540
What is the probability of? The larger of the two, there was a maximum of why one and why two is greater than that.

535
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:24,080
So that's the question. All right.

536
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:31,730
So think about how to calculate this probability.

537
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:09,670
And as I think you wrote earlier.

538
01:21:17,740 --> 01:22:37,810
Oh, yeah. She wrote it there. And if you got it, what is the number?

539
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:35,880
What is the number? The three or four.

540
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,950
Very good. And let's see, how do we how can we calculate this in different ways?

541
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:49,080
Okay. So one way to do it is, again, since I already express it in this probability form.

542
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:56,580
We can think about how to translate what's inside the probability as a equivalent event that is called level.

543
01:23:57,150 --> 01:24:03,240
Right. Currently the maximum is greater than the cost that is not directly calculable.

544
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:12,660
But if you think about the complement of that event, the maximum last that it calls that and is much more manageable.

545
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:25,940
Right. So that is equivalent to one minus the probability of the max y1y to last that small.

546
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:35,610
That's. And if the max is the last time a small as we argued before that is the equivalent to say

547
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:44,460
why one is less than one in two is less than half at the intersection of this two events.

548
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:58,800
Since these two are independent and identical and distributed, we know exactly nothing that is equal to this y squared.

549
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:05,190
Right? So this is not any constant, but rather the median.

550
01:25:06,030 --> 01:25:13,350
Meaning if you evaluate the CDF function of this and that's exactly one over two,

551
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:19,860
so that's one over two a square, and that gives you the final result of three over four.

552
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:28,110
So that's one way to do it. Okay. Just try to find the equivalent event that is calculable and then evaluate it.

553
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:36,420
Alternatively, you can also use the PDR function that we have talk about.

554
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:42,060
Okay, so this is the probability of the mass of these two, i.e. the amount of barrels,

555
01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:53,190
the other ones you're trying to calculate the probability of this y from this to where I am.

556
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:59,890
Right. Simply be the max statistic is greater than I am.

557
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:11,350
So that is equal to one minus half of y to.

558
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:19,480
That's right. That's the survival function for this mass statistic.

559
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:25,420
And now we can plug in what the formula is for this mass statistic.

560
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:40,990
Recall that it has a formula of Y Square security for back to the order statistics.

561
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:45,190
Uh, right. Right.

562
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:53,230
We know the mass statistic as a function of individual up to the power of it.

563
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:57,430
To the other result directly. Right.

564
01:26:57,790 --> 01:27:01,120
That is equal to one minus y squared.

565
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:05,380
Again, y is one over two. This give you three.

566
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:14,030
And the way it's ended samples instead of two samples.

567
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:27,260
What is the result? If we are talking about the largest amount and random samples exiting the population meeting.

568
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:35,160
What's the probability of that? To see the result directly.

569
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:58,109
She? Yeah.

570
01:27:58,110 --> 01:28:00,790
You can use two approaches. Right.

571
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:14,940
Either you got the complement and break it down into an event in an independent events or you can take advantage of this PR function,

572
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,820
setting out function for the MAX statistics.

573
01:28:18,810 --> 01:28:30,030
In the end, you plug in the number, change this tune two and and get the final result, which should be one minus one over two to the power of it.

574
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:46,980
Now the words as and goes to infinity. The probability of the largest value out of this and samples exiting the population medium is approaching one.

575
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:56,460
So it almost surely will have a maximum, maximum or max statistic greater than the population median.

576
01:28:59,370 --> 01:29:05,219
Any question? All right.

577
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:14,550
So off the classic kind of I can give you some give you a question to think about is what if the question becomes

578
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:22,620
what is the probability of the hours order statistics out of this and random samples exiting the population,

579
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:24,540
meaning what is the probability of that?

580
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:37,320
And so think about what it it's not about the maximum of this and random samples but the hours order statistics exiting the population meeting.

581
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:41,810
What is the probability of that that's thought and.

582
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:59,030
All right. Next example. Love this UI being random samples from this uniform distribution and ask this create a random

583
01:29:59,030 --> 01:30:09,320
variable with PMS of this form where acts is taken by 1 to 3 all the way through infinity.

584
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:12,860
So if you see some of this, some of this up,

585
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:22,430
you can explicitly evaluate what this C constant is in order to make it up here and then see how it should be one over E minus one.

586
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:34,750
Then the question is if you construct a new random variable Z based on this formula, the minimum of you want you to.

587
01:30:35,090 --> 01:30:40,820
All the way through you x. Then what is the distribution for this z random variable?

588
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:50,600
The tricky part here is that you construct this z random variable based on two sets of random barrels.

589
01:30:50,630 --> 01:30:51,350
What is this?

590
01:30:51,710 --> 01:31:02,840
You were unavailable which are idi random samples from uniform and the subsequent x is another rhinovirus which has a discrete distribution.

591
01:31:05,150 --> 01:31:11,030
Think about how we derive the distribution for a random variable that's defined this way.

592
01:32:47,210 --> 01:35:02,330
It's. You got it.

593
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:12,950
It's from your heart. So let me just give you a hint.

594
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:21,470
So we are trying to derive the distribution for Z, which is again defined based on two sequences of random variables.

595
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:27,470
The tricky part is one amount of variable is in the index section.

596
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:35,250
But if you consider this conditional distribution of first edition about X.

597
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:46,200
What is the distribution for Z? Because once you are conditional upon x, x becomes a constant you can't fix.

598
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:08,780
All right. So let's look at this together and see how we can track this problem using the statistics.

599
01:38:10,010 --> 01:38:16,340
So, again, the challenging part in this case is you have a diverging sequence.

600
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:25,760
And so the number of statistics and the number of random variables inside this main function is diverging with a random.

601
01:38:27,050 --> 01:38:33,350
But again, as I said, if you conditioned upon this X, then the tricky part just goes away.

602
01:38:34,550 --> 01:38:43,940
So if we can evaluate this conditional distribution first Zeke of an X and then since we know the marginal distribution of blocks,

603
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:53,420
we can combine the two together, drawn distribution of the annex right from the joint distribution.

604
01:38:54,710 --> 01:39:03,490
We all know how to gather marginals, right? So from the joint distribution, we can integrate out one right of our well to get a marginal.

605
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:12,020
The other in this case is a little bit trickier because one is continuous, one is described by the same idea applies.

606
01:39:12,710 --> 01:39:22,730
If you want to get rid of this a discrete random variable you just sum up and some of them are going to read out the discrete random animal.

607
01:39:23,330 --> 01:39:33,230
As a result, you can get the marginal. So we just take this different steps first and the conditional then got a joint and then got the marginal.

608
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:36,770
All right, so let's take a look at how we actually do it.

609
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:44,780
First of all, the conditional acts, once acts as face, then the Z is just the minimum of this random sample.

610
01:39:45,470 --> 01:39:48,950
As a UI, they are all IDed from the uniform distribution.

611
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:54,730
The minimum is just the the the first order statistics.

612
01:39:55,340 --> 01:40:05,750
Right. So the given x is just u one.

613
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:12,780
Which is the first the mean statistic of.

614
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:31,480
A random sample. Size X right now we know this idea for this minimum statistic from a uniform distribution.

615
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:36,580
We have derived the PDA previously.

616
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:45,700
All right. So that's going to be X, which is the number of the random samples which condition opponents X becomes a constant.

617
01:40:46,570 --> 01:40:55,899
So at times Y minus the CDF of this uniform random variable to the paramount

618
01:40:55,900 --> 01:41:06,310
max minus one times this period of the uniform evaluated at the start of Z.

619
01:41:08,410 --> 01:41:18,850
And we know for this uniform distribution, the CDF function is just the identity functions and the PDA function is a constant function.

620
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:32,740
But once you play it again, that becomes at times one minus Z, X minus one times one, where the greater the zero.

621
01:41:33,730 --> 01:41:41,850
That's not one. Now give us this conditional distribution of these given acts.

622
01:41:42,450 --> 01:41:54,210
Next, we need to got a job distribution or in this case, it's even we don't even need to go that route because you can notice that.

623
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:08,420
The PDA of Z can be evaluated using the law of total probability because this acts as descriptive, right?

624
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:27,950
So the probability or the PDA of Z is equal to the PDA Z even ax times the PMA of X, the sum of all possible values for x.

625
01:42:29,950 --> 01:42:38,229
That's just the law of total probability for if you don't if you don't recall them of total probability,

626
01:42:38,230 --> 01:42:43,930
you can always go from the original root cause,

627
01:42:43,930 --> 01:42:48,450
getting this joint distribution and multiplying this condition distribution,

628
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:57,909
which is the marginal distribution or X and then integrate out X or in fact as Axis described, you just sum up all possible.

629
01:42:57,910 --> 01:43:02,350
That is essentially the same formula. All right.

630
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:06,819
So this is what the total probability is.

631
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:15,190
We plug in what you have, this one, two infinity X, minus Z, that's minus one.

632
01:43:17,710 --> 01:43:21,040
Fans see over X factor.

633
01:43:23,860 --> 01:43:42,489
Now we have see is a common sense we take it out of one affinity, one minus z to the x minus one over x, minus one factorial x.

634
01:43:42,490 --> 01:43:50,590
Here you have x factor here is or how x minus one piano words is equal to you can change this ax.

635
01:43:51,010 --> 01:43:57,490
So now it's from one to infinity and you all have ax minus one in this summation.

636
01:43:57,970 --> 01:44:08,050
Alternatively, you can also deny that X from zero to infinity nine becomes one minus the current at X Factor.

637
01:44:09,250 --> 01:44:12,070
All right. And how do we simplify this summation?

638
01:44:13,270 --> 01:44:24,940
The old treat, right, the old trick that we have used so many times, and now they think this is the kernel of the piano we can reduce.

639
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:28,930
We can directly calculate what this summation is.

640
01:44:29,110 --> 01:44:38,020
So what is a kernel? Also I impose on we have this factorial this power term over factorial format.

641
01:44:38,980 --> 01:44:55,150
We call that 48 cosine distribution at y y is equal to this y factorial lambda lambda to the power of y, right?

642
01:44:55,450 --> 01:45:04,210
And this y goes from zero to infinity here. This range is correct from zero to infinity, and the format is also correct.

643
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:07,600
X factorial this constant times.

644
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:13,210
The power of x is all that's left in this exponential term.

645
01:45:13,690 --> 01:45:25,299
So if you multiply this by E to the negative one minus Z, all right times E to the one minus z.

646
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:32,170
So it cancels out. These is exactly the PPMO for cosine distribution.

647
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:36,550
This parameter one minus a z is from 0 to 1.

648
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,460
That's a valid constant for plus all.

649
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:53,380
All right. So this just goes away because it's under one halts and becomes E to the one minus z over e minus one.

650
01:45:55,430 --> 01:45:59,860
On Z. Greater than zero. Less than one.

651
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:07,650
Okay. I've got it. Any questions?

652
01:46:10,110 --> 01:46:14,340
So this problem is involves several tricks.

653
01:46:14,580 --> 01:46:23,040
First, we need to notice that if the construction of a random variable is complicated, try to break it down.

654
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:28,590
Right. So this one is complicated because it's involving two roundabouts.

655
01:46:29,130 --> 01:46:34,800
But if you conditional upon what then becomes a well known statistic.

656
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:38,070
It's a minimum strip, minimum of a random sample.

657
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:48,480
And then from that conditional distribution, we can got the marginal at the top and then got the bars are using this law of total probabilities.

658
01:46:51,300 --> 01:47:02,580
The second part is this computational tree of evaluating imputed summation or integration and noticing what paranoid is, or a particular Idiap or RPF.

659
01:47:05,790 --> 01:47:10,950
Any questions? Right.

660
01:47:10,970 --> 01:47:13,120
So I have no question that it would be all hot today.

661
01:47:13,130 --> 01:47:21,320
So next time we're going to continue on this on statistics and I'm going to move on to talk about trying distribution of different statistics.

662
01:47:24,130 --> 01:48:39,040
Please, great view. Preview the materials. Yes, we should be doing something I wanted able to do because I use it on location.

663
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:55,240
Like what I was just saying.

664
01:48:57,290 --> 01:49:31,790
If you want to go work on average over 15 years, go about it because I not going to stay inside your work.

665
01:49:31,850 --> 01:49:52,570
I'm going to take mission to enhance the quality of our class work and you're going to have customer complaints.

666
01:49:52,850 --> 01:49:56,410
You can just go through some of what you need.
