1
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:17,180
Yeah. Yeah. You know, there's always a chance to change this.

2
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,450
Okay. It's 11:00, folks. Let's get started.

3
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,510
So happy Friday. Welcome to HMV 620.

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,990
I've got some announcements here up on the on the slide.

5
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,950
Number one, who bugs you more about this than me?

6
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:52,990
Please register for the GLC symposium. Do it today if it's on your to do list and get it off your plate.

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,880
It's $15. It's refundable if you attend.

8
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:02,470
So what a deal. There will be no class that day on Friday, October 7th.

9
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,110
The deadline to register is Friday, September 30th at noon.

10
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:15,549
In full transparency, I have to give the catering headcount on Thursday at the end of the day.

11
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:21,880
So I have to actually do a bit of a guest. So you could help me out by registering before next Friday, if you can.

12
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:29,440
And the bottom line is, you cannot attend if you do not register because we will not have food for you.

13
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:36,399
Okay. So this is really important. If you haven't done it yet, please do it because I really want to see you there.

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,030
And I think you'll find that it's a full, interesting, fun day.

15
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:46,270
Second thing on your to do list is to complete the GLC interest survey and you should have

16
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:52,300
received an email from me yesterday asking you to complete a survey with a went to meet Paul.

17
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,970
We're looking for what interests you.

18
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:02,590
What are the topics you want to hear? Those who are the kinds of leaders who one needs to engage with?

19
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:11,079
Our job in the GLC is to bring leaders in either in-person or remotely to talk about things to you,

20
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:18,700
to give you an opportunity to learn about different kinds of career paths, kinds of industries, and also increase your travel.

21
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,720
So I don't want to know what you're into.

22
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:37,370
This is my population and maybe you make sense, but I want to know exactly which industry so that I can.

23
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:46,410
To come here. So please feel that that's really important because that will really help the quality of your experiences.

24
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,450
Next week we will be remote on Zoom.

25
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:59,040
Next week we're talking about case presentation and case prep and along hashing over.

26
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:07,160
Joining us from New York City. She's a teacher and she's got a lot of experience in this area.

27
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,610
She's a former masterpiece competition winner. And this is just the.

28
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:21,740
To help, whether you're interested in policy or management consulting or not, it's good to know how to dissect the case.

29
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:29,960
Whether you're in a class or whether you do or whether it's just a skill set you have.

30
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,680
If you don't have that. And so that's, I think, going to be a really interesting session and it will be by Zoom.

31
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,150
And as promised, there's a general prompt for the week.

32
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,670
Last week we talked about developing a 32nd elevator pitch.

33
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,720
I'd like you to add your 32nd elevator pitch to your journal.

34
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,670
And I want you to think about how you tweak it for conversations that you're going to

35
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:01,700
have maybe this weekend at the tailgate or other events in the coming couple of weeks.

36
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,350
So write it down.

37
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:10,190
Think about it and think about how you're going to tweak it for various different kinds of constituencies that you're going to be talking with.

38
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:22,240
Okay. That's all I have for today. And. And there we go.

39
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:34,840
Bear with me here. So you are in luck.

40
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:46,470
Today you have a guest speaker who's just, uh, he's an accomplished senior leader in New Orleans.

41
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:55,450
His name is Mike Studio. And Mike is here to talk to you about his inroads.

42
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:06,790
President and Chief Operating Officer at Oxford Dr. Talks here at Oxford Health.

43
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:13,690
And here's he's here to talk a little bit about his career experiences and leadership and so.

44
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,790
So without further ado. Good morning.

45
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,820
I put a plug in for the case analysis and preparation. Ochsner Health is actually the case.

46
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,000
That will be the subject of the case for a nasty case competition this year.

47
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,510
I'll give you one of the judges for the midst of the trials.

48
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:49,340
So don't know how that will play out, but it's interesting to see that the look of morning I again my is my.

49
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:56,560
President. Chief Operating Officer Um, just maybe some start with an introduction.

50
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:05,350
I graduated in NHTSA from Michigan, and I grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Xavier University.

51
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,320
Cincinnati came here basically right through.

52
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:17,390
And so my guess is that it makes a difference. Experience levels here.

53
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:28,640
I had just come out of Michigan. A lot of options are very fortunate in the fashion instance.

54
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,020
I'm a firm believer.

55
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:38,050
Going through, especially for those folks who don't have a lot of work experience, you know, undergraduate school fellowship throughout the process.

56
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:47,810
I picked Ochsner. I think it was about just a reorganization, mainly for couple one middle class life.

57
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:58,160
James. Yeah. Secondly, though, was really the model that we have talk about communication style.

58
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:11,110
It's all about. The third is also the culture, the focus that they had even 25 years ago on the.

59
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:22,360
Welles. What we'll talk about today is what that looks like today and the evolution of our organization.

60
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:29,410
Uh, it's. It's a good plan, and. Public health systems interventions.

61
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,200
They come in. Students in here today.

62
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:38,740
And hopefully this talk appeals to everybody's interest because we'll talk about things in a lot of different markets today.

63
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,910
I would hope if you got questions, I got plenty here.

64
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,560
You get tired here. Let's do everything we can.

65
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:55,240
The conversation was much more interesting. I do reflect back in 1997 when I first came here.

66
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,260
This is one of the few rooms that looks exactly like it did.

67
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,610
I didn't even recognize it from across the street.

68
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:11,170
There's nothing like that. I also remember being in the chair and being pretty solid, pretty intimidated, not wanting to speak up.

69
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:18,490
And so I get that. I get that feeling. So if you have that, trying to overcome that and have a good discussion today.

70
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:25,590
Oh. Kicking this off in terms of where we are today as an organization.

71
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:37,120
A lot of the what we'll talk about today really started three and that definitely impacted our organization as we work our way through the pandemic.

72
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,060
We're the largest health care provider in the state by law.

73
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:51,530
We had about 35,000 employees. Our annual revenues and working on the operating partnerships about $8 billion a year.

74
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,420
Employ a couple of thousand physicians in about 40 plus hospitals.

75
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:04,980
And so in 2019, our board took a step back and said, What do we want this organization to?

76
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:12,160
And its ultimate purpose here. We've always been this place where.

77
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,170
The sickness that the sick came to get care. We have.

78
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:25,320
One of the largest transplant programs. It states for about a decade, we have the largest liver transplant.

79
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:32,980
That's also the best quality outcomes in the country for a lot of high end cardiac care.

80
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:39,030
High end in pediatric care. Yeah, but but that's what you were known for.

81
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:46,970
You were really sick and you had a really big problem. But since I live in the hospital next door, it's always.

82
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,370
Our board really started challenges to think differently about this is our

83
00:09:54,370 --> 00:10:01,479
ultimate mission or we live in a poor state and that unhealthy state at state,

84
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,850
at the education levels not would like it to be at our boards.

85
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,560
We make those issues better. No one is more.

86
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:11,490
Yeah.

87
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:23,900
And so there was a lot of discussion around this in our boardroom around what is us this responsibility to improve not just the health of the state,

88
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:31,970
but also talk about education and some other components that we're really doing much more actively in this nation.

89
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:38,800
In some ways, people have referred to us as more like a public health organization as opposed to a health care provider.

90
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:43,790
And I think that's an accurate assessment. Exactly what we need to do.

91
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,370
The challenge on us is the economics of all of that. In terms of the model.

92
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:55,840
We do live in an environment where. Sure you guys have studied in this study capitation.

93
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:02,870
You've taken a lot of capitation. And so when we're able to drive down the cost of care from a perspective that is different.

94
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:10,070
And so a lot of the talk around public health really is avoidance of disease and the impact on overall.

95
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:15,220
So there's some economic climate, but not to the extent that we needed to be that.

96
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,379
Talk about how we try to push that and think about that.

97
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:24,630
So. What we came up with under them is going to sound cliche when they say how we got here.

98
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:32,490
Louisiana is basically for you guys to fathom out in Mississippi from last week, the United States.

99
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,470
Outpost four for our population. And really more pessimistic about things like health care.

100
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:52,379
And so we came up with this concept of can we get out of here for, you know, 50 to 40 days nationally by 2030,

101
00:11:52,380 --> 00:12:02,790
which is of like really for you under 40, that's still in the bottom 40%, right, till I show you what it means for us to be able to do that.

102
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:08,850
Yeah, but it's, it's, it's an interesting analysis that we went through to try to understand what they it take because again,

103
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:16,500
you know, in some ways within our culture, this concept of, you know, 40 by 30 is becoming a bit of a rallying cry.

104
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,920
Yeah, I think it sounds cool, right? Yes.

105
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:27,640
But that's not really what I would say that the impact would be on the people in our state if we're actually able to.

106
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:40,210
So point on this very forward driven focus and really kind of turn the dial on the expectation of the organization that.

107
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,750
So when we talk about the employee, I have to say, what does that.

108
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:53,559
Exactly. There's there's multiple kind of components that go into this in terms of health outcomes.

109
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:00,400
But you guys, I'm sure we understand, is talking about that. To me, obviously, the socioeconomic factors.

110
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:08,470
You have to give that. Not the most educated population of our state.

111
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,160
The poverty rate is remarkably high. Very often the same.

112
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,670
But basically the largest determinant of your individual health is.

113
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:26,069
I think we're in many ways about that. Clinical care is certainly a component of it.

114
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:30,710
But if you really study this in terms of the overall health of the population,

115
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:40,970
the critical care and these other factors in their social and economic behaviors, the dietary needs, alcohol, smoking,

116
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:47,520
those sorts of things, and then the physical environment that the left hand side of that, probably 80%,

117
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:53,450
the complicated science that all we've done historically is really focus more on the social care.

118
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,700
That's what's changing organizations. So you see our rankings and I'm going to talk a little bit about what we're

119
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:05,180
doing in each of these areas to try to have a sense of closure for about 30.

120
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:10,230
But what does that mean? That means you've got to change everything on the right hand side of this.

121
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:17,489
And sometimes the populations that. So how do we we set this out.

122
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:25,920
We really have announced this in 2012 and became really understanding what this was, what this could look like and how we go about doing it.

123
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:33,600
In 2021, we went very broad experimenting and really launched the initiative for having healthy

124
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,290
lives and for us to be supported by three concepts that will get you started.

125
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:49,300
And this this year, what we've done spent a lot of time engaging system and community and statewide leaders and organization so that that core.

126
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:58,290
It's just. It's complicated. And no one. The government mandated health care providers.

127
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,680
Schools can't do it. Think very differently about the population.

128
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,970
How we work together.

129
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:19,540
So going into this aspiration of of 40 by 30 and really trying to understand where do you begin and how do you tackle this and what is that?

130
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:27,890
What does that look like? We did an assessment of the state. And look, it's different in New Orleans, it in Baton Rouge and those in Shreveport.

131
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,680
Charles and we'll talk about that. We laid out with you what's what's actually going.

132
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:39,080
I've been talking for ten. Well.

133
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:49,430
So we laid out the strengths. Actually, there's a decent amount of funding if you look at it for capital places that are statements that's positive.

134
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,260
Oh, there are certain components in here, again, around teen births, mental health.

135
00:15:54,470 --> 00:16:03,920
We see what we're doing in perspective. So vaccination that actually be pretty well challenges are around poverty

136
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:10,070
unemployment drinking smoking to most chronic diseases product challenges that.

137
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,500
We need to look at the poor health outcomes. And so then we got to lay it out.

138
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:19,610
All right. We're going to make a difference with it. That's our assessment.

139
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:25,450
One of the drivers. And I'll show you some stats almost from from a smoking perspective,

140
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:33,390
but you kind of start go on top to bottom and really try to understand what we actually to do about this.

141
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,200
And also, you know, some of your case study that you guys can get a feel for how we've approached this.

142
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:44,480
My point. I'll talk a little bit about that. The coalition that we've developed.

143
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,010
Because, again, if you look on the right hand side of this house, when you drive from smoking and smoking cessation so that we are very.

144
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,450
That's a big part of what we're doing with economic hardship.

145
00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:01,830
Alexander, that's all. Yeah, it's. We've had a really expensive conflict over your health system and rebuilding.

146
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:16,120
Is that. Is that yours to deal with? Well, Candy, this is a more workforce development perspective than the person will actually have a staff of 70.

147
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:25,430
So, yeah, we can enhance the educational offering and training offering jobs in a way that's going to help us in a very good way.

148
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,910
Staff project here. So we've done.

149
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,020
When you look at it from that perspective, it's a different view.

150
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,780
Premature death. We have a really large opportunity.

151
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,730
Statewide inflation, which is. Not the majority, but it's a significant component of it.

152
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,240
And we've asked some of our physicians, very active at the state level and really around the state,

153
00:17:54,110 --> 00:18:00,600
premature death in the terrible tragedy to have a premature death and a way.

154
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:05,590
Yeah, that's. There is this violence associated with it.

155
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,120
But there's also, again, sort of some of internal politics.

156
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:21,180
So I had to walk through every single one of those. But we feel like in a lot of them, we can't solve everything.

157
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,720
So it's a. So we'll get drilling down further because again.

158
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:33,890
If we're going to shoot to be the state of Louisiana. 48 by 2035.

159
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,880
What? I love the game. Sounds cool. What is that? What does that even mean?

160
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,910
So in Louisiana, 780,000 Louisiana adults smoke.

161
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,150
And so for us to be able to move this to a place where.

162
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:54,310
Coping with where we are in the state. We need to figure out how to get to our 30,000 people.

163
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:59,120
27% of. Stop smoking. What is that?

164
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:06,510
How do you do that? What's that? Who has an interest in working on it?

165
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,940
That comes with the onset of. Right. The second one around, mental distress.

166
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,320
So 26 out of 60,000 people experience frequent distress.

167
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,100
So you get about 25% that we have. That shameful travesty.

168
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,580
Health care provision perspective.

169
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:34,910
I'm sure you guys have spent a lot of time talking about the importance of dental care and how key that is to help in general.

170
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:45,090
And you can see what we need to do better in terms of primary access to dental care families already with the health system with as to how best.

171
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:51,410
That's an area we've never done before, but we're getting into it now, especially pediatric.

172
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:58,220
That's where actually get residency programs in our facilities and where you can get your kids to go out.

173
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:07,140
Chronic disease. And talk a little bit about some of the tools that we developed and how we're trying to apply them to lower income.

174
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:16,770
Individuals. Right now we're funding. And that creates, again, another set of challenges for the economic incentives that always align well.

175
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,390
We've got some great tools and great ways to change the outcomes of hypertension and diabetes and.

176
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:32,880
She's there. And then I'll tell you, the one that we don't have a great feel for or a great plan for is going through this now.

177
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,460
It ties the economic. With the right economic training, you can create more jobs and retain more people.

178
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:47,950
Better from that perspective. Yeah, but this is one that I can't let you guys.

179
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,960
That says that's. To be determined.

180
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,100
So then you got to stay for about four and a half for so many people.

181
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:08,120
But the issues are not the same in every part of the state.

182
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:15,230
So just picking a couple, if you look up Shreveport, the biggest challenges around low birth weight,

183
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:21,050
again, prenatal care, huge opportunity cost and access to health care.

184
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,820
Whereas if you go to New Orleans. Quality of the products.

185
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,560
And so we had the same big rivals with different focus in New Orleans and.

186
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,100
In Shreveport.

187
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:44,399
And so literally each area has some overlap in some of these, but each one kind of comes with its own set of issues and its own set of challenges.

188
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,260
So how do you think about that? How do you assess that?

189
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,820
How do you figure out what it is you want to do and who do you work with in each of these different regions?

190
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:01,470
So I'm going to stop there before we get into some of the work that we're doing.

191
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:06,590
See you guys. Any question, though, part of the overall assessment?

192
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:12,290
The size of the task. Our view based on state.

193
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:19,060
Given the prime. Does that mean?

194
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:35,800
Yeah. So. One thing a little bit of history for a couple of minutes of the.

195
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:44,380
So when I went there in 1988, I'm actually on the margins of the state.

196
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:50,860
Yeah. And the whole delivery mechanism of. Was the.

197
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:58,090
It was all kind of like. It certainly has service to what we hear a lot.

198
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:14,710
But we we want something to live. So back in the early 2000, doing a well recap of the but when we started it we maintained all those.

199
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,900
And so. And still have them to this day.

200
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:26,150
And one of things I think is great about our organization is we're making the largest liver transplant program in.

201
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,760
I have a couple of good stuff,

202
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:40,680
but we do it in an environment where we also have that most organizations are not necessarily in that boat because that is the way to.

203
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:50,590
Was like 34 years. So. I give you that history because to your point.

204
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,550
Take Medicare bills, pensions.

205
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:05,460
And as we think about the challenges that they face on hypertension and diabetes, there's absolutely no organization that we're able to.

206
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,520
Manage these disease states better and get.

207
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:17,950
From a medicaid perspective. I talk about some of the stuff we're trying to improve the health of the Medicaid population.

208
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:27,160
Right now, we don't take risk in that environment. We're actually providing much of the service here in the state for Medicaid.

209
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:34,160
Because if we keep everybody in the hospital, we have an emergency department in the hospital.

210
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:39,600
So it's frustrating that some of the parents. The tragedy before.

211
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:43,890
And so, yeah, we are in the commercial insurance world.

212
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,470
It's still in service for us as a commercial service,

213
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:58,370
but we might not make a lot of money right now because the biggest problem is that it didn't really, really well.

214
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:04,530
And so the impetus for them to change. It is just purely look at this from an economic perspective.

215
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:10,980
It's pretty. They talk about this before and after that.

216
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:17,169
A point of personal frustration for me in this whole process.

217
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:20,739
And the work that we're trying to do is as a health care provider,

218
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:27,130
we've got a very broad view with a lot of investment into our communities and how to.

219
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,889
We're a not for profit health system right now.

220
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:38,610
Post but a lot of systems. You have to do a brain.

221
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,800
They're not coming to talk to you about stuff. It should be.

222
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,150
I think that there is a. To me, it's a little bit of a.

223
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:53,020
Then the frustration comes from the spokesperson that.

224
00:25:54,110 --> 00:26:01,820
I'll just have to let you get, I think, until the payors and the providers closer together and move towards a.

225
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:06,350
Population health. But you've got it right here.

226
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:11,820
I think this is. And so that's why we're also seeing this is a ten year journey world.

227
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:17,040
And I'll show you some of the consortiums that were trying to deal with the tenders.

228
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,810
It's about hitting me with a lot faster. Like I said.

229
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:35,100
Yeah, exactly. So that's in large part never really focused on Medicare or, uh, Medicare patients.

230
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:46,550
But also we're also getting into the culture is where do you think we'll get the economic benefit on that to Medicare patients that we have?

231
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:52,399
Um, but at the same time, we're scaling up programs through Medicaid patients.

232
00:26:52,400 --> 00:27:00,970
That frankly is. Dollars were spent right now because we saw these patients in the course of our prospective negotiation.

233
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:07,390
Right now, we're crossing over to pay for someone to do something about it because we've proven they drive down the cost of care and.

234
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,250
So we're in a little bit of a question, really.

235
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:20,150
We have a little bit of Medicare for all in do it.

236
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:24,620
Well, that kind of drama from that perspective. In Medicaid.

237
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,310
We're getting a lot closer to that or a lot of Medicaid.

238
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:33,260
As it grew across the commercial planet away the.

239
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:44,620
At the same time we're still providing service and we'll try to embed culture rotation is here for patients to care for and let us do it again.

240
00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:02,110
So good question. You know, we do every couple of years as part of our nonprofit status we have.

241
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:10,610
You know, honestly, we've done. Um.

242
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:16,310
We've never thought of it like this until we're pushed.

243
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:24,370
Mental health needs another person on the alongside and actually in some of our markets all the hospital systems together.

244
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:30,710
So virtually all the same things and interface with public health at peace across the state of China.

245
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:40,890
The difference is that we have always known that it never really got much, much, you know, in some ways it felt.

246
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,410
That's a little too much like we were checking the box because this is how we get.

247
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:52,560
We have gotten a lot closer with public health entities,

248
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:59,980
and that's why we're dealing from a political perspective and some of the things we're doing, which is actually creating competition.

249
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:07,020
So we think it's a really. So they're certainly involved in their long term and statewide.

250
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,550
But if you look at the results. Gotten much out of.

251
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,470
So we're pushing each other and it's actually getting a little tense at times.

252
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:32,660
Have you seen any progress or. Probably get.

253
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,980
That's a great question. We have last year's as well as picked up a.

254
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,990
Whether you can directly tie that to Medicaid expansion or not, I don't know.

255
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:52,310
But I will tell you, we firmly believe we expand Medicaid four or five years ago.

256
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:58,850
We then in favor of what they won? It's been great from a patient perspective.

257
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:06,750
I will tell you one of the challenges that some of. You guys understand these concepts?

258
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:12,340
A lot of private practice groups. And I think the commercial interpretation things.

259
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:17,410
One of the challenges for us is.

260
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:30,490
We've got an outbreak of. But a lot of the private companies here so historically have been charged with no no coverage.

261
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,160
Nobody. And so it's far from perfect.

262
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,630
I think over the course of time, there was no question.

263
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,900
I also tell you that. Back to that slide.

264
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:51,880
I before where on the right hand side you have the clinical care and other components as well the socioeconomic components of.

265
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:59,190
That's the bigger fight. Yeah. And so, again, a huge proponent of Medicaid expansion.

266
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:08,390
It's helping. Whether I can directly correlate will improve in clinical outcomes to that.

267
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,870
That's a that's a long conversation. I do think.

268
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:40,550
We've had a lot of people studying this. I would say it's not.

269
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:48,000
Only in. I worry a lot about the impact of the rise.

270
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:54,820
But the amount of mental health disease. Especially when children.

271
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:02,560
Is true. And I don't think we even begun to understand what that actually.

272
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:12,470
What the long term effects associated with this are. One of the things that we've done on our show is we three years ago as part of this work,

273
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,870
we asked our mental health department to see if they can double.

274
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:21,240
I'm sorry, w. Didn't think they could do it.

275
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:28,879
There's a lot of psychologists and psychiatrists and social work. A very competitive environment.

276
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,650
Fighters. Somehow. That's scary, though.

277
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:37,540
It is. Literally on day one, those people show up for their patients.

278
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,860
And the demand is completely insatiable. But I think there is based on.

279
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,680
So socioeconomic status, age. But what we're really trying to watch and figure out is what?

280
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,970
So it's it's it's it's a relative term.

281
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:04,070
A lot of it's some of the pediatric components of the job facing an adolescent no more than two.

282
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:11,550
Social isolation. Level of violence has very, very different ways for children.

283
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:18,510
So that's definitely compelling about it. But I think there's a lot of factors driving it.

284
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:24,860
I think it all got multiplied. So.

285
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,640
What are we? This is kind of the assessment, right?

286
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:37,090
The budget numbers that I would take and how we think about, for example, this approach to it's a better question, what do you actually do?

287
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:42,880
Right. We're not going to be able to hit on everything that we had today.

288
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:48,310
But there are certain components of this that I feel like we're going to play in certain ways our.

289
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:54,000
So. So I left to write health outcomes interventions in screening perspective.

290
00:33:55,030 --> 00:34:03,570
Yeah, we had a lot around 42 different views as long as you focus on access to better access to it.

291
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:15,030
This past Saturday, we had that downtown massive screening and about 50 patients show up, the vast majority of without a primary care doctor.

292
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:19,740
But, you know, I'm sure we have all these community health clinics around the region.

293
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:25,130
Yeah. We had an on site for appointments all the summer.

294
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,760
So you can try to prepare for it. See, so we're doing events like that.

295
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,940
And you. At the same time we were working on.

296
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:43,560
Our cancer leadership team was present for more than one or two slides on their

297
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:49,140
support for cancer screening rates in 2017 and ratcheting up significant.

298
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:57,190
He got better. So we are. And they had a real impact from that perspective.

299
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,380
And that's why we do everything we can to really show what is work.

300
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,340
I'm going to talk about digital health a little bit and then talk about vaccines and how we view this program and also.

301
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:14,150
As we just reviewed the world a little bit differently three years ago, especially around those two issues.

302
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,240
The social determinants, I think, is the biggest challenge for health care is.

303
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:24,250
This is where I think working with the public health agencies is the most important part of it.

304
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:33,690
You know, we have we think about transportation to and from our organization so people relationships with.

305
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,380
Seven. That's out to get people who are to chronic condition,

306
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:45,520
patients who have appointments or have a child protection perspective to make sure they get in and see the doctor.

307
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:52,600
A lot of organizations have done things like that. Food security is a real challenge, broadband and all of those discussions.

308
00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:00,400
But the same thing is that one that's really multi-factorial.

309
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:06,190
It's a little bit out of our house and we don't have very much to do with so.

310
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:12,130
Our answers, create more jobs, train more people, get people better economically.

311
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:16,120
And that's. That's the biggest impact of that.

312
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,230
Which leads me to the next point. I'll talk a little bit more about this in greater detail.

313
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,820
The workforce development epidemic is very advanced and.

314
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,780
It's the same with the same thing. Yeah. And the economic disparities are huge.

315
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,800
And we'll talk about what we try to do from that point of view.

316
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:40,380
So that's an interesting one from there. Nutrition, exercise, health behaviors.

317
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:46,590
You go to a nice restaurant in the world, you probably see a park next to the healthcare wheels.

318
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:50,970
That's all part of the program you have to organize in the nice.

319
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,740
We also own multiple fitness.

320
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:03,800
So we're trying to make this accessible care center accessible to people and really trying to get that sort of stuff together.

321
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:08,420
You saw obesity. It's a big challenge, all this together.

322
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,780
But we know that this as well. And then access community health centers.

323
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:24,760
We will build 52 health centers. In underserved neighborhoods between now and the end of 2024.

324
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:33,170
We got a government approved construction right now, early construction with an online bus and.

325
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:40,370
It's just a fundamentally different strategy. Frankly, most health care providers, we're not any different.

326
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:48,420
We tell you, we used to pick sites based on where you insure people. I have to write this book also pays the bills now.

327
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:54,280
Do think we have to continue to do that? If I actually have to do more of that so that we can have find.

328
00:37:55,250 --> 00:38:01,490
The power centers. We're talking about today. It creates a very strong sense of community organization.

329
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:09,010
It's proven to be quite, quite positive. But again, we're getting into this community health center where it's almost like.

330
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:16,020
It's really the same concept, really sort of. They are.

331
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:24,080
Great question. We do have we have about. 15 or 20 school based.

332
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:34,010
But that's one of things we did not really think of as well, where we schools had no idea like, you know, how to use.

333
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:41,710
COVID experience. And so what we did was the first batch of child stars many years ago,

334
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:47,860
you get a contract in the schools and private schools and take them to the public schools.

335
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,820
And so we began funding. So.

336
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:03,300
And so we've got a bunch of them now, and they basically have telemedicine capabilities to deliver nutrition to you.

337
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:10,310
And so that interface. And but it's something that, again, three years ago, we weren't doing it.

338
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:18,150
The pandemic definitely sped up, and that was more driven by our desire to realize just how important.

339
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:25,129
This is. So I'm going to dove deeper into this.

340
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:31,790
But this is kind of the concept because of how we're thinking about organizing work and what that looks like.

341
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:38,710
What are the other entities that we stood up is called Oxford Agency to help.

342
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:47,070
Xavier is an HBCU in New Orleans that is a great academic institution.

343
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:51,660
It actually. In a national perspective.

344
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:59,260
Every year, it seems that with the most African-American kids into school.

345
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:04,390
Great, great, great, great, great science based breakdown. And they do a wonderful job.

346
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:11,880
And so one of things we did was let's do outreach, because they were where we're at a community pharmacy program.

347
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:18,800
We came up with this idea for combat where some of their students and faculty

348
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:26,060
ideas are used to really try and understand in much greater detail the challenges,

349
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:31,430
but then also really get into the outcomes research and what does this look like?

350
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,930
Because again, I'm showing the global data that still don't necessarily get it.

351
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:40,399
And what's really important is we get into in doing this work.

352
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:48,680
And so the principles behind our our Institute for Health Equity Research starts with, again, outcomes research.

353
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:56,510
What's our data? What's our scale? One thing that's good about oxygen is that all of our hospitals, all of our clinics,

354
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:01,070
all this community was involved in all that we've done, I think, for ten years.

355
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:07,160
And so the amount of data that you have on your entire system is a lot of my driving record.

356
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:12,139
Yeah, it's millions of patients over the last year, but I think it's really,

357
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,850
really helpful and I think it's a great experience for students at the university

358
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:20,459
also to participate in this if you're allowed to work with us on the data strategy,

359
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:25,180
you see. From a population health perspective.

360
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:32,410
We talk a lot about this Medicare age, folks. How do we figure out the quality of what is happening in life?

361
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:44,990
How do we track the effectiveness of. Again, university through this institute is helping us track what we're doing for the health care.

362
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:51,540
Health careers. Again, I talked about that move that we're doing a ton there.

363
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:59,970
Partly that was selfish for the words I was trying to say. It's compatible with people's lives.

364
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:08,090
ReEngage with your question earlier. Community health needs assessment and how do we build partnerships for public executions?

365
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:14,260
That's again, part of the work. And as a result, we study that. And then there's definitely proposals around things like control.

366
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,200
Tobacco research and policy, followed by the State Government's support.

367
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:25,550
Luckily, the funny thing about this situation. Basically finding care.

368
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,860
The portion of our state that continues to smoke.

369
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:35,660
And so those are the two parts of the legislature that really push it to try to make a difference.

370
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:48,610
So what do we do like right now? And what are we working on today trying to make sense of this, that you're not going to go through all of this?

371
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:58,409
But I am going to pick a few. You'll probably find lots most interesting results in the quest to get in the middle on the top

372
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:03,450
in-clinic value based programs with Medicaid for lung cancer screenings that I just mentioned.

373
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,530
So while it was great that Louisiana expanded the.

374
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:15,720
There are certain things that those movies that. This is a smoking cessation, not.

375
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:21,230
One screening a lot of Russian players will pay for about.

376
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,710
Yeah. Couple of things in the upper right hand corner. Comprehensive dental care for adults.

377
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:36,220
The best digital hypertension programs that we have helped manage that work in a pilot program right now.

378
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:40,000
And that is that managed care organizations. I'll show you some results of.

379
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:46,600
Obviously this is a human scale, but we can't fund it all.

380
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:52,450
So there's a lot going on within that. And I got some pretty specific answers here, for example.

381
00:43:55,140 --> 00:44:02,629
This slide into to regulatory questions. So I mentioned that you guys understand the complexity to have to try to rebuild

382
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:07,400
this organization because you do it all by itself and coming close to that.

383
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,100
And so we did we created a statewide advisory without 30 to 40 people on it.

384
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:21,450
And they're a significant industry. They are other health care providers, all of the large systems of the state.

385
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:30,980
And we said, you can't do this alone. We will be the conveyor belts that everybody with us from the health care provider perspective.

386
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:36,980
It's pharmaceutical representation. Education, technology, public health, large employers.

387
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:42,820
Academic institution. Two is part of it. You can't do this part of it.

388
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:51,160
And against governmental leadership, that's where you. So every quarter is about 35 or 40 minutes.

389
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,880
Get there and you go through what you always leave it.

390
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:00,300
What are we doing when we take it on? Um. Because it can be so.

391
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:08,730
Action. Sometimes we look over our shoulder and wonder where the US is in terms of the pace of change.

392
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:12,650
Again, you have to align on different sources.

393
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,510
So are you just not going to bother to challenge?

394
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:34,410
Questions at this point. It's.

395
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,950
Like the government. I guess.

396
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:53,380
It's. It's China. It's clearly a red state.

397
00:45:55,060 --> 00:46:01,010
And. I wouldn't necessarily be a Democrat.

398
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:09,360
Turns out the next election is very rare.

399
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:13,680
And that was the. Gubernatorial race in Louisiana.

400
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:21,570
He's on that group. The head of Louisiana Department of Health.

401
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:25,870
Always one group. So you have.

402
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:30,010
Have. But Louisiana former House leader.

403
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:38,340
Her job like they were here. Of course she's going to be. I wouldn't say there's anyone who's.

404
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:43,910
Actively. Against the work that we're doing.

405
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:51,160
You still get involved. Right. So just is more like, okay, well, that's great for you guys.

406
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,300
Do it at the moment. You raise your perspective and that's what.

407
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:58,900
Everybody go do your work and let us know how.

408
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:10,040
This is supposed to go. So I wouldn't say that there's really anybody existing at all, but I would tell you.

409
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:17,320
We wish to support a more aggressive and is in our opinion this is a change.

410
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:26,670
And it's again, it's so cold, it's so complex that we need the strong participation.

411
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,600
We're negotiating the mischaracterizations. And I'll show you some of the.

412
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:39,620
And so some of our digital medicine tools that we know keep some people out of of their.

413
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:44,910
Got to meet some resistance, but this just gets harder.

414
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:50,800
I think that. Thank you for your question, but.

415
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:02,080
Yeah, good question. So we do have that it does tie to representation.

416
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:07,690
We've got multiple leaders in both the lack of academic institutions and the

417
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:13,360
health care providers against multiple approaches and systems that are here.

418
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:20,050
And so there is a little bit of time in terms of the number of seats that are on the advisory board.

419
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:28,480
As we as we look at this, some of that and obviously the good news that your question everyone we asked to get on this board and participate said yes.

420
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:33,870
So there was no. But that wasn't what you saw.

421
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:38,190
There are other people making less interesting. But we've got to.

422
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,910
So within the organization, this is kind of how we structured the work.

423
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:52,860
Our CEO reports the actual board directors who actually the beginning of it is created in the upper right hand corner of this community.

424
00:48:54,050 --> 00:49:01,780
So it's a subset of our goals. We always have important. A lot of other things, but we didn't have a huge impact there.

425
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:09,549
And so we review these results and look at board committee report in terms of how how we're doing.

426
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:12,400
We appointed a physician lead, an lead.

427
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:23,049
We have the Xavier University for Health Equity and then internally we have a healthy sue outbreak in our group that does its work internally.

428
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:35,290
And the advisory board, which is which is this group and the work is clay is being that point being restructured the work and accountability to.

429
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:40,770
Did they do it? Let's do it. Let's get going after it needs to cleared.

430
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:49,270
In terms of some of the way that we've thought about.

431
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:55,049
This work. We can only get some details now without the actual examples.

432
00:49:55,050 --> 00:50:03,360
But if you think about again code, I started with right hand corner, the right hand side and that's one of the things that I think three years ago.

433
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:09,940
Not sure we thought this way. It was as we got to vaccinate.

434
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:17,110
Thousands of people. But one of things we got into early on was what is?

435
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:23,860
What is the situation as it relates to this in terms of the patients that were vaccinated?

436
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:31,270
And does our work reflect the fact that the population that we serve?

437
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:40,900
And so it's pointed out here that the actual health vaccinator just that we look at black and African-American or vaccinated populations,

438
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:45,010
about 26%, Louisiana populations, 32.8%.

439
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:51,880
And now the unknown or other. You can see that a four point difference there.

440
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:57,190
I'm guardedly optimistic that some of these folks feel better that African-American.

441
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:05,010
Proving that that stat is something that our vaccine spent a ton of time thinking about and talking about.

442
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:08,410
And by the way, you know, you can see about a six point difference now.

443
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:16,689
The difference now, at one point, that was about ten. We tell the Pakistanis, you can make a difference in the Philippines for access to vaccines,

444
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:22,860
for use as well, so that we can we can actually do a better job for that patient population.

445
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:26,430
So again, these are stats and I'm not sure we would necessarily.

446
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:33,230
It impacts on the strategy, resource allocation and what we do on day to day basis.

447
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:40,010
We also looked at this as part of that work with your institute and we publish that.

448
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:49,429
So we looked at positivity across black, white, Hispanic, Asian populations, hospitalization rate,

449
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:54,410
which you can see I find pretty interesting the difference in the hospitalization rates.

450
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,890
We also looked at deaths in the hospital with that rate.

451
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:05,220
And so is there a disparity? Is that your job to compare the patient populations compared to Hispanics and

452
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:08,820
that you can see actually death in the hospital between African-Americans white.

453
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:17,860
And so it was unfortunate. If you think about going back upstream around the back seat, that's what that was all about.

454
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:24,399
You've got to get people vaccinated. And so that's the way that we're beginning to think about things.

455
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:29,050
And again, what we we've extremely transparent about it would be shows within our organization, so you can see it.

456
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:32,590
And so I think a lot of the values that we care about.

457
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:40,860
So that's again how we think about this and how this impacts us on day to day real time issues that we care for.

458
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:45,249
Get. Mental health. Again, we go back.

459
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:49,630
This is the number of visits recently that we did back in 2019.

460
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:54,399
5000 visits a month, 100,000 visitors.

461
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:03,730
And the bulk of the question around mental health said the fact that the size of our department we get there is a huge need for.

462
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,820
Throughout the pandemic. This is the response to it. Pretty good job.

463
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:18,660
I've said this about four times now that we've developed different digital tools that we're.

464
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:27,530
Drone pilots will work with a number of ministerial to try to figure equalization up.

465
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:35,300
So we built all this technology ourselves. I'm just going to use the left hand side of the graph as an example of where this digital.

466
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:40,030
Where we stand in this case is that all Medicare patients.

467
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:48,790
Fun. We send people high blood pressure. The patient goes home to take their blood pressure goes into.

468
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:57,600
Pharmacists who have protocols throughout our physicians that can manage hypertension medications.

469
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:08,040
So we take the patient population in Shreveport and roll how many people into it.

470
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:14,710
But what we had kind of the usual care are in the yellow bar on there and the

471
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:21,420
control rates at 90 days compared to those folks in our digital medicine programs.

472
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:27,720
And you could see 64% of the patients in our digitized programs that had the hypertension under control compared to 57%,

473
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:30,720
which is better than zero at least twice a year.

474
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:37,200
Pregnancy, your doctors and blood pressure was very healthy and we prescribed something and probably did well.

475
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:47,470
So 57% in the Medicaid population. But then we studied it and it is the results were fewer in-patient admissions.

476
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:55,450
Fewer E.R. visits and fewer primary care physician visits to this population.

477
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:02,260
Because we literally can track their and monitor their blood pressure as much as they.

478
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:11,830
And so this stuff works. And I think back to some of the other question, what becomes a little bit frustrating at times like if you.

479
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:22,190
And I ran a McCain managed care organization that you can track everyone, every hypertension diabetes patient with you on this program.

480
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:29,610
That I think is going to take. I know it's taking time, but those are the sorts of programs which I wouldn't take a huge difference.

481
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:37,630
If people can arrive on time and make this work, if this is an example for the patients, it's good that.

482
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:53,140
Questions on that. Just like you mentioned.

483
00:55:55,090 --> 00:56:07,010
As for the vaccine. So what kind of.

484
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:14,850
We went out. We did. It was two main things that we did in urban areas.

485
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:20,870
We did a lot of work. With local churches.

486
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:32,890
And so we go on Sundays. So that's. Centers of Business Insider outside the church and many people.

487
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:39,130
It sounds similar. There's the energy area over the registration.

488
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:49,770
I think people are seeing the whole sort of thing. And so we really hope to work closely with the rest of the population that.

489
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,879
In those instances. If you think about it, though, a lot of folks walk the church.

490
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:01,110
So the transportation issues are addressed. Access could be a factor.

491
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:05,190
But it's also true that. So it's true.

492
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:10,040
We all the churches are going to have to. Populations.

493
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:16,999
And so we did a lot of that in more urban rural areas, but also it's similar to urban areas.

494
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:28,220
We did buy more. Japan's. Trust that we could then actually transport a team to go to a river city area in a rural area.

495
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:32,820
Instead of capability, we discovered refrigeration and all that stuff.

496
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:36,860
That's the vision that you've seen. So.

497
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:47,850
We had teams of people. All they did was fast. And yes, we have in our clinics you have in the hospital, you've got to go work.

498
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:57,570
And those are probably the two most important aspects. We did some where we would do outreach to large employers in the state to.

499
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:03,700
Employee working people. Tended to be in the vaccinated group.

500
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:09,320
And so the yield on that work wasn't as high in some of the other stuff.

501
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,410
So. We were based out of Boston.

502
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:25,800
That's where I grew up. Yeah. We we have to get back to having we get a lot of data we were able to they understand what are the biggest pockets.

503
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:32,070
The lack of vaccination. We also helped develop for the state of Louisiana.

504
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:38,440
Tracking system where we track, we ran the analytics behind the state point.

505
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:43,440
So we will be able and we will get positive testing rates.

506
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:52,760
But there are two different things that we got through the summit and so we knew what was really cool about that is living figured out and that.

507
00:58:53,690 --> 00:59:00,740
Yeah. Because you had the test. So we would better deploy teams on a daily basis to different parts of the state and.

508
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:08,120
Without being the analytics behind that for the state that we have that data.

509
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:14,940
And again, a lot of those who are inner city, inner city or rural areas for being with the data and.

510
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:18,780
Exactly. See the positivity rates trending.

511
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:28,920
And. That's what I've heard.

512
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:32,430
If you dare to, then go back and look at what?

513
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:38,190
We did and then do a little more bizarre phone calls. There was a.

514
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:48,160
The Department of Health has its limited set of resources over military support personnel that were deployed also.

515
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:56,280
We get it. One of the things I was doing as a military support for.

516
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,450
Alexandra, where was your. Yeah, I figured out.

517
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:09,960
Yeah, that's just kind of what you for, what we do. But we tried to coordinate across all resources.

518
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,270
Highest and best use of. Resource.

519
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:23,160
It's time. You know what it's about. It's okay.

520
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:32,820
So I want to go forward and really think through how the community engagement perspective on what is this, what is this means for us.

521
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:41,160
So from an education perspective, you mentioned early on, we're not the most widely educating state in the in the union.

522
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:45,250
And so we've done different things as we as we get into this.

523
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:52,260
One thing that we opened a couple of years ago was a John Foster Discovery School, which a charter room facility.

524
01:00:52,710 --> 01:01:04,110
It's near our main campus, which isn't in the greatest of neighborhoods of what we did in the state of the art school that was no longer in use.

525
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:10,110
We helped start a $20 million renovation of that school.

526
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:19,440
It is it's now in 2021, we're going to be the same level as Baton Rouge in 2023.

527
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:30,809
There is a component. This is really good for our employees because half the slots in the school are reserved basically for our employees.

528
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:34,720
They get to get first crack at it. Again, it's public school.

529
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:40,140
Low cost is ramped up faster than we've ever bothered have.

530
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:46,620
But we never thought and never thought we'd be. The elementary school.

531
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:56,360
The charter runs it. It's part of the question we are we for is that great access to it?

532
01:01:56,370 --> 01:02:04,779
So it's one thing to sit around and play the educational system and to be able to make it better in a way.

533
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:08,480
And so we had that is building literally up.

534
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:16,480
So this is like a. Education. I think.

535
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:24,000
That's exactly what he says. And. Again.

536
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,580
It's in a neighborhood that is. Of it.

537
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:37,550
And so it's literally going in to provide public school options, exactly as you describe it for.

538
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:46,030
Relatively. The other thing we're doing is STEM.

539
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:51,780
Nola is a not for profit. It's really your parents instead of education in the city of Louisiana.

540
01:02:52,620 --> 01:03:03,390
We actually the building was lit up. We'll be doing the city to help actually provide funding for the program so that we can get STEM education.

541
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:08,510
For your health education more deeply embedded in early.

542
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:14,040
Child's development. So yeah, things like that.

543
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:18,899
Some years ago I thought if we think about the workforce,

544
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:28,320
go to the local community college or building a $20 million facility to expand the size of nursing school allied health programs.

545
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:33,150
And it really basically double their capabilities.

546
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:36,490
It's the future of professional staff again.

547
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:41,760
Is that self-serving? Yes. Is it you?

548
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,910
Absolutely. Does it expand opportunities for people?

549
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:56,590
Yeah. Yeah. Every year in the state of Louisiana, we have 5000 qualified applicants to their school that don't get.

550
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:02,760
And you know. We've got a massive nursing shortage.

551
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:09,290
And you got 1500 people every year for the right to be a nurse.

552
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:18,690
Student. All right. Let's go. Let's go solve this unfixable problem.

553
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:26,350
One of the biggest challenges problem. And so we've actually recently, about a week or so ago, requirements in, say,

554
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:34,710
Louisiana that said that within a school of nursing with 70, 70% of as part of the accreditation, 70% of the faculty.

555
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:41,620
The schools are saying brave willing to take back so.

556
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:51,900
A nursing officer is. The president said it was necessary and she felt that through the initiative that this is okay.

557
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:57,420
Only 20% of nurses that teach in school at the University School of New.

558
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:03,270
You could argue or exaggerate. Maybe not.

559
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:12,240
But it's better than the best shortage of people. Itching to get into versus to the point that there is a faculty disagreement on the problem.

560
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:16,560
So you got to try something different. Oh, by the way, they ought to go through and pass their.

561
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:22,980
Before the practice session. So. It's going to come down to that.

562
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:27,540
So we're trying to really think differently about this.

563
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:32,320
We are doing similar programs, tax, free tax.

564
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:39,010
And then one of the more interesting ones we were doing this for a long time is we have backlog systems in our clients that help support.

565
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:45,120
About $15 an hour. And what we will do is help fund out.

566
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:49,680
The group continued to gain success in.

567
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:56,680
Grow your ears, but also about. To save sustainable life.

568
01:05:56,690 --> 01:06:00,170
So we point to this is what is one example?

569
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:08,360
It's one example of. We're trying to vet this war within our community.

570
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:23,159
Specifically. We have a tremendous number of. Of our staff who participate in different events and to help educate the better place and

571
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:29,940
that can be operated for a lot of people frankly volunteer their time of off hours you.

572
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:36,540
But we believe that somebody does pay attention.

573
01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:45,139
Well, but there are people that just want to do. But you can see different ways around it and other challenges that we have.

574
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:48,590
But we're trying to figure out what we have here.

575
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:54,530
And that's actually part of our part. Mission statement.

576
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:59,360
So I to say this is the program where we decided.

577
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:07,190
Same player, same player who up a concept similar to Big Brothers but much, much broader.

578
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:10,080
But let's talk about the show first.

579
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:19,860
And so we were talking about the nation to its program so that they can continue to expand to give young men specifically.

580
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:30,820
Mentor and it goes pretty deep and there's actually a week or two to go experience some of the other ones in.

581
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:36,250
So programs like that would take over the course of time to make the real.

582
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:42,630
From a research perspective. Again, we have the relationship with Hager Hill.

583
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:46,720
The foundation gives a $2 million grant to get this fast and get it going

584
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:53,800
because we have to study the BROOKS got into the game got a lot of a lot of it.

585
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:58,660
You have all the different views and perspectives on it, not just the clinical.

586
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:16,540
Which is what? Right. So.

587
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:26,250
Good question. The data on all four.

588
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:33,430
It's more your house. His presence.

589
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:41,020
And so some of the data that you have to look at all of the patient population, but you've got that data.

590
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:49,880
And so so naturally, you would think that users customers that the service providers or the.

591
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:59,040
The things that are hardest to measure are things like. Food insecurity and stuff like that.

592
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:02,490
Broadband access for young. Yeah.

593
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:07,280
That's a little infected with that. That's good.

594
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:13,080
And so I think it's, it's things like. Food security.

595
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:24,410
The and then from an education perspective. Standardized testing has failed things like quality the especially in elementary schools and.

596
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:32,220
And there's the statewide testing that. I need to know how to make sure that.

597
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:38,500
So when we worry more about it or harder to do for us to understand and for us to deal with.

598
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:47,000
Are those the societal issues that we still.

599
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:50,760
We're totally dependent on others for that again.

600
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:57,010
We're going to have a really interesting case study that was sort of we opened a couple years ago and we wanted to.

601
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:06,110
So we're going to we're going to have an interest a few years, about ten years of interest in education in the state.

602
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:11,230
But until you participate, you don't have them in the situation.

603
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:23,650
I feel like. So.

604
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:26,820
So that's why we didn't even name this.

605
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:32,799
45.5. We got it for about €30 million.

606
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:37,470
So it takes a long. This society has been built over.

607
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,410
For years, I'll be honest with you philosophically on that point.

608
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:49,500
I'd like to get to 40 by 2030, but if we get to 45.

609
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:55,770
It's a lot better. Or you might want to go out there.

610
01:10:57,950 --> 01:11:05,630
And so that's part of the philosophy behind it is that, you know, what we need to do is get better.

611
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:12,920
That was a big rallying cry. So. But we got it.

612
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:20,569
We got to figure out how to engage people on these tough issues because they really we have a long time by weakening the trade agreement,

613
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:32,030
hypertension, diabetes. Education, food insecurity, workforce stuff is going to take for it to be big enough to matter itself in four years, right?

614
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:35,830
In order to ensure workers are graduating themselves and not two years from now.

615
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:43,390
But the really severe impact, though, in large numbers across multiple cities and across multiple parts of the state.

616
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:50,940
Years. Decades is how we have. Would love to come back here.

617
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:55,320
Decades. Here's a lesson of what worked and what failed.

618
01:11:55,380 --> 01:12:02,520
And someone's going to fail. Oh, so community health.

619
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:08,330
Community Service. I mentioned this earlier. Um. A lot of health systems in order to get rid.

620
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:15,350
We have to continue this work. Have to generate some margin so that we can do our part to support.

621
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:23,530
So we ask we continue to offer and open new sites in new parts of the state where you can really generate more jobs there.

622
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:28,000
But we've begun to open is also part of it.

623
01:12:28,570 --> 01:12:34,840
So going back to what we can do, provision of care and we've opened up a couple of them, we are able in the construction.

624
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,930
And more importantly is that people don't have access to care.

625
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,220
And, you know, we do a lot of different programs in there.

626
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:50,250
It's primary care, but it's also the smoking cessation piece about how they will be added to that in a statewide perspective.

627
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:56,639
Obesity is a stupid program that you teach classes in these various community health centers.

628
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,480
People can't take this up and get you to there as need be.

629
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:03,850
And then we're extending the hours because it's obviously what people.

630
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:13,890
If you're making $12 an hour. You can't take 3 hours off during the week and you can't do it.

631
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:17,580
Yeah. And so us running the clinic.

632
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:22,600
From 8 to 5. Monday through Friday.

633
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:34,770
Yeah, I work for some patient, so for sure the patient population is working for us, going to need access outside of those hours.

634
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:41,600
And so how do we do that? So that's kind of what we're trying to do is try to think about it's not just as part of the primary care doctor,

635
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:45,580
of course, it's let's deal with this with the challenges of the population.

636
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:58,770
And a new community health center and their own health information.

637
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:06,800
How are the work? How you begin your work.

638
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:11,240
So here's our view of the fight as to how.

639
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:21,610
We're not for profit health system. Our view is this is part of our mission.

640
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:26,700
We hope that all accounts for this work and others from involved.

641
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:32,530
We had historically run at 2 to 3%. Without a profit.

642
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:36,020
Do you guys know every dollar invested that people in your program.

643
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:41,090
So could we go if we weren't doing all this stuff?

644
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:44,280
Could we make. A 4 to 5% margin.

645
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:49,060
And go reinvest in your people programs and nicer buildings.

646
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:59,050
Yeah. But in our state, when we look at the problems, that's what's really what's really needed, what's the right thing to do.

647
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:05,180
And then we got to get out of this.

648
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,260
And so the initial announcement said, you know,

649
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:12,910
it's a great question and it is a challenge for us to figure out how to talk about this stuff and a challenge the people.

650
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,410
So an initial press release for 4530 was awesome.

651
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:22,320
This has been $100 million over the next five years to do in health center elements of buildings

652
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:26,560
and other programs and the Research Institute and those other components that I talked about.

653
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:34,100
Uh. You think so? Now it's not a blank check.

654
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:37,920
And that's my point around. Frustration around. People.

655
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:47,360
These digital tools keep a diabetes hypertension out of the as far as the hospitals and other managed care providers.

656
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:52,400
That's just. That's just that's foolish.

657
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:56,120
So it's now everybody's going to have to step up and do this work.

658
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:03,290
It's kind of these groups will make an even bigger issue with $100 million in the first five years.

659
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:12,100
The economics of this are real. They're challenging and they're not.

660
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:19,750
It's not an easily solved equation. So that's what we got.

661
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:25,630
Yeah. Obviously, our focus around this is cultural based.

662
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:31,690
The nature of the terms of brain imaging, our physicians and our staff.

663
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:38,590
Have truly been galvanized by this story and do everything we can to make it even more of a.

664
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:45,330
It's something that I think is great for the culture and globalization. We can't do it alone educationally.

665
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:49,080
We can't do the role of health equity perspective. And we can't do it.

666
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:58,350
There's too much to this day, and it's far too complicated for us to try and stay on the ground.

667
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:02,310
But we think we can do a lot to make a lot of progress.

668
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:07,560
So. I hope that this is what we were shooting for today.

669
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:19,220
I think this is hopefully a real world. Example of how we're trying to take on the challenges that exist within our state.

670
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:24,310
Population and again. What about the state of Louisiana and.

671
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:31,470
95%. We started off by blasting the city of Detroit. And if you visit.

672
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:39,570
Places across the border from or about to do as well as what to do.

673
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:44,040
So we're excited to see how this plays out over the course of time.

674
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:49,290
I think comes in around some is going to take a really long time to figure out.

675
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:58,190
It starts on the. So we're going. Any other question?

676
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:06,940
Photograph. Like you're hoping that this new model for.

677
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:19,090
Is there any health system you're seeing? Great question in bits and pieces.

678
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:28,210
And so what I mean by this is that some of the question that was asked so in so many words were What?

679
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:34,240
I have concerns. Please take your questions to the floor.

680
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:40,090
So if you look at the Kaiser who lives in a world where they take the risk.

681
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:46,980
It was obviously social and social issues dried up.

682
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:56,390
That's an organization I wouldn't say would necessarily. Got to stay focused on what we do.

683
01:18:58,050 --> 01:19:01,300
But that mental model and the concept was.

684
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:14,399
