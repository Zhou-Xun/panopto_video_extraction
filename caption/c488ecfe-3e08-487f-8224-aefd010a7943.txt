1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,340
I was just like this is like conceptual model draft no such.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,930
I want to get to on a plane for you real quick.

3
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:33,260
I don't know if you guys are with us on Saturday before my second shift right next to ours, because this man wanted me to do it.

4
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:43,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did one, you know, and I really didn't like when I didn't want to do it again.

5
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,640
So first you have to be also I mean, that's all for me.

6
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,410
Obviously. Before that they couldn't say, yeah, yeah,

7
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:04,940
I only because he was more like a house party radio host and then people complain, but I think he can go full time.

8
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:12,180
He's like, he made like really weird call me to all the guys I was not by anyone because

9
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:19,260
I that I was dating oh you know casually like oh look it's like really new.

10
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:24,490
Like, for example, there's one guy at the stadium to make sure it doesn't occur.

11
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,060
And you know which one of us.

12
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,199
You did not just say that. There's no way.

13
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,820
You just. Yeah, I mean, like, I was just like, yeah, I don't know.

14
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:47,160
He was just very much like he's like I was on his parents.

15
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,290
How funny he was making these comments on other day about like all that he is.

16
00:01:53,770 --> 00:02:02,370
I'm trying to get your one bedroom as a lot of times like that, you know.

17
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:08,530
And then I tell you one, it's very interesting to me is like if you want to like, yeah,

18
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:27,110
I think cause there's like, oh, for that to dinner special for you, I need to go to my bathroom.

19
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:41,840
Like I was like, Oh, that's where I'm so like he just like, I mean, you like, but like, I just know something.

20
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,650
That's basically. What do you see?

21
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:59,090
Like, I was like, drinking coffee, and then he went after I mind and I'm like, I know I only spend less than 300 us.

22
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:10,620
So this money coming from like when I was on my power but in that sense at because five times but

23
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,560
don't you think that's I like wrapped it up and that I want to be a prep sonographer okay right.

24
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,879
If your ultrasound and I walked out in January. Yeah, I took a box of water.

25
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,080
I was like I was like it was like up to a little behind.

26
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:34,800
It was like, if you can see them for a second, I was like, I love I think he's nuts.

27
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,120
I lost a bottle inside.

28
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:50,820
So I find out who now I could leave the time and God that even you me for this you are you he just graduated you more all crazy.

29
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:56,129
I'm like I was like, oh, that's the other thing.

30
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:01,800
I must like, you know that I mean, I was like, oh, I just I think you do too.

31
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,070
I like, you see, because it's like, how much do it.

32
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:13,559
So my and that's the only thing I would like that you if I was the case earlier this

33
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:24,000
week like I was encouraging the weeds he just took from me now like I in the means.

34
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,780
No, no, no. I do not care if like grown up.

35
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,280
Not because I was just fundamentally different.

36
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:45,000
I think that it's not going to work out. I think that, you know, I so I also do see more investment than I am right now.

37
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:53,240
I'm sorry, but I hope people will see like action that I should be like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

38
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,690
I think I don't think I was very impressed by her when my.

39
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,150
Oh, yes.

40
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,560
You're not 70. Oh, great.

41
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,510
Right. He doesn't want to talk about how she had met her partner 40 years ago.

42
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:21,660
Oh, yeah. That doesn't say anything at all that they are ever going to get married.

43
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:35,330
Nobody else like your partner who can afford to do something like that.

44
00:05:35,480 --> 00:06:01,620
He said that. So I started, which, by the way, I think it might be hard to find people who think that, you know, you can't buy this right now.

45
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:11,130
It's it's something that is somewhat like 30 minutes, I think, for something that's about to happen.

46
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:26,160
You might want to start somewhere, even if you could find the actual date on what I was saying earlier and then go from there.

47
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,030
That makes sense. Yeah, that's true.

48
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:36,030
Yeah. I'm sorry, General. Thank you for it.

49
00:06:37,230 --> 00:07:06,720
I have to go. I mean, you were just talking, like, just figuring that, like you say that, you know, you're probably wondering of itself.

50
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:14,880
Well, if I could. If I could get to it. Oh, you want to all take a minute and just a quick Google search.

51
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,940
Just real quick. Yeah, I can give like I just help.

52
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,340
I have a lower body.

53
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:33,300
This might be like you might not like something like this.

54
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,010
Yeah. Yeah. Are you kidding me?

55
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,210
I'm just sorry. Yeah, that's.

56
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:50,160
That's. Yeah, right. Because then maybe I feel the lowest price for doing the meeting.

57
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:56,820
Okay, so our management are two very different times, and I can tell you for sure.

58
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,160
So I think we should.

59
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:09,910
We should try to pinpoint a particular problem, like like it's a high risk of a particular cancer or like a particular screening.

60
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:17,610
Also Moral zero or all of that too, because we're all the three of us are cancer cells.

61
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Yeah. So to my mind, I think like share from that and I feel like we have to think about what the odds are like,

62
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,720
like my liver contract in like body dysmorphia, like pancreatic cancer.

63
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,370
Made a point like but then also my, my partner.

64
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:41,900
I'm sure there are certain things that's a little bit tricky with that, but I feel it's disorders do have their own category.

65
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,520
I just feel like I actually share my screen.

66
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:54,509
So like there's like our, our contract and like the city itself,

67
00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:06,380
it's like by a very low risk of like just taking that and that would be a good one to make a case for you.

68
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:13,660
I don't have a problem with it ever. I like does say yeah, yeah.

69
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,730
It's pretty easy to call. Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

70
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:27,440
Yes. I'm using there's like multimodal maladies, like identifying our common problems and the ideas already are there.

71
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,130
I like the idea. If you have, like, a family, it's for pancreatic cancer, an increased risk.

72
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,760
But also if you have a history of like alcohol use, pancreatitis,

73
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:54,330
the links there certain like cystic fibrosis variants that can put you in an increased risk with sites that are also responsible for smoking,

74
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,620
drinking regularly. I'm sure there's like, you know, lots of.

75
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,710
That's one idea. Okay, this might be a little bit better, but we're talking there about.

76
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah. To get through is really interesting.

77
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,670
Time develops in adolescents and teens, and it's like, let's keep thinking.

78
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,680
Yeah, I think there's a lot already going on for like cancer screening, especially now that like,

79
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:29,470
you know, trying to find other interesting things like this is what's hard, you know, a lot of summer.

80
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:38,300
Then I would say, see if I was going to go with like actually the topic diagnosed and but there's a lot it's usually just

81
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:49,010
like the more specific you're interested in the process of getting diagnosed especially young children.

82
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,650
Yeah. Yeah. You know, nothing of substance there, 1967.

83
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:05,900
So I think I was just trying to speak and she gave me like fertility management just.

84
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:19,130
Is that like Â£2 of proteins? Yeah. I think personal groups like fertility preservation in your parents like issues like cancer,

85
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:29,570
which would be helpful to like think about like what it was about would be categorized as like it's

86
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:40,190
like what states have California like countries where it could be a specific like it's a little bar,

87
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,820
there's this map or like increasingly mammography there, you know,

88
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:53,870
like the one place I have a lot of crazy dropped research like California, just looking at someone like I think I could.

89
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:00,319
I heard that they were coming out with like something like, yeah, I got it.

90
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:12,730
Almost like yourself are the results. Well, prostate cancers of other interesting stripes have so much overlap with like the other groups,

91
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:17,330
like cervical cancer connections, like HPV vaccine.

92
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:26,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So let's look at like, what's Michigan's current cause that one aren't actually seems like falling out of favor.

93
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,910
Anyway, this one is probably worth mentioning because they talk about physical exercise and dietary thing.

94
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,100
We're also this kind of sports.

95
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:42,450
We're very much and this is a pretty much a brain survey essentially proposing a new type of intervention you have to do.

96
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:48,290
Yeah. Yeah. So we talk about yeah, that's the hardest part as well.

97
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:57,020
So it's like behavioral energy as something different.

98
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,340
I'm afraid for you to look at the medication.

99
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:09,950
And I do think, you know, I think that so and I know for sure I'm ready to be more about about I don't know.

100
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:18,140
I don't think it's something that's in our or in a greater, relatively healthy and just school.

101
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:27,350
And I'm sure you're stressed because because so especially the 15 to 34 years that crunchy so important an intervention to get more women.

102
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:35,030
Yeah because if we're we're targeting 15 to 34 hours immunization motorcycle.

103
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:40,010
Yeah. Oh most parents there.

104
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:52,760
Yeah this is a washtenaw has opted for like a low that would be the order that knows what you know.

105
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:59,299
So we should pick something I guess I'm just thinking of like we want to do what we're

106
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:04,810
leaning towards eating disorders and we want to provide our own brain more specific.

107
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:15,950
It's like we to also because I'm out of the person if there's like a barrier is like guidelines you so that's what I think

108
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:22,790
it's all going to come back to be relevant no matter what type of forms which is your to providers what we do there.

109
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:34,639
Yeah. But I think that's, that's a problem and it's is I would say that community systems are very specific exemptions are these personal statistics.

110
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:45,890
I feel like I'm thinking back to like the major difference between Bolivia and border is just the purging characteristic.

111
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:51,230
I mean, it is true the diagnostic characterization is almost identical.

112
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:59,590
So I think it's like you pointed out the outcomes for like increased uptake of insert in screening modalities.

113
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,760
Like, you know, to it, that one has more layers.

114
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,220
So I guess it would be really good to try. Yeah.

115
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:18,140
Yeah. I with the barriers. Yeah, I think we should there be like a thousand different.

116
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:22,300
That's the only way, you know, we start with that.

117
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:28,750
That's a good idea. Yeah. Because I think, I think you make a really good choice to do.

118
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:38,470
Certain things would probably try not to look like it's like I am in the it but

119
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,340
there's a lot more like people see a lot more attention is given to anorexia nervosa.

120
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,219
So I actually think your brain at least that can be a little bit outside that.

121
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,920
Let's see if that exists. I think it would be hard to go through a lot of drought.

122
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,940
Oh, so. Oh, do you want to.

123
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:09,970
We want to go now. Let's look up the most extreme items.

124
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:16,330
So we turn to this so we can.

125
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:32,770
Oh, yeah. I mean, I, I just think that we have it's not necessarily like my goal is to change the science and policy makers like program first.

126
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,120
Yeah. So now I got my little satellite.

127
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:43,890
I just wanted to specifically target is it school.

128
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah. That has where I know well which I honestly it's not that far higher than right now.

129
00:16:55,090 --> 00:17:05,130
Right. But would be applicable to kind of our public schools. So we're just going to do this area have no parts remains on location in Europe.

130
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:12,940
Oh oh it's like this overall. It's like I don't really need to figure out where to start.

131
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:23,889
Yeah. Yeah, I think we could. Just because I seem to be a little wary of trying to go overly specific before we can find anything.

132
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:34,240
Because, as you said, I think they just didn't have it didn't have enough that we can go on because.

133
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,300
Yeah. I lost track of that background.

134
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,200
Ah. Oh, no. Oh, oh, oh.

135
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:46,740
That was really nice. Looking out of the classroom. You don't really want to see.

136
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:54,010
Oh, let's just get. Hey, let's get some sensible model.

137
00:17:54,010 --> 00:18:01,390
But that I don't know. I have it though and it's straight forward because I thought it was the high street surgical

138
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:08,290
high and then intervention the next big thing and things like we understand the problem.

139
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:18,370
You might want to promote. Oh, I just got on the bus.

140
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:25,820
Oh, they are gonna let me do this. Okay, that is not under.

141
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:33,640
I'm going to raise Christmas prizes like this.

142
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,730
This is my control. This one, this paper is about breast cancer.

143
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:50,079
But this is interesting and I grab a good model of yourself towards it is because I

144
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:57,730
think we have to explain additional understanding or maybe it's all kind of like sports,

145
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:10,670
like not everybody goes to school in Michigan, doesn't have any data.

146
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:27,760
Yeah, it's weird in this culturally what it's like trying to look at it and keep over all the Asian neighbors and 20 transgender women are.

147
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:33,960
Oh, there it is. Association disorders, St Clair.

148
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:37,060
So has a good time.

149
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,970
It's so it's so like domestic.

150
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,770
No we have we, we want to do with extensive the graph.

151
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,020
Yeah. Because I mean just look at what it's like.

152
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:58,930
I think it's low enough to where there's no clinical guidelines saying that like there's a need for residents.

153
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,840
But I don't like what feels like there'd be more.

154
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:10,729
Is it natural? Yeah. But are they on migraines?

155
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:15,200
Cause they have various things that kind of just incitement.

156
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,690
Yeah. So it's like. Yeah, it's one of the virtual squares.

157
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:25,639
Why not? Because, like, like, maybe not large enough to do a deeper dove into the larger.

158
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,200
It's almost like, yeah, I always have a hard time.

159
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,670
It's like how there's going to be data on that and this is a good start.

160
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,770
Can we get a little bit more? So do we.

161
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:45,769
Do we want to make it a separate document? Because this one's a little bit crazy.

162
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,310
I'm asking you like our kids, but I think it'd be very interesting.

163
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:55,489
Yeah, that's more what I'm thinking. And I wanted to and probably expand that to like non-binary so much.

164
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:01,040
But I think anyone that's not like that could probably go anyone with a prostate.

165
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:08,780
Do you want to make that? I feel like I would like our health could be like get into that, but we could target it's a trans woman.

166
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,510
I think we felt like you have to, like, narrow it down.

167
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:21,800
Yeah. It's sort of like part of the access to contraception for I guess for various reasons.

168
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,610
So I guess we could change.

169
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:32,110
That's true. I, I feel like there wouldn't be with like caveat ing slash acknowledging that like, right.

170
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:42,990
It's like all these are not the only and this is like not only people who are have this potentially unaddressed prostate cancer you feel

171
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:56,050
like you them like I don't know interpersonally it might not make them more masculine or have so many problems with eating disorders.

172
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:01,160
But imagine if you could sort of pull up our sites, narrowing our population.

173
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:06,640
How much of you? Oh, yeah.

174
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:11,500
So, like. Oh, yes and no. Yeah.

175
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,260
Yeah. So that these are like, relevant to understanding the problem.

176
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,860
Like, we gonna to try it out.

177
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:24,170
I try to answer those three reasons and prevention strategies.

178
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:28,550
Not quite yet. So we're like, yes, I wonder.

179
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,830
It's real you. Yeah, that's what I have.

180
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:45,370
I always or I have it for a philosophical difference, but it's still like it's just not the perceived risk.

181
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,330
But I really think.

182
00:22:54,370 --> 00:23:07,610
But really we are like, yeah, we have no idea of the spelling stuff cause it's like about on the page.

183
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:12,290
Yeah. You know, it's pretty cute.

184
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:17,480
So I think we wouldn't do that anyway. I think. Well, this is a very basic level.

185
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:23,330
Yeah. Family history of prostate cancer.

186
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:35,389
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Now I'm saying, like, with all these conceptual multiplexing of like, we're going to be crawling out of another person.

187
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:39,270
I assume a lot of these just fine area.

188
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:45,350
Like it's like, what is she going to be trying to stick to?

189
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,270
Yeah, I don't think it's perfect.

190
00:23:50,450 --> 00:24:02,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll go all the information or maybe find someone else trying to make the format standard or something.

191
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:11,660
Cassie which is, which is better or that to say or.

192
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,740
Yeah. So I don't know. I indications usually for her.

193
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,030
Yeah. Oh that sounds obvious.

194
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:33,330
You really like the doctor didn't go on the route and that was negative.

195
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:38,620
I was actually thinking about this.

196
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,959
I was like, Oh, I didn't say negative.

197
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:48,440
So when out of that either, they're fine.

198
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:55,760
Honestly, I don't know. I oh, my.

199
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,950
She's not surprised.

200
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:14,010
I will say this. I don't know if that's what you think is likely to start.

201
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:22,920
I guess it would make this control a format I want to track right across the spectrum of consumers.

202
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:28,170
Media usage is going to get you in. Well, and also like for the first year consumers.

203
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:33,570
Well, it does look weird on the first day it goes over really cool.

204
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:45,630
Does it go on video format? Looks like I just I don't know.

205
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:56,040
So you could break it up like that. Okay. I think she's I think that's the idea that I know all the votes are messed up.

206
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,530
So, yes, that's a separate, very helpful background.

207
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,950
And I think sometimes she also cited sources.

208
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:19,649
You know, certain people were like, yeah, I mean, in our audience, you know,

209
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:39,270
you can think of how those might be good to look at just so everybody knows will recover from what I was saying here.

210
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:53,810
Yeah, it also has like Dearborn oh eight and in order to bring the meta analysis interesting, I want to take it over again.

211
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:07,620
As I said, what do you decide? Yeah, every class I'm literally just like, she's so interesting to listen to and it's like so passionate about it, too.

212
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,320
It's just like, it's very captivating, even though it's like,

213
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:19,220
obviously we're talking about not like the specific characteristics like age sex can come up.

214
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:25,440
You know, I'm all over the place, so I'm beachy, but I'm also in kinesiology and doing nutrition as well.

215
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:34,139
So I feel like I feel like there are also things because of her process as far

216
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,940
as I can't wait for your you know been in planning is like something about

217
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:52,820
what you know things that we know or decide like say or just intro to adapting machine might be like sat through the first two classes and I was like,

218
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,040
because if we're going to be sort of like, I kind of understand that.

219
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,590
And then I looked at the work and I was like, I just don't have the time to do this.

220
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:11,190
Like, let's say that I did not participate in like it started off as like differential equations, which is math that I've done twice.

221
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,230
But then it was like, I think I'm doing this for years, my best.

222
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:25,530
I don't have to, I don't I don't want to get like too hard people who have like higher risk for prostate cancer or just like everyone.

223
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,900
I'm also I just made a point of screening that should be offered to us.

224
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:37,920
This would be an exercise and I think the screening modality is always the same.

225
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,780
It just starts like it's consider.

226
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:49,120
It's one of the ones where it's like if they're starting like a patient for the next round,

227
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:57,720
although there is that kind of like the how how about if it works once you have a top end menstruation?

228
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,770
I think that would be a very, very slim. I know there's like a lot of a lot of moving parts with that,

229
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:11,220
but I are encouraged to discuss the risk factor to consider screening and are 2500 families.

230
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:16,410
I know that the 1% like prostate like the word in itself is left.

231
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,530
Yeah gender first we just didn't use with the question.

232
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:30,480
Yeah I think there are like and like shrinks to prosody so you're like it's like it's the start one, right?

233
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,919
Like there. So why is it like that.

234
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:53,870
Cause more and more drugs, women start like right now I'm working on this and then they kind of like we and stuff like that.

235
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:58,380
So I don't know. So I was wondering if even you have that would still have.

236
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:05,590
It would be great if we want to do things, so we want to target high risk.

237
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:18,020
I think it needs to almost be like it belongs to the level, like a high risk and a general population risk.

238
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:24,970
There's also there's a lot of sense that there's some evidence that being older at transition increases the risk.

239
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:36,660
Yeah, I feel like the intervention, I mean, that could be like age could be a reason to go even farther.

240
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:41,650
Yeah, that's certainly true. That's so interesting.

241
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:58,450
And you have to head out, so you have to wonder if I actually should be really with this.

242
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:11,170
Will not like having such a problem. Yeah, I think I'm wondering if this is more common on purpose because that's one thing.

243
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:17,190
That's a problem. I want to keep my students and their families.

244
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:25,030
Yeah, that's true. Well, I mean, I'm not.

245
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:29,679
So that is that so yeah. That is actually really safe.

246
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:40,570
So you think it's just like less because like when I, when I want to talk about like we're not really that's an operation.

247
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:54,360
I don't know like I guess I think are either the American Council it seems increasingly military guys.

248
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:59,390
I don't know. They're not specific. Oh, are you think they're like an outcome?

249
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:14,850
And that's because when I have more, by my count, more like people are like, yeah, I certainly want to do the actual.

250
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,040
Sorry, what are you doing? Was that so? Yeah.

251
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,830
I just think you can ignore everything I just said.

252
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,870
It's just like I think.

253
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:38,980
I think if I say, you know, this is like one page reading things like country edition, hey, you can add, oh, let's, you know, let's expand it here.

254
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,340
But this is, you know, too specific when I search.

255
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,780
So is it how great there are?

256
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,540
I don't know.

257
00:32:46,540 --> 00:33:02,280
Because when I searched for something to it wasn't there bit like if someone gets, you know, like separately South Sudan, we could go up north.

258
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:10,400
We were so excited. I mean if you want like to do is like put me through something.

259
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:15,790
When we get to the end, we just go there. It's already done it. Oh, yeah.

260
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:19,600
Sexual and gender, minority issues across its guidelines.

261
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:26,410
You're reading them. Exactly. But it's it's removal of.

262
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:34,750
There are some of the other things as long as we have it there somewhere.

263
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:39,910
I agree that it's kind of different for each other.

264
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:46,160
So I'm so used to that, which is great, but I'm glad I got it.

265
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:52,450
But it's dual screen. Yeah, for sure. It's in its own surrounding area.

266
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,880
Like, oh, the rest of Michigan. I don't know what's up. Yeah.

267
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:06,290
So I still like stress out here is right here is where we go like, you know,

268
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:16,150
we're like up north we're into the what Otsego has and not a single school of that has been higher than 95.

269
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:25,060
No, not yet. So I think it could be that, oh, she goes 94% and you have to correct like the consequences of 14.

270
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,710
Oh oh yeah.

271
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:38,330
You start growing out in the woods analogous one not like logical cancers and breast cancer, but like not really any only 9.6 or four times for us.

272
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:46,930
I totally get whatever kind of interested in the second part of and then 37 points down here which is

273
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:57,880
the very much like social networks and also but totally happy to help with that but then also else.

274
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,820
You'd be comfortable with either the target population and our common interests.

275
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,970
We will find evidence to support for this.

276
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,940
No, I don't think she is. Oh, yes.

277
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,919
All right. Cool. And then do we want to have Cassie work on the outcome?

278
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:25,240
And obviously we can all work out all parts of it. But I feel like also like I was concerned about your interest is going to go.

279
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:31,629
Oh, I see. So you're kind of I guess the question is like conceptual as we're kind of envisioning it to be like this conceptual

280
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:37,690
framework example where there's like an arm for like the patients that are before providers in Ann Arbor.

281
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:42,730
What do you think about the like here, use this, etc.?

282
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:58,180
So it seems like that's addressing these or some concerns happening I think can be helpful to have what I was supposed to like.

283
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:02,470
What wow. What a lot of like really candid.

284
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:12,150
Thank you for that. We're like if you're we figured out on our own just like, you know what that was.

285
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:31,780
I just looked up. I think our Claire talked about the population, you know, the other writers and like, what kind of medical are we going to be like?

286
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:39,429
The recommendation is like it like make our oh, it's not maybe like a ten jump out of meetings, let's all get together or something.

287
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:46,420
What's there and then just see, hey, we still need to time because I honestly think like it says what four paragraphs?

288
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:54,399
Everybody writes a paragraph and then we just do it together. I really don't think that's is education.

289
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,520
The parents of children are not going to be stepping up another term to sit there and try for a topic.

290
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:15,990
I mean, I'm to see you're really like, let's see, we weren't going to be like the access to care.

291
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:25,550
Okay, really, we're going to have a couple of different things like in Software Update.

292
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:30,950
And I was thinking, I think that's so weird.

293
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:46,900
I guess so you must be somebody else. But I think this is like what they tweets, I would say, and I think it's a public with them quote,

294
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:52,510
I think I just I don't know if it's still for the name.

295
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:00,940
It's some of it's like stuff however I'll come back to this really could maybe we can make a timeline

296
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:10,440
and just the origin and like a psychological or something that doing so we are not ready for everybody.

297
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:16,270
Check in. How's it going? Are you having a problem? Free Wednesday for least 9 hours.

298
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:19,630
And a car. Okay. Thanks again and again.

299
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:23,710
So many points to be forced to go on the retreat for a party.

300
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:29,530
We will be bonding a lot Wednesday. We haven't done that last time.

301
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,520
We just kind of go, baby, like you might not like.

302
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,930
We're going to go back and read it together.

303
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:44,060
So understand that last week was all a drag. Yeah.

304
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,020
I'll meet you there if you want to clarify it.

305
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:56,950
You know, I agree, but I think the more you promise not only not 100% have properties that really define what this is about,

306
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:09,490
which I think if we flesh out this background entire population, no, it is, then maybe we'll circle back around to things.

307
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,490
Let's look at the statistics.

308
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:24,580
A 6.4% of parents with their spouses choose to be your secret, but I think they're highly educated to their health insurance.

309
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:29,230
That's interesting. So within the community, it's kind of know,

310
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:37,089
I think there's not much research institute for that in their families like their parents me out but I don't like also just a

311
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:47,790
piece of it takes no capital resources it just takes time dedicated to this way that can be you are people are brought your back.

312
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,890
It seems like there's going to be overlap between background and target population.

313
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:55,500
I think this first part of our address be.

314
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:02,430
You are one lawyer, correct?

315
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:14,260
I think more background on like more transgender people in general and like your position is important to one thing decisions about the dynamism,

316
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:21,050
factors and maybe other things that are really small.

317
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,430
So for example,

318
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:39,570
you can start forever living and then maybe what is like follow has less than 9% you but because a single sentence like 2.3% of outcomes.

319
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:46,880
So they're on 20 different skills and I don't think that will be a problem like all the time like that.

320
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,500
Like 11 students are like the biggest is 23 or six months.

321
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:58,920
So it's still possible, but that is something to keep in mind as it might not be that skewed.

322
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:14,390
Yeah. So we want to increase Head Start programs that are available talking to say, oh, let's do three different schools that are stressed.

323
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:25,450
We have death, loss and grief from six and I had friends about ten saying I want to make it also.

324
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:34,920
You have to continue. Yeah, a lot of reading, a lot of research on it and it talks about.

325
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:51,830
So when you meet Tuesday night or on Sunday, so 10000 minutes for you know, for you is like also me wondering where the short answer is.

326
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:59,540
A little bit of either bigger or are some everybody in it or not sitting somewhere or not.

327
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:06,200
So so we're gonna wait bring us back down on one thing.

328
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:12,990
If you have like a small time or I think there still find yourself to everything.

329
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:23,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's nice. Very nice. Towns like Cape Verde, like on Tuesday night I just described.

330
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,560
Okay, so Wednesday. Yeah. Well, you know, you have to work.

331
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:36,500
Let's see, what about Monday night? But yeah, because this is after 530 here.

332
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:47,000
So I guess Monday night is her best night, like 6 to 7 weeks if we want to make it.

333
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:57,800
Yeah, I haven't done that since I was.

334
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:01,850
I don't know. I don't think that. That sounds great, June.

335
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:13,820
Well, I think we can do like I think I think like 6 to 7 days ago so I can period.

336
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:21,200
I'll schedule it. We probably we can. Okay.

337
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,310
Okay. Yeah, let's go. Let's just think over generally.

338
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:32,239
Do you have any anything on the 20 before the one do you want to do.

339
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,220
It's like 24 which. Yeah, we could actually do that.

340
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:42,230
Yeah. Maybe think about this as you start out. Yeah. Spend that time doing that section.

341
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:52,410
Yeah. Okay. Are people also turning 20 a group as close as we talk about?

342
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:58,060
I answer, so I guess I'm gonna go first.

343
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:12,660
So I was. I also should add that might be one of those, but I'm not I'm not telling you what to do for the next one thing,

344
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:19,340
I think if I'm in July five, so I think it's the last shot at arms, but I still got four quarters.

345
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:25,310
You know, I was I was classmates of that same day will be spent.

346
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:35,240
Okay. Oh, yeah. And like hopefully we'll be able to distinguish get your things across right after this class on Wednesday.

347
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:50,870
I'm trying to think, oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. Just because that's where the children I think like that's where we find that.

348
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:56,010
Okay. And we've heard evidence from them.

349
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:02,769
Yeah. Yeah. So I. We have to consider like our kind of our brainstorming document.

350
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:13,870
And then I can put like a clean version or actually do our specification because if we need to narrow down,

351
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:25,630
I guess some other company, I don't want to be like, Oh yeah, yeah, I can see the slides.

352
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:33,010
I have some. It'll come up.

353
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,630
I don't know if we're going to find the same thing. That's mission statement to it.

354
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:41,730
Yeah, we did. Yes. Yes.

355
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:45,320
Yeah. Yeah. Oh.

356
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:55,570
Should we just throw the what we have with you guys?

357
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,830
I think I can, actually.

358
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:06,370
Why do you think? I do think one way you could look at it.

359
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:11,529
So we're so basically like going to our sections in areas.

360
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:17,109
I think that we want to make sure we want to make sure.

361
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:29,200
I'm guessing people are not issues with its vaccinations for children.

362
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:36,430
Okay. Okay. You want a magic explanation for children?

363
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:40,590
And this is going to be like stream of consciousness.

364
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:45,370
Oh, yeah. We're trying to say, like county government in person ever again.

365
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,040
Well, I'm going to give you a request.

366
00:46:49,390 --> 00:47:00,050
I don't know. I thought it. All our in are always like, I'm not going to live in this district or my county.

367
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:07,389
I don't think there's really much because we've been looking at districts that the first one on sickle cell,

368
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:16,810
there's one on like the cars and rides because you can like an emergency or medical or medical exemption we were going to share.

369
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:32,980
Oh, I just sort of you try to kind of think about who do say the consequences more likely to vote.

370
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:37,750
And we were able to highlight the data. That's what it was.

371
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:46,680
Yeah. And make it all public. So we don't want to be like it's already like a higher population and a lot of like that.

372
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:50,860
I was like, I'm gonna try the competition. And finally she mentioned this.

373
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:59,200
I'm like, Yeah, I feel like specific care packages, maybe like next week to like these people.

374
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:07,210
No, really? Yeah. I will say I'm like, what are relevant because like despite all the intervention.

375
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:17,350
So yeah, maybe like national and state, whereas there are people, okay, so like our team is different from what they say.

376
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:23,200
There's something and then there's something personal choice in there, maybe people like.

377
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:31,080
I mean, it could be like any chance that she's going to make it waiting for meeting people.

378
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:40,570
And so our group didn't say she's totally if you can overthink it, you could be totally up to you.

379
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:48,440
I can ask the second time, you know, this graph like the class counties and showing that and stuff like that that made the

380
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:52,170
part of your presentation like just by like this is why we've chosen all of these.

381
00:48:52,170 --> 00:49:00,100
It's like you justify why you chose these people and you want to go like not to.

382
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:03,640
Great I you have to go to like at her level.

383
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,500
But for all that data that you can say like these districts and stuff like that.

384
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,480
Yeah. But it's, it's hard to you.

385
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:18,130
You really. How much do you know.

386
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:25,090
Yeah. And it's like not a lot of data to back up.

387
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:28,989
What you're doing this for myself, it doesn't make sense.

388
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:33,330
Incredibly easy. I mean, they're not vaccinating their kids.

389
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,580
You just go with the other one on the air treatment plan.

390
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:43,180
But I was like, That's true. That's great. Yeah. Yeah.

391
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:50,350
So we would have to change it later, too, because it sounds like you have a lot more intuitive sense, but I don't think you would be.

392
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:58,470
I think the fact that it would be harder to justify I'm going to look writing like almost like looking at like, say somebody.

393
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:05,379
Unpredictable case. I think if we don't see that you want, we have to do that.

394
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,680
We have to do certain things like that will probably be the law.

395
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:16,690
It'll be hard to justify. We're going to target like all the schools in three counties in the country,

396
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:21,070
like I think our background information on the health problem, how granular.

397
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:26,229
So it's mainly focused on like because it's kind of like containable, like you're working.

398
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:35,110
I would say our section is going to be focused on cancer in general and the practice of like transgender health care in general or sexual focus,

399
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:39,340
that kind of thing. Okay. Does that make you work?

400
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:47,590
And does it work? And stuff doesn't work in either because it doesn't always look like just, you know,

401
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:54,040
because the philosophy's like maybe I didn't transform the animal in the whole course.

402
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,540
But if you want your patient to focus on the cancer,

403
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:07,790
that you would get all the prevention and management and the latest like trans or you can say like we're trying to see like why is it that,

404
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,040
you know,

405
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:23,230
it's it's up to you ultimately but I think you're you're definitely on hoping to make it data you'll be able to justify like yeah I really don't mind.

406
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:27,570
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Let me know if you need these.

407
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:32,480
And I think for you didn't have to do that.

408
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:49,390
But I like to get your education right now.

409
00:51:50,980 --> 00:52:03,060
Okay. But one of the things that we are arguing for, whether we are it is just the general SDI,

410
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:14,780
because a lot of the information on Google search, we would ask you if you wanted change was too much.

411
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:23,350
But it was good just to do this with so many challenges as of now.

412
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:30,210
We're just going to do it for us. But I understand it's very good that, you know what?

413
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:35,020
I think we need to expand if you want to do that.

414
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:41,450
She said that's I could see what like somebody would be like.

415
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:50,049
Yeah, I think that the other ones, they may be too like the size and like the numbers.

416
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:54,000
So it's like the lesser known or lesser part.

417
00:52:56,030 --> 00:53:03,730
I don't know. I just hear like like there's not a lot of data that people are surprised

418
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:09,440
because they have a vaccine that is like HIV is always going to be a long term.

419
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:13,700
Yeah. Yeah. So that's why we just decided to make it general.

420
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:18,340
Yeah. So I think it's fine.

421
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:25,730
Okay. I think if you did go like long, I would go to, like, HIV, but like,

422
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:33,290
not to like the outcomes of similar but like, like you said, there's other prevention like that.

423
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:37,790
But I think there's going to be a lot that you could find on each of the other things.

424
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:42,589
It may not be as good. Maybe some stuff is not going to be as robust literature.

425
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:53,090
So yeah. The separately like and I would say like but if you do start to find things that are

426
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:59,150
relating to like another like technology that do have a lot going on like different,

427
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:01,760
then you're like, Oh, we want to own it, that's fine.

428
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:09,650
But just as long as you feel like at least I think I think like you said, a lot of studies are saying like HIV.

429
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:16,370
So that's probably to keep it open in that like urban or beautiful, like.

430
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:33,620
Yeah, so it's not it's always those things are not specifically nice, but they are very, I don't know, like this little one down here.

431
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:37,780
That's right in the middle. Oh, that's cool.

432
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:49,700
It's like the rising New England stuff is like, you know, like you're preventing us from.

433
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:55,690
Yeah, I. And it was. Yeah. The sun and its surroundings.

434
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:59,900
Okay. So what I think I think about that because, like, surrounded by.

435
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:12,480
That's what I'm thinking of. Like how challenging it seems like they're not going to be like we're going to talk about the the implication.

436
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:26,750
So, so when we talk about it, it's like, oh, like I like.

437
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:31,580
Yeah. Cause you're really getting into because we to be walking in children.

438
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:35,059
Yeah. Yeah. And so that will be a different topic.

439
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:48,450
So that like that day through is like that would be a consequence of each other or say like I did

440
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:57,040
start getting that because like screenings that would be like a different kind of version of that.

441
00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:06,380
That would be if you did, we would get HPV back in like just about the second half complications of like,

442
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:12,260
you know, it's like because of that sense that that's one that I would be like, oh, like California was.

443
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:20,900
It was like. Yeah, it does. Because I was just thinking, like when she was mentioning about this stuff, like, I feel like that.

444
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:26,240
But I, I was thinking like, um, prevention, a separate direction where you can also say,

445
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:36,339
like, are you allowed to the idea that something that's creating something or is that too,

446
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:47,780
you know, all over the place you the thing is okay so like you this become a model but like we are working hard to do a project like this.

447
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:52,489
I know that during your first year you just for the class you may have lot models,

448
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:57,550
but like for a lot of time you're thinking about your own research group.

449
00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:02,090
We're we're done discussing. Oh, I was just wanting to apart.

450
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:11,570
So we're all sitting in a good place. But they had all these other questions that I didn't know if I should be, like, talking to this.

451
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:17,590
Okay, we're. We're done. I think we're going to outline questions.

452
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:22,580
Yeah. So, like, you'll have like for the for the class and, you know,

453
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:27,160
you'll have time and you may focus specifically on like this about them and all this stuff.

454
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:34,790
But like, say, if you were so cute with kindergartners and study five year olds really get into the nitty gritty.

455
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:40,069
You would probably have a big bottle of this. Like you're like what you're thinking about.

456
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:46,280
So these it's like this this list, this, this, you know, this, this map here.

457
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:54,470
But it seems or they're maybe that like more in fact, if you look at all of that like but.

458
00:57:56,270 --> 00:58:02,190
Orchestra like a smaller piece or is part of this class?

459
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:05,970
We would technically only have one outcome. Yeah. Yeah.

460
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:11,220
Yeah. I mean, you could you could have like the outcome I guess is the SCA.

461
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:14,960
So it's multiple conditions. But yeah, that would be like your.

462
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:22,740
Yeah, yeah, that's genotype frequencies, but not really because it doesn't make me feel a lot better.

463
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:28,530
Okay. Like the survivor could essentially like a, like a thing that you could go deeper.

464
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:32,129
You could like, it's your job, but you don't need to do that for the class.

465
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:37,410
But a lot of times like, like how an actual heart will eventually come out into.

466
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:46,330
Yeah. Yeah. Goal is interesting. Okay.

467
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:53,050
We can play those sorts.

468
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:06,780
And how do you how do you want to do bibliography?

469
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:18,990
Because let's say I have something in the first person's statement and then you would have to reorganize the later on.

470
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:29,870
They're really connected. Basically, it's like I'm using the same source that I really don't know.

471
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:34,560
So there's this one stat here, right? nowI freed up every time I.

472
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:39,720
And right now, I'm always like, I always go to one more or something.

473
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:44,810
But as soon as somebody put something that I wrote before it, connect just changes.

474
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:48,080
Like. Like I might as well. I try to use the shortcut.

475
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:56,100
All my stuff. Yeah. So maybe we just end on the number of sites, the number of individuals in the ingredient list minus the individual date,

476
00:59:56,100 --> 01:00:07,290
which is because we're eventually going to have to put it in a different order, which is that you just have to keep using less.

477
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:13,200
And that's more what I'm thinking is like that's due to somebody else and also because of you,

478
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:20,490
because maybe we should just come spell frameworks for how to have.

479
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:23,580
Yeah, I had bullet points and I was like, Oh, it'll be better if we do numbers.

480
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:30,899
And I was like, We didn't know that you were after like having a period of time.

481
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:36,800
We're like trying to make sure that yeah.

482
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:44,069
The US. Yeah, I was also.

483
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:57,000
But I kept thinking, okay, how am I supposed to know how to do all of this?

484
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:04,640
There's no way unless there are giant variances.

485
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:12,870
But like you to actually, like, even exploit those two sentences on each other's character wrestling.

486
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:17,330
Unless you just don't want me to explain what it is like. I mean, we would say.

487
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:28,169
I mean, it's just like. It's funny that. So do we want to like I think for data, we want to be, like, assigned to each other.

488
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:31,530
No issues range around that. Like CDC. Yeah.

489
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:37,500
And then we can also do something else. Just a difference.

490
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:43,320
Yeah. Yeah. So it looks like background operations to certain groups.

491
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:48,100
Yes, that's what I just said.

492
01:01:48,630 --> 01:02:00,690
Or you could just do like you might not know which is just which makes me think that just gives us like for one reason.

493
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:09,960
And it is that we can just do the standard and it's basically double life.

494
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:17,390
It's just like Smith at all. So yeah.

495
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:28,430
Think Syrian. Okay.

496
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:38,480
So you feel strongly do I feel like I have something to like?

497
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:51,260
Because I don't think there's any country.

498
01:02:56,090 --> 01:03:11,120
I know a lot of kids and they all go together and make sure they're okay.

499
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:14,900
So there's have a good data and the like. Why do you care?

500
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:24,620
You don't know the answer. Yeah. So I can't say, well, okay, I'm not good.

501
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:30,770
Okay, I do. I can go. I can do our town, I can do this tax.

502
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:40,760
I get the parents to do it or why can't I do my part or whatever?

503
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:46,070
I don't do the work. I would agree that.

504
01:03:47,470 --> 01:04:12,540
I mean I mean, I just I think I would like to think about it just in terms of like what's the chance that you can get to get involved in one way?

505
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,250
So do I start it?

506
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:26,730
And then I feel able to multiply, like multiply this side of me and discuss it with like I'm going to.

507
01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:41,120
No, no. Sorry. I meant this was originally I just because a lot of people so everyone is passing and do that because they could be identical by or.

508
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:54,930
Yeah. Or anyone else because I've done like this, you know, and I think I think it's.

509
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:56,460
Yeah. So, you know, I'm sorry.

510
01:04:57,010 --> 01:05:11,940
I think that as soon as I cut my screen and I put my counter thing when I like, maybe I just have to be really quick or that's the same thing.

511
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:22,950
I don't know the free advice and I just don't like being like, oh, my transitions account.

512
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:29,800
Yeah. Yeah. I wonder if.

513
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:36,190
Excuse me, sir.

514
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:42,050
I have a bookkeeping formula. Yeah, and I did that over it.

515
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:48,160
You see, if we need to do some more work on it, I think I'm not going to.

516
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:56,690
And that will give us something just a little extra there.

517
01:05:56,690 --> 01:06:04,700
But also like. Yeah. Yeah. Used to what is happening over and over.

518
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:08,000
They. Are they having to break in place?

519
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:17,480
Yeah. Yeah. You know what I'm mean? Um, source for every Monday is our 570 transportation, which we should keep in mind.

520
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:23,090
Take a bus is like, you got to get that window to open.

521
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:28,040
6 seconds. Do do.

522
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,510
Do we want to do it once? Right.

523
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:43,400
I think I mean, I think that having a it I feel like I have sometimes I think that this time I do I don't think I do want to do a zoom Tuesday night.

524
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:51,860
That's what we do every day at 6 p.m. because then we'll have time to focus on other things.

525
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:55,220
And then that's all the more like we actually get.

526
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,850
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're not distracted? I think I could be.

527
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,560
Yeah, cause I'm going to be done with that. Okay.

528
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:06,920
And sending them. Oh, lovely.

529
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:18,560
Thank you. So, what do you think of shopping?

530
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:27,620
You know, I think it takes me whether or not it was really hard, but now that I'm like.

531
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:36,850
I mean, I've got it down. Yeah. You know, it's good to finally.

532
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:45,710
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Oh, really?

533
01:07:46,060 --> 01:08:01,850
I know. And then if I can see something like the orange or if you like to draw everything out like you clear, focus off.

534
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:05,150
Like this [INAUDIBLE] poster. Yeah.

535
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:13,760
Oh, I kept systems hopping so you could see all of testings.

536
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:21,490
And that's the one that you want to critique. Not ideal of the one I got, but I do want to try to think ahead of time.

537
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:29,900
Have a lot of you can just cause to address like a few small like.

538
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:40,240
Yeah. So here, I'll show you my draft, but it's gonna look different by tonight.

539
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:44,240
So. Yeah, that originally had no figures in it.

540
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:47,930
I was like, I think you need to make everything into a figure. Everything should be a picture.

541
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:56,230
I'm like, not sure. That's like the other day for like 23 figures people should be able to.

542
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:02,000
Yeah, I dunno. My books are supposed to look like according to but I, I will say that I think she or.

543
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:05,730
Oh really. Really. I see. I see it too.

544
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:10,960
But I feel like I was told like so yeah. Like I think, I think other like.

545
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:19,699
No, yeah. But I wasn't there. So I met with her Thursday and she literally like, like she's gonna hate us like this year.

546
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:24,140
Like this year she worked through just like she just like change average.

547
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:32,600
That's part of what she's used to are there for you all for something that you wanted to be wanted to see.

548
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:39,889
So it's space to something. It I'll just take it on whatever when that's the first, your first suggestion and then you can make it when you go.

549
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:46,330
And then somebody also have to have like before that stroke or like, you know, anything but on our.

550
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:52,280
So I'm also worried about like, like margins on the site.

551
01:09:52,320 --> 01:10:02,090
So I'm sure you connected to it now. Oh yeah. I w I was like, I mean, I mean, like it was just, you know, but I already know what I printed.

552
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:08,860
So because I was literally, I know I told you my friend was like, oh, you just oh, that's the first one.

553
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:15,860
I'll just it's that you can't blame people, you know, for doing that one.

554
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:29,479
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I'm like, well, because I heard from Laura and then I was like, Oh, yeah, I heard that they got it.

555
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,650
But they don't really talk about it. I. I'm Intel's.

556
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:43,160
Worried about Lee celebrating. I feel like I was like no one was, like, secretive about everything I was telling me.

557
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:49,579
I just felt like something else to someone the other day.

558
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:56,030
And they told me I was like, I know we like to narrow it down, you know what I mean?

559
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:01,430
And then I listened and read something that driver and I spoke about it.

560
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:05,510
It's like the government spokesman. I don't read his blog.

561
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:16,640
I wish it was someone who is British prime minister.

562
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:25,150
You know, he's so kind of that's all I am so proud of this country for.

563
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:30,790
And I'm like, you know, that's asking for change. I was like, how much money should I apply for?

564
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,950
And I was like, Just apply for all of it. If your budget is over that apply for it.

565
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,639
And so I guess I just didn't know that other people got it.

566
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:41,780
And she thought she took all the funding and felt bad and wanted to give it back and let other people have a turn.

567
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:50,100
I'm like, Cora, oh, my God, you stop. It says, it's like this guy distributed to my heroes.

568
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:54,140
1500 can be sure. Like under.

569
01:11:54,290 --> 01:12:02,820
Oh, yeah. He was like, I checked because I think it's like right around 20 sounds.

570
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:08,050
Oh, I would talk about that. Yeah. I wonder if she has.

571
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:11,920
Oh she really has to pay for me personally. I do. Yeah, she does.

572
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:19,700
Yeah. I was like married to her. She was like, I just I didn't want to take it from some people's party because they're just so great.

573
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:26,150
If they chose, you're like, Yeah, yeah. Like it wasn't like, took the bias here.

574
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:29,870
Like we're an objective board. Like, please stop these guys.

575
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:34,370
So, you know, when we applied for it. Got it. I know that that's.

576
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:39,650
Truth is, you said you didn't. I don't know. I don't you know, right now I need money.

577
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:44,900
She doesn't need money.

578
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:48,660
And I don't think I have that.

579
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:55,460
So I really want to go.

580
01:12:55,670 --> 01:13:03,930
Yeah. And I said, Well, that's what I turned to Laura when she was like, You still kind of feel like that even though she need to.

581
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:07,219
I was like, I think we can help you, you know, your money.

582
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:10,370
So you're not going to take the. RATHKE More like the funding we get.

583
01:13:10,370 --> 01:13:16,370
It's really just looking opportunities for the rest. And she was like, Okay, I'm like, learn to stop being nice.

584
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:26,849
Yeah, I think we're just in here for fun, so I feel like we do.

585
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:31,160
You have all your funding? Good. Yeah. This is one of my project and good luck.

586
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:36,400
It must. It feels really good, but I don't think they are.

587
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:37,890
Your connections are more like this.

588
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:53,300
Like, I mean, like it looks like other worlds is a lot more natural, like, but it's not one of the kinds of things for that.

589
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:59,960
But those 500 or whatever, it's something like, Oh, it's not if I feel like I'm going to talk to you just enough.

590
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,310
I don't know some of them.

591
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:09,830
So I was just sort of like, that's why I'm not super.

592
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:20,520
I mean, I don't know. It's got to be like, Yeah, I have something to write, right?

593
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:28,760
So good. Yeah, I'm going to check out.

594
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:44,300
I know I got a lot of things. Yeah, I last for one thing that I could keep my clutch bag, but I realize we are split in half with a new section.

595
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:49,280
I did because I was watching her all at the same time.

596
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:53,360
I hear her all the time.

597
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:57,580
Yeah. You ever been? Yeah. Yeah, she was last year too.

598
01:14:57,710 --> 01:15:08,560
Yeah. Are you well in that last year when I went to the stairwell cause I did, I took an hour with a lot, huh?

599
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:15,230
I want to talk my $4. So, like, okay, renting at the retreat was thing.

600
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:21,540
I know I should have done that. Or, like, braid. And she was first for grandfathered so she doesn't know or.

601
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:30,410
Or. I want to volunteer to go first, you know.

602
01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:43,330
We're also going to clarify with Maliki instead of former prime minister, because last year we were all here in Michigan, but it was like a can of.

603
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:50,660
What was going to be happening this year to college.

604
01:15:54,170 --> 01:16:02,110
So I'm sitting there looking for I was checking it's going to be 64 on Friday,

605
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:15,740
67 on Saturday the high and we're going to be run by the solutions to get rid of right now relates to parents and parents.

606
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:24,620
Okay so what do you think, the deadline to print or posters like Wednesday?

607
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:29,150
Yeah, 24 hours. That's very good.

608
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:32,750
I think I'm going to try to submit my her printing tonight, but I can let everyone know,

609
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:38,430
see, you know, because we're going to be upset for campus for.

610
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:45,440
Oh, well, to put it to you off now or nothing.

611
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:50,330
So you can't call.

612
01:16:52,800 --> 01:17:04,930
It's like literally the most boring class ever. For example, there's a presentation every week when they're like, We have to surrender everything.

613
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:10,090
Oh, yeah. So it just look like you're assigned to, like, one of your group members presents on,

614
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:13,460
like, you're assigned portion of the paper every single you know.

615
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:23,229
So every week there's no one lecture day. And then what they wear, we take a quiz and, you know, that's like we're reading this right now.

616
01:17:23,230 --> 01:17:27,200
I'm really pleased. Okay, so.

617
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,790
But you're doing too much. Gene was activated last week.

618
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:39,430
Oh, you were way too much. Well, you know, that's just who I am, fully.

619
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:44,390
Okay. Love me or hate? You know I love you guys.

620
01:17:46,100 --> 01:18:01,550
Thank you. I think we really should be on the phone.

621
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:13,430
My gosh, I love. I feel like we should have the checkpoint today while it's still fresh in all of our brains.

622
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,880
But unless next week is going to be like, here's every 2 hours all the time.

623
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,810
I think it is going to be a slide related topics that we're struggling to.

624
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:28,790
I was going to base it off of the three apart, so I'm not sure where you are.

625
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:42,560
That's the reason why it seems like they are not gone further and I'm like, Oh, well, that's pretty because we have six months to live.

626
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:46,170
Afterward I was like, I want to go. I was like, What have you like?

627
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:49,820
She made the decision. I was like, Okay. Why would you explore that?

628
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:54,260
It's going to be a big decision.

629
01:18:55,550 --> 01:19:19,800
Oh five Sorry. But I mean, I keep telling you it's this discussion section, but that's have longer.

630
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:26,620
My mom had texted me right when I was taking the quiz, like, call me right now.

631
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:31,940
So if someone did die so bad, I think, oh, yeah.

632
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,600
It's like, okay, that's what I want to do.

633
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,410
That's why I'd say, Oh, okay, I'll take you later.

634
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:43,940
Okay. Thinking, Oh, I'm seeing if I'm okay.

635
01:19:44,230 --> 01:19:53,510
But you're right. I'm like.

636
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:08,200
I do it only 3 hours.

637
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:17,829
It's nice. You. It's incredibly ironic that in class about exercise.

638
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:20,890
I don't know, three, 30 hours.

639
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:26,240
Just really funny. Did you get a break last night?

640
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:31,890
I do too. I do, too. And kids, you like to go anyway?

641
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:42,060
I mean, it's like I had eight classes in art history class, 3 hours at church.

642
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:48,430
Everybody is like. Yeah, I feel like I'm trying to pay attention.

643
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:54,280
But it's just important to do our stories and studies at work.

644
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:58,090
Here goes. Nothing like this.

645
01:20:58,610 --> 01:21:03,100
So I know I'm just like, why do you hate me?

646
01:21:04,730 --> 01:21:07,990
Yes. Very difficult to do also at our discussions.

647
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:19,030
Oh, I'm jealous myself. Can you just come to realize, like, I was a wonderful actually, like, what's it going to make?

648
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:22,930
What difference is going to make? I guess just like you.

649
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:34,670
Yeah. There's no evidence like that. But that would be the last time I go to the U.S. all alone.

650
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:39,290
Yeah. Yeah. I would love this all alone. All right.

651
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:50,110
Well, I'll see you before I see you.

652
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:57,800
It's not something outside, but it's called inside.

653
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:03,410
Thank you. You got it to.

654
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,470
Have a good one here.
