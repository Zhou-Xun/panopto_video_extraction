1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:09,680
Sometimes, though, it's not really crazy, you know?

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:19,230
Sure. Like, you know, it's like I said, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,910
I was really. I mean, what do we have this X amount?

4
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,660
But at least we came up with.

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,640
I just think that's, what, four years ago?

6
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:49,110
Well, I think we're going to get started. And so it's sort of like looking back to the semester I've been to your first week.

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,190
So welcome to those classes. 600. So this is your professional development course.

8
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,790
You guys are entering your second year. This program goes by so fast.

9
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:15,060
So this course is really set up. I'm I'm going to be your facilitator to help you finish up some of your your requirements for the MPH,

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,300
but also just to provide you some tools to help you feel ready for your next steps,

11
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:28,110
maybe dietetic internship for the graduate school or jobs going out to the job.

12
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:44,060
Erica. All right. So I love Anderson. I know I've met many of you and have had you in 688 last year, but are you for other various reasons?

13
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:52,879
So I am a clinical associate faculty in the department and we do have a greater in the course.

14
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,900
She won't be in any instruction, but Cecelia will be helping out with grading.

15
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:04,370
So you will see her name pop up in canvas just like you are aware of that.

16
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:17,210
And I want to start off by doing the brainstorm because you guys are going to be going entering out into the workforce pretty soon,

17
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,280
and especially since COVID, lots of things have changed.

18
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:33,260
So we just really want to think about 21st century workforce, but event poster admit amidst COVID now things are just really different.

19
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:40,459
So just hearing this 21st century workforce just by raise of hand,

20
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,920
what are were a word or a phrase that comes to mind or a concept that comes to mind?

21
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,640
Yes. Working remotely. Working remotely, absolutely.

22
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:59,510
And that takes a whole bunch of different types of skills in terms of being effective as part of our work team can be kind of similar,

23
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:04,610
just adaptive, like being able to switch gears when we need to like on Zoom or something.

24
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:11,570
Absolutely being flexible, being adaptive to being in-person or going on Zoom for variety of reasons.

25
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,420
You one thing that people are more focused since COVID is.

26
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:24,010
There's no mental health or like there's this quiet quitting period is something

27
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:31,210
to limit the work they're working on constantly keeping them and saying,

28
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,930
Yeah, yeah, you'll see a lot of companies are actually starting mental health days or things like that,

29
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,170
just to sort of be aware of the awareness of mental health and healthcare.

30
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:50,079
And that is also yes, I do think people are starting to learn boundaries.

31
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,440
I, I think before COVID.

32
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:58,930
Going to work sick was acceptable and now we should be like, why are we doing that?

33
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,010
You know? Anything else?

34
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,850
Yeah. My job. Job hopping?

35
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,220
Yeah. It's more common, like people aren't staying in companies. Yeah, absolutely.

36
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,340
Yeah, it is more common now. It's in.

37
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:23,200
Yeah. Also in different industries, I would say it might be more common in terms of not staying at one place forever,

38
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:32,230
but you know, getting sort of grounded somewhere and then building skills and bringing them somewhere else for.

39
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:42,910
Yep. Yeah. Quite a lot of people are doing that at lunch money or they become more time building it just by doing their social media.

40
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:53,650
Oh, sure. Yes, absolutely. Social media is becoming a big part of pretty much any workplace, and that presence is really important as well.

41
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:04,210
So yeah, a lot more like contract positions, not full time person or you might only work for a company with a year or two.

42
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:10,510
Yeah, absolutely. And that's a contract. Not full, full time are not.

43
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Yeah. With limited, limited time. Sort of similar moving from one place to another.

44
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,970
Yeah. I don't know if this is like new, but I present, like, networking is important.

45
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:31,059
Absolutely. Yeah, networking is so important. We'll talk a little bit about that in just a few minutes as being part of this class.

46
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,900
But absolutely, networking is important and it's a skill.

47
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,089
It's something that's I'm not comfortable and not comfortably to everyone.

48
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:45,980
So definitely a skill that you need to practice and. All right.

49
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:53,270
These are all right. Thank you so much. I love sort of just the ping pong ping ideas coming at you.

50
00:05:54,050 --> 00:06:02,630
So this is something we'll come back to a lot. Just thinking about what it means present day, how to prepare for the next steps.

51
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,959
So today what we're going to do is we just have to go over, you know, what's going to go on in this course.

52
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,890
So we'll talk about each of the different components of this class.

53
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:19,190
I we'll do a little bit of a reflection just to think about where we where we're at now

54
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:25,670
and if we have some short term goals in this next semester or year before the next steps.

55
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,670
And then one of your major parts or components of this class is disseminating

56
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:36,860
your work from your internship or your apex through the abstract of the poster.

57
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,620
So that's all going to happen this month.

58
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:49,220
So we're going to get right into it, start have some time for you guys to start drafting your abstract and we have to take care of a logistical thing.

59
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,690
Printing your poster for the poster session is.

60
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,940
I wish it could be straightforward, but it is not.

61
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:04,760
So if you all have a device or a computer, we're actually just going to take 5 minutes and do the first step to getting your poster printed,

62
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:11,180
just so I can make sure we're all taking that first step because there are lots of other.

63
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,370
All right. So these are the learning goals of this course.

64
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:29,180
What we really want to do is just to be able to strive throughout the semester to figure out as a public health nutrition professional,

65
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,630
what can we offer to the world, to the workforce?

66
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,549
And so we'll engage in these different activities throughout the semester.

67
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,490
We'll do a lot of workshopping or in class work,

68
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:48,080
trying to identify our professional or personal strengths, but also areas that we can work on as well.

69
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,000
Well, think about lifelong learning, right?

70
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,719
Once you finish school and you go out into the workforce,

71
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,430
you're going to continually set goals for yourself to keep improving and keep getting to that next step.

72
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:15,350
Disseminate. Right. This is really surrounding the dissemination of with the abstract of the posterior internship knowledge, data skills.

73
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:24,080
But also we'll do some dissemination through an E portfolio and I'll talk about that in a little bit and networking role,

74
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:30,370
do a lot of networking even just in this class in professionally.

75
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:41,030
I like to do a lot of pre assigned partners or assigned a group work to mix you guys up a little bit so you can interact with people.

76
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:50,809
You may not know that well because that happens a lot in the work place and it's just something you have to do and then we'll do interprofessional.

77
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,100
So you guys are going to have an assignment,

78
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:03,980
an activity where you will be teamed with other health professions students and you will work through a module together.

79
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,550
I'll talk about that more in a little bit.

80
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,630
And that's also sort of the last bullet point here.

81
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,930
But throughout just being able to articulate,

82
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:25,100
think about and just deeply reflect on your strengths and what what you are going to carry out into the workforce.

83
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,080
It's just going to develop confidence,

84
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:38,300
which is really important when you're going and interviewing for the internship or a job or other whatever you guys are doing in your next step.

85
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm just developing developing that confidence and having an idea of how you can portray yourself.

86
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,130
Okay. And then these are the core competencies.

87
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:55,190
So these are skills that you should have once we are done with this course, I'm not going to read through them all,

88
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:04,790
but please review the syllabus just to get familiar with the elements of this course.

89
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,760
These are competencies I am going to talk through a little bit, because especially these public health core competencies,

90
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:20,480
we have to meet these competencies for your to complete your MPH.

91
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:26,510
And so the first one is really focused on our professional education.

92
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:37,070
So that is when you're learning from other health professional students, you're working together, you're learning about each other's roles and values.

93
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,590
That's going to be a section of our course.

94
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,090
And I'll talk more about how you're going to you're going to do that.

95
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:54,620
You're going to work through some modules. And then we actually have to do this is a little unique to this class, this first time I have to do this.

96
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:01,280
But we have to work on qualitative data methods in this course or analysis.

97
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:10,190
And we're really simply going to be doing this through a peer evaluation and using a learning technology called Letter Smith.

98
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:19,700
So we'll be able to complete this in class, but it's something that we have to we have to address before you graduate.

99
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:25,730
And then the last one, applied leadership or management skills we're going to do in class,

100
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,810
case scenario in groups, and you guys will present to each other.

101
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:35,090
And that's how we'll accomplish that. And it's actually tied back to the interprofessional education.

102
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:43,309
And then we do address nutritional sciences specific and competency,

103
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:49,160
but we'll sort of just integrate that through all the all the activities that we do in this class.

104
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,450
Any questions here? You guys don't have to think much about this.

105
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:02,000
I just want to articulate to you how you are completing some of these core public health competencies in this class.

106
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,110
Okay. So there's a lot to unpack in this class.

107
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:18,250
I know it's just a to credit class. So I like to I like to provide a lot of in-class work time so you're not doing as much out of class.

108
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:24,160
But also, I like to just go week by week and split it up.

109
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,650
It's just sort of these three course components.

110
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:35,860
And so the first one is that dissemination of your internship or apex products, and that's through the abstract and poster.

111
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:42,759
And that's going to happen all this month. We're just going to totally focus on that this month, on September 30th.

112
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:48,670
Is the poster fair? So it's going to we're going to get through a lot in this first couple of few weeks.

113
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,700
Right. Interprofessional education is the other component.

114
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,450
I'll talk about that in just a little bit.

115
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:04,209
And then the last portion of this class is dedicated to thinking about your brand in the field of public health,

116
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:12,430
nutrition, and creating an E portfolio where you can display and exhibit your brand to other people.

117
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:20,560
Okay. So I'm just going to talk briefly through each of them to get a better sense of what you guys will be doing.

118
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:30,790
So the abstract and poster, these are two different writing products that are that have different purposes.

119
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:41,350
So I just want you to think of the abstract and the poster as doing some writing in public health for a certain audience today.

120
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:50,980
Actually, we're going to talk about brevity in writing and communication in general and the workforce and how that relates to an abstract,

121
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,190
but also just general professional development.

122
00:13:55,030 --> 00:14:00,790
And then next week, we'll talk about giving and receiving feedback and just thinking about.

123
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:12,400
We often think about giving the feedback, but it's also important to think about how you behave and your sort of the way you receive feedback as well.

124
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:18,820
Right. And so the just note, the poster session is Friday, September 30th.

125
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:22,690
So the abstract and the poster will all be complete by then.

126
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:30,830
Just another note. The poster session is during this class time on that Friday, September 30th, I.

127
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:39,080
Okay. Okay. So interprofessional education.

128
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:48,049
This might be the first time that some of you are introduced to what interprofessional education is.

129
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,390
For some of you it might not be,

130
00:14:51,500 --> 00:15:05,780
but this is going to be a chance for you guys as public health nutritionists to think about how you will contribute to an interprofessional team.

131
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,780
You're going to go out in the real world and be working with other health professionals.

132
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:19,670
And we really want to understand and figure out what your role and what your value is to an interprofessional team,

133
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,590
but also the role and value of those that you're going to be working with as well.

134
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:32,460
All right. So to address this, you guys are going to engage in two modules.

135
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,870
The first one is just an introduction.

136
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:43,440
It takes about an hour to get through. Maybe even less if you watch videos on faster speeds.

137
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:52,530
But it's just an introduction to what I interprofessional education and collaboration is and what that looks like at the University of Michigan.

138
00:15:52,950 --> 00:16:00,750
And then you have to engage in a discussion post basically post something and reply to someone else's post.

139
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,649
So that's just a quick introduction. I'm after you guys complete that.

140
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,190
We'll actually have a class session where we engage in a workshop,

141
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:18,570
and this is where you guys engage in a group together here and do a case scenario and present it to the class.

142
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:25,260
And this will also meet that one competency. It's like leadership and management and public health competency as well.

143
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,100
And then the last thing you'll do for this is called Teams and Teamwork Module.

144
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:44,820
So this is where you will be assigned pre assigned to a team of about four or five students from other health professions.

145
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:52,260
So nursing in medicine, social work, dentistry, physical therapy I think is also involved in this module.

146
00:16:53,070 --> 00:17:05,460
And so you guys will work together to complete a case scenario, and then you'll also work together to address some reflective questions.

147
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:15,840
Again, thinking about your own role, your teammates roles, their values, their ethics, and just in general, effective teamwork.

148
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:24,030
And so, yeah, the teammates within this cohort or some other group.

149
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,670
So not so you you might be on a team with one other public health student,

150
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:35,130
but you will the team will be made up of students from different health professions.

151
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:40,380
I think within this classroom of the people outside of the classroom.

152
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:44,360
I just want to know because I don't see the nurses and such people here, so.

153
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:53,519
Oh, absolutely. And so as team and team arts module in totality takes about three and a half hours to complete.

154
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,640
But it's not you don't do it all at once. Right. So just be aware of that sort of in chunks.

155
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,520
And you're going to my husband is calling me.

156
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:08,240
You heard you are going to is meant to emulate real life, right?

157
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:15,150
You're going to some of you will get on a team and it will work out perfectly and it will work follows together.

158
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:24,990
But many of you will be on a team where you're going to have to deal with difficult difficulties in communication, you know,

159
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:33,930
by one team member or a couple of team members, scheduling conflicts, different opinions, varying personalities, things like that.

160
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:41,069
So it's really meant to emulate real life. It's doesn't always go so smoothly, but just be aware.

161
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:46,470
That's part of the whole process of learning how to be an effective team member.

162
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:53,520
Okay. Let's see. All right.

163
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:58,530
And then the last this is my favorite part of the class, about the last month or month and a half.

164
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,950
We're going to think about self branding.

165
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,460
So branding yourself as a nutritional professional.

166
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:10,500
What do you want to be known for out in the field at this point in your career?

167
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:20,130
And we're going to do that through workshopping in class, just really bringing to light.

168
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,540
What are your strengths? Being able to articulate that to peers.

169
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,840
And through writing, we're going to draft something called the professional philosophy.

170
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:39,410
So this is just a short statement where you really describe your values, your motivation for working in this field.

171
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,820
You know what public health means to you.

172
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:51,590
And I just want to note that we're going to address this in a learning technology platform called Better SNAP.

173
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:58,049
So only for this assignment. So you won't be using a word doc or a Google doc, you'll be using this letter.

174
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:06,000
Smell the. So this this platform is just like a word, doc, right?

175
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,440
You open it up. It's just like a word, doc.

176
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:16,079
But what it has is visually on the side of it, it has like components of the rubric that you can see, right?

177
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,559
So it's right there as your drafting. And what else you can do is you can actually once you draft something,

178
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:30,540
you can take a component of the rubric that reflects the portion that you wrote, that reflects that portion of the rubric.

179
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:40,200
So it's like a visual aid for you, but we're also going to use this to meet those qualitative data methods kind of competencies as well,

180
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,270
because you can use it as like a coding system and we'll do that through the peer evaluation.

181
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,430
Again, not something you have to think about it deeply right now.

182
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:57,900
Also, this is until the end of the semester. So we'll talk more about this stuff as we move further down the semester.

183
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:03,870
Right. And then the stuff is all going to be integrated into an E portfolio.

184
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,570
And that's sort of the final assignment for.

185
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,310
Okay. Other topics.

186
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:24,490
Someone from the office is going to come in and facilitate a couple of class sessions, one on professional emails and cover letters.

187
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:29,110
And that's in class. And one on negotiation.

188
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,790
It's also in class. But I believe the negotiation one might be Zoom.

189
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,040
I think it's like the last day of class. I have to double check that.

190
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:44,440
And then interviewing is typically done in class, but we could not find a time that worked out in terms of scheduling.

191
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:53,170
So there is a session outside of class that also offers highly recommended that you go it's not not required, just highly recommended.

192
00:21:53,740 --> 00:22:00,840
And that's on the syllabus in the schedule. Okay.

193
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:07,040
And sort of to round this out. These are just the major assignments that go with the three components of the class.

194
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:14,750
So the abstract and poster for the apex are internship dissemination the modules for interprofessional education.

195
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:22,250
And then one note I want to say about the module on if you have done either of these modules,

196
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:29,870
let me know as soon as possible and we can work through that because there's always one or two students who have done these modules already.

197
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:39,560
And then the professional portfolio or break self branding, the major assignments there, the professional philosophy and the.

198
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,720
Any questions? Clarification.

199
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,950
Yeah. Is that your portfolio website? Yeah, it'll be.

200
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:56,110
It'll be through Google sites or you can use weebly.

201
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:01,450
There's other options. Guidance is on canvas and we'll talk about it as well.

202
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:13,720
Any other question? Okay.

203
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:20,129
And then just a couple of logistic things in terms of technology in the class,

204
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:25,440
I welcome you guys to bring your computers instead of me printing off things.

205
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,500
It's just easier to put it on canvas and you guys can open up in class assignments and things like that.

206
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:38,340
Sometimes I'll bring paper copies if I want to collect it that day in class.

207
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:46,410
And then just in terms of respectful, right, you have your computer and it's open.

208
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:53,100
Just make sure if someone's talking up here, whether it's myself or a facilitator coming in that you are engaged.

209
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,320
I'm not checking email or doing other assignments or things like that.

210
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:02,220
Just in terms of distraction, right?

211
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:10,709
You're not only distracting yourself, but also others around you and the instructors and then participation.

212
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:18,150
I don't have anything graded for this, but it really is just showing up in class and being present.

213
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:25,799
And we all we all have value that we can add to this class.

214
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:32,940
So we just want to make sure if we are going to participate in a large group discussion to raise your hand and

215
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:39,660
wait to be called on and things like this just so we can make sure everyone has their voice in this class.

216
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:54,550
Okay. Just simple strategies for success and success in the course organization.

217
00:24:54,590 --> 00:25:03,560
I'm reviewing the syllabus, the schedule, of course, guidelines for all the assignments and things like that and.

218
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,390
Just remember, this is a professional development course, so just always keeping that in mind in the back of your head.

219
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:19,870
Okay. Any questions before we do a little reflection?

220
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:35,210
Okay. So what I'm going to do is hand out a little index card, and I want you guys to think about this as sort of a short term goal.

221
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:43,130
And what am I going to do? I do want you to put your name on this because I do want to collect it.

222
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:57,870
But just think about something you want to work on in the next semester or the next semester or even this year and putting an action to it.

223
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,200
So how have you worked on it?

224
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:11,960
So for example, last year, a lot of students, like the majority of students, about 80% of them talked about, I also need to keep my distance.

225
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:20,840
They talked about oral communication and just had a lot of different ways in which they could work on oral communication.

226
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:29,220
I'm going to put my mask on. Sorry. Like, I want to be respectful and do that.

227
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:41,300
So, yeah, just thinking of like a short term goal. And so I have a goal and an action.

228
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:51,240
And so if you give that to.

229
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,810
But you know, that's not how we want to vote.

230
00:28:27,000 --> 00:29:33,100
Think. He chooses.

231
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,960
Okay. It looks like her writing is slowing down.

232
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,870
So just make sure to put your name on it. We're not going to share anything.

233
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:09,020
But I do. I'm always just interested to see what you guys are striving for, and.

234
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:20,910
And I'll hand those back to you at some point in the semester. Actually, I probably am the best because you're supposed to keep it light.

235
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,219
Okay, so. Okay, what I want to do is was take care of a logistical thing.

236
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,940
So if everyone says if you have a device, a computer or a tablet,

237
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:47,740
what I want you to do is go into canvas and under the poster draft assignments there should be towards the end of it.

238
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:53,560
There's like a lot like step one and a step two of directions for poster printing.

239
00:30:54,190 --> 00:31:02,110
And so I honestly just want to give you guys 5 minutes to work through these steps and just complete this first step.

240
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,900
Okay. Oh, I see.

241
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:11,920
And if you guys have any questions or run into issues, just let me know,

242
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:19,629
because I did this only once myself and I wrote out these directions, so I might have missed something along the way.

243
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:29,380
So just let me. Just let me just jump in.

244
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:54,850
Oh. Just.

245
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:05,830
Is that required services? Yeah.

246
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:10,120
I would put your personal phone number and 481 or nine is.

247
00:32:49,210 --> 00:33:22,050
Yeah. I'm.

248
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:28,620
Yeah. It's such a good job to do the job and do it.

249
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:32,730
Why don't you guys put a 28?

250
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,589
Does it say 20, 28? Yeah, I thought in the guidelines.

251
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:47,670
Right. It's not. Thinking.

252
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:58,580
Yeah. Just a student. All right.

253
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,650
Title specifications. I don't know. I just dropped it.

254
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:09,140
Requirements duty. Yeah, it's a job title.

255
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:23,970
Job duties. Job title, say Western Fair Society in doing the contract with the union is the same as those.

256
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:42,280
I think she's.

257
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,410
It's interesting.

258
00:36:49,440 --> 00:37:04,790
You still have symptoms? Yes, but he's not.

259
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:29,850
And. With.

260
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:54,470
I need to use this prescription to save lives.

261
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:26,559
It was great. Yeah I just I recipe for getting to know like my draft and I was like, oh, I can't believe you were going to do this show to me.

262
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,060
Wasn't even worth my time. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

263
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:36,940
You know, I think I miss clicking the FedEx thing.

264
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:42,130
Should I cancel it? It just didn't even start.

265
00:38:42,180 --> 00:39:01,610
Sorry. About what? No, it's not. It's not your conversation that you have to do anything about, you know, for transportation.

266
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:20,030
You should continue. Okay.

267
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:46,120
I guess it works for the money. It's locked into the voting system.

268
00:39:52,270 --> 00:40:10,470
Okay, so I know it's close, but I mean, it'll happen.

269
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:21,880
But I think we still need more time.

270
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:27,700
Those are disagreements that, you know I have.

271
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:40,010
Yeah. Just didn't work for seven years in the Senate.

272
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:49,450
Okay. So I think the next thing is in, like, a couple of days, maybe even today, you'll get an email back with a quote.

273
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,370
So how much is it going to cost? And then they have like further directions, which I think is in step too.

274
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:02,760
But I don't think we necessarily have to worry about that until we're close to having the final pollster done.

275
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:11,650
So we'll come back to that. But just make sure when you get an email, it'll be from like Q2 services or what to order services.

276
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:15,640
Just make sure you keep that email handy. Okay.

277
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,930
I already got my email. You already got it. Yeah. Okay. All right.

278
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,830
I'm going to give you all right. Because you have to go in and see.

279
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:27,160
So there's a click here to view pro detail. Okay, perfect.

280
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:32,100
See, it happens. They say it'll take a while, but it happens us.

281
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:39,040
Okay. Thank you guys for doing that. I just want to make sure we just all have that done.

282
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:45,490
So there's not like people, you know, we have so many things going on and just for getting this stuff.

283
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:52,000
So I began to write When the recession comes. So what am I doing?

284
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:03,020
The last bit of class is first talk a little bit about an abstract and talking about it in terms of being this piece of public health writing.

285
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,120
And it's more of like a technical, scientific, technical piece of writing.

286
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:11,200
But the way we're writing this abstract, it's not so technical,

287
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:19,120
but we do have a rubric of things that are guidelines that we need to follow in terms of what has to be incorporated.

288
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:25,540
But the the products for this dissemination are the abstract and the poster.

289
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,200
But right now we're going to be focusing on the abstract.

290
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:40,020
And so the first thing I want to think about is whenever we're doing any sort of public health writing, we are writing for someone, right?

291
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:50,669
An audience intended audience. And so I want you guys to think about last year as first year MPH students and go into the poster session.

292
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:54,900
And I'm just thinking about the poster session and the abstract booklet.

293
00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:03,570
But now, you know, speaking of being a second year student and you're actually in it writing this abstract, right?

294
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:16,140
Who who are you writing this abstract for? The first two years, the first year MBA students.

295
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:21,540
Exactly right. They're coming to this business session to learn about the different internship

296
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:27,840
opportunities or apex opportunities that they could potentially be involved in.

297
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:39,579
Plus, there are other people. If you're going to get students, come to them later.

298
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:42,790
I can ask you about leadership ideas. They would have a better understanding.

299
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:49,240
Absolutely. Faculty and staff, they look at the abstract booklet as well.

300
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:53,200
Also, the posters are judged.

301
00:43:53,350 --> 00:44:02,890
Right. So faculty and staff and some Ph.D. students will be reading the abstracts and then going to the poster, and they're going to be judging you.

302
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:10,149
And there are there are prizes, monetary prizes for first, second and student choice.

303
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:14,290
So just be aware of that as well as you are writing.

304
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:21,040
But yeah, also we do look at the abstracts to learn more about the different internship opportunities.

305
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:25,660
If a student comes to us and asks about a specific internship.

306
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:32,160
Yeah. What if your internship isn't interested in having other.

307
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:43,030
Yeah, that's a great question. Still, it's for it's for the first year students and the faculty and staff.

308
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:50,590
We need to know what you did during the internship just to make sure it aligns with what was expected,

309
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:58,150
but also for the students just to see, you know, what things you can do out in the field.

310
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:11,750
Anything else? Any anybody else? Yeah, I'm really interested because I had two internships trying to pick one or both.

311
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,480
No, that's a great question. And this comes up every year.

312
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:26,240
If you had two internships or more, I suggest that you just pick one and focus on one for your abstract and your great question.

313
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,640
Yeah. Has anyone ever presented on both internships?

314
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:38,700
Do you have examples of people I don't see? Usually, yeah, but if they're integrated.

315
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:46,730
I you can do that. But I would say just focus on one or else you have to do two separate abstracts.

316
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:53,090
Okay. Those are some. Okay.

317
00:45:54,410 --> 00:46:00,979
So these were just some ideas in terms of who that writing this writing piece is intended for.

318
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:13,090
And we think we've covered all of these. So I don't want to push you guys to think about the activities that we engage in,

319
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:17,920
thinking about the skills that you're building during these activities.

320
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,120
So thinking about writing your abstract.

321
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:28,270
What kind of skills are you building as you are developing this piece of writing?

322
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:35,980
Yes. Brevity. Brevity. Yes.

323
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:43,690
And that's something we'll talk about in just a second. But absolutely, learning how to be concise yet impactful in this short amount of space.

324
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:48,519
You need to have that skill to be able to convey the information you need to convey.

325
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:53,320
But in a short amount of space. Yeah.

326
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:59,290
Writing that can show off where you've gone where they you could do that to future employers.

327
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:03,060
Absolutely. Yeah. This is a this is a product.

328
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,430
It's like a work product. We can think about that. But this is.

329
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:13,690
Yes, good practice to think about different other types of products that you might have to create in the future.

330
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:23,500
Or you can even you know, who knows, you might use this as an example product to show to future employers or other the future.

331
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:31,790
Another their skills if. Yeah.

332
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:40,810
Scientific communication is like if someone isn't familiar with your your field, just having to explain that to them in simple terms.

333
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:49,479
Yes, absolutely. A scientific communication and thinking about, you know, you're in it so you really understand it,

334
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:58,030
but how can you convey it to people what you did to people who might not fully comprehend what you're doing?

335
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:04,210
So that's a super important skill in terms of communication, writing and orally.

336
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:11,860
No. Yeah. I'm working on our editing skills.

337
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,830
Either editing our own abstracts or appearing abstracts.

338
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:28,540
Yeah, critical thinking, I think, goes along with editing evaluations or really having to hone in and think about what is being displayed here.

339
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:35,590
How can we improve it, providing that critical feedback to yourself, to others?

340
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:47,740
Notes. You understand the needs of the target audience?

341
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,950
What we like, what's more important to them to see?

342
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:56,410
Absolutely. Always keeping in mind in the back of your head who you're writing for.

343
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:59,470
So never lose that. Always think about who your audience is.

344
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:06,790
That's important for the scientific communication, but the audience piece in general is just really important.

345
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:12,610
Right. Those are all awesome ideas.

346
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:16,330
I don't have a list here of examples or anything. Let me think.

347
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:25,240
Things also like self reflection write. You're reflecting on what you did and strengths you have.

348
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:33,280
You can bring forth some things like that. Those were all excellent examples of skills that you're building.

349
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:43,660
So a whirlwind romance tract is eventually, in the long term, going to lure people to your poster problem to engage with you ask questions.

350
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,190
Some people, especially faculty, might like to give feedback and things like.

351
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:57,020
Okay. So I provided an article whether you guys run it or not.

352
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:03,710
We have a class on brevity in the workplace and I really just like to think about that.

353
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:13,070
I'm always a person who loves brief and concise things, whether it's writing or other aspects of work.

354
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:22,670
And so I just want to think about this question here, but why is in today's workforce, why is brevity really impactful?

355
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:31,100
And again, thinking of like COVID, the 21st century workforce coming out of COVID and how things have changed.

356
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,430
Give me one of its specific to COVID, but just people are, you know,

357
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:44,459
spending a lot of time on their screens, also just getting tons of emails all the time.

358
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,370
So if you know you're pitching an idea or sending an email to someone,

359
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:51,899
it has to be like to the point I feel like a lot of us we barely read the emails.

360
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:57,220
It was the subject tells us to. So it's like this is so important for other people other than students.

361
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,049
Those are a lot of great points that came out of that.

362
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:08,340
But just the screen time that we have right now, especially like Zoom calls, I struggle even in like an hour Zoom call meeting, right?

363
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:19,680
I like 15 minute meetings, 30 minute meetings now and that can be really helpful in terms of staying engaged in on task emails.

364
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:25,469
And we have a professional workshop dedicated to talking about emails,

365
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:34,650
but short and concise emails will capture the reader's attention versus long emails.

366
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:46,230
Right? You're going to skip those emails? I learned actually back when I was a student, I was inside and the it was actually for 688,

367
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:54,120
there was a guest speaker who was like who told me he flat out told me I didn't read your email

368
00:51:54,120 --> 00:52:00,690
because your subject line didn't make any sense or maybe I didn't even have a subject line.

369
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:02,879
And that stuck with me for so long.

370
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:12,510
So that informative subject line can help in terms of orienting that reader to the email and understanding what they're getting themselves into,

371
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:18,080
what else in terms of brevity. No.

372
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:27,380
He thinks there is too much information. Sometimes the main message I'm trying to give out gets lost and diluted.

373
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:36,180
So yeah, again, just thinking about if you long something right, that message might be lost.

374
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:43,050
So really getting to the point and understanding the significant message that's trying to be conveyed.

375
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:50,819
Yeah. Taking back off of that just to be on task is what the goal is and to make sure we're being

376
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:55,260
really mindful of everyone's time and how we're using everyone's time to reach that goal.

377
00:52:55,470 --> 00:53:04,920
Yeah, absolutely. On being goal oriented, understanding the purpose of a meeting or trying to think,

378
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,430
because I just had a meeting in my mind of a meeting or an email or whatever it may be.

379
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:14,850
Yes. Awesome.

380
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:18,630
Any anything. I don't want to cut you off to short.

381
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:28,500
And so then just kind of going off that and actually I think we might have we might have captured this.

382
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:36,270
But in terms of products like emails, right, discussions and meetings, I'm thinking of like Zoom meetings, right?

383
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:46,950
Where we get tired when we're we're looking at a screen for so long in terms of I'm thinking about brevity being brief yet informative and impactful.

384
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:51,270
And yeah, it's something that I have no problem with.

385
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,170
But like for like, sure, you have brevity and interviews.

386
00:53:55,860 --> 00:54:00,389
Oh, yes. Yes. Thank you for bringing that up. I wanted I definitely wanted to touch on that.

387
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:07,170
So, yes, because you guys are all have to be thinking about interviews in the next few months now.

388
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:16,530
And so just making sure that you have that space and time to practice and this is you know, this is why this class is helpful.

389
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:20,370
You can really think about what your strengths are and how you want to talk about them.

390
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:29,309
But when you go into an interview, again, being that goal oriented and being very mindful of what you have to portray in that short amount of time,

391
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:33,180
and that's also an important space if you go on and on and on, right?

392
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:37,270
That is that's where the message might get lost on.

393
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:43,870
And so that's really important. Anything else?

394
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:50,170
Yeah, I just thought of like in my leadership class, we talked about having an elevator pitch,

395
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:57,459
kind of talks or being brief, but getting your point across and yes, absolutely.

396
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:05,650
That elevator speech will actually sort of practice an elevator speech when we we have a practice session for our posters in class.

397
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:11,320
I call it a mock poster session. That's a time to do an elevator speech for your poster,

398
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:16,930
just because sometimes when people come to your poster, they'll just say, tell me what you did.

399
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:22,780
And so that's important to have that, you know, 2 to 3 minute summary of your poster.

400
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:30,210
But also I can see in like interviews like tell me about yourself, write those sort of questions.

401
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,160
Yeah. I feel like whether it's a good thing or not.

402
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:42,170
Like since we're all in public health and communication is such a big part of what we're going to be doing.

403
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:51,320
And like with the reality being that like if you don't deliver it in like a tick tock speed, like it's just nobody's going to do it at this point.

404
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:57,350
It's like just being able to like stay up to date on like what science communication looks like at this point.

405
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:03,950
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So I'm thinking about in the 21st century, right?

406
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:08,690
What does communication look like to different audiences and things like?

407
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,670
Like the framework of different social media platforms are quick and to the point.

408
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:17,530
But yeah, in terms of public health communication,

409
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:24,620
keeping up to date and understanding the different audiences and how they're going to intake that information, these different formats.

410
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:36,140
Professor. What I've learned is that the interviewer has made up their mind in the first 30 seconds.

411
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:45,230
Yeah. Yeah. And if you guys do go to that interviewing workshop, they'll talk a lot about these things in terms of,

412
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,120
you know, the first impressions of the interviewers and things like that.

413
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:57,960
But, yeah, that that is a common thing. Right. The interviewer gets a good feeling in a short period of time.

414
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:04,040
And so that's really important in terms of how you present yourself in that short period of time at the beginning.

415
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:08,600
Yeah, well, I may have missed it, but when is the interview workshop?

416
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,590
It's on the schedule. On the syllabus.

417
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:19,990
It's mid-October ish. Sometime, I believe it's a Wednesday, late afternoon or evening.

418
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:24,650
Thank you. Yeah. Anything else?

419
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:35,139
Thank you guys for sharing this with really a lot of different concepts to share.

420
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:40,660
So that was really nice. Okay, so the abstract, what I want to do now.

421
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:48,760
So it's 11:00. What I want to do now is just provide a link, check back in in like 25 minutes or so.

422
00:57:49,390 --> 00:58:00,490
And I want to give you some time to get on canvas, open up the abstract draft assignments and you'll find guidelines and a rubric.

423
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:06,520
I also a paper copy. If anyone just feels like a paper copy is better.

424
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:11,680
You can come up and grab it. And there's also.

425
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:19,270
So. So what I want you to do is take a few minutes, read through the guidelines, read through the rubric, the different parts of the rubric.

426
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:24,850
Okay. Just familiarize. Familiarize yourself with it.

427
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,770
There's also some student examples from previous years of abstracts.

428
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:37,480
And then also just another important thing to note about this assignment is that there is a template you have to use.

429
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:46,630
I think it's in that you have to use because once you submit it, I think it's so easy.

430
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,620
Now, here, Carol, I don't think it's Carol anymore.

431
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:56,770
Will be using that template and just inserting it into a PowerPoint.

432
00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:03,460
So it's really important in terms of time sake for whoever is making the abstract booklet.

433
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:13,360
And then next week you're going to have a full draft ready for class and we're going to do a period valuation next week.

434
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:22,880
Okay. So any questions before I just give you guys the next 25 minutes or so before I check back in?

435
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:32,900
Just those of us that have done more than one internship with what is the best way to choose the experience to write the abstract?

436
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:37,190
I think, to be quite honest, it's up to you.

437
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:46,790
Whatever one, you perhaps enjoyed more or feels more useful to disseminate to students,

438
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:49,490
especially the first year students, we really want to be thinking about them.

439
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:58,130
I would do that and has a really significant product that you could shop for it, like a work product.

440
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:08,570
I'm not sure I can give you any more guidance other than I think you just have to make the best for yourself.

441
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:16,390
Anything else? Okay.

442
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:20,260
And also just use this time to start drafting pieces of your abstract.

443
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:51,410
So he's like, Yeah, yeah, I think I know how to use the company use case.

444
01:00:52,410 --> 01:01:26,620
I think I was looking at other I right now and you know I just basically I'm sure it'll be used, you know.

445
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:35,370
And so I think that it also has a different choice, which I think you're you know.

446
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:41,990
Yeah, I use email.

447
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:53,270
I know. But you also know that, you know, I like the co-founder.

448
01:01:53,270 --> 01:02:23,380
I really do a huge that's why I reached out and and I think personally I feel so it's true.

449
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,550
You know, that's why I know. I just want to know this is the name of her.

450
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:41,410
And she decided she decided to do this for you.

451
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:45,050
That's how I think. I think it is.

452
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:51,410
Yes, I will definitely be here.

453
01:02:53,820 --> 01:03:01,860
Yeah. Yeah. So that it's like mental attitude.

454
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:13,190
I didn't even know. Okay.

455
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:18,680
That's all right.

456
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:46,990
It's kind of like, you know, I to say, you know what?

457
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:53,070
You just say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

458
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:01,460
Let me tell you.

459
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:06,930
Yeah. That's why I think she goes. She needs more.

460
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:19,950
So that's what she had documented, but nothing like what she was doing before.

461
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:26,810
I know. I don't know what else? What else? Is there anything else?

462
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:53,630
You know, I was thinking that that's a big issue for you, but you don't have to worry about making the farm, the chase and some that.

463
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:07,640
I mean, I don't know.

464
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:16,160
But I think we have to write that all the time.

465
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:28,070
I don't. I don't. Yeah. Okay. Think I think I just it's the same question.

466
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:34,070
But, you know, I guess I guess. What were you trying to say?

467
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:38,150
You know, I see definitely is a different time about today.

468
01:05:38,150 --> 01:06:03,620
And as long as there will be real strong resistance, I have to say, you know, you're right where you need to go to get a job.

469
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:09,490
Yeah, it's getting. Yeah, I just thought it was excellent.

470
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:20,810
And I know, like you said, you know, I'm trying to mean what I'm all about to.

471
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:25,190
Maybe I need to. They're really good. I just think that's really important.

472
01:06:32,500 --> 01:07:01,230
Yeah. And that's why I feel like I, you know, I have the right to be like, oh, I just.

473
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:06,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

474
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:37,140
I think, you know, what I'm saying is that there is a close call I think you're on on the other side.

475
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:54,800
And she came in and I'm like, Oh, my goodness.

476
01:07:54,900 --> 01:08:25,530
And you know, this is something like hospitals is not just like I'm going to be like, oh, oh.

477
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:38,690
So, you know, like students didn't know.

478
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:48,480
Franklin County, Iowa.

479
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:56,500
And I didn't even know.

480
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:30,780
Oh, it's like when you're like, you know, I just I just I was like, I mean, it doesn't quite know how to respond to this.

481
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:38,530
I just want to give you.

482
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:42,400
All right. Right.

483
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:47,490
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

484
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:52,710
Yeah. And she doesn't know.

485
01:09:52,740 --> 01:10:06,480
So why do you want me to add to it?

486
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:11,580
People think automatically. Oh, yeah, that's right.

487
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:14,550
I mean, I understand her perspective, but it's just not true.

488
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:40,050
I want to ask your son if you can ask him to do something along those lines, you know, so I think that's you know, it's a great it's like,

489
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:48,120
you know, you definitely you can do it, but like maybe like use it or something or something along the lines so that.

490
01:10:51,480 --> 01:11:04,460
Yeah, I know. It's like a fine line. Like, I don't look at anyone like, you know, like I think, I don't think she's very negative,

491
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:08,040
which helps with like the concern is like what happens though?

492
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:23,720
Like just because because I think if you put in your time thing, I,

493
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:32,430
I don't know anything related to this class and I wonder if I have an obligation to say something like, okay, I'll finish.

494
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:39,660
Yeah. No, no. Yeah.

495
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:45,720
Well, can you just email and just remind me?

496
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:50,860
I don't know.

497
01:11:51,270 --> 01:12:03,630
I mean, you know, like, you know, we're going to have to think about that, but also maybe,

498
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:12,120
you know, you know, and that's because there's a couple of things from the Internet.

499
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:18,420
So, yes, I would follow that early on.

500
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:36,600
I understand, though, is it, though, is now and it wasn't just on today's political news about this is another thing.

501
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:42,780
You know, there's not.

502
01:12:44,250 --> 01:13:04,140
No. No, either. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's why, you know, I think that's why we have to be present to you to decide which I think is really important.

503
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:13,920
I don't think it's wrong to use these things.

504
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:18,630
Yeah, yeah, I know.

505
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:25,710
Oh, yeah. It's, it's much like when he started making those too.

506
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:34,500
So, yeah, it's also relatively short.

507
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:46,420
I guess that's what we're trying to think of an easier to.

508
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:59,550
Yeah. You know, I, I really like most of my teachers or something like that.

509
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:09,330
We like to say, okay, yeah.

510
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:19,830
I don't know. Yeah, yeah, I know.

511
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:24,230
Oh yeah. Something like that.

512
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:29,630
Yeah, I'm.

513
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:53,940
I'm gonna tell you, I think it's like, oh, she's all right.

514
01:14:53,940 --> 01:15:24,120
Thank you for letting me know. I remember from my experience as a student, I suppose, like, I think yesterday.

515
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:33,360
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's merging with.

516
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:55,270
I don't know, it's weird, but I also think you guys did a great job.

517
01:15:55,350 --> 01:16:05,530
But I think, like, she's going to have to take a video.

518
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:14,699
I got one maybe after they had a business in the farmers market.

519
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:19,000
So I was really surprised.

520
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:25,040
Oh, I know.

521
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:28,990
I mean, I have to wonder. Oh, my goodness.

522
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:47,820
Well, I just think it does make it difficult to get along very well.

523
01:16:54,580 --> 01:17:09,300
I think you're like, okay, well, you're going to go back to 1999.

524
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:38,100
Yeah. And it's really easy for me to assume that they're going to sit and wait for, like, a day.

525
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:59,790
He's not ready to be like, it's hard for me to make it clear I'm going to be like, Yeah.

526
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:04,600
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

527
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:20,400
Oh, yeah. You know, it's not something that looks like something right now that it's also good for

528
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:31,820
you to know that that's why they're saying they are going to have to be working.

529
01:18:36,690 --> 01:18:41,790
Oh, yes.

530
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,780
Yes. So, yeah.

531
01:18:49,740 --> 01:19:09,200
And so it's like, oh, I think intentionally this is not the same thing.

532
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:17,260
I don't think it matters. But he. Right.

533
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:33,600
Yeah. There's another one. Yeah.

534
01:19:42,090 --> 01:19:56,360
Yeah, it's it's not just like I was in his speech Thursday, I had a screenshot of it.

535
01:19:56,370 --> 01:20:00,569
I was like, well, I don't know, you know,

536
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:12,750
but I wanted something for the future because they're like after six years and we are also

537
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:23,879
recovering exactly what I thought was right and I was just Calendar three Dogs is a classic,

538
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:31,500
among other things to consider for quite a while. Yeah.

539
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:40,830
Yeah. Oh, I never think about it.

540
01:20:44,820 --> 01:21:05,460
I don't think anyone's. This is early last year, you know, so I.

541
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:45,290
Actually to start with, you seem to want to engage on how to make more.

542
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:58,870
And there's like to think about this and I just want to know how much I guess I know that has really everybody on

543
01:21:58,910 --> 01:22:16,520
your story and yet like you have somebody who is related and so you want to pay them exactly what it sounds like.

544
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:36,410
They're willing to give you credit for a closer look throughout this process.

545
01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:43,070
Something is going on here,

546
01:22:43,550 --> 01:23:04,010
but it's also interesting together in order to keep a close eye on everything from the result that I think

547
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:18,230
historically and there's so much such that I'm sure it was a constructive friction how they received the first night,

548
01:23:19,190 --> 01:23:23,270
which was shocking to me.

549
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:32,720
So make sure you keep a straight face down.

550
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:48,890
You know what thing I mean?

551
01:23:50,870 --> 01:24:10,040
It's it's it's it's interesting to hear McGrath was flirting, but I was never going to say, what did you think?

552
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:29,540
Oh, because you want to keep him from occurring every two or occurring twice a week.

553
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:33,679
Now, it's always so interesting. I would go to that.

554
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:39,860
It's like, I don't know.

555
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:43,430
I mean, it makes it doesn't make sense. Yeah.

556
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:54,799
I mean, like, I frankly think, like to do this thing, I mean, I just did not is going to, you know what I mean?

557
01:24:54,800 --> 01:25:05,300
I didn't do that. I was just trying to make sure.

558
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:18,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

559
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:44,590
Well, that part is supposed to be on that and I think she knows she does it too.

560
01:25:45,560 --> 01:26:05,950
You can see the difference, I think, because then I can answer any of those two questions.

561
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:13,610
He was against one of the positions.

562
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:19,440
I don't know what is whether they could change it.

563
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:28,060
Yeah, but they can't be like that.

564
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:35,430
So I don't know what that's like, but it's.

565
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:53,220
I didn't want to see. I take whatever due to mindset when like I can't handle that.

566
01:26:53,220 --> 01:27:03,750
He didn't even talk about it the second 12 hours later that I spoke to her.

567
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:08,760
Oh, wonderful. Yeah.

568
01:27:09,690 --> 01:27:16,970
So let's see. I could do it right out of college.

569
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:23,519
That's what I knew. And I also like.

570
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:26,520
Oh, Detroit is finally coming around.

571
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:43,060
Yeah. Yes. But mean, like, I used to have a lot of people in my home to do really simple things, so.

572
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:51,000
Yeah. Oh, I kind of want to make everyone.

573
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:55,060
I just want. I just mind to give you some time to start wrapping.

574
01:27:55,080 --> 01:28:00,330
You cut around the abstract and an opportunity to ask questions or ask each other questions.

575
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:07,739
So keep working on it. We feel free to stay here and use this room if you want to keep working on it.

576
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:15,299
But I you guys are free to go next week is just evaluation of the abstract.

577
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:22,890
So we'll talk first a little bit about giving and receiving feedback and then we'll just jump right into the evaluation.

578
01:28:22,950 --> 01:28:31,320
I will be pre assigning you to a peer, so if you cannot make it next week session, please let me know.

579
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,960
Or else in class I have to rearrange peers.

580
01:28:34,770 --> 01:28:43,319
So please just let me know if you cannot make it to class and I don't know if you're going to do one or two peers abstracts,

581
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:44,015
I'll, I'll figure that out as I prep for next week. But that's it.
