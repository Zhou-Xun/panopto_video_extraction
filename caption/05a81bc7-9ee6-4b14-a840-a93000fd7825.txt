1
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,560
So in this section of the course,
we're talking about stories.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,460
But my guess is that some of you
are thinking, hey, I don't tell stories.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,610
But you do every day.

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,698
Let me give you some examples.

5
00:00:17,698 --> 00:00:22,090
A doctor tell a story, actually,

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:28,040
when she tells a patient that he
faces increased risk of diabetes

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,550
but that that risk could be
lowered through dietary change.

8
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,640
And so that therefore the doctor is
gonna recommend a particular approach.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,750
Thatâ€™s actually a story.

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,020
Here's another story.

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,179
A statistician tells a story when
she describes how the field used to

12
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:52,715
analyze particular types of data using one
method, but now a better method is known.

13
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:59,645
And therefore, other analysts should
consider using this new method.

14
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:01,270
Here's one about a manager.

15
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,900
A manager tells a story when she notes
that the performance of the particular

16
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,000
unit has been quite good
on most measures but

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,900
not as good on another important measure.

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:18,302
And so therefore, she's going to focus
employee attention on improving that area.

19
00:01:18,302 --> 00:01:20,050
Here's one last one.

20
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,320
A scientist tells a story
whenever she describes

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,600
how our understanding of the world,
it seemed to make sense before.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,070
But there's new data that suggests that
our previous model is actually incomplete,

23
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,590
or maybe it's even wrong.

24
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,870
And therefore, a new theory or paradigm
is needed to understand the world.

25
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,050
These are all stories.

26
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,340
They all share the common
structure of the narrative arc.

27
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,490
Now, there are many
descriptions of the story arc.

28
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,450
I'm not gonna try and cover all of them.

29
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,970
One old one is from
Hegel back in the 1800s.

30
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:01,820
He described it as their thesis,
antithesis, which creates tension because

31
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:08,740
it contrasts with the thesis, and then
synthesis, which resolves the tension.

32
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,980
This structure isn't artificial, in fact,

33
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,890
it's the natural way that human beings put
information together to make sense of it.

34
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,220
That's why human beings
naturally tell stories.

35
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,830
Now, what is artificial,

36
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,060
however, is the way that academics have
learned to write journal articles.

37
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,850
Ever heard this structure?

38
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,660
Introduction, methods,
results, conclusion.

39
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:37,310
These sections are classically
used to write journal articles,

40
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,290
and they're descriptive.

41
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,850
I know what an introduction section is.

42
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,190
I know what a method section is.

43
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,800
I know what a results section is.

44
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,840
I know what a conclusion is.

45
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,150
But there's no tension.

46
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:52,380
And sometimes if you don't embed
a narrative arc into this,

47
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,260
we end up understanding what was done but
not really knowing the point.

48
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,760
We know that a certain result was gotten,
and that we conclude

49
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,740
that this fact exists, but
we don't actually sort of know the point.

50
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,640
No matter what it is you're communicating,
what you need to do is to recognize

51
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,070
the narrative structure in whatever
it is you're trying to get across.

52
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:20,090
And then once you recognize that structure
to build the communication around that

53
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,410
structure, it's kind of a scaffold.

54
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,540
And you can hang pieces of
information on that structure.

55
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,510
Doing so will make it easier for people
to understand and remember, because what

56
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:36,450
they'll remember is the structure,
not necessarily the specific points.

57
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,840
Now, don't take my word for it, right.

58
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,788
In organizational science,
Steven Denning who used to be a major

59
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:46,873
executive in the World Bank,
he wrote a book called

60
00:03:46,873 --> 00:03:52,290
The Springboard: How Storytelling Ignites
Action in Knowledge-Era Organizations.

61
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,815
And he's been going around for

62
00:03:54,815 --> 00:04:01,410
years telling the power of a story
to evoke organizational change.

63
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,570
In science communication,
Randy Olson, who's a former tenured

64
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,480
marine biology faculty member, wrote a
book, he's actually written several books.

65
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,450
But one called, Houston,
We Have A Narrative.

66
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,190
And they both basically
say the same thing.

67
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,360
If you want to change minds, or

68
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:23,280
change behavior, through communication,
you need stories.

69
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,780
Science is already a story.

70
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,910
Management is already a story.

71
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,410
Education is already a story,
if you recognize

72
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,120
the underlying structure of what it
is you're trying to communicate.

73
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,416
You just need to learn how to tell them as
stories to help you achieve your goals.
