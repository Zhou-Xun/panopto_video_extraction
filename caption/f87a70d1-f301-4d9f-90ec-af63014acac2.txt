1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,720
I want to take audiences around the world.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:19,310
I don't know yet because we are just waiting to see anything until the very end.

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:36,270
On the one hand, people who are used to work education, where are you now in your job is like you're like is like I'm your family.

4
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah. It sounds to me most likely to deal with things that are happening.

5
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:56,820
I don't like this, man. Yeah, I don't know what I'm saying.

6
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,560
I'm not sure why you have this line of business.

7
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,310
I mean, outsiders, you know, exchange everybody.

8
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,700
No, no, no, no. Yeah, exactly.

9
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,310
Because it's whole different system. I thought this is the wrong way.

10
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,820
Yeah. There you go. There you go. All righty.

11
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,560
We're going to have to go. Do we want to? What's that?

12
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,070
Want to like it's screen. Sounds like speaker, Nancy. Oh, do you want to?

13
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,750
I don't know how to do that. You got it. You're on. Yeah, I was on the case.

14
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,450
Is it just, uh. You mean, like, this thing? They can just do it from there.

15
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:52,320
Oh, you can just do here. No, that's okay. I need to expand and project that and then give you extend.

16
00:01:52,380 --> 00:02:03,860
There you go. Yeah, that's the way it. So most of them are really all right.

17
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:10,030
And I'm just going to duplicate it so much.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,760
Center you. Yeah.

19
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,060
All righty. And then we have speaker nuts over here. Cool.

20
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:32,090
So. Yeah. Yeah. So. Hi, everybody. Uh, we're group one covering the potential of benzene found and accused.

21
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,190
Community setting community, community concern and sunscreen.

22
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,510
I'm Orrin. It's Neal and Sarah and is now with us today.

23
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,610
But if there's questions on that, information sheet is available.

24
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,360
All right. So a little background in the setting or the scenario.

25
00:02:51,390 --> 00:03:01,140
So benzene was found in sunscreen related products from the study or from a number of studies.

26
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:11,550
And the community got word of this and there was a whole uptake of media coverage on this potential exposure from benzene and oh, it's a carcinogen.

27
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,240
Oh, there's cancer causing with sunscreen. Is that sunscreen supposed to be protective?

28
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:23,249
So we were tasked with estimating through a number of means the frequency, duration,

29
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:31,230
magnitude and route of the exposure, trying to recognize the potential input of benzene into a potential body.

30
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:44,160
And in that pseudo study or study that was detected from here, not intact up to 20 p.m. and most between eight and 12 p.m.

31
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,680
And we'll put those numbers into context later in the study. When you talk about the regulatory component of benzene.

32
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,190
Next slide, please. Sweet. So just a little background and benzene as a chemical to start us up.

33
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:06,810
So the high KW which means that it has a high like air to water coefficient rapidly volatile mobilizes ions so it sits in low lying areas.

34
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,349
Given that it's highly volatile, oh well we'll get there first.

35
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:22,320
But so it's formed from a bunch of natural and anthropogenic sources like volcanoes, oil, gasoline additives and has a short half life.

36
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:31,470
So it dissipates very rapidly in the environment exposure wise, given that it's highly volatile,

37
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,589
the main route of exposure or the main kind of exposure pathway you'll see is

38
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:47,790
through air and both indoor and ambient through a number of these exposure sources.

39
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:59,730
Sweet relative to its chemical use, it's used mostly like industrial settings with like solvents, plastics, rubbers, detergents, drugs and pesticides.

40
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,380
Yeah. So this thank you.

41
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:14,010
So in terms of ABM, so again, given that it's highly volatile and it's mostly found in the air, inhalation is the major route of exposure.

42
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,669
But dermal and oral are somewhat investigated,

43
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:28,260
but not as much given that it could be found by pharmaceuticals and other other substances like sunscreen distribution wise,

44
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:38,159
once it's inhaled or enters the bloodstream, it's preferentially stored in fat and nervous tissue and metabolism.

45
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:45,810
So once it's in the bloodstream, before it's sequestered into the fat, it gets metabolized by the liver into.

46
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,840
So benzene itself isn't inherently toxic.

47
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:58,410
When it metabolizing the liver, then it generates a secondary metabolite that is a toxic component of it, you know,

48
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:09,060
ukoniq acid and those can be either excreted the urinary or there's some other conjugates that are excreted.

49
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:22,649
And so given that inhalation kind of well lacking in that but so exhalation, whatever is not absorbed is exhaled for the initial inhalation exposure.

50
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:28,170
And so that exhalation is actually a major right of elimination prior to actually actually being absorbed.

51
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:35,700
And as I mentioned before, it has both fecal and urinary metabolites excreted prospectively.

52
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:44,040
Um, so let's say, let's say that it gets to your body and it's causing a negative effect.

53
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:53,399
What are the symptoms look like acutely? Those will go into like skin irritants, drowsiness, kind of mild neuronal symptoms,

54
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,070
confusion, maybe a little cardiac in there with arrhythmias, but so minor.

55
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:11,280
When you get chronic exposures, you'll get these decrease in these metabolic activities, hemorrhaging, you know, toxicity.

56
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:22,360
Leukemia is a. Major. Why don't we talk about this cancer carcinogen property of benzene causing cancer, the blood forming organs and lymphomas?

57
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:32,079
Next month. So this is just a crude diagram kind of inspired by Dr. Julio and his impact pathways.

58
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,810
So you can see the number of factors here that play into this.

59
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:42,430
Sunscreen to benzene exposure I outlined in blue is the main things that we're concerned with.

60
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:52,179
Despite the respiratory tract, blood borne kind of activity is the main scientific exploration component.

61
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:59,330
But again, we're focusing mostly on the blue and a little bit of that blue dashed line with the dermal uptake, too.

62
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:09,070
Yeah, but again, sweet. So the question remains, is benzene really in sunscreen, despite what the scenario media uptake said?

63
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:18,190
Kind of that media uptake scenario was actually based off a true event recently where an independent laboratory testing of a

64
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:29,349
bunch of different products across different sunscreen brands were tested and some were found to have benzene in sunscreen,

65
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:38,290
and some were not, despite benzene not being an active ingredient or not a main ingredient or component of sunscreen and in general.

66
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:46,569
So it was it was thought that benzene was likely in excuse me, unintentionally introduced during the manufacturing process,

67
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:51,610
maybe cross types contamination and with other manufacturing processes in the same plants.

68
00:08:52,680 --> 00:09:06,160
Right. Um, so once again, it was hypothesized that the inactive ingredients for some cross contamination were introducing benzene into this mix.

69
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:19,270
Um, there are certain components of sunscreens that are manufactured or generated through reactions with benzene and then includes grade propellants.

70
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:27,420
And then it was an association with spray sunscreens and benzene levels within that study.

71
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:34,930
So those were of interest or additional interest or concern and again, not correlated with any active ingredient.

72
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:43,180
So now applying that to how much of that benzene is actually liable to enter a body?

73
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,590
Well, given that the main route is inhalation, the research on benzene,

74
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:54,250
on dermal exposures like would be found in applied sunscreen is sparse or is few.

75
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:01,960
And really, there's a call for action amongst all these papers that say more research needs to be done in terms of dermal exposure.

76
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:12,680
Yeah. So for this scenario, we're gonna go through our proposed exposure assessment methodology.

77
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,000
We break it down into dermal and inhalation, since those are both relevant rates.

78
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,120
So this is kind of a review of dermal exposure assessment. We have the potential dose being the amount applied to the skin.

79
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,940
The applied dose is the amount at the skin barrier specifically that could be absorbed in the body,

80
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,040
the internal dose being what is absorbed and passing through the skin barrier and then

81
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,460
the biologically effective dose being that which interacts with the target organs.

82
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,549
Super sampling strategy. We thought there were a number of different routes we could take,

83
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:50,700
especially since this is not as kind of worked out as much as some of the installation sampling strategies.

84
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,380
So we thought we could do an interception sampling using something like coveralls since some screen is applied on the whole body.

85
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,500
We thought that would be a relevant way to determine how much benzene people might be exposed to thermally.

86
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:07,500
And then also, since it's often you going to be using your hands to play it, it might be important to look into that.

87
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:14,010
So we thought we could try one of these, like rinsing hands, using a bag and using water or solvent to estimate.

88
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,450
Also, since people use sunscreen and they go in the water, it could be important to look at that aspect.

89
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,790
And then silicone wristbands we thought could be an interesting avenue to explore,

90
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,050
since these can be used to integrate both inhalation and dermal exposure.

91
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,460
And we did find some studies saying that it would be, you know,

92
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:40,470
relevant if it's been tested as a relatively good approximation of that when compared with other exposure strategies.

93
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:47,490
And they were used essentially as like passive environmental monitors. So we thought for a more broad population this could be a good option.

94
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,100
And then lastly, bio monitoring again would be both dermal and inhalation,

95
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,790
but we thought we could collect urine and blood samples from exposed residents

96
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:02,710
to see what that actually like absorbed biologically about the doses could be.

97
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

98
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:16,770
So a potential alternative testing method that we've learned how to call the pathology is the thermal exposure methods using in vitro human cells.

99
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:26,850
And so basically this epidermis skin model is a cross antibody model where we expose some kind of agent of concern to human derived keratinocytes.

100
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,460
So the epidermal layer and we can see like,

101
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:35,790
like on the bottom an example figure two kind of recapitulates the different layers and the multilayered organization of the human skin.

102
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:43,379
And so that would be like a way to like get a more relevant dose for biologically effective doses in terms of like a human equivalent.

103
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:50,250
Those instead of having to do like our metric scaling and then just like assuming from can absorb those, what is the pharmacokinetics?

104
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,379
And then just some studies showing that although the literature is sparse,

105
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:05,530
as mentioned, exposure data collection has been done for thermal exposure of benzene.

106
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:11,500
This particular study used a dose of carbon 14 benzene that was applied on four volunteers.

107
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:18,830
And after 30 seconds, they didn't detect any benzene on the surface, which again plays into that like rapid volatility.

108
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,750
So that's all we're going to talk about, inhalation as well as a pathway of exposure.

109
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,139
And then just some more results from the study.

110
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:32,020
There was a lot of urinary excretion as well and the total absorption was a really small amount of the applied dose.

111
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,339
And then so speaking of which, no correction was made for volunteers isolation.

112
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:43,659
So going more into the inhalation methodology of how we would assess and measure different types of volatiles.

113
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:50,170
So as we all have come to appreciate and be familiar with the air sampling collection methods,

114
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,130
we can focus more so on like the ocean methods and as well as our methods,

115
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:01,660
they kind of share concordance for one, measuring benzene volatiles, specifically number 12 for our specification standards.

116
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:08,950
You when you're sampling and collecting for benzene, you use a calibrated personal sampling pump at the specified flow and volume,

117
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,720
and then you use like a granular absorption sampling tube that's coupled to the sampling pump.

118
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:21,730
And as we know, you know, there's a front section and a back up section and it's, you know, just the standard parameters for what we use.

119
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:28,360
And so specifically, the short section of the tube is used as a backup and should be positioned near the sampling pump.

120
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,220
And then we if you're trying to use the specific like sampling pump,

121
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:40,420
you would break off the ends of the tube and making sure that you have one half the tube diameter around the two millimeters,

122
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:47,979
so that when you're sampling, it goes from the front. So and then in addition, when you're sampling for benzene volatiles in your environment.

123
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,230
So this is like an active air sampling method. You also want to make sure that you have like a blank test batch.

124
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,300
So performing all the different kinds of procedures except for actually sampling for benzene.

125
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:04,470
So like breaking the seal and transporting it, making sure you have like a good control as you like.

126
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,670
Compare it, make sure there's no confounding factors.

127
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:16,929
And then so but one of the main questions we also had was if you're actually trying to monitor benzene volatile ization from sunscreen products,

128
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:22,060
you're not really specifically focused on environmental monitoring on a continuous time exposure scale.

129
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,660
You're also trying to see for regulatory compliance as well whether or not there's benzene emanating from the product.

130
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:35,860
So to help control for confounding factors and variables, one of the modified methods you could do was a airheads based sampling.

131
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,360
So specifically, I have some diagrams that kind of help visualize this.

132
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,929
It's like a closed system.

133
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:49,540
And basically you have your like, for example, your sunscreen product or whatever agent of concern and you basically dilute it into your matrix.

134
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,510
So like, like a little solvent.

135
00:15:53,290 --> 00:16:03,250
Internal standards, making sure everything's up to protocol and then either through heat or just like equilibrium, like shot equilibrium system.

136
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:09,220
You can then measure like the volatiles that like go from the sample matrix and then into the head space,

137
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,310
the head space being the gas space and then the liquid state being like the matrix of your dissolve sunscreen.

138
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:20,680
And then I put some like advantages in applications as well, some disadvantages.

139
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,540
So traditionally when you directly inject like,

140
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:31,960
like your liquid sample or your analyte into like gas chromatograph to separate the components for analog analysis,

141
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:39,340
you have like a low sensitivity, often because of like different contaminations and like interferences from the alpha compounds,

142
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,120
but with like the dynamic head space sampling which is shown here,

143
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:50,920
you basically have a more control on a closed system and then you're able to basically when you to into the head space,

144
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:58,270
collect those volatiles and really help separate them for like a better sensitivity and improve your limits of detection with that sort of interest.

145
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:05,410
And so basically all of this is to say you're having like a more control system instead of just like active area monitoring.

146
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:13,320
And so going more into the methods like air head space analysis here's some like basic.

147
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:21,640
About the method. So like of course our analyze benzene, our matrix is in the air coming from the sunscreen products.

148
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,240
And then we have like pretty good sensitivity.

149
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:29,820
And an important part about the sensitivity of this method is that it's determined by the slope of your calibration curve.

150
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:34,080
And so you should really see a like a really good linear relationship when you

151
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,840
perform this method between your benzene concentration and then your area counts.

152
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,340
And so the detection limit is also dependent on the slope of the calibration curve.

153
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,639
And this method has been validated across the various years.

154
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,870
So like this has been around for since like the 1970s, and they kept on improving on it.

155
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,520
So the accuracy is pretty high.

156
00:17:54,030 --> 00:18:01,680
And then yeah, like the method absorption and like as we mentioned before, it's using like a charcoal granular and sorbent too.

157
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:11,070
And then you analyze this by separating with gas matter, grassroots gas chromatograph, right, with a flame ionization detector.

158
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,220
And yeah, here's some just parameters about that.

159
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:20,520
And then so just like continuing for the reagents, some considerations you should be looking out for.

160
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:26,700
So when you're using this gas chromatograph, you use like a carbon disulfide gas chromatograph.

161
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:32,010
But however like that as your stationary phase, unfortunately with a lot of the commercially available products,

162
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,950
there's a lot of contamination with like benzene.

163
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:40,410
So you have to make sure you like distill it out before you use the provided columns for the gas chromatograph.

164
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:49,590
And then you you want it for your internal standards and your calibration curves use like reagent grade and purified like grade of air as well.

165
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:55,950
And then, you know, your solution efficiency is directly proportional to what purity of the reactions you have.

166
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,720
And then for a calculation. So going back to like gen chem with analytical chemistry,

167
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:08,610
you can use the your Lamberts equation which basically states that absorbance in a concentration or like solution by

168
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:15,179
like a material for like light or electromagnetic radiation is like directly proportional to its like concentration.

169
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:20,459
So you can see like the equation here and then specifically they derive using that

170
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,560
equation to determine how much benzene is in your sample of the liquid like.

171
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:33,710
And then, you know, going back to our lecture from like lecture 16, there's kind of like a schematic overview of how all this works.

172
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,200
So when we talk about like a stationary phase,

173
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:42,890
that's the part of your column that's like being interactive with your like analyte or unknown chemical of interest.

174
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,690
Right. And then the liquid phase or the mobile phase is what you dissolve your compound in.

175
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:56,210
And so based on like the different affinities and chemistries of your compound of interest, it either sticks the column or it gets washed out.

176
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,110
And so for benzene, right, since we're talking about like all of that aromatic compound,

177
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,280
it would be like a non-polar phase or most commonly referred to, like our first phase.

178
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:10,040
And then your liquid phase would be kind of like a like polar non-polar,

179
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:18,110
empathetic mix so that you retain like some like, ability to mix the solvent with like your compound of interest.

180
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,180
And then, of course, I'm not going to like belabor the point, but at this method calculations,

181
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,630
you have to make sure your distortion of energy efficiency, right?

182
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:38,540
The mass absorbed has to be equal to like your mass recovered over the distortion, efficiency, sorry, and then the capacity breakthrough.

183
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,880
All these concerns still apply to this method.

184
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:47,510
Unfortunately, though, when we consider like sunscreen, there's a lot of different components in the mixture.

185
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,569
So we also consider a bulk material analysis.

186
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,630
And so this is another recommendation by OSHA and then NAOC.

187
00:20:54,650 --> 00:21:03,020
And specifically what you could do is you take a representative lot of like all the like benzene products because if you take like one random sample,

188
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,889
it might not represent like the whole batch of like manufactured benzene products.

189
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:14,810
So you can mix them together and then using that you can use like an HPLC detection method which is similar to gas chromatograph.

190
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:19,939
But the reason why you would do this is because some compounds maybe in that sunscreen are

191
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,800
more volatile and they're thermally sensitive because when you use gas chromatograph,

192
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:29,390
you're just doing that. The compounds of interest are thermally stable and volatile,

193
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:36,260
whereas this is more assuming like you might have compounds that are like thermally labeled or like unstable when you keep them up.

194
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:45,680
And so like similar properties, you basically can determine the absorbance of light at 254 nanometers for like benzene using HPLC.

195
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:53,930
Yeah. And then I'm not going to belabor the point. Make sure use reagent grade reagents, sample collection,

196
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:59,660
make sure you separate your air sampling from bulk material sampling using special Teflon line caps.

197
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:08,810
Because the fact that you want to make sure you're not accounting for additional bias from just contaminants and interferences.

198
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:15,530
And then if you need to, you have to, like, distill the samples and delete them as necessary, but first, analyze it undiluted.

199
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:25,070
And so like it was like an example graph where like as you run the HPLC, you can see like absorbance peaks at 254 nanometers.

200
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:32,090
And so like, for example, you might assume that like peaks seven and nine, there's like a pretty high concentration of like benzene.

201
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,730
And then you can derive that how much is actually in the sample by volume using that equation?

202
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:45,190
Here's just like a schematic overview, and it's a pretty nice picture that kind of like gives you how it works.

203
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,459
So you have your, like, dissolve sample, you pump it, you inject it, you separate it.

204
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,300
Using like your column would either be like gas chromatograph or a C column.

205
00:22:53,610 --> 00:23:00,020
Then you have your data detector, flame ionization detection, and then that integrates it into like actual reader output.

206
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:07,400
Oh, yeah. And then mobile phase, stationary phase, your stationary phase being the one that you want your sample to interact with.

207
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:15,889
And then once you have like your templated amounts, right, you can start calculating the average daily dose from like just using sunscreen.

208
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:21,650
And so we realized that like for recreational and community exposure scenarios, it's going to vary.

209
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:28,040
But if you just assume for like ideal purposes, like an occupation, like lifeguard, agriculture workers,

210
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:38,120
athletes who have to wear sunscreen for like eight hour exposure periods, then you can like start calculating a more concrete daily dose.

211
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:43,250
And then from that you can also derive like a priority score for the vapor hazard index.

212
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:52,130
And then there's like other sampling instruments. So as we talked about in previous lecture discussions, right, we have like break tubes,

213
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:59,450
detector tubes like electrochemical sensors, portable gas chromatograph as well and patches as well.

214
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:07,940
And then we'll talk later about biomarker measurements as well in your urinary metabolites as well as like your exhaled breath.

215
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,059
And then the ability for these sampling instruments to be useful is when you're doing

216
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:18,980
like will vapor time exposure profiles for like direct monitoring but as well see later,

217
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:23,420
there's, there's advantages and advantages to that. And then I just want to shout this out here.

218
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,720
I'm not going to like I'm not going to go too heavy into.

219
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:31,680
If you want to do some theoretical modeling and you don't have enough resources or it's just too cost prohibitive,

220
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:36,360
you can use like Dr. Olivier, Julia is like use today's multimedia toxicity model.

221
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,630
So this is from the United Nations Environmental Program.

222
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,240
And basically like if you take all the physical chemical properties of each chemical,

223
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:53,580
you can actually do different mass balancing and then you can like put it into like a matrix, formulate a differential equation, probabilistic model.

224
00:24:53,850 --> 00:25:00,900
And so Mike is he's done remarkable work on this front where he has like a database of different chemicals by the case numbers.

225
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,660
And you can put like different inputs and see like,

226
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:11,190
like a basically an estimate of what like the risk is in valleys and your product intake fraction for all these scenarios.

227
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:16,640
And then yeah. And then here's like some of his equations that you would use for like skin surface modeling.

228
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:20,250
Yeah. So if you were to do thermal equations, you could use this and then yeah.

229
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,360
So I'm just like theoretical using the physical chemical properties you can like start

230
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:30,090
having like an estimation of how volatile the product is and how long you would stay on.

231
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:37,370
Yeah. And so with strengths, limitations and certainties, we're going to talk about some of the advantages,

232
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:41,330
disadvantages associated with like the dermal and ball type methods that we talk about.

233
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,059
Yeah. So for the dermal methods, as we talked about with sunscreen being directly applied to the skin,

234
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:54,770
this is kind of the most relevant pathway for this scenario and it can allow for a more in-depth characterization of systemic effects.

235
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,250
But there are also a lot of limitations, as we talked about in class,

236
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,940
the kind of like methods and calculations for dermal are much less worked out than they are for things like inhalation.

237
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,290
There's kind of like not exactly a standard, so there's probably a lot of different ways you could do it.

238
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,020
And we don't really know what the best way is.

239
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:18,350
And also we don't have a lot of specific measurements to compare to as we'll talk about when we talk about standards that exist.

240
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,419
And again, with the standards, with the calculations and methods not being standardized,

241
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,560
we just have a lot of uncertainty in our calculations and measurements.

242
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:35,840
And also another point we thought of, since sunscreen is applied on the whole body, we know that the skin thickness varies across our body.

243
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,400
So that could be something we might not be able to account for super well with the current methods we have.

244
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,530
So it could depend on like if you're only putting on your face for putting it on your arms or whatnot.

245
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,060
So we just might not be able to sufficiently account for that variation.

246
00:26:50,390 --> 00:27:00,250
So that could introduce more uncertainty as well. And then we've talked a lot about biomarker events and disadvantages, but just kind of recap,

247
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:06,310
especially for this example, advantages are it confirms that there is absorption and we can find the absorption dose.

248
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:12,190
And also it can sometimes be helpful for detecting lower levels than other methods.

249
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:18,069
But some disadvantages are if we were trying to differentiate between the dermal and inhalation exposure,

250
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,889
we couldn't do that because it's going to reflect all exposure pathways.

251
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:26,680
And also if someone was exposed to benzene through their work or through some other way other than the sunscreen,

252
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:33,579
we're not going to be able to differentiate that. We do have a lack of reference levels for the biomarkers sometimes.

253
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:43,209
And also, since this is we're thinking about an environmental exposure on a population level, the limit of detection might be too low to be relevant.

254
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:50,710
We might have exposures lower than that. And then it can also be expensive depending on what biomarker are you using.

255
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,310
And specifically from one of our lecture slides.

256
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:01,270
Some examples with benzene specifically are the endogenous production of phenols can interfere

257
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:06,650
with looking at the biomarkers and how much of that could be from the exposure or co exposures,

258
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,970
you know, highly variable metabolism.

259
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,940
Um, and I got more exposure.

260
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:23,549
Oh, and so for air head space sampling, some advantages and disadvantages, we kind of touched upon them earlier, but for advantages, right?

261
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:29,630
You have a really sensitive and reproducible method, especially as these methods are often performed by third party laboratory testing.

262
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:37,800
And the samples are really stable, usually because if you're just directly dissolving your benzene from your sunscreen in a liquid solvent,

263
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:42,600
you can avoid the whole transportation and storage issue and you're able to analyze multiple

264
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,790
compounds sanctimoniously using the differential like affinity and chemistries of your matrix,

265
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,060
using the gas chromatograph or HPLC column.

266
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:59,820
And then if you properly choose your GC or like HPLC parameters, you can circumvent a lot of internal interferences and contamination issues.

267
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,420
However, once again, like the disadvantages, right on the flip side,

268
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:09,389
you have like a limited absorption capacity by like charcoal before you like overload it.

269
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:16,740
And so often if you were to moderate it in like an environmental sample, right, you would have like issues like humidity or like co contaminants.

270
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,409
But if you're doing it in a closed system,

271
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:25,560
you can kind of also circumvent that which is the the benefit of doing like headspace space instead of just out in the open environment.

272
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:31,980
And then the position again is like limited by the reproducibility of like the equipment and specifically with the tubes.

273
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:39,030
And so often like when you do your personal calibrations for your pumps, they're only calibrated for one tube.

274
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:45,419
So having that reproducibility could have like a little variation, but it shouldn't be like, oh, like huge variation.

275
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:51,479
And there's like the specifications you should look out for. And then of course, you have to have like a high degree of skill to operate.

276
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,030
So analytical chemists like really exact the exact parameters that they need to

277
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:03,420
circumvent like interferences and then similarly for bulk material and volatile sampling.

278
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:10,079
Right. Want to make sure it's well, it's advantages, right? Sensitive and it's like reproducible and then similar advantages.

279
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,350
Right.

280
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:19,280
Like you can re and analyze samples and you can like differentiate in the mixture of like the benzene compounds but uniquely to the C column, right?

281
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:25,920
Because you're injecting such small liquid volumes, you have to be aware of like anything in the benzene or sorry,

282
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:31,500
the sunscreen that could clog the capillary tubing. So the stilling the sample for like, like, you know,

283
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:39,360
I like lotion has like leave on the chemicals that stick your skin better and then also using like the clarification kit.

284
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:43,080
And then of course, you have to have some high skill to have to read that too.

285
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:50,370
And then with like direct readings and then other methods or methods of analysis, they're more easier to use.

286
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:57,509
And then you can also avoid these time delays and potential sample losses and then some of them not for like direct reading measurements,

287
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:05,760
but some of the methods you can actually do like a continuous monitoring from emanating from the, the sunscreen in a closed system over disadvantages.

288
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,549
And I think Sarah kind of recapitulated pretty well is just there's a lack of specificity reference

289
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:16,650
levels for calibration and there's like potentially a lot of interferences and contaminants.

290
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,670
Some of these like direct reading measurements are also really high and initial costs.

291
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,820
So like, for example, the tubes that are like $20 for a tube.

292
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,030
So it's not really good for statistical analysis.

293
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:31,439
And then you have to like frequently calibrate it and you have to have like a expert who's

294
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,470
like knows how to calibrate it and compare it to like the reference standard levels.

295
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:40,350
And then often these like measurements are thresholds or like for semi quantitative or even qualitative,

296
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,839
just saying whether or not benzene is present in the product or not.

297
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,100
So it's not really helpful unless you're comparing it to like an oil, for example.

298
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,750
Yeah. So for standards, we're going to look at a couple of different things.

299
00:31:54,230 --> 00:32:00,260
As we know, there's there are a lot of standards for occupational exposures and we know that benzene is often occupational exposure.

300
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:06,049
So we're going to talk about that a little bit and then we're to talk about what makes sense for kind of general population.

301
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:11,990
But as Neal mentioned earlier, there are some people that could be have these like longer eight hour exposures

302
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,440
if they're working outside or something and need to use sunscreen more often.

303
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:25,190
So these are kind of this is just from the OSHA website, all the various pools, TVs and whatnot for benzene.

304
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:34,640
You can see there's there's a time that averages and the short term exposure limits the pretty low one part per million if you know up to five.

305
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:42,140
And we can see for the ECJ and Cal OSHA, there are skin notations for those two, not for the other two.

306
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:47,419
So again, these would be most relevant for people that are occupationally exposed.

307
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:54,590
And if we remember back to that scenario slide at the very beginning, I forget the exact numbers, but I believe they were like 20 yes.

308
00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:01,190
To 12 versus area ranges between not in tact and 20 with most applying between eight and 12 p.m.

309
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,809
Right. So we can see that these levels are clearly much lower than that.

310
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,680
But again, in terms of how much is actually absorbed, there's still a little bit of a question there.

311
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:18,740
And then the ACG also has some these there's a couple of different biomarkers that can be used for urine samples.

312
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:28,340
As we mentioned, we would use that part of that as part of our sampling strategy so we could compare to these levels to see.

313
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:36,229
Obviously we don't have numbers for what those would be, but and then more for the general population,

314
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,420
we thought there were a couple other avenues we could look at.

315
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:45,850
Prop 65, as we recently discussed in class, has a couple of levels we could look at approach that out.

316
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:50,960
There's no significant risk levels. I was going to try to convert it to parts per million, but it wasn't working.

317
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:54,169
So there's a couple of different levels we can compare to.

318
00:33:54,170 --> 00:34:02,809
But again, they're oral and inhalation, so there's still no dermal specific comparison, as we mentioned,

319
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:09,050
is kind of a limitation of doing this, but they give us some kind of reference of a range of what might be relevant.

320
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:14,120
And then another option, when we take our blood biomarker sampling,

321
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:20,420
we could compare that to enhanced levels just to get a sense of like how does this compare to the general population level?

322
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:25,550
Is this significantly higher? Like how much of an impact is this sunscreen having for people that are using it?

323
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:32,440
So that could just be another avenue of comparison. All right.

324
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:38,950
There's a lot in conclusion here, just like the blanket statement of what you should know about benzene sunscreen.

325
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,250
Again, it's not a standard ingredient in sunscreen.

326
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:48,850
It was detected in some consumer products at levels, in some cases above 2 p.m.,

327
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:58,270
which is again, above those concentrations that were regulated in terms of benzene.

328
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,820
Use in sunscreen is not directly, readily absorbed.

329
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:07,990
Inhalation remains a concern, especially when you talk about the SCRAM propellant sunscreens that are just missed into the air.

330
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:14,769
But nonetheless, that concentration in your product, particularly in your consumer sunscreen,

331
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:22,510
would still remain low and exposures are generally inhalation.

332
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,090
And recent developments in the dermal surrogates have some potential for hope for estimating

333
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:33,880
dermal exposures and your purchasing coefficients and bioavailability of this benzene.

334
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:38,950
And just a little general note about sunscreen in general.

335
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:43,809
It's a good protective public health tool for if it's broad spectrum UVA,

336
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:51,459
a if it's a general UVB, and the more the higher the SPF, the longer you're protected.

337
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:56,800
But don't do anything over the 50 because it's negligible benefits, as far as I know.

338
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:02,380
And then again, just with any exposure, consider control priorities.

339
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:10,330
And keep in mind that no sunscreen is perfect and there's alternatives that you can do, like wearing wide brimmed hat,

340
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:14,740
sunglasses or other protective clothing and then seeking shade wherever possible

341
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,620
throughout your occupational or just your recreational time in the sun.

342
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:32,390
All right. Thank you. Couple minutes for questions.

343
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,980
Questions? Very detailed.

344
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:39,440
Good job for your air head space.

345
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:47,180
I'm wondering if that if you took into account where in your research you found that when you use that in this specific situation,

346
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:57,380
usually you're applying sunscreen outside. So like if it's the spray sunscreen, like thinking about how that might be, you know, it's it's a big area.

347
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,859
Yeah. Account for that at all. Yeah. So that's actually a really good point.

348
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:05,269
And kind of like Oren was alluding to in the conclusions is that you have your spray on sunscreen,

349
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:08,150
that's like molecules and then you also have your leave on sunscreen.

350
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:15,170
And so using ocean methods like number 12, the reason they give you two scenarios is so like with the head spray sampling of like a closed system,

351
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:23,630
you're more so capturing like the liquid gel matrix that doesn't really volatiles and then seeing like what vapors like emanate from that.

352
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,870
Whereas with like the actual like active air sampling that were traditionally like just using a calibrated

353
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:37,180
sampling pump that would be more so for like the volatile and strongly those sunscreens I could spray on it.

354
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:43,010
Okay. Yeah. I mean, in class we talked a lot about ventilation is like an important way of reducing exposure.

355
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:49,160
So you might like recommend putting on like an aerosol sunscreen outside rather than inside and downwind.

356
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,050
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, except for those people I talked to on point of difference.

357
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:58,920
Yeah. Yeah. All those people. You know the questions.

358
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,820
So you mentioned it. It's called style and doesn't care what you do.

359
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,770
Is that for just pure benzene?

360
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:16,890
Did you find anything on bands and solutions for hair gel or lotion type of situation that you think it definitely would impact it?

361
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,130
I think the winter is kind of out there.

362
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:27,810
Yeah, there is still time, I would imagine just from theoretically the longer that there's benzene in contact with your skin,

363
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,389
the higher probability of benzene penetration. But again,

364
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:36,090
that penetration that that partition coefficient hasn't quite been isolated to a concrete idea

365
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:42,450
and it's just generally understood that it's not directly like readily absorbed in skin.

366
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:51,260
So again, I think the biggest concern would be if it's not washed off and it's lived on the the vapor made it

367
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:58,950
from that sunscreen product thermally applied now especially if it's on your nose or near respiratory.

368
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,610
Holes. So for your sampling, what are you sampling?

369
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:11,530
A movie? Oh, yes. A certain type of product in person to be in your study or.

370
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:20,470
Yeah. So we were more so sampling the direct like directly to products, but we weren't specifically focusing on that population of interest.

371
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:29,020
We were just assuming that if you were to apply this on your skin and then assuming like, oh yeah, for our average 40 hour work week.

372
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:36,819
Yeah. And I think for the bio monitoring, I think I said we wanted, we were focused on just kind of like residents like general population,

373
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,020
but we would probably want to collect some information as well about if they like how much they use sunscreen,

374
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:45,219
if that's something they're using in their job and if they're being exposed more often

375
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,280
and like separating those out to see if there's a difference between people using.

376
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:57,479
For long periods of time. And no, I'm sorry you had to exposure factors.

377
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,840
Did you find any information like how much sunscreen?

378
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:08,010
Yeah, it's about, I believe, one ounce of sunscreen for the whole body and just hands and face.

379
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:11,760
It's one sixth of an ounce, two tablespoons.

380
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:18,390
And so we try and we play with the idea of a strengthening from that amount and then like how much concentration

381
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:24,930
of benzene in sunscreen and therefore how much concentration our base of benzene you apply to your skin.

382
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:30,989
But those numbers kind of petered out and they're like too insignificant, you know,

383
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:38,190
degrees just because you're dealing in such small quantities and such small concentrations of benzene with, again, this concentration of benzene.

384
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:42,000
Benzene in sunscreen is, again, so demonstrably low.

385
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:50,160
And then in the millions, you know, kind of thing that, you know, that kind of number doesn't seem as it's critical.

386
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:56,940
Yeah. From our estimates and our comparisons with the regulatory and just the literature review.

387
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:05,850
Yeah, we, we're having a little struggle finding like all those extrapolations and specifically with these modifying factors for light penetration.

388
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,440
I know they have like models like Dr. Julie.

389
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:15,809
It was also like kind of alluding to where you have like penetration coefficients, but uh, that's kind of still tentative.

390
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:22,050
It's not like experimentally validated. Any other questions?

391
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:37,610
Okay. Thank you. Good. Three year. I'm sorry it took so much time.

392
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:42,740
Now, do you think he's angry at all?

393
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,960
Yeah. Yeah, that sounds such.

394
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,340
Yes, that's exactly right. You know, it'll be great.

395
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:50,370
Sarah. Lost and put it back to the things that are going to heal and it's going to duplicate versus who's going to be helpful.

396
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,830
It should be fine. Oh, yes, yes.

397
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:06,530
Because I don't know. The answer is.

398
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,700
It's not benzene in sunscreen. That's where surveillance keeps.

399
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:30,200
Why is it even logging in the very near past? What is going on there?

400
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,650
I would say well, using veto. Okay.

401
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:41,270
Yeah, well, I'm at a loss of security control shift then.

402
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:51,660
Yeah. So I have been asked a lot of questions about sunscreen and benzene.

403
00:43:53,710 --> 00:44:04,600
My brothers and I used to hear, you should know that the approach I took was, I must say, the right way.

404
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:15,549
Those people in California so focused on Prop 65 and they give you that microgram per day to try to find how much value of sunscreen is typical.

405
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:24,160
And then with that, you get a massive volume based on how much benzene might be in the realm.

406
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:32,500
And then do some, you know, high and low estimates of what might actually make it through using various assumptions of skin inhalation.

407
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:37,120
The questions of, you know, is it going to fall twice as much as that solution?

408
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:43,209
So there's a lot of different things that, you know, people have on their hands.

409
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:47,590
Are they washing their hands up and the mouth contact also concerned, right.

410
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:51,790
But yeah, telling people is pretty low, especially if it's going to be places.

411
00:44:52,140 --> 00:45:00,549
So it's probably okay. But if in the event that it's trapped in that solution and on the skin for a long time and does get through the skin,

412
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:04,750
then it may start to support this process, right?

413
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:11,260
Yeah, we did that already. Well, yeah, we actually measured more sodium in like that, right?

414
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:18,040
Yeah. High class work of three.

415
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:27,310
My name is Tricia. I'm David Bird presenting ethylene oxide, exposure and industrial.

416
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,180
And then a little bit background on our scenarios.

417
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:41,230
So in the state of Michigan, it has recently received a large number of complaints from residents who live nearby,

418
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:51,190
a large medical supply company in the area that a Ford exposure to ethylene oxide and is commonly used to to use sterilized medical equipment,

419
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:55,900
but it's also thought to be reproductive toxicant and carcinogenic.

420
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:06,310
And then the purpose of our presentation is to know the extent of exposure to ethylene oxide in the community,

421
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:14,660
whether the facility is in fashion as responsible for any increased elevator exposures.

422
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:27,330
So ethylene oxide is a flammable, colorless gas at temperature above 10.7 degrees Celsius.

423
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,900
That smells like Arthur at toxic levels.

424
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:40,170
It is a industrial chemical found in production of solvents, antifreeze, textile, textiles and detergents.

425
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:51,540
Smaller amounts can be also found against violence and for cosmetics, as well as during hospital sterilization of surgical instruments.

426
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:57,490
In 2016, it is labeled as a carcinogen by EPA.

427
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:01,050
It is concluded in the final report. Says says.

428
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:12,840
Ethylene oxide is 30 times more carcinogenic to people who constantly exposed to the ETO in industrial settings.

429
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:16,980
It has not been reported to bio accumulate.

430
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:26,850
Therefore the effects are small and are from a constant exposure and the primary route of exposure is through inhalation.

431
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:37,400
So we did a little bit of background on the past cases against ethylene oxide exposure in different cities in the United States.

432
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,440
In August, 17,

433
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:51,420
State of Texas Environmental Regulatory Agency announced that et0 was significantly less toxic than the federal agency had found and thus new.

434
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:59,180
This has a result, a new standard that could allow more ethylene oxide being emitted to the environment.

435
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:08,360
Laredo is a city in Texas that is amount of 20 hotspots in the country with the highest level of cancer risk.

436
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:14,510
And this is most caused by a company called Midwest Corporation.

437
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:24,080
And the plans, their plans will be used to far more ethylene oxides on average than any other sterilizer plants in the country.

438
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:31,760
The facility evaluates the estimated lifetime cancer risk for nearly half of the Laredo residents,

439
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:38,870
with the state statistic being shown to all cities that all citizens of Laredo having at

440
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:47,330
least a 75 higher cancer risk than the rest of the country due to ethylene oxide emissions.

441
00:48:50,490 --> 00:49:01,229
Thank you. And then another in cases against ethylene oxide exposure as a company called Storage and genetics used the gas ethylene oxide

442
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:09,960
to sterilize medical devices and other products that later being reported to be associated with elevated risk for cancer.

443
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:15,960
For those residents who live nearby the operation sites, over the years,

444
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:25,140
residents reported all kinds of problem health includes cancer, leukemia and other type of disease.

445
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:37,350
In 2018, after a five week trial concluded in September that one of the victims commuter against the company

446
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:45,540
for pumping more than £1 million of ETO into the air and failed to install emission controls.

447
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:50,820
And then she was awarded $360 million.

448
00:49:51,390 --> 00:50:00,320
In 2019, Illinois EPA shut down the Willowbrook facility due to the elevated cancer risk.

449
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:06,180
But later that year and later in the year, this company was closed permanently.

450
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:11,409
And then next. Okay.

451
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:19,520
So we're basically making a proposal to the state of Michigan to how we should assess this company in the area right now,

452
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,009
how we should assess how much of everything oxide they're giving off.

453
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:27,850
So we're going to approach this with basically four steps,

454
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:34,750
maybe simultaneously or possibly sequentially in steps depending on the kind of evidence each step produces.

455
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:44,620
And so the first thing we want to do is take samples around the perimeter of the the company under suspicion, took our samples,

456
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:53,680
uh, and then take into account the complaint areas and create kind of a radius based on complaints to sample from as well.

457
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:58,960
And using these samples, we want to build their model of ethylene oxide measurements.

458
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,719
Um, assuming that the data is not available already from the EPA monitoring and

459
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,510
they will also submit questionnaires to the residents that are complaining,

460
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:13,510
complaining and affected and later sending possibly more questionnaires depending on what the air mall produce.

461
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:22,360
And we also offered blood tests and blood tests for biomarkers of exposure, such as elevated levels of white blood cells.

462
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:30,190
In the case of leukemia, supposed to be the most common cancer that every oxide is going to be attributed to.

463
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:39,440
Um, and so after doing these, uh, different types of analysis and questions, uh,

464
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:46,180
the idea would be to collect enough evidence to gain what's called a seal order where the EPA basically shuts down that chemical.

465
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:48,880
It's just an access to the chemical.

466
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:55,750
And then we can do another test after they shut down that chemical to have more conclusive results about whether or not they were indeed,

467
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,440
um, you know, not following emission criteria.

468
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:09,340
And so there's a few methods we could possibly use, but there's a couple that stand out just due to their sensitivities.

469
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:15,630
I personally like this one the most because it's the most sensitive, but it's if you aim at the top 15.

470
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:23,920
And so it's been around for a while, but recently, 1580 came out in 2019 as an improvement over the 1999 version.

471
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:32,890
And the improvements are really just based off of just based on how you see basically it's improved you see that allow better sensitivities.

472
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:41,540
And so this this ACA uses DCMS. Which is basically state of the art in terms of the Okies.

473
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,960
And they used to make canisters to collect samples.

474
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:57,309
So we chose this asset because recommended by the American Industrial Hygiene Association and it is a multi analyte assay,

475
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:00,190
but we can just ask the reference lab to focus on ethylene oxide.

476
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:06,070
One problem with it is that there is a coalition of duty which could affect the results.

477
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:12,820
And so we basically need to make sure that wherever we submit the sample, we need to ask that reference laboratory to have that,

478
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:18,520
to keep that in mind and have basically the method to separate those two elements of.

479
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:29,409
And we want to say time integrated samples, maybe variant with 24 hours 8 hours and then have a final calculation of what the

480
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:34,570
concentration is in the air and method detection limit is 41 parts per billion,

481
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:42,850
but it could be even lower. That's kind of systematically picked based on what the EPA has already reported on the method.

482
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,690
So here they, they assigned the, uh.

483
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:57,919
So basically they picked the highest of these three concentrations to be kind of a limited detection,

484
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:06,080
but they could potentially go down to a point zero, 1.4 billion or 0.0 to 5.4 billion.

485
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:13,070
An alternative method would be EPA method t0 27.

486
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:19,940
So last March method 3702, which is actually a portable GC method.

487
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:27,140
And so they use these sampling bags to collect that along with the field.

488
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:34,010
GC And so it's not as sensitive as, it's not as sensitive of the method as the previous method, but they can get,

489
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:40,520
they can get results basically by in there without having to send it off to a, to a reference laboratory.

490
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:51,079
And so some pros and cons about using these sampling methods, since we are dealing with the DLC that comes with the year that we sample,

491
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:58,850
which has all these other components and they can react within the sampling vessel and that could throw off or concentration calculations.

492
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:05,240
And we can also get sample loss on the walls of the sampling vessels.

493
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:10,520
But these are really easy to carry around. The super canisters are like the size of a basketball.

494
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:18,500
Probably not good for personal sampling, but these are excellent methods for sampling.

495
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,649
And so in building the air models that we want to that we want to build,

496
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:32,770
using the air sampling measurements we want to use, we want to take into account the air and the air flow in the area.

497
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:41,430
And so we can send out like a field survey to see and maybe satellite imagery to see where the company has their vents installed,

498
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,620
where they're it's also installed.

499
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:49,150
And we can calculate kind of the theoretical plume boxes that come out of that company and put that into our air model.

500
00:55:50,740 --> 00:56:00,850
And the idea being that we eventually get this kind of area map based on the few samples that we have and the air models,

501
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:04,870
we create this kind of heat map to see what areas might be the most affected.

502
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:14,500
And then follow up with more sampling, more questions, more more blood tests to have more conclusive evidence of this being released into the air.

503
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:26,630
And so using the error modeling mostly, but also some of the area measurements, we can calculate an average daily dose.

504
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:34,040
So we can use the concentration either directly if it's it's from an area measurement or probably more

505
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:39,589
likely we can use the concentration that's predicted from the air models to see what everyone's breathing.

506
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:56,959
Rates are in the area. And we could also go with some personal personnel sampling using ice methods 1614, which also uses GC.

507
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:06,140
But instead of using MS2 using electron capture detector, it's not as sensitive as a method, but it would be a more personalized sampling method.

508
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:11,810
So you would get data for each person that you include instead of generalizing from an area of measurement,

509
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:23,530
this actually measures to bromo ethanol because the. The ethylene oxide is captured in a glass over filled with hydrophobic acid,

510
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:30,370
and so it reacts on the filter paper and to below ethanol is able to be collected directly off of it.

511
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:36,640
And so even though this is acid, it's not as sensitive as the previous two.

512
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:46,090
It does form a stable product. And you can more conclusively say that or rather more confidently say that this is actually what the concentration is.

513
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:52,060
But these are known to be a bit sensitive to humidity and temperature.

514
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:58,360
And since they do use since this method does these glass tubes, they can break pretty easily.

515
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:05,840
And so some of the biomarkers we could use are exhaled breath.

516
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:16,620
We can do we can directly measure doses in various people in the area and we could also do blood tests.

517
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:21,000
So one of the hallmarks of leukemia is an elevated level of white blood cells.

518
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:29,129
And so if that's just another data point to add to the three oxide concentrations that you have a high concentration in the area,

519
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:34,800
they have high leukemia and have high white blood cells. It's probably probable that they're being affected negatively.

520
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:48,420
One paper. I don't know how to pronounce the guy's last name, but it looks like this week or most recently from a 2018 storage annex incident,

521
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:54,060
they took advantage of that incident to do a study on measuring hemoglobin attacks.

522
00:58:54,690 --> 00:59:01,020
So it's a female is a hemoglobin added with an end to hydroxy F of energy.

523
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:10,180
And so in this study, they did find that people that were closer to the acidity, Sister Jennings had higher concentrations of this added.

524
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:19,079
And so we could possibly include that in our blood tests to basically see how people are affected.

525
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,110
It could be used as a measure of proximity exposure.

526
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:30,740
Yeah. And then for some other data collection activities,

527
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:35,750
we would like to administer a questionnaire to the surrounding community in Detroit for the

528
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:41,750
individuals in the community that are reporting higher incidences of miscarriage and cancer.

529
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:48,679
And by administering this questionnaire, we're aiming to control for any potential confounding factors that could be contributing

530
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:54,210
to the rates of miscarriage and cancer that may not be from the ethylene oxide exposure.

531
00:59:54,620 --> 01:00:01,090
So some of the potential confounding variables are factors that we're aiming to control for for miscarriage.

532
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:07,340
We wanted to look at past medical history and family, family medical history as far as miscarriages,

533
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:15,139
because having a past miscarriage yourself or family members that have previously had miscarriages,

534
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,570
then you're at a higher risk of yourself having a miscarriage.

535
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:24,170
We also want to see if there's any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the miscarriages themselves.

536
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:29,930
And then, of course, drug and alcohol use we would like to ask you about in this questionnaire,

537
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:36,020
because, as you all know, high rates of drug and alcohol use definitely lead to miscarriages.

538
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:42,110
And then for cancer, we would like to look at the approximate time of cancer onset, if known.

539
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:50,149
Also looking at the family history of cancer, because having family history of cancer puts you at a higher risk.

540
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:53,360
It could be due to genetics rather than the exposure.

541
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,330
And then, of course, looking at rates of smoking.

542
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:04,070
And then for the question, you're just starting off with some demographic variables, just as most surveys do.

543
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:11,130
So just asking what gender do you identify as what is your age, what is your race and what is your ethnicity?

544
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:16,260
And then starting off with miscarriage for our potential confounding variables.

545
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:22,530
Again, looking at previous medical history, having previously had a miscarriage, the individual would answer, answered yes.

546
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:26,459
Then we would potentially think that this could be an underlying medical condition

547
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:33,120
that could be contributing to the miscarriage rather than the exposure. Same for is anybody in your family ever had a miscarriage?

548
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:34,770
We would definitely want to look at that as well.

549
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:43,080
And the individuals at any point during your pregnancy have used any of the following drugs marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine or opioids.

550
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:48,090
Just looking at drug use in general, that definitely put somebody at a higher risk of miscarriage.

551
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:56,340
And ideally, we would break this down even further by drug and ask you about different frequencies of how often they are taking these drugs.

552
01:01:56,580 --> 01:02:01,709
But just for the sake of time and just keeping it simple, we're just going to ask in general,

553
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:07,020
if they used it at any point in your pregnancy, did you consume an alcoholic beverage?

554
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:11,760
And then breaking that a little bit further down, he responded to that question with Yes,

555
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,630
approximately how often did you consume an alcoholic beverage per week?

556
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:21,480
So the good answer with 0 to 2 drinks per week. 3 to 5 or six plus drinks per week.

557
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:27,610
And then leading into cancer are some potential confounding variables.

558
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:32,610
Again, have you ever been diagnosed with cancer? We would like to look at the cost.

559
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:36,070
Medical history with cancer today of the history of cancer.

560
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:42,640
Or is it just by chance they have been diagnosed? And then if you have responded to that question with yes,

561
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:49,420
please specify what type of cancer we would like to look at the types of cancer that the individuals are being diagnosed with.

562
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:56,530
And if this could be potentially related to ethylene oxide exposure or if it may be a type of cancer that they could get from smoking,

563
01:02:56,530 --> 01:02:59,650
for example, or are they being diagnosed with lung cancer, for example?

564
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,820
Has anyone in your family ever been diagnosed with cancer?

565
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:10,370
So again, looking at the family medical history there, how recent was the onset of your cancer?

566
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:14,950
So, for example, if somebody had been diagnosed ten years ago with cancer,

567
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:21,400
but they had just recently moved in the neighborhood two years ago then we definitely want to contribute that to the ethylene oxide exposure.

568
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:29,410
And you have a history of smoking, yes or no? And then have you used tobacco or other forms of nicotine in the last five days?

569
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:37,000
So again, we could break this down even further, ideally, and ask what forms of nicotine are they consuming or using?

570
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:41,560
How often are they using? But for now, we're just leaving with this.

571
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:49,780
So Hayley and David already touched on the strengths, limitations and uncertainty over exposure assessment and again for our chosen method.

572
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:56,860
Yet it is validated methods recommended by the agents that helps us out there.

573
01:03:57,190 --> 01:04:01,620
It's simple using gas. There's a lightweight sampling method associated with it.

574
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,130
It's got a very low detection limit.

575
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:09,010
So especially for us who will get environmental exposure to this ethylene oxide, we should be able to pick it up here.

576
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:15,959
Our survey and exposures, exposure assessments, we can provide community members with some possible answers regarding their symptoms.

577
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:22,690
Their potential associated cancer can lead to do screening, early detection, improved treatment, their health outcomes level.

578
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:29,260
Location for our assessment. The Tier one funding method, the cost of sampling.

579
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:36,220
Of course, there's no stabilization, but guessing of the seasonal levels is a problem for low particle and exposure assessments.

580
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:42,219
And then we need to account for potential confounding factors and uncertainties like existing health problems,

581
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:46,600
drug and alcohol use influence for the countries on experiment on environmental exposures that

582
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:51,579
might affect what we're picking up by our sampling method and our standards and guidelines,

583
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:55,810
which you'll see in a minute, are based on exposures, not necessarily environmental exposures.

584
01:04:57,830 --> 01:05:01,250
So her uncertainty is the type of cancer being reported among community members.

585
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:05,580
Hopefully this questionnaire can help resolve that the cancer community is not.

586
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:13,760
This may not be associated with the adverse health effects of our exposure and the content of very strong character in our community.

587
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:19,690
Our survey questions are not police or subject to recall and reporting bias.

588
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:23,960
We might not be able to remove all of the uncertainty in that regard. We can remove some of it.

589
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:34,480
These are all guidelines. I personally thought it was interesting that the OHIP that used to be are the same, because that's not often the case.

590
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:43,650
The the EPA has the lowest it went two parts per billion. In terms of reducing exposure, we want to implement a hierarchy of controls.

591
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:50,650
So the preferred action would be replacing ethylene oxide in its entirety with an alternate chemical.

592
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:58,720
This might not be feasible because ethylene oxide is very effective for sterilization of Kirchhoff heat and moisture sensitive items.

593
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:06,040
So you might be able to remove most of it, but it's very likely that some of it in sterilization processes anyway.

594
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:12,310
Alternatively, we can implement engineering controls to reduce ethylene oxide emissions exposures to be irrelevant standard guidelines,

595
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,920
and those are occupational based on environmental space.

596
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:23,750
The CDC has storage and use guidelines for ethylene oxide and respirators, and OPV can help reduce occupational exposures.

597
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:35,230
Sources. The questions. All right.

598
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:40,060
State of Michigan, people in charge of keeping all questions.

599
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:49,649
Can you go back to the questionnaire slides the last one that you have.

600
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:56,520
And I'm just curious. Just pretending to be like a critic that's going to give me money.

601
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:04,540
So, like, if someone answered that, say, someone in their family had been diagnosed with cancer, what are you going to do with that information?

602
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:12,750
Is that so? I mean, you're going to just like assume that their family didn't also get exposed and get cancer.

603
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:20,430
How are you going to establish that? That means that person, that person's cancer is genetic versus associated with the exposure.

604
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:26,580
Yeah. So we could definitely look more into their family history of whether their they grew up in that neighborhood,

605
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:33,870
like if their parents had also been diagnosed with cancer to their parents, grew up in that surrounding neighborhood in Detroit as well.

606
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:39,060
Looking at the types of cancer also, were they diagnosed with a similar cancer?

607
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:43,680
Also asking if they gotten genetic testing previously with their cancer,

608
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:51,390
if they had gotten genetic testing and they did realize that that was possibly due to genetics, then we could contribute that further.

609
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:56,110
But also, there is just some uncertainty that we can't exactly always account for.

610
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:59,880
Yes. And so it's one of the limitations with the questionnaire as well.

611
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:11,830
Oh, just last group as well. My questions are about criticizing.

612
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:15,460
These are very tricky topics. And I just threw you out the deep end.

613
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:20,079
So I'm just. I'm just. Playing devil's advocate here.

614
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:25,510
But on the questioner, did you want to think about exposure factors as well?

615
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:29,800
What kind of exposure factors do you think would be important? Basketball.

616
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:36,630
Looks like. They spend their time indoors versus outdoors.

617
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:44,639
So yeah, we could definitely look at the exposure factors looking at where they spent the majority

618
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:51,900
of their time and how closely do they live predator wise to the exposure of interest.

619
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:57,390
Also, what is their occupation? Are they being exposed to their occupation as well as their?

620
01:08:57,810 --> 01:09:02,340
Are they located close to their own company from their occupation?

621
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:07,290
Are they being exposed that way also? So we definitely could have concluded that that would have.

622
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:14,790
Definitely made the questioner a little bit stronger. Did you find anything they endured?

623
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:18,940
So it's sort of an ambient airport in this case, right.

624
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:23,720
Do you think the windows and doors that connect residents would be the same as our borders here?

625
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:34,709
What kind of. Norse usually have filtering systems, but I don't know if they would capture that.

626
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:44,070
We know that it is harder than you would expect to find if an area is heavily concentrated and we know that you would expect to find them indoors.

627
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:56,420
Want to include in the testing as well, because everybody and I mentioned creating kind of the radio points around the area at residents homes,

628
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:06,160
so to say, would you're doing indoor testing? Questions.

629
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:17,190
I'm going to ask a question back here. You that you asked me earlier, how many samples you intake or how many points to get your radius map out?

630
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:21,240
I think if I were just going to start with for further sampling,

631
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:27,809
we just need to eliminate four corners or sides and then create the model base

632
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:34,350
of that and use the use of how the wind affects the models to form sample.

633
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:44,180
Any thoughts to turning your cooperation to the company on occupational skills?

634
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:50,389
Yeah, so I thought that that's probably the first thing we would do is ask if they would give us permission.

635
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:56,570
But a company that's, you know, a company that's looking out for their best interest because, you know,

636
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:05,129
so assuming that the CEO order was screened and then somehow that led to something like a warrant.

637
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:13,620
So for us to go in and we can then proceed to do an occupational exposure assessment using the, the, the method that the persons have.

638
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,920
Yeah. This is another scenario. This it's kind of full of irony.

639
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:27,890
Sunscreen is supposed to save you or me. This is a very critical chemical that's used to sterilize.

640
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:32,150
If they were to get rid of it, there would be massive disruptions to.

641
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:37,620
Health care. So another. That's a real life question.

642
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:45,220
All right. Thanks to the first two groups for braving the initial round here.

643
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:49,810
We have groups to and for Thursday and for people who shows up for classmates.

644
01:11:49,840 --> 01:12:02,020
I'll try to bring some more snacks. Based on the survey here, looks like cookies were moderately popular when arenas were more popular.

645
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:05,680
So we think that you can help yourself to someone one way of.

646
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:17,720
There's been. The job was never done.

647
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:30,160
But we have another project tomorrow. What do you have to tell me about it?

648
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:39,290
It's been a pleasure. By the way, did you do anything?

649
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:47,910
Well, I was like, okay.

650
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:53,500
Yeah. I'm just like, You all right?

651
01:12:56,030 --> 01:13:01,500
Yeah, I'll look at it. I just. I could have priority, you know, just seeing all this.

652
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:06,390
I got to ask you.

653
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:10,860
Oh. How do you feel? Do I have to?
