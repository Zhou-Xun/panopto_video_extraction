00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Okay, Good morning, everyone. let's get started. Hi saw you submitted the project, and also the quiz.

2
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And most of you did really well so i'll go over the quit.

3
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Briefly. before we start a new lecture.

4
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Any questions before we start

5
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Let's go over them, so the number one is I have collect a meeting level lab level household drinking water for every county in Michigan, so you can think about it.

6
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh, can't hear me I can hear you

7
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Are you just fine? Alright, Alright, thank you.

8
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Thank you, but let me know so the one you cannot hear me.

9
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm sorry, but you probably need to check your all you setting sorry for that.

10
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But you could, actually, I I believe you would turn on the subtitle to kind of actually see the transcription of my speech for the for the moment.

11
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So hopefully that'll help a little bit Okay, so this is the data type you think about for every county right there.

12
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I don't know 100 county there in Michigan and each one.

13
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We measure the meeting that level. So no matter how we measure that will be one number of each county, so that'll be a continuous management for each county.

14
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So let's now also compare them across the county so what kind of path should we use?

15
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And all of you did really well so I won't spend time on, you know asking you to to explain

16
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So essentially we have 50 county, each one has a continuous measurement and put them side by side.

17
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That'll be a bar plot right remember now we'll talk about Bar Pop Cloud.

18
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
2 variable one is a categorical, which is a county here.

19
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The other one is a continued which is the meet meeting that level here, and the other 3 are not right.

20
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Pistol, gram and pie chart is for one distribution.

21
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Okay, it's about 2 continuous variable so they're in different purposes.

22
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Question, too, for every company in Michigan. I have 2 quantity now for meeting that level, and how how to drinking water and the meeting household income.

23
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
How do we visualize? so now it's very clear we have 2 variable.

24
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Both are continued. if you want to plot the auto data.

25
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Then the gather path would be the one that applies the one to remember.

26
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
All the dials X and Y are 2 measurements will be the one to plot to continuous variable.

27
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If you really want to use bar or plot, what you can do is actually to group.

28
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Remember you can group the meeting hospital income into several men right?

29
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
The low income, main income, high income. Then you can use bar plan.

30
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So for the water that you have to use guidelines any questions.

31
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
They'll comment, I see some of you got the you know different answer.

32
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So. you have question or comment. You could let me know

33
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh, there are 2 variables, so it's not hitogram or pie chart.

34
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If you use bar plot, you need the first controller one continue variable into a categorical one.

35
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Our plot question 3. I have a database about 40,000 woman there for breast cancer in Michigan and past 5 years.

36
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I would like to visualize the distribution of age but it's very clear now.

37
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
We just care about one variable which is age I want to look at a distribution of that.

38
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So there are 2 platforms for distribution. Why, it's kit to ground line for Pi Chart.

39
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
A pie chart only shows distribution of pedagogical, variable, a historical ground potential.

40
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Both. So the answer is, people around here. Yeah. So so basically, all these questions are asking,

41
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Take a look at the number of variable and there's a type of their variable right, both you know, hopefully after yesterday's laptop.

42
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
This will become why we use. choose one person in the other.

43
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah, if you have any question, please stop me and let me know.

44
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And the remaining 3 questions are little there's a tweak here.

45
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'll be there a little bit more you know subjective or you know not really directly follow what the way talk is the day the number 4.

46
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Is that Examine the 2 plus here plot. a and B. and decide which response is below your most agree with.

47
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So let's look at the 2 Paths They both potted immunization in California.

48
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
King of Arden, the entire state o'clock you you know when I'm here, the Apollo is always read the the app, and why access here?

49
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The actors like time right a year. The why is the percent of incomplete demonization?

50
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So this is con 2 continuous variable but if it's it's different from you, know.

51
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Other type of variable in the sense at the time. The year is sort of a time course, right?

52
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So naturally we want to order them, by time that's Why, we don't use gather plots for this kind of data, although it's 2 continuous variable, because the time the year is already naturally ordered so put

53
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
them in order. will, will, you know, reply the most of the information, because you want to see the trend right?

54
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So this kind of a blind plop really convenient for the time time course data.

55
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So both are plotting the same data. But the the the choice of their y-axis, and you know the way they choose that that's different.

56
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So I don't know whether this is too small and let me make it bigger.

57
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So the first difference is that in this plot, you know.

58
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
There is a dot for everything called data point in single year. Right?

59
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So I guess they have data point for each year. but they don't have data point in the middle of the year, so they just use wise to connect them.

60
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
This one doesn't I would say This is more of a cosmetic sort of different either way.

61
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I think they show the tramp, but this way you probably can see the every year.

62
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
They look rather I would say, this one looks simpler, and then, and neither right cleaner.

63
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So look prettier. so I I would say each one has pros and counts.

64
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I wouldn't say which one, it's either personal accurate for this one, you know, without a dog, for the main problem happening in the Y-axis.

65
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You see here the y-axis go from 6% to 10%.

66
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I guess that's the range of their data right So the lowest, maybe actually low, is the 7% the highest.

67
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's about 10% 9 point something per cent. So they constrained the range from 6 to 10.

68
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Some people do that. but I will talk about Why, that's not a good idea, and then down here they go from 0 to 10%.

69
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So every once you make about visualization we'll have proton counts right.

70
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
So the the pros of this one is that it? really shows you the change across the time.

71
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So you can easily see. You know the subtle changes right from say, from here to here, right?

72
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The change is more exaggerated than the change from here to here.

73
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But the downside is that I meet lead the the reader, right? Most people don't really pay that much attention to the exact number on the y-axis.

74
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:41,000
They look at the bigger like for 30 s they got the Oh, there's a huge change from the Oh, forward to you know, 2013 by the change, you know, if you look at this the change thing to be dramatic right even go up for 2

75
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:52,000
times more. But the real changes from like a 7 point, 5% to 10% is like 20% change or 30% change.

76
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So this this plot a you had the have the danger of me mislead the the reader in pinking that you know the changes bigger than you at actually what?

77
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So I think it's up to that proper probably is better so I unless you really have a strong reason a reason to change to choose the you know the starting point not at 0.

78
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You should true that 0. So, for example, if you plot the human height right though if you don't, you know, start on 0, then the the line will be 2 per sort of a flat that may not be the best use of your right you could start

79
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:37,000
with something out. but when you when you don't start your access from 0, you're better mention it in the food null, and the bigger thing, you know.

80
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Be careful by note. The Y access does not start on 0, because most people assume they start on 0.

81
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So given that argument, I know you may or not, may not buy it.

82
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But using that argument, the answer is is for because I chose B because the y-axis starts on 0, and that's almost the mile to change right mild increase.

83
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
If you look at a you might think there's a dramatic change.

84
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:13,000
But that's not the true. So we first passed pair about whether the bigger reflects the data, and the underlying information from the data no more or less.

85
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Exactly what the data is saying. Right? other things. You know how. What color are your truths? What kind of blind have you to that secondary?

86
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Any comment here. I think most of you agree with me.

87
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But some of you might have other opinions

88
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Let's go down here similarly this one is a little bit the subjective this week shows the gandhi Gandhi in Florida again across year.

89
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:03,000
That's why they use the line graph right well. this one. I think it probably come from some manufacturing, because you know the caller at home with very very dramatic, but nevertheless, those are secondary, like I talk about

90
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:15,000
right. So here they show the number of murder immediately using firearms in Florida across time, and also them. They point out one year, which is 2,005, which is the exact year in Florida.

91
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You make the stand your ground law I think They this is a It's a article about you know about this law whether the law will make it changing the number of that right?

92
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It seems like an apple law is going down But if you'll pay a closer attention to the Y-axis, you would see.

93
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Actually that's not the case, because the y-axis actually start from 0.

94
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And actually, when you go down is actually going going larger. So it seems like, the mother called down, here.

95
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Are you looking at the number after it goes on so now, you probably realize that's a bigger.

96
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You should much bigger easily. I could if if you don't say or you don't emphasize people.

97
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
We just assume, you know the y access goes naturally like this one right when you go up.

98
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's going larger when you go down it's going lower But the author here they flip the the the the water right going down.

99
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's actually going higher going off it's like going lower that's very counterintuitive very much meeting.

100
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So that's a number one problem I have with this video So if you look at the other choices it will say the wire value is in the wrong direction.

101
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Exactly that's the one I would pick that's a that's a bigger issue.

102
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I don't like the caller call maybe they chose this color to mimic the blog right because it's about that.

103
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But you know, is their choice. I don't really like it but the news newspaper audience.

104
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It may or may not work better that's not a big issue, the biggest.

105
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Usually I have to pick one. I will take the y-axis, and then the Y-axis increments are too big.

106
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I don't the access to do not specify each year. I think, though, yeah, those can be improved by the the the biggest issue with the the direction of y access.

107
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:07,000
If I have to pick one i'll take this one any comment

108
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Yeah, you all did pretty well, just like, except for a couple of students.

109
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And let's look at a very lost one this one I think it's all thing don't I don't know what happened.

110
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:28,000
But oh, anyway, this why is the hardest, I think, because the multiple choice, right audible toys is always always part.

111
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So I think you all of you did really well so this one shows again.

112
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's a live graph with you know time course on I execute y course on the measurement which is the price.

113
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I guess it's a percent of people who are obese That's my guess, right.

114
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But it would be bad that you say. Pile it out, Then this are different.

115
00:22:48,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Caller Age group, we see that the the 45 to 64 years old group as the highest percent of obesity by followed by a 30 to 44 as well as 65 years and older and the younger group

116
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
had the lowest Ovcp and the low fat guidelines here.

117
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Maybe that's the time when the low tab try the line, you know, com file, but part of that actually the percent of ops actually increase after that guideline

118
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So, and then there's a time. cost here. right so there are many way. This figure can be improved, but I think they they show the information without much misleading, but I think it's it's better than the previous 2

119
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
parts. here is a The title Obese is not the specific.

120
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah, it could be better right. It could be you know percent of obesity, or you know something like that in particular state, or or i'll i'll i'll see the political study.

121
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So I value an offense system space yeah I mean it doesn't look good, Right?

122
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Why do they take this intervals right which are it's irregular.

123
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Maybe there's some reason, but despite that that was no regular space interval.

124
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Well, those are secondary, like I said it doesn't meet feed people. And the why access label percent is not specific, just like the title.

125
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yeah, they could say the percent obesity that's much about I mean you just right percent. Nobody really know what's going.

126
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It is finally a python would have been a better way to display the data which is just not a case right?

127
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
The high chart can only show one histogram about one distribution of categorical variable.

128
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
It doesn't apply here here. We have continued We have 4 of them right? And it's not a distribution. right?

129
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's a time court data for the last one do not apply. But the other 3, I think they make sense.

130
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Given. This is the multiple choice. the 3 are the 3 are

131
00:24:49,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So I have to say you are you know vast majority of you did really well on this path, and the latest has actually, similar. some of my I think they're they're

132
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
they're even easier in the sense that they are less subjective.

133
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
But nevertheless, you know I think the key here is, you know, for it to try.

134
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
What you're learning in lecture yesterday you know go to answer this kind of question.

135
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I think it did really Well, i'm very glad we'll see that so any any question i'll comment people I I move on to a new lecture

136
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Yeah on the phone. You know, this is the middle of the week.

137
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And sorry already in the morning. we all little bit higher.

138
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
But that's fine. you know just sit back and

139
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Yeah it's also here. I think that's that's great that's move on a little smaller

140
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Summary. Remember that the first lecture we talked about the overview of the whole, the physical inference that hosts the physical analysis.

141
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Starting from the validate on the data format study design, you know, and also visualization and summary.

142
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And you know inference. right. So yesterday we go deep into the visualization part.

143
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Today we go. Dp: on another step, which is the data summary.

144
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So the key is that again, the raw data usually coming in the table, which has many rolls and columns.

145
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
The numbers are there, you know you you can get them, which is very accurate. But the rod that is not a good picture of.

146
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You know how the data really look like right? Because we want to summarize data some way to interpret that.

147
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So. besides, speaker figures is definitely, very, very useful.

148
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I would always recommend you to plot the data in different ways to understand how they are distributed right other besides the figure.

149
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
The second one is a summary statistic, basically different way to up civilize the data into one.

150
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Or you know, a final number of twice as a number where you can capture the the the picture right, for example.

151
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
You want to know where the center of the distribution is, where the spread of the disagree is, or other things.

152
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Maybe so today we've got to talk about how to reclamize in particularly.

153
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
We talk about the most commonly way of dominating data in location of. we already talk about this a little bit in.

154
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:37,000
They want will be a little popular here, and I may have some time later on to make some plots, so make some drawing

155
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So there are 2 sub lecture, but both are very far

156
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So summary statistical location. So location, we mean, basically, where most of the data live. right?

157
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
If you have distribution where it's a center right that kind of thing.

158
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
But then we will talk about. How do we do it again?

159
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
The rawders are there for your panelists.

160
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
We have your spreadsheet. you can use the the tool software, right?

161
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:22,000
They are good for stating raw data, but we are not, you know human brain are not very good of understanding why there's just too many numbers there, But we want to summarize data into pure one number So that we can decide we can we

162
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:33,000
can they're at and you know think about what they mean So collapsing while it a bunch of you know raw data into a single value of better value that make them easier than the time.

163
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It's it's a typical way we're doing statistics actually, that's where the the terms that come from.

164
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So those summary values from the wallet. the calculus on the body that we call them statistics.

165
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So that's exactly where the world comes. from Okay, and Then we can use statistic to to measure different quantities different feature of the data.

166
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And so there are a different kind of statistic right? So usually we measure the so called signal annoyed, or is basically the quality of interest and uncertainty around that quantity of interest.

167
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
So this 2 points are more important, and then we can use this.

168
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
The statistical to make inference right. I will talk about later on about the sampling design.

169
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:17,000
So the inference. it's really the inference of interest it's really about the population underlying the bomb.

170
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So usually we're under the data the data come from the phone right?

171
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:29,000
But the sum will come from a population of interest by the population's usually too big or inconvenient, or too costly for measure as a whole.

172
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So we draw a sample. we'll talk about that later. So basically we take the data for trying to make a more general infant or conclusion about the population where the sample come from.

173
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Came from. and then there are many physical tools to add in those characteristics.

174
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
We'll go over this cycle again, you know you know later.

175
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Lecture that's here just give you a head of What's gonna later on.

176
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Okay, So the number one statistic we want to measure about the distribution.

177
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
When we, when we talk about the distribution, we talk about one variable right.

178
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
The distribution is the location of the distribution by location where it could be.

179
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
The mean could be in the mode, or you know any anything.

180
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
So there are many different statistics. the number one we use is a sample mean.

181
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:18,000
We'll talk about that right means. it's essentially the average right? You take all the measurements from all the observations, and divided by the total number.

182
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
In this case we will affect one plot back to all the way to black accent and divided by N.

183
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And the final answer You can call the sample me it's called X.

184
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Bar. I mean even this simple formula can have come play many different forms, Right?

185
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:41,000
For example, if access hide, you have to decide whether you want to measure any to be tumble, centimeter, or inches, or other things right?

186
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So different units, different measurements can give you a different expon.

187
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So we want our conclusion to be sort of independent with the unit of measurement.

188
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Right. so we'll talk about later on how do we do that.

189
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
But all you can think about is the this: acts are numbers right When you add them up.

190
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
You know you have to think about there as a unit of the measurement and a lot of times.

191
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Not only we can change the unit management, we can also do transformation right?

192
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Some. some of the things are make more sense to imagine them in your log scale or square root of pale other scales.

193
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Right. So this could be, you know, after some transformation, or after some data transformation or cleaning, so on, so forth.

194
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
So this may not be the very, very raw data, but these are the data of interest, the format and the unit.

195
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
That you are interesting. So the sample mean pretty much measured.

196
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:34,000
The I would say the center of the distribution, but quote on Call center, because later we have another quantity meeting. measure.

197
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:43,000
The the vendor even patent. Okay. so sample sample Me, i'll talk about later to actually measure the the the center of the math of the distribution. Now read the center of the location.

198
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:52,000
The distribution. So just as I, as example, right the pulse I I collect, I design a study and collect data that like this: right?

199
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I randomly take 7 of you in the class, and ask you how many attacks you send yesterday.

200
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And I got the following response: It would tell me these on the number of Texas.

201
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Then I bad. This is the overestimate of our cost. but you know, if you do it in high school, probably that will be under estimate.

202
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,000
But anyway, so computer sample means just add them together, divided by 7, which is 28. right?

203
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
This is definitely you can do by hand but you shouldn't be thinking of doing it by hand.

204
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
You know, in this course, because in reality you could have, like a 500 right 500.

205
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Now 7, right? So using any file product like cell or or or physical software, So I will show you one.

206
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You know how to do it in excel for those of you in Alpha Meter.

207
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But you know many of the the spreadsheet excel. We're all the providers can do this, but I just show you in general how can do this kind of a analysis without using a calculator.

208
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So let me copy this data. I think i'm sharing this right?

209
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
So if you put your data here, i'll leave it doesn't look very good.

210
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I'll i'll just have some dong here, Okay.

211
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:17,000
34, 2926, 40, 1921 25.

212
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And then you do the first one. So what you can do is now is that

213
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
You can pay. You want to pay for the average here, right?

214
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:46,000
What you can do is just type equal. Outreach this one and then the last, you know, once you type the the parameters, and you can select this whole thing and then close it off.

215
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So now we've got to have It so essentially the function You just have the average from a 2 to 8.

216
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
This is a 2. This is Aa right. You can also type a 2 calling a A that will give you the same thing.

217
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So this will be the average. So many of the excel brushes are, you know, using this course?

218
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Art on or made using this kind of a functions, and you know functionality of excel.

219
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
They can also compute standard deviation, a medium and anything.

220
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Okay, So Excel has, pretty much all the basic statistical functionality included in there.

221
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So basically you know that you know that's why we use it? Okay, So the question is, once we summarize 28, right?

222
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
28 somehow lies in the middle of this. This have a number.

223
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:40,000
It depends on how we talk about metal or center so let's say, from this data I make the claim that the average graduate student in United States and 28 packs a day.

224
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,000
What do you think of this client? right? can I make the kind of plane or not?

225
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I don't think so, because the sample sample size would be too small.

226
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
That's that's true yeah that's too small.

227
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Any other reason.

228
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Sorry. Sorry you can take her

229
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I was I was about to say about the representatives of the sample might not represent nationwide. So you might not be able to extrapolate to that wonderful Yeah, perfect Yeah, Yeah, I think that that

230
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
That's a even bigger problem here. someone else Rachel or Iraq.

231
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I was gonna say the same thing if you've only simple people in one class.

232
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It may not be representative. Yeah, thank you. And this is, you have something to add.

233
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Yeah, I think this is just one day, but from from a long term. but you can be divided to 2 semesters and the vacation.

234
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:09,000
So it should be also considered from a temporal point.

235
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Yeah, I I agree with all of you. So So this is a sample. right?

236
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
This sample draw from some sort of a population of infrared.

237
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:31,000
So these come from some graduate. so whatever you learn here will be representative for

238
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Yeah, I mean someone typing the chat about saying the power is not sufficient example size of 7.

239
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So yeah, I totally agree. So there are basically 2 problems, Right?

240
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
One is that the sample is too small, by, you know.

241
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Small largest relative, but with the sample size of 7.

242
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:57,000
This estimate will not be very accurate. Right? Go up when you know, when you create sample size that may will be closer and closer to the comedy you want to add them. in But the second, problem.

243
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I think, is a bigger problem. Is the representative in this right?

244
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So this probably come from one cloud how representative that cost you Think about the whole us.

245
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:14,000
But I think it's not much right because you know different types of hybrid school, different type of class different states.

246
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:22,000
They might have very different right. So So the better way to design a study to sample different schools across the Us.

247
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:30,000
If you sample 50 schools across the us and you which school you take you know, 50 students, although that's not a whole lot bigger.

248
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Tumble 5. Actually, that would be much better.

249
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So so you can think about this right? So every year I mean every year or every 4 years before the election, there will be a lot of post running for the election right?

250
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
They predict which candidates you know we'll be when there and so on.

251
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So forth, for those kind of posts. they don't really have a very big sample size, but usually their sample guys are in 1,000.

252
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Okay, you're in tens of thousands that will be even better, but usually at least 1,000.

253
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
So we'll talk about later. actually to to so you must study the whole Us.

254
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Population which has like a over 300 meetings. people you you need like thousands of data points, and some of those of like a 1,000 will get a pretty good atom a pretty good estimate.

255
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:29,000
So some of us need is not that big? But although you cannot be 7, but the bigger problem is that you, you know, to run a poll ongo on the you know, national level pricing for election, you need to have sample being represented in the sense you need to cover all different

256
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
States, all different age groups, gender, racial, you know, education level.

257
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You need to cover all the all the population there right if you only sample Michigan, no matter how big it sample that you have, you cannot possibly call over the the the situation.

258
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Other thing bacteria right? i'll talk about later on about the study design and pumping.

259
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
But I just want to give you a heads up so during the sample is actually by itself.

260
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
It's called a study design or sampling it's actually by itself.

261
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
It's a course you have to take to 40 on a time not on both of it.

262
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Okay, thank you. So supposedly, I now collect another sample of 5 7.

263
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
So I repeat my study because it's cheap right Then I compute another average.

264
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:21,000
It turned out also to be 28. So look at this type of number.

265
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:28,000
There it for like 5 s. I look at it set up number both has a mean that 20 again.

266
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So if I don't tell you the raw data you're probably think there was the same.

267
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:46,000
But now i'm asking you in which sample to sample me better summarize the data, and why first 20 got Let's take a raw valley.

268
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Maybe you go first. and yeah, yeah, I think it's somewhere.

269
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
First one, because those these simple numbers are quite to the mean.

270
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:05,000
The second one r we call. I think you should look.

271
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I think you should look at the standard deviation of the sample to see like which of these have the lower standard deviation on the higher.

272
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I mean in this the the higher point is 50, and the maximum of 62 honestly 62.

273
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
The data is more widely spread out. come back to the first one.

274
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,000
So I think the first one is I totally agree with both of you.

275
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Yeah, essentially, I think we think the funny aid is better representative here, because the number of closers or 28 by all of the other, not the same.

276
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:46,000
But there are 26, point, 7, 29. But here you have, like a thing like 3 or 62 or 50, which are far away from 20.

277
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:54,000
8. right? So in this sense, you know how in Josh tell us, 20 is a better representation of this data than this one.

278
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
But yeah, later on we can computerize the deviation to see the second day of that has it larger spread.

279
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
So, which means the first day the size tighter. the second one is you know, more more and more.

280
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Spread it right? So now let's move on so the the mean definitely?

281
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
How about something about the location or center or metal point of the distribution?

282
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Right. We got that intuition. But there are other measurements like the metal, like the medium.

283
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:30,000
So the meeting is left. Youth standard means for many good reasons, but also has its strength, which I will compare them later on.

284
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:41,000
So the mean me, the median is also measures. The middle or center of the distribution by the meeting is called also called the 50% towel.

285
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
So there present, how from first person tales with a 99 person tell right.

286
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I got. You guys are very familiar with this already because you know you know, when when my case was born, I every time to do a annual, you know, physical checkup, they matter the highest on the weight on give the person's out right

287
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:06,000
so he signed with the person Tell tells you how many people in the population of below your unit measurement and or versus above you. Right?

288
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:15,000
So the meeting is the 50%. How means that 50% of people in the population or below you in this particular measurement?

289
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:26,000
So in this particular case, for the first example, right to calculate the meeting, We just need to order the data from the the smallest to the larger. And then find the middle point. right?

290
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
There are 7 data points, or the middle point will be the fourth largest or smallest tompo.

291
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So, for the first day of the meeting is 27 for the second data set of meeting 17.

292
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
So now we meeting it Either the median does not equal to the mean right?

293
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
So the 2 days that both have me in the 20 eighth.

294
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:57,000
But the meeting are different, and they are quite different right so both me and the media are measuring the center or the metal, but they could give you a different number. But we'll talk about why later on, and talk about which one might be a

295
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
better priority organization that this should be, Yeah, reach Kate.

296
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Okay. Yeah. If you have a question, please let me know.

297
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
By this definition right? The meeting is always in the middle of the data depending on how to define metal right.

298
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:29,000
An immune is not as authority in the middle but I mean it's more widely you first of because you know, people just understand me, and bad right.

299
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You can talk about average, I think you understand in elementary school. the median probably a little later, and also mean it's much easier to compute, probably just add opting.

300
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And then average right for meeting. I have to order them all.

301
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Their things are much harder than average thing, you know, if you do it by hand.

302
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:53,000
But you use your computer. that makes no difference. So the different well, sometimes me and the meeting are really close to each other like this case.

303
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
2728, I I bet you do you don't think there's some much different.

304
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
But sometimes they are, they are quite different. and in this case right?

305
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
So whether me on the meeting are called to each other, depend on the distribution.

306
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,000
So in in symmetric distribution. me on the meeting are almost the same.

307
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Actually you know in the distribution wise if it's perfect it's a metric. Then they are not exactly the same hold on a second.

308
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I will log in my my ipad, so that I can draw on the screen

309
00:44:43,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Hopefully, this works. So for distribution, right

310
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Part of

311
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
A wide board

312
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:29,000
How do I sorry?

313
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Okay here, got it finally got it. Okay, Sorry about that for this distribution. If it's the magic then both of me on the meeting will be here

314
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
And also In this case there is something called the mode, which is also be here.

315
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:57,000
The moment is the highest point of the distribution by the distribution is asymmetric like this.

316
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Then the meeting will be here. The meanwhile probably be here, and the mode will be here.

317
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Oh, they do not overlap so for symmetric distribution.

318
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:18,000
The mean, the media and the mode always pretty much hallway are the fame. So for asymmetric one, they probably have different values.

319
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:28,000
That's number one, and number 2 the mode measures the i'll talk about the mold per the mode measures the highest point, but it the high point may not as a third to be the center unless the distribution is

320
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
sort of the symmetric embellishing. right.

321
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:42,000
So even there are cases. you know they're a multi mode right then. the mode is not even defined in 3 months there. So that's why we don't cover mode Yeah, the camera right?

322
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Now that's why we don't cover mode that much in this cloud.

323
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So me on the median supposed to cover this assignment, but they call a different kind of center.

324
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:01,000
The median is a standard in the sense that, the area under the curve on both sides or 50%.

325
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:08,000
So this is 50 per time. This is 50%. and for the Median meeting the this one supportee.

326
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So this will be 50% of the area, and this one will be 50%.

327
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
So the media has this property. The area under the curve on both sides of the meeting is always 50%.

328
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:28,000
So in this case you would say no. What the mean is measuring the mean is also somehow the the center right?

329
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:35,000
What is the measure? So it turned out that the mean is mattering the the center of the map.

330
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So what do I mean by sign over the map? Let me clear off Because I don't have enough space.

331
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:47,000
So you have a distribution like this and this. Suppose you you you called it up at 0 right?

332
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And then you you cut it out. Use the cop, you know.

333
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Do the paper right piece of paper and then you you make this straight, and then you you put the piece of paper, you know supporting point, and then it will balance.

334
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:21,000
It will not tip one way or the other and this turned out to be exactly the mean.

335
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:28,000
So it's a center it's also the center about the center of the map

336
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:35,000
So you can imagine if it's a of the math if you still remember middle school sort of a you know high school physics right?

337
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
So if this tail, instead stretch much longer, you know.

338
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Here, then, the me and will be dragged here right the mean actually goes with the tail, which tail those longer. the mean will be dragged along by the tail a little bit, because the center of the map or you want to balance the

339
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
whole whole weight. But the meeting is not a packing right.

340
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,000
If this part is 50%, then the medium will always be here, regardless.

341
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
How long the tail is could be sure could be long it doesn't matter, because the air is always 60%.

342
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Oh, 50%,

343
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Yeah, I hope that health Any questions so far

344
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Okay. So once we understand the different Oh, there is something in the chat.

345
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Okay, Yeah, Me ask me to take off my

346
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Is it working now

347
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Yes, cool. thanks. yeah. time you let me know my mind my kids just left home.

348
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:05,000
So it's appropriate timing for me to take my to take all my year from So once you know the difference.

349
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
The me and the media are measuring right. You will see their behavior.

350
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:20,000
The mean is measuring this fewness right, in fact, about a few minutes of the the biscuits we mean when they are asymmetric, which way they which way the payoffs.

351
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:33,000
So trash, father, right? And also those are sort of a affected by the all I want to meet here. The value are much smaller or larger than the less of the data.

352
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Right. all the tail right? If you if you pull out all you know there's a long tail Sometimes the all aircraft is the pay, or the tail will determine the skewings and then everything will

353
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
determine the mean. The mean is pulled toward the tail.

354
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:52,000
All the meetings now. Okay, So in that sense, if you have highly skilled distribution, you have outliers.

355
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
The mean will be very sensitive to them. You may not cost cost troubles.

356
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:09,000
So there are 2 type of students. One is skilled to the right. Basically, there's a pay on the right hand side stretch very further away, and in that case the meal will be pulled to the right hand. side.

357
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Not a medium, I mean it will be part of that meeting.

358
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:22,000
You know the opposite, vice. versa right there's a last skill distribution. The tail to the left and the mean will be smaller than you need, so that's the difference between the 2.

359
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:34,000
So for symmetric or near this metric to be this 2 do not make much difference. You can take either one, and we use meme most of the time because it's easier to compute and ask them and make inference on right but for high

360
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
school distribution. You do think about what the meeting meeting is a bad idea.

361
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:47,000
But in this course we prep dominant and use me because you know the i'll talk about later.

362
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
What right? But just so. no meeting is also a quality that is of interest.

363
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:03,000
So in this particular distribution. it is Hitherto ram that shows the plot lab level measuring Detroit children or age. it's a histogram. Therefore the Y access is the density.

364
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:10,000
All the percent of people enough people are bar the wire of the access that's on the ball that level.

365
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So for many measurements, could you number hide on the weight? when we measure the population, we might see a a bowl shape, which the normal distribution later up.

366
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:31,000
But for all the bathroom of the microsoft different shape for example, this one, it's not valuable shape anymore. It's sort of a highly skilled right.

367
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:39,000
There's a long tail, to the right-hand side of that with the left hand side, which is natural, because you know, the average is very, very close to, 0 and the 0 is the boundary right?

368
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
You cannot have a measurement of blob, which is negative.

369
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:50,000
So by definition, you're not going to have a left tail, or you could have a right hand. So that causes to distribution.

370
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So in this case it turned out at the end of this value is 7 7 point.

371
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,000
1, 2 is right here. So the question is that where do you think the medium Id is larger than 7?

372
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Point one to a smaller. I I think the medium will be smaller than the mean.

373
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,000
It will be between 0 and 7. point 2, 1, 2, yeah, smaller.

374
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Yeah, because the meal will be dragged by the tail to the right hand side. Another meeting. Yeah.

375
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Thank you very much

376
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Okay. Hmm: Yeah, i'm just a minor thing it doesn't really matter that much for the meetings very useful computer. When you have all number of observation, you just order them take a minute. one right?

377
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
We have even number the middle one you know doesn't have a unique middle one.

378
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So what you do by convention is, take the middle 2 and average them.

379
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
But this is very, very man of mine right when you'll have like a 500 number.

380
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
It doesn't really make that much difference. Okay, so I also talk about.

381
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:08,000
If the data that you're doing is the match and the media and the are the same, and the manual distribution we will talk about in this course are sort of normally shaped. Therefore it doesn't really matter meeting I mean so

382
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
we use meeting for convenience, and then a lot of mice are organized by property.

383
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
But when your distribution is highly skewed, you need to think about

384
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
What? what the meeting? Why might give you? They might give you a different conclusion.

385
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Okay, So how do you do this with categorical data?

386
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I remember, when you when you you have corporate data.

387
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
You cannot do me in a meeting, but if you really want to do, you have to convert them into New York.

388
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Right, for example, assigning of a number, because I mean this case measuring the paradigmal house, You give them 1, 2, 3, 4, plus.

389
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
You give them 1, 2, 3, 4, you can compute the mean or medium right?

390
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:58,000
So in the particular case, this data set we have 100 subjects, and 10 of them got a score of 1, 23 got a 2, and so on, and so forth.

391
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:07,000
You kind of copy the mean of these 100 numbers, and you got a 2.9 which is the fault close to 3 about here.

392
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So, which means the average parallel downhill. health score is 2.9, so I need last 9 3.

393
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
But the problem again, converting kind of garbage data.

394
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Who to continuous data is that it's hard for me? perpetual right?

395
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
What does 2.9 really mean? That means pretty much through right.

396
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,000
That means the average health of this population is a mile, but it just.

397
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
It just married hard to to interpret. Because why do you do?

398
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,000
1, 2, 3, 4, in the first place, right? Maybe I think this one is too severe, and I want to give you a 5.

399
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Then the being will also change right so there's some arbitraryness in the assignment of schools.

400
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:58,000
So that's that right in general. it's better to analyze the kind of garbage with data that's kind of grow up the data we've all But But now the last you know you still could cover them Yeah, i'm

401
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
just

402
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Okay. Yeah. So so exactly. you think about right? The mean is very good.

403
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,000
At the symmetric that you the median is good for high school distribution.

404
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:29,000
No, I want. I want, you know, some of you to to give us some example which we, where you think the distribution, you know, tell us what kind of measurement, what kind of variable we are interested, and then what kind of distributions it might

405
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:39,000
be some magic. I know it. part of our is. imagine. so what kind of matter we would think might be some metric, how hard to talk about like hive and lick right?

406
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:46,000
But could you give more examples?

407
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Could one be grades? Great: Yeah. Yeah, I think that depends right.

408
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I mean in principle grades are supposed to be normally distributed.

409
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
That's the best in reality. they May not be easily curved, though that's a good point.

410
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Yeah, Any other examples?

411
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I think if you would plot age again, and employment, during like lifetime, it would be normal distributed, because, like the first 18 years or 25 years, you won't have a job, and then you retire after

412
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:29,000
65 until 85. so it will be like centered, I guess.

413
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. So you can actually see later on, almost all.

414
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
So. most of the measurements, you know alive are sort of a normal disability. for very good reason.

415
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,000
The expected biological traits. Right? You measure blood pressure, you know, many things like those.

416
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Usually they are, they're roughly not perfect but roughly moment is distributed.

417
00:57:51,000 --> 00:58:18,000
So. Now let's come up with some example which are high as skilled so definitely not symmetric a highly skilled Do you have some existing

418
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Would one be like I don't know like hard to these i'm go singing occurs in older in the older population.

419
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I mean there's solar cars and younger populations as well. but like would that be scared?

420
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:43,000
You mean the the outside of the heart disease? yeah yeah yeah Yeah, I think that'll be the same as you know.

421
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:54,000
You could talk about the yeah, maybe the you know all sorts of things like cancer or other things as well.

422
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Right. i'll also the the age I mean the the time to death. right?

423
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I I think there will be a tail very thin, but you know, stretch all the way.

424
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:24,000
But yeah, yeah, are there any other examples?

425
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
So. so I think 1 one kind of so most of the biological trades in not all they are.

426
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
They're not gonna determine no I want to distribute it.

427
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:41,000
For for reason we talk about it is actually central in the theorem, but most of those many of the you know, socioeconomic trade.

428
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
They are highly skilled, especially things to do with like a money.

429
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
For example, the housing price to help the price of house right.

430
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Most of them will be like, you know. Here will be like, 200,000 300,000 400,000 right.

431
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
But if you look at a higher end there will be like 3 million 4,000,010 meeting. right?

432
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:05,000
So things to do with money. Usually I have a very long, right tale or income, right?

433
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
If you look at the income, there are very few people, but they their income is very high on their personal asset.

434
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,000
It's very, very high, right so most of the people in the country probably earn like a 100,000.

435
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:22,000
You know, 70,000 a year. but there are people earning like a billions a year. right?

436
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:31,000
So things to do with money usually has a very long tail. and the reason is because you know that just do not follow the the central limit, theorem, which is, how about later on.

437
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:42,000
So. But if you'll take the log of those measurements they will be more like a normal visibility. that's because you know things biologically, for example, Oh, hi!

438
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Our heart is the determined by hundreds, if not thousands, of genetic traits.

439
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,000
And you know, environmental vendors right? Each one has a very small impact.

440
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:58,000
But will you add them to gather? they sort of cancel out on average human height will be normal distributed, and that applies to all of a lot of the places.

441
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,000
But them to do is money for novel, your your your your personal asset, right? that could grow exponentially right.

442
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
So basically the difficulty for you to go from like a 100,000 to a 1 million.

443
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:14,000
It's probably the same that's from a meeting to time meeting to a 100 meeting right?

444
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:21,000
So that's why some people they can they can you know accumulate their asset to like a billions right without not much trouble.

445
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:29,000
So on that kind of So basically the underlying mechanism of how how this number are gathered up there, and that's why they have different distribution.

446
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
So the for the rest of the you know few minutes.

447
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I I want to talk about it. You know a a joke.

448
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I may not. Of all the friend I had a friend who used to be a professor, a math professor.

449
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I don't have a few years it's somehow that we're trying to get a you know different. job.

450
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
So he applied to a lost rate, firm as a qualitative analyst.

451
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
So you know he was very smart, so he did a interview kind of offer.

452
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
The the parties is the is in Manhattan, New York, right?

453
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:09,000
And then, once we got the offer, he was kind of a surprise to see that the the the salary was not that much higher than than his Mac Professor Salary right, he thought.

454
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
People are lost with her, like, you know, meetings of dollars.

455
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
But based out of it. So he caught his future. Boston.

456
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:22,000
You know this money is not. this hour is not so high, so how can I afford the living cost in in Manhattan?

457
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Right, his boss saying, You know don't be silly people are Wall Street.

458
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Don't read the D one based salary but we have A.

459
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:39,000
We have a, you know, year and bonus, which is like 3, 3 times bigger, your lying on salary, for example, if your salary is a 100,000, then you know, the average phone is like 3,000 300,000 300,000 a

460
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
year. Right? so so those are the real one now. He was very satisfied.

461
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:49,000
He moved to New York right, and then, after like a 6 month, he got a year and bonus.

462
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:57,000
But he was in shock again. The bonus was only 30,000. It's a It's a very very good number, you know.

463
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Do people like off. But to him it's a it's a shock, because, you know, he was thinking about things like at least 100,000, though all more right.

464
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
So again he called his boss boss, saying, What? Why, is hello?

465
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Right. so his boss reply, all those people are smart. So 3 boss reply, First of all, you're only here for 6 months. right?

466
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:21,000
So. So you're not supposed to get a very high homeless second thing is that the 300,000 is it's average.

467
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Some of us got like a 3 meeting so so that that's the thing you know this is a made up, Joke, but I I really had a friend.

468
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Have this experience right? The numbers are made up. so the idea is that the year on bonus is not.

469
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:48,000
It's not normally difficult. so although the the average right when he's passed out of me, and he's 300,000, but because some people got premium that some people got 30,000 you see what's going on because you

470
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
know, because it's to do with money not normally distributed.

471
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:59,000
So my take home message for you is that is this, unfortunately, that my friend is a math professor now the statistic professor.

472
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Otherwise, you know he could. He should have thought about this. And, you know, asked about the medium of the all of rather than the mean.

473
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Okay, this is this is a job, right? The number? I made it off.

474
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:17,000
You know I really had a friend like this alright Let's take a break, and the come back in 10 min.

475
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Thank you.

476
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Okay, I think now that's continue so so I want to point out, you know, in my experience, whenever I I started talking about allliers and you know, skiing is, and you know still just somehow got worried about their data.

477
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:49,000
analysis, you know, always keep asking, How do I define our lives? How do I deal with students, you know, Is my data really normal?

478
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I want to talk about here is that you know I I mentioned all those issues.

479
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
So, for it will be aware so it's good that you are aware of those.

480
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,000
But there's no need to be a worrying about them too much.

481
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:12,000
About later. So first of all, the kind of statistical analysis we talk about in this course, although they are based on normally distributed symmetric data.

482
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
They are rather robot tool, asymmetric data, with certain degree of all hours.

483
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Hey? There are good reasons that medical reason which i'll talk about later.

484
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Okay? so. So in most of the case, it doesn't really matter you can just ignore the how I is.

485
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:32,000
If there are a few, or, you know, a symmetric skeweness in the data, and they will give you pretty good and solid number.

486
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Bus answers right in the very rare cases where it does matter.

487
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
So you have a dream outliers or extreme students right?

488
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
In those cases there are ways to deal with them for novel.

489
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
For skewings. You can do transformation on the data.

490
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Take it a lot. Take the square root, or you know, for all wire you can remove them.

491
01:15:52,000 --> 01:16:02,000
But when to make the cop when to make the call it's actually pretty clear in that sense, because you just look at the data, there are outrageous outlers on how already the skill is right, So using the normal just do not

492
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:12,000
access anymore. So in typical data, we're gonna have a sound skillless, and some hours they do not matter, and just to convince yourself they do not matter.

493
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:20,000
There are simple things to do. For example, if you, if you think there are like a couple of outliers which might change your conclusion, you can just try it with, and without.

494
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
A wire I most often i'll conclude and stay the same.

495
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,000
That's a very, very simple thing to do right so you just remove a few.

496
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:37,000
How liars from your data set and re-analize the data The same way you will see your conclusion probably stay the same quality to be the same.

497
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Of course, number will change, but part is the same that gives you confidence that they are not really affecting your analysis.

498
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
So much so I would say, you know, once you start looking at data.

499
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:52,000
And then I know I didn't know that you would realize the problem is not as severe as you you would imagine.

500
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Okay, So so So the focus of the course is focused on a basic principle.

501
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:05,000
How do we analyze data? Use the most wide use approach and We'll talk about those I like you have just aware there there could be usual.

502
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,000
So any physical matters as downsides. right? there could be usual in data which should mess up.

503
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,000
But those are there, and when it happens, you know that there are ways to do with them.

504
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Alright, yeah, always let me know even question. So now I talk about location.

505
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Now i'll move on to to spread okay i'll go a little faster, because I have been slow in the first lecture, Sol the mean and the medium measure the metal point or center of the distribution you should use mean and then

506
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:40,000
How do we measure this brand is right brandy for variability of the data we're on to talk about your standard deviation.

507
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:51,000
That's now just a goal over them again. so so once we use the mean to measure the location right.

508
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
We need to talk about how much deviation the real data points are from the mean.

509
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,000
On average, we talk about this, called the spread of vulnerability.

510
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:07,000
So we talk about using standard deviation. So the way we do that is that we take the data points like this: Suppose this time we have 30 data points, right?

511
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:13,000
These are 3 30 patients receive antibiotics while being hospitalized.

512
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,000
These are the last of our hospital State. We got 30 numbers, so we know.

513
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:25,000
The meantime we capital means means 12. but this number you know very very close, very far away from 12.

514
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:33,000
So what's the average deviation from 12 so what we do is that we simply take the difference between each data point and its mean.

515
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
And then we got 30 numbers, and these are the deviation.

516
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Now we have negative numbers or positive numbers. So now we want to summarize the 30 deviation into one number, because we are not good at understanding 30 number at once. Right?

517
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:53,000
So what we do is that we cannot pick the average again, because if you take an average of deviation because some of them are negative, you are now with 0 always.

518
01:18:53,000 --> 01:19:01,000
So instead of what we do this, we we square them make them all positive, and then average them.

519
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Here we not divided by 30, but 30 minus one always that's just a mathematical communist.

520
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
You know I won't go into detail. but you know that's not just the way we do.

521
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
And then take this word, because here we square right, the unit will be off.

522
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,000
We take the square root again. so we go back to the original unit.

523
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:25,000
So now we have say, quote unquote. the average deviation of this 30 number from its mean as well.

524
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Not. So that's just a way of mattering the quote on both average deviation from the mean that's called the standard sample standard deviation.

525
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Okay, there are other ways of defining it right So if you just want to do with negative number. You can actually take the absolute value instead of the square, and then take the average of the absolute value. you don't have to take the square root right

526
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
that will be another measurement, so that's fine some people do that.

527
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,000
But they are good mathematical reason of doing this, which you know will be using later.

528
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
So essentially, if we use the sample mean, it turns out the sample.

529
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Standard deviation is a good way of measuring the deviation that has manufactured properties, especially to do with normal distribution.

530
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:08,000
That's just the thing we do most of us do Okay,

531
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
So the square of this this is called as x. for so S.

532
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Stands for the standard deviation, so asax Oh, that's for the sample bar, you know, if you're square right? if you don't take the square root that'll be the sample parents So the sample standard

533
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:27,000
deviation measures the average deviation. but the simple variance mentioned, the squared average division.

534
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Why, you might wonder, Why do we square it right? you could.

535
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:36,000
The square. One has other properties right now, so basically useful in different scenarios, but they have different locations.

536
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:45,000
So so they will not get the last off. Okay again, let me know if you have a question, because I want to.

537
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,000
You know, run a little faster, so that we have more time for for exercise.

538
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:56,000
So when we calculate the sample standard deviation, right, we only focus on how far away you trans division is from the mean, and then we square them.

539
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:02,000
We lose the sign right So in the end we don't really know how which side the data point lies in.

540
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:09,000
So we know they're about half on each side right this only measure the average distance. right?

541
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:20,000
So basically, by doing this we are somehow zooming the data are roughly symmetric, just like the mean right? Once we're computing this, we're somehow assuming the data rock is the magic.

542
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Right. If the thing are a skew just like the mean, the Ss.

543
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Will also be effective. Actually, there'll be fact that even more by the mean a than the mean, because when you hit square, the larger become even larger. right?

544
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,000
So if there's a tail, then the standard division will be dragged by the tail to be a given larger number.

545
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:48,000
But nevertheless, if you assume the data is roughly symmetric, then we use mean and the standard deviation to measure the location and the spread of the data.

546
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Okay, and that's the most widely used qualities and then, people that are skilled right we prefer to use the medium.

547
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,000
We can still use the medium plus minus the sample standard deviation.

548
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:06,000
But there, when we compute a standard deviation in the formula here, we shall subtract the meeting rather than the mean.

549
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:12,000
But people rarely do that. You could do that if you rarely do that for well, good mathematical reasons.

550
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:20,000
So instead for median, we use other thanks for matching the spread Eventually, once we have medium, we know the data, you know.

551
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:28,000
It stays in metric. Then we use other metric measurements which are more will go to asymmetric data to measure the spread.

552
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Okay, So usually we use a bracket where you can call a pair of value to imagine the springs which are already seen. right?

553
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Iq. one. So what's going on is that you know Now let's say we still have the 30 data points bye, so we know the median is 10.

554
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Remember the mean is 12. the media is 10 they're not so much different.

555
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,000
So maybe i'll let us go to the right so the meeting is smaller than me, but not much.

556
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Okay, So how do we manage This brand is acquaintance for the media, right?

557
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:07,000
So one thing we could do is the range, which is actually the smallest value and the largest value. right?

558
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:12,000
So that give you sort of a the spread of the distribution.

559
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:20,000
But but the range has come downside in the sense that range is very, very sensitive to the to our lives right.

560
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:26,000
If this number is not 49, but 490, then the range will be 10 times larger.

561
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,000
But the media stays the same right. If you change this number to 490.

562
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:37,000
The meeting still test, which means meeting is very robust who all irres, and the mean will go off a little bit from 12.

563
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Maybe I don't know to 2 40 so me and will is more sending, but the standard deviation will also go crazy along the *.

564
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:52,000
But the range will also right. So the range is not a robust way of measuring this practice.

565
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:58,000
So instead, what we do you know we use ipr I think it's on the next slide alright.

566
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,000
So. So now we have a distribution of the data we we plot it.

567
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
We see it's slightly you know there's potential all I know 49 year rent.

568
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Polon should potentially rise view. So the meeting is a little order than a meeting right.

569
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:19,000
The range is from 0 to 49, right? 50% of data, a lot more than 10 and 50% of more than 10, and so on. and so forth.

570
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
So how do we measure the spread of this? using a moral boss?

571
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Metric is Iqr. Essentially we measure the 20, fifth, and the 70 fifth person hell.

572
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Now Iqr just like the meeting or robust we'll buffalo.

573
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:41,000
All our. So in this case, because the meeting is 10, right? we look at the lower 50% of data and find a meeting of the lower 50%. right?

574
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:46,000
So the media, the lower 50% will be the 20 fifth percentile.

575
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Similarly, the meeting of the higher 50% would be the 75%.

576
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:55,000
How turnout they are. 7 and 14 So now we say the data set has a meeting of 10. See?

577
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,000
They're actually duplicates attempt on never mind not at the left.

578
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:06,000
The meeting is pen, and then iqr the input how range. So it's not the rate of the data, because the range of data is from 0 to 49.

579
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:20,000
But inter port. how range of the data? is from 7 to 14 and it's 7 to 14 roughly measure the brightness of the data, and they are very robust, Because if you change this number to 400, and 90 I can't do nothing

580
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:27,000
at all, just like the meeting. They were both okay. so usually we use mean half minus standard deviation to measure the location.

581
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:33,000
The spread of the distribution. So if the distribution is very, very highly skilled, we can.

582
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I use the medium and iqr so that's a different pair of measurements.

583
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Any questions so far

584
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Okay, that's why we have this kind of a box talk which really show the media.

585
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Iqr. Remember, the box part is a different way of showing. the distribution is more compact than the hito graph, so that you can lay on top of each other.

586
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:13,000
You can compare many different boxes. So the middle box, which is the central part, shows the meeting at the blue.

587
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Why, and the box. The 2 edge of the box showed up.

588
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Iqr, and then the remaining you know whiskers and dash line.

589
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,000
They show the 1.5 Iqr. until the last day the point.

590
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
And there are more data points outside this. They just plot it out right?

591
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
So just so, you know there could be potential all that that's not to say this.

592
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
All I will matter right. This is 49 not 490, so it probably doesn't matter.

593
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
You see, the me and the meeting are still quite similar here.

594
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:45,000
So this 45 do not really. I know that much, but they still show it so that you you are aware.

595
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:52,000
So if you are worried about this number or this 2, number, what you can do is that you can remove them and then try our analysis again.

596
01:26:52,000 --> 01:27:00,000
And the technically your your conclusion will stay so that you don't have to worry about it.

597
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Okay, so that's all for the for the second half of the lecture?

598
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Any questions before I move on to exercise. I have a question.

599
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:14,000
What do you mean by 1 point? 5 Iq hours? Okay.

600
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,000
So the Iqr is the is the distance between 25 percentile and 75%.

601
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Time in this case is is from 7 to 14, so the Ikara will.

602
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:33,000
The length of the Iqr. will be 7 right so the last of this line will be 7 o'clock times 1.5, which will be 10, point 5 here, so this will be 10.5.

603
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:42,000
I I know this plot. doesn't look like so right but this is 7. If it goes 10.5, you should go all the way to 24.5.

604
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,000
This doesn't look like it I don't know how how this part was made, supposed to be 10.5.

605
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,000
The left of this should supposed to be 10.5. Okay, thank you. problem.

606
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:58,000
And this side will be lower, because you know the whisker will stop at a very low data point.

607
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Yeah, So it's supposed to stretch all the way below 0.

608
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:10,000
But because the last data point is 0. So there will stop here point in showing 1 point: 5 Iqrs with the purpose.

609
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Okay, The purpose is that if the data are that's a very good question.

610
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:20,000
I forgot to actually mention the purpose that people do this is that if the data is really normal.

611
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Okay, then, the Iqr should probably cover all the data points.

612
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:40,000
So. So if that's what i'm saying if the data is normally distributed, then the majority of the data points will be within this whiskers, and anything go outside you can conceal them as outliers this is a very very

613
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I would say, you know ad hoc way of define.

614
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:51,000
You could use 2, right? No problem. It just people think this probably cover the majority of the data points.

615
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
If the data are sort of a normal additional deal. Thank you.

616
01:28:54,000 --> 01:29:01,000
No problem. Yeah. So if the data points are within this 1.5 Iqr: they will shrink.

617
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:09,000
However, the last data point right? if they are beyond they will stop here and show you every single data point beyond this range, and then you'll pay attention to them.

618
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Right? So this probably color like majority of data, this carbon, the rest.

619
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:24,000
And then this cover the the very few you know our

620
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,000
But this you know, this kind of a box part, or the convention.

621
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:40,000
You might see some other version of where the the whiskers stretch all the way to the extremes right, the minimal maximum data point or the fifth or 95 percentile right those version might exist for some software, although I

622
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
rarely see them, but by the rationale the same right.

623
01:29:42,000 --> 01:30:06,000
You basically see, once you see this kind of part you know the majority, 50% of data here, the majority are here, and the view outside, you know, that's basic for you to get an impression of where the data lies any other question

624
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Okay. So now, let's move on to project projects right?

625
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
So we have again we have 2 projects let's focus on 3 8.

626
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:32,000
So let me open 3, 8,

627
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Okay, So 3 A is here is about the manuscript of a Macdonald at all, and then ask the few questions here, right about just about a few of like table, one, bigger, 2, and table 3 right?

628
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:52,000
About all of this. So just like yesterday, right I focus on this and read the text surrounding this.

629
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
You don't have to read the whole manuscript right but those are there for your reference.

630
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:01,000
So this is about us. Study on a I think you know.

631
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Incarceration race, and so on, so close. Hello, Hi!

632
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Part is is here I don't know at all and I believe this one doesn't require you to use the spreadsheet. Yep.

633
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:24,000
So i'll talk about a spreadsheet here played on once we do a 3 D. So now what I will do is again.

634
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I will send you to a breakout rooms.

635
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Hold on very interestingly, you know, what's happening that I try to keep you in the same room as yesterday, so that you build up this momentum of you know, working with the group.

636
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:07,000
But what i'm seeing here is that many people today, or not here yesterday, and many people yesterday were not here today.

637
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I don't know whether that's the truth

638
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:36,000
That's kind of a problem. but nevertheless I will I will try to send you to the same room you had yesterday.

639
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:48,000
But if you're new here today, I will randomly allocate you to the rooms and we'll see how that goes the room are still 25 min, and then you guys brought together.

640
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Hopefully. or if you want you can stay here and then we'll come back in 25 min and discuss it as a as a group.

641
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Any question before I send you to the big power rules

642
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Okay, how much time do we have for the assignment?

643
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Yeah, it's by default 25 min.

644
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:17,000
But do you think it should be longer or further? and we are just doing 3 A.

645
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:26,000
For now

646
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Well, if you have actual time, you can definitely go ahead and look at 3 d right, once you're finished I think 25.

647
01:33:33,000 --> 01:34:03,000
It sounds good. Okay, great, i'll send you no

648
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Okay, welcome back. Yeah, I know that some of you, somehow.

649
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:07,000
So. Yes, the day I saved all the break break room of allocation.

650
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:13,000
But today, when I open it up it show, some of you are on allocating.

651
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
I I noticed some of you were here yesterday. so I don't know what what what messed up.

652
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Maybe I didn't use it correctly. or maybe some of you use a different login, and you recognize a new student and never the live side apologize. I you know.

653
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
I hope you had a good time discussing i'll try to fix this.

654
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:32,000
But but you know never the last time I was still keep using breakout rooms.

655
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:42,000
So no that's the over to the other review we'll do it for a few minutes.

656
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:50,000
The people to break. So the first question is, read the manuscript and the answer.

657
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:54,000
The sampling scheme used to select the prisoners.

658
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:59,000
What was the was the sample data randomly collected.

659
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:07,000
So if you still remember your group, can someone from group one a room, one answer this question?

660
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:12,000
One night

661
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Yeah. So we thought, We thought that the samples were not randomly collected.

662
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Selected they for the for the hot spider group.

663
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:29,000
No, they they rank, order them so. the most frequent users, and they selected.

664
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:35,000
That sounds like the top 800 most frequent users, so they would not land them.

665
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:43,000
And then, because of that, we thought that they were then not generalizable to the population, because they not randomly selected.

666
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Okay, thank you. Hold on alright, annie yep. So this is a very interesting Yeah, I I greater you know this. They're sampling ski.

667
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Because the next 3 questions about that it's a very interesting sampling scheme he has his drawbacks.

668
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:08,000
I'll explain. Why they did it from my understanding and what's the process accounts of it.

669
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:17,000
So it is a pretty Oh, I would say mixed some money scheme, right like you, said the the top 800 host bothers.

670
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:27,000
We're not random, so that they were just rank and the top 800, but they also have 800 controls, which were actually random, selected from the remaining right.

671
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:32,000
So it's sort of a mixed scheme I this you know the answer to this question would be yes, and no right.

672
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:41,000
It's just it's not a clear answer i'll talk about why they did it, and what's the person accounts. but you know representatives and so on and so forth.

673
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:48,000
And then for one B. you said it doesn't generalize to all encounter the people in the us.

674
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:58,000
I think you already answer this question my tickets that Yeah, No, no, it doesn't generalize, but but not mainly because the the sampling scheme, you know the sampling scheme is not ideal for

675
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:04,000
this that later in 2 or 3 but they have their their rush now using it.

676
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:09,000
But the main reason that it doesn't generalize to to the for the incarcerated people in the us.

677
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:14,000
It would cut this. All the people you know in this study, I think, are from New York.

678
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,000
You're upstate New York City I guess New York State.

679
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:24,000
So we couldn't imagine other part of the us they have different options and distribution.

680
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Right. So like I said already, you cannot just study one state, and hopefully, that will cover all the Us.

681
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Unless you have strong belief that's the case usually it's not the case.

682
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:38,000
So that's the main reason I appreciate you on yours you're asking this question.

683
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Any other other answers or comments from other other rooms.

684
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:56,000
For this particular question, Hey, Paul?

685
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:05,000
I mean it's fun to have a discussion and that's that's I think we're most of the learning how does one on my my boring sort of a lecture.

686
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Right. So it's totally okay. to not get the the same answer.

687
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:18,000
We might have different answers. it's good to hear about other answers, and you'll make your own call which transfer make the most sense. So it's not like I I dominate the crack answer I Just tell you what I

688
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:26,000
think I may be more experience, but you know i'm i'm happy to be about your your your comments and your thoughts.

689
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:35,000
I'm from group 5 and we think this be our results with the same that we thought that the rank call of something was done.

690
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:40,000
But the topping car salted in minutes, and the control is randomly selected.

691
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:53,000
And also since the samples are only from New York City jail so we cannot say that the study is generalized, and we need samples from all demographics before we can say that it's generalized.

692
02:04:53,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah, Okay, let's move on

693
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Second question. and if I think it is specifically gather data from database of 800 host dollars or 800 controls, right?

694
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:12,000
So now the question is, why didn't They must just simply get 1,600 subjects randomly right.

695
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:16,000
They could have done that. That would be more representative but why didn't they do it?

696
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:29,000
So group, 2, maybe room, 2,

697
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:32,000
I'm not sure in which group I was to be honest.

698
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:53,000
But My answer to this question was that I thought that if you would take like a random sample of 6,000 subjects you might not like catch the hot spotter, since this is only the top 1% or then would be too

699
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:59,000
small. Thank you. Thank you for answering. I Yeah, I I I understand not.

700
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Everybody knows which which room they are in, you know. because I sound clear.

701
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:09,000
So yeah, you're absolutely right so so the rationale to me of this study.

702
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
They want to compare the the so-called house father.

703
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:19,000
So basically, those people who are, you know, frequently in cars incarcerated versus the rest they want to see by the you know, the host.

704
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Bother has any kind of rest, they can make them hostile, right?

705
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:27,000
So if they just, you know, suppose there are tens of thousands of people in New York City.

706
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:33,000
You know, jail population, if they just randomly sample 1,600.

707
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:42,000
If they just randomly sample 1,600 then there's a very little chance they will get a lot of hospitals, because the house mothers are rare.

708
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:46,000
So you're not case if they just want to study the overall population in this jail population.

709
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:52,000
They could do that. but their goal here is to really see the hospital, whether they are in some some way different from the rest.

710
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:56,000
So they want to enrich the house followers so that's why they take the top.

711
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:07,000
800 so-called hospitalers. and Then they they don't want to study all the tens of 1,000 people, so they take another 800 control on hold control from the rest. They think the rest are not hostileers.

712
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Right. So this is somewhat, if you still remember, on on day one we talked about study design.

713
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:15,000
So there are 2 kinds of study design in terms of sampling.

714
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:22,000
One is cohort, Bobby. The otherwise case case control study. right?

715
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:25,000
So this is a somewhat like a case control study. Where are you?

716
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:32,000
You'll pick a group and the other group so so that's why they did it.

717
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,000
It's basically their ration. Now, is you know they want to study hospital. They want to.

718
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Canada not half bottle, so that they have a big sample that's on a hospital to learn them.

719
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Well, that's why they do it this way it's still kind of a strange way of doing it.

720
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:48,000
This is not definitely not a textbook layer sampling.

721
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:54,000
So now any comment.

722
02:07:54,000 --> 02:08:04,000
I agree it's not I mean I think it's not textbook, but, like you said in order for them to actually tease out this population that they were most interested in.

723
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:17,000
They had to isolate them. first. I thought maybe they could have done some randomization in the in the hot spotter group if they wanted to like, instead of taking the top 800 kind of to some randomization in the top 1,000 you

724
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:24,000
know. but but I think, in order to actually do this study, the whole purpose was to compare this group of frequent users to others.

725
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:30,000
So they had to start with a subgroup of frequent users in order to to do the study.

726
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Yeah, I totally agree with you actually we'll revisit in the right next section about how we improve the study right?

727
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:41,000
But yeah, let's go on thank you very much let's go on to a question.

728
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:47,000
3 right? Consider the how membership into the Focal Hospital and Control group will determine right.

729
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:51,000
So if in instead of 800 house, father, what if they do?

730
02:08:51,000 --> 02:09:10,000
400 house. Father, what what's the impact so maybe group, 3,

731
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Yeah, if you don't okay so so if the Sam, if the sample size has decreased, then the me, wouldn't be as accurate to the true me. and so therefore, the actual so the the case is like

732
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:38,000
me for a study with less sample size will be less accurate to the true value.

733
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Yeah, Thank you very much. I I totally agree with you. You think of all right.

734
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,000
The Hospital of the 800, most frequently incarcerated.

735
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:49,000
If you define as top 400, of course their frequency will be high.

736
02:09:49,000 --> 02:10:02,000
The mean will be higher right? So that's the major problem of this kind, I mean, I have no problem with their creative sampling team for the downside of this crazy If someone scheme is that their group are defined based on

737
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:06,000
the sample side by the hospital or the pop 800.

738
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:11,000
If you define a cost model as top 400 that's a different different group of hospital, right?

739
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Even the group meeting will change So that's not ideal so that go back to what R. Thaler was saying right?

740
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:24,000
So what's better is that a they don't define a group based on the sample size That's a very bad way. Yeah, ideal.

741
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:27,000
We want to define a group independent assembly.

742
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:42,000
So you define a host bar, or those, for example, incarceration rate is above some level, and then the rest are below some level, and then you do a random draw within this 2 group pretty fine right with your sample size.

743
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:55,000
I got everybody. but at least the definition of the group do not depend on the sample size, and there is a common in the chassis in the pack size, with difference will change.

744
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Yeah, everything will change, Because, you see, the group of study are defined based on the sample size.

745
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Then, when you change the samples at the group, the definition of group are changing.

746
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:14,000
So you are basically chasing a moving party Oh, you don't even define what you're studying right. Basically, the definition of hospital in this study is not as clean as possible.

747
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:19,000
They should define a hospital as someone with some kind characteristics.

748
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Not just the top 500 that'll be a little better but this this allowed them to.

749
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:31,000
To not define what what a hot spotter is right like!

750
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:40,000
How how frequent people should be okay. yeah they're they're not doing it here. They just stay the hospital at the top 800. right?

751
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:44,000
So the by definition, the host, father, and the sample size are sort of the link together.

752
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:50,000
So so they just, you know. it! It would be better to have a more clear definition of hospital.

753
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:53,000
In the first place, before they even think about the sample sense.

754
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Now Sorry about the control size of the control group.

755
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Like overall. Does it have to equal equal to the case group or no, it doesn't have to equal.

756
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Yeah, epo is definitely one popular approach. But sometimes people do.

757
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:19,000
1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3 ratio you know because sometimes it easier to get more controls right. But you don't want to like have one to 10, because the control over all right.

758
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Sometimes you don't need that much control. does it affect the power or no having a little bit. So both case we have the highest point.

759
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:40,000
So what is the most popular one, but sometimes control almost much cheaper to get.

760
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,000
So you want to study cancer versus non-cancer.

761
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Some people do one to 2 and do 3 matching, because control cheaper to get right.

762
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:53,000
So now that you still push your power. But if everything else you call them palest group, I want one.

763
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Matching is half the highest power that's a very good question. Thanks for asking.

764
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:03,000
So so there's nothing wrong with you know 800 versus 800.

765
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:09,000
It just I I just don't like to see the the host bother with define, based on the sample size.

766
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:14,000
They could do a little better. but you know nevertheless they They they they did what they did, and they got a lot of out of it.

767
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:17,000
That's you know that's probably our our a valuable study.

768
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:30,000
So I have to give them quiet. But doing this okay, Any other comments

769
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Alright Number 4 is to do with table. one basically asked about the 2 group frequency frequently jail and the control group and see the number of being called incarceration.

770
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
It's symmetric let's do a r rescue.

771
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Let's go back to the table one is here. So it's asking about this number of incarceration.

772
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,000
No, basically this this box. and these are the 2 group that you know.

773
02:13:53,000 --> 02:14:15,000
The the hospital group and the control group. They asked whether this variable is symmetric or skill, at which side of skill so someone from a 4 4, maybe

774
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:32,000
I can speak for this. Yup. I think both of them were skewed to the right. and the reason for that is, we have discussed how, if the mean is past the Median then your data is cute right So those rid

775
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:37,000
of values that I used. Thank you. Yeah, I think you are absolutely right.

776
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:45,000
The mean is largely a meeting. So that's the signature of skeweness to the right right because the mean is dragged by the pale.

777
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Hey? Look at the difference. About 23.4 and the funny one It's not too much different right 3.9, 3 are a little bit more different.

778
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:57,000
But overall the skewon is to the right.

779
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Is there probably not very strongly skilled. And the other thing is, you can look at the range right?

780
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:06,000
The range give you the smallest and largest number you see there.

781
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:10,000
The lower end is closer to the mean or medium than the operand.

782
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:15,000
But off on this further away. So you can imagine, although they are not showing a histograms like.

783
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:20,000
I imagine the distribution is still to the right, with the longer thing on the right hand side. Right?

784
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:27,000
So absolutely right, is killed to the right. Any other comments

785
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:41,000
So when I look at it, though it looked like they had a a p value of less than 0 0 one for the mean and median on the frequency jail group, So I thought that if the P-value was so small

786
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:49,000
that that difference would be significant. in that one would be rights to you as compared to the control group, where it looks like the differences in best.

787
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Yeah, I mean like a 3 to 3.9 and so that would be potentially more symmetric, or am I reading that incorrectly?

788
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Yeah you're you're already I I think we'll we'll visit how you the next question, or the the next 2 questions.

789
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Yeah, we've got there about .

790
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:12,000
You know we haven't talked about pivot yet. right but that's a very good point.

791
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Okay, Yeah. So So there are some skills going on. I think we all agree with that.

792
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Oh, that's go to the next question thank you number 5. Here again, table one, I look at a 2 group, and look at our main length of stay right. So the meal of state differ in in the mean but not in a

793
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:45,000
medium. So we haven't talked about how do they really compare exactly right.

794
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:48,000
I would talk a little bit, you know, on day one about how to come in.

795
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:55,000
We didn't talk about how to convert the full meeting but nevertheless is asking about whether it is more valid one way or the other.

796
02:16:55,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Right. So here I think we are looking at thanks here so the main length of state.

797
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:13,000
It's you know 29 year 49 year.

798
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:18,000
So this is significant the difference, and then the median is 11 and 13.

799
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:25,000
There are nothing different. So the question is that which component are, you trust?

800
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:30,000
More.

801
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:46,000
I can go for this group 5 So I think we think that the main is a more valid comparison, because the data is skewed to the the and then we know that the mean is more

802
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:56,000
sensitive to the scheme is, and since the range in the higher like in the range for the frequency shield group and the control group, the higher value differs.

803
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:04,000
So so maybe the median does not consider all those values like when you have the highest value is 9, 62.

804
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:15,000
So the mean do consider the values which are higher and that's why the mean has increased as well, maybe that's why the mean is a much more valid comparison.

805
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:21,000
In this case, but i'm not sure yeah I would I would disagree.

806
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Go ahead, I would disagree. I say the medium is a more accurate representation because it incorporates the average without the inclusion of the outliers.

807
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:36,000
So in the control group there could be some syndicate outlers that could be impacting the mean results.

808
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Thank you. Yeah, thank you both. I think I think you know, if I hear clear, I think both of you actually meant to say meeting is more robust.

809
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:52,000
But but you know, with I think i've read you you mentioned actually meetings more about what you say being is more reliable.

810
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:56,000
But I think you actually met the meetings more reliable because, you see, you know.

811
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:00,000
You look at the the difference between me and the meeting are huge.

812
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Yeah, you know, 2 times more or 3 times more here, and then the range go all the way to the right.

813
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:08,000
So this lesson stays highly skilled to the right.

814
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:12,000
In that sense, you know, the mean is not reliable in characterizing the location.

815
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:19,000
So, although you'll see a difference in the mean between the 2 group right, that difference maybe driven by the outliers, they all may not.

816
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:27,000
So the meeting aren't that much different. so so here I would trust me the more I I I believe most of you actually said the same thing.

817
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:32,000
But you know great. I think you you use a different work.

818
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Any other comments

819
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:45,000
So after looting at this table I think you know the question may may not be totally fair.

820
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:49,000
So there's a star here basically you know key less than point.

821
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Oh, one. we talk about pivot later on that is There's a dramatic difference Significant difference between the 2 group.

822
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:58,000
There's no start here you know I think we assume there's no difference.

823
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:02,000
But after looking at it here, right there's 23 and 9 is significant.

824
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:05,000
The priority. This is 21, and a 3. I was bad.

825
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:11,000
This is also sticking in a difficult so the reason there's no start here probably is not meeting.

826
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:15,000
They're not different, or rather they did a even path they only pass the meet.

827
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:22,000
They didn't have the meeting that's my guess so you know, given the question there right, I mean supposedly tapped it. and this is not.

828
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:26,000
No, it's probably meeting more, but my guess is that they only test them in.

829
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:31,000
They didn't even pass the meeting. okay, but if if that's the pace.

830
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Now we don't really know whether the media are there or not right they could be different.

831
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:42,000
There's other thing we'll talk about later on in the course where we talk about right. The pivot means something, but you have to take it into consideration.

832
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Many other thing. For example, the sample size, is 800 each tool, which is a very large sample, which means they have very, very high power to be packed, even though very little difference.

833
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Or it's follow difference. Okay, so so just because keys left I'm point.

834
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Oh, one doesn't really mean the difference is striking even 11 or 13.

835
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:09,000
They can declare a significant difference. So you know, we have to take into both the P.

836
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Value and the effect size into consideration we'll we'll revisit that later, you know, later.

837
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:18,000
On action. Okay, thank you very much. I know i'm over time for this.

838
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Session. I want to finish it before the breakfast.

839
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:42,000
I I want to take a break Now let's take a break for 10 min, and then come back and then continue

840
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:48,000
I have a question, would, having standard deviation to help you?

841
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Better determine whether the meet the mean or the median.

842
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Is it better choice? Well, yeah, call I mean not first I will answer this one.

843
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:09,000
There's another question I I think not really the standard Tv should give you how bright it is right. if the distribution really is highly skilled, the standard division will be affected as well.

844
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:14,000
So there will be much larger Then they should have me in because you know it's okay.

845
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,000
It's not a debate perspective about all our even more than I mean.

846
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:39,000
So I don't know how much information you get in those cases that's not feeling there was another question

847
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:47,000
Okay.

848
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Yeah, So look at the difference between me and the media and the range. You could have the Iq.

849
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:56,000
R. you know, which is also skilled because standard deviation is one number Doesn't really give you the students right.

850
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:08,000
If you look at Iqr you you might see the resumes, and the if you you can possibly make the box plot or histogram, we'll do that actually in the later exercise with those plots.

851
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:12,000
You can easily see the skewness. Just yeah, with not numbers.

852
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:42,000
I think the difference between me and the Median, and look at the range will give you some idea

853
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:33,000
Okay, that's continue. I I I explore a little bit how to save, and the lowest breakout room.

854
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:38,000
It seems like my understanding wasn't really alright correct try to fix it.

855
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:43,000
But apologize if you know tomorrow I still couldn't get effect.

856
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:47,000
So it you know the the the bottom line that you'll be assigned like our room.

857
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Just don't get the same roommate each each day Oh, that's for the inconvenience.

858
02:30:51,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Okay, that's continue with question number 6 right now we're going to figure 2.

859
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Okay, Why are the value for the high, the live Bar National

860
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:14,000
So figure 2 is here. So this cloth shows the house bother and control.

861
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:25,000
When you break down into the I think the the reason of their incarceration is either missed in minor or follow me. I'll see the difference.

862
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:30,000
I think the primary scare is comparison so they put the number here, and they don't put a number here.

863
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:37,000
And why, what's your thing? and you can talk about anything to do with this bigger?

864
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:53,000
So I I think we go over all the 5 groups, but anyone who want to answer, Please go ahead

865
02:31:53,000 --> 02:32:08,000
We thought that this was because it the office may have decided it's not necessary, since you could derive the height of the light gray bar by subtracting the height of the dark gray from a 100 yeah you're absolutely right I

866
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:14,000
mean this 2 bar add up to 100. so knowing this give you this, and also I I think it's not too hard to look at.

867
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:15,000
You know where I on the on the Y-axis?

868
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:18,000
It is right, is the 88. The ball is about 10.

869
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:22,000
Right. So and this is about, you know. 55 is about 40.

870
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:27,000
Something right. so I I don't even think they need to put the number here, either.

871
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:31,000
So it's clearly the difference. is there right it's not much just statistic needed.

872
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:34,000
Just look at the bar. You know the the chef in distribution.

873
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:46,000
So they they make the decision to put number here there's you know very minor. It seems to me it's very mine, and whether they they add a number or not right with other numbers cleaner right with the number is more active so I think it's either way.

874
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:50,000
it's fine, I think they just want to emphasize the ship.

875
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:55,000
The host Fathers, most of them are, has misdemeanor rather in control, is 50 50 right?

876
02:32:55,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Misconception are following, so the reason for them to be incarcerated are quite different.

877
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:11,000
Any comments.

878
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Yeah, also find this to be not surprising, because you know, be a hospital, or they need to be frequently incarcerated.

879
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Which means each time they spend in in jail should be shorter.

880
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Otherwise, you know, if you were there for a for you know now you were there if someone was in the jail, for if I only they probably gonna spend much longer time there, then by definition, they cannot be a frequent in incarcerated right

881
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:41,000
so. So all of this are come naturally from the definition of the group.

882
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:57,000
So i'm not surprised to see the reason also is different any comments we did discuss a little bit that the the rash now for not including that in this figure, makes sense.

883
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:07,000
They also do, and include them in the next figure which does not make sense this one right

884
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Are you there a figure 3 I don't think there's a thing or 3.

885
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Okay. Yeah. Oh, the next question, Okay, yeah, the next let's go on to the next question.

886
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Next question to do is table 3 on the fever one they say they've contain redundant information.

887
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:28,000
Do you think those are needed? and if not, which one you like to remove?

888
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:33,000
This is very, very subjective, so you know anything you like is fine, just like, let us know what you think.

889
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:42,000
So So this payable talk about. but you know they they really I think they put on different kind of charges against the the the subject right?

890
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:48,000
And then show the different group in pass, father and control on this table.

891
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:55,000
Awesome list. different kind of charges, but here they show only the host model.

892
02:34:55,000 --> 02:35:04,000
They don't have a control. I think column right but here, because of table, they list more causes that the figure only this buy right?

893
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:09,000
So I would say they are overlapping. You see the 29 point, 9, 23.8.

894
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:14,000
The number also appear in the table in the figure 29 point, 9, 3.8.

895
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
But they show they show something overlapping, but not slightly different.

896
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Right here. they have the control. The table doesn't have the control of the pay payable has more reasons to only apply.

897
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:29,000
So what are the thought? Do you think both are needed? Or if you want to keep one which might want to keep anyone?

898
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:41,000
Our our group said both aren't really needed but we liked having both because the table so it's like the specific name of the charge.

899
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:46,000
While the bar plot is like a lot easier to just look at visually.

900
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Yup. Thank you. Any other comments

901
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:04,000
The figure. had more information that I cared about. Then the table see them, including both.

902
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:11,000
But if I was gonna remove one, I definitely would leave the figure.

903
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Yeah, I mean there's there's no right or wrong answer here, right?

904
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:20,000
I I think both have slightly different information apparently it's good to have both.

905
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:26,000
But you know, given a limited space it's also nice to to keep one right, I mean, move the other one.

906
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:35,000
You can have some journal nowadays can have supplementary material. Or you can put the online at the data set right for people who are really interested to dig down.

907
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:39,000
So usually the table can pay much more accurate and complete information.

908
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:48,000
The reason they they don't have another column here probably due to space limit, but they could totally make the table a scratchy and make available online right for people to follow.

909
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Off, and then the figure is much easier, quick to read, so usually that prize as well, even more in the presentation than in the article. Right?

910
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:03,000
So you, if you have a news article, you wanna put the pay full peak figure other than the paper.

911
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:08,000
You have a presentation like a slice you really like to put speakers rather than tables.

912
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:12,000
I think you'd like to find on the way of present presenting and think about your your audience right?

913
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:20,000
So there's no right wrong answer There anybody want to add up

914
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:30,000
So I, if I were the author, I probably will keep the bigger, but I probably will make the paper even more complete by adding the column for the controls.

915
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:36,000
But make a spreadsheet available online right for people to to dig into, to re-analize the data.

916
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Because the figure cannot contain all the causes. right? this especially the little tiny ones.

917
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:49,000
So I would probably add another column, saying all others right So we illustrate this.

918
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Do not add up to 100% right there's big time of data which is missing

919
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:03,000
Okay, but but you know they did a fine job i'm i'm just like Nick Nick.

920
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:08,000
Any paper can be improved, even my own paper so i'm just trying to say

921
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:15,000
You know. sometimes they can do a little better. alright. Finally, Number 8 right now is again.

922
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:27,000
If you let the agency right working on devoted program to prevent reincarceration or present inmate based on this study, right, how would you recommend your agency focus on the effort?

923
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:38,000
Now again. Right so again, if you have some manpower or budget, what you want to focus on for the next year or next 3 years cool to reduce reincarceration, nobody want to see so many people going back again again

924
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:56,000
back to to jail. right? So any anyone I mean, I I like more than one people to share about this

925
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:04,000
I think The study showed that the like frequent incarcerations were associated with homelessness.

926
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Minor charges and key comorabilities at least That's what stated in the discussion.

927
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:25,000
And I would focus on people who have known zoom substance use either in combination with mental illness, and or our homeless too.

928
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:42,000
And instead of imprisoning this group for minor charges, would focus on creating institutions that can house these people and give them correct treatment for the drug abuse and support their mental illness instead of imprisoning them Yeah, Thank

929
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:52,000
you very much pull it over any any other comments

930
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:57,000
Yeah, that was my main. Take the way, too. is that prosecuting these misdemeanor crimes, right?

931
02:39:57,000 --> 02:40:10,000
I think there's got to be other ways to to find restitution. when people have, you know, minor crimes other than throwing them in I think that's why I would spend the money is to find another way for people

932
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:18,000
to quote pay, you know, society back for whatever minor crime they committed, rather than throwing them in jail.

933
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:32,000
It taking out more resources. Yeah, Yeah, i'm absolutely I mean I totally agree on unfortunate things, bad things happen, but sometimes tracing back to the calls and thinking about the the cure or treatment.

934
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:35,000
You know the way to gather around. This is much more complicated.

935
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:47,000
I mean just simply putting them in jail actually do more harm than that. Good! right? You look at this table right? I I think you mentioned that the main reason these people got frequently incarcerated.

936
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Are sometimes, you know, drug abuse or mandal health issues, right? Those are the real calls.

937
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:58,000
But if you don't deal with the real calls just deal with the consequence, it's not really solving the problem right?

938
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:11,000
Yeah. Any Any other comments?

939
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:15,000
Okay.

940
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Thank you Now let's move on to a project 3 B.

941
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:26,000
Again, you know, for the sake of time we we can do it together quickly. but you only need to sum you 3 8, anyway. right?

942
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:37,000
So please come in right now, or slightly after the lecture. and also, remember, there is a post lecture quit just like yesterday, which is due to tomorrow morning, so you could do it anytime today.

943
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:45,000
But you know, please remember to do it on it it doesn't take like 30 min. I hope it doesn't it didn't take 30 min yesterday.

944
02:41:45,000 --> 02:42:10,000
So let's look at 3 b

945
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Okay, this is Threeb is about another data set on visa and an adoption data right?

946
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
And then ask you to do a few of manipulation.

947
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:21,000
It will really be helpful if you do it together with me.

948
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:28,000
I know it is hard, you know, with zoom all but you know. Just try it. Okay.

949
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Cause there's some hands on data analysis Oh, try to slow down.

950
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:41,000
So you got more time exercising. but you know we also have to move on lost your you know.

951
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Feedback saying, You know I should move on faster so there's always a you know, a trade off you know how fast I move.

952
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:53,000
So anyway, this this asked about this data set on resonance adoption.

953
02:42:53,000 --> 02:43:05,000
So you can download the data here and open up, using spreadsheet sales, scratchy

954
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:18,000
And the data side look like this is the data set essentially against the table, and each row is a country, and there are 3 columns or the number of visa issue to that country from the Us.

955
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:24,000
In 3 different years, 88, 91 and 92 alright, very simple data set.

956
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:27,000
We just want to see. How do we get them? get?

957
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:30,000
You know the summary statistic from this data set to do that, you know.

958
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:38,000
You can also look at the description, but that's basically what I said to do that we need to use the scratchy here.

959
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Call the descriptive statistics, open up this one and open it.

960
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Follow and hope it.

961
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:55,000
Yeah, it will be helpful if you do it together with me.

962
02:43:55,000 --> 02:44:00,000
So once you open up that one you got this scratchy he said.

963
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:04,000
It's similar like like yesterday, right there's a data column. You occupy the data here.

964
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:12,000
The mean, the media standard deviation, the mean and the Max and the Iqr and sample size all of them.

965
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:17,000
We will automatically count it. So these are say if you just look at if you want to wonder how this is made right.

966
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:22,000
It's very simple. So this one you click the cell that's equals average right?

967
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
Basically the average of the first column. This is the median.

968
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:30,000
This is the Max. This is the first assembles that.

969
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:34,000
So everything just using the excel Mac calls okay it's got, you know, equations.

970
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:46,000
So let's go back to the Oh, exercise right so compute a mean median standard deviation range of icar for the number of visas in the 3 years I use the scratchy.

971
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:50,000
I would do it for one year only for the sake of time.

972
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:51,000
But you know you can go ahead. do the other for you.

973
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:55,000
Actually, I think I will do all 3 years, anyway to answer any other questions.

974
02:44:55,000 --> 02:45:01,000
But you know you please do that. So, what I do is that I take this column.

975
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:15,000
You can just copy the whole column click, the column and click this one that'll be copy right go to the other spreadsheet, and then click here and click paid and that's it.

976
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Now I got a meeting meeting everything alright so 2 to the other 2 years.

977
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:27,000
It'll be easier if you just you know dial the spreadsheet again.

978
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Right. i'll spread it again and do it again you have 3 separate Brush it now.

979
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:37,000
We'll make things easier, but that last time you know for the second time.

980
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:42,000
I would do it one here only for the first year. Okay, please follow.

981
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:45,000
Follow me if you have questions pizza copy and ask i'll i'll do it again.

982
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:54,000
I know some of you are now making, not very familiar with itself.

983
02:45:54,000 --> 02:46:01,000
So the question is that question 2. The number of visa for each year appear to be symmetric left.

984
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:10,000
You know why right? So I only had one year so that let's look at this year the mean the Median the mean the Max the Iqr.

985
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:21,000
Can someone tell me, do you think is skilled, or Nascar

986
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:31,000
Well, of course, your data Oh, awesome. Yeah. Oh, well, according to the data, it looks skewed to the right.

987
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:35,000
Because the mean is 231, while the meeting is 49.

988
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:40,000
And if you look at the the minimum and the maximum, it's 0 to 130.

989
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:48,000
2. Yeah, the the mean is 0. The maximum is actually body 1,000, right?

990
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:53,000
Almost 5,000. Those way you see the mean is way much bigger than the meeting.

991
02:46:53,000 --> 02:47:03,000
That's a signal of highly skilledness to the right and the standard deviation is also highly big, because you know it's it's dragged by the payoff and then iqr less to a lesser degree, But iqr

992
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:07,000
is also asymmetric, or around the meeting. right? you see the lower bottom.

993
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:11,000
Iqr is much closer to the medium, and the Ho are the one Iqr.

994
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:15,000
So all this signals a hi! this good distribution.

995
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:18,000
You could actually make a hitogram out of it you know using yesterday's tool.

996
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:22,000
You have seen the hateful ground must be highly skilled to the right as well.

997
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:28,000
I'm not going to show it, but is doable thank you hi!

998
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:40,000
There. You know this This question right for each country computer mean over the 3 years I'm here to meet a standard deviation of this new column.

999
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:43,000
I'm gonna call this meeting and the standard deviation hey?

1000
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:49,000
And now, now, computer average of the 3 columns, right?

1001
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:53,000
So I see whether they are the same so so it's a little complicated.

1002
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:58,000
I'll walk through you So what's what is asking is about you know, taking this data set right.

1003
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:02,000
If we come, compute a mean of each row, how do we do it?

1004
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:08,000
I will show you just have people average and then provide this.

1005
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:14,000
And the black is 3 close It up that'll give you this right?

1006
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:19,000
This number is the mean of the 3 i'm then you don't have to do all for the all the rest.

1007
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:25,000
You just drag it.

1008
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:36,000
You just drag it. You know this one, if you, you know, hand over your miles to the bottom right corner, you drag it on the way.

1009
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:43,000
That will the only in the formula is accordingly that's how you got all the means for all the roles.

1010
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:49,000
And now you can compute the mean of the meet

1011
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:58,000
You compute a mean of the mean

1012
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:04,000
This one that's the mean of all the all the role means right? Don't know. We can do the same for the columns.

1013
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:16,000
Suppose we do. The average of the first column

1014
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:23,000
Okay, don't know what's wrong

1015
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Oh, it's a typo I have a reach computer doesn't like hi Holes.

1016
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:33,000
I'm. Then you drag it you got all the 3 columns.

1017
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Now my first question is, if I compute the mean of this 3 column in, would that be equal to the mean of the rowing?

1018
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:46,000
Anybody want to make a guess

1019
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:55,000
You see the person here? if you take the mean of all the roles, and take the mean of the mean similar to do all the columns, would you got the same number?

1020
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:59,000
All.

1021
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:09,000
Yes, you would. And why is that? Because What you're doing is taking the average of all of them?

1022
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:15,000
And then averaging it out so either way you do it You're gonna you're doing the same process. cool.

1023
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:20,000
Thank you. You are exactly right. The average of the average is basically the average of the whole thing right?

1024
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:25,000
Essentially you're getting the average of the whole matrix so that's identical.

1025
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:32,000
Now I'm asking you a second question which is harder if I instead of mean I do the standard deviation for each row.

1026
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Then take the mean of the standard deviation or when I take the standard you need to call them.

1027
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:42,000
Then take the mean that's kind of easy we don't well, I still get the same number.

1028
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:50,000
Anybody wants to guess. Well, i'm doing it so this will be the standard deviation.

1029
02:50:50,000 --> 02:51:01,000
There are several different version. We Use the top s that's the sample standard deviation

1030
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:08,000
That's the sound of the dvd have the first role, and then let's do everything.

1031
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:15,000
And then we got an average sample standard deviation

1032
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:18,000
Are you? if I do the call? Sure, I got the same memorial.

1033
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:30,000
Now make a gut, I think it'd be different cool why is that

1034
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:45,000
I think, because the numbers you're using to create this standard deviation are different than the columns it's from each visa, and so that that's a different range than they range across the different countries you are absolutely right you

1035
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:50,000
know. basically the mean of the mean is always for me. But the mean of the standard deviation is the totally different quality. We are doing.

1036
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:54,000
The role wise and the column wide. you got different number.

1037
02:51:54,000 --> 02:52:00,000
So the mean is the special. So you got a different number.

1038
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:06,000
Okay, cool, cool. Thank you. And that answers this question. You know you can.

1039
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:12,000
You can practice, you know. I think this will give you practice how to use, excel, and how to understand me and standard deviation.

1040
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:23,000
And now number 4. So the number of visa issue to South Korea in 90, 88.

1041
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:29,000
This extremely outline from the Via of other countries suppose after you you know you've got this data.

1042
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:33,000
You'll find out that it was actually a data entry or someone that made it hype on there Right?

1043
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:38,000
And the actual value was 942 without redoing everything.

1044
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:45,000
Do you predict the mean to change? Get smaller or larger or the same or and and the possible for the meeting.

1045
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:53,000
Let's go back here you'll see this number and let's go to the other.

1046
02:52:53,000 --> 02:53:00,000
She Okay, Sorry here. So this number is the number of these are issues to South Korea in that year.

1047
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:04,000
You see, this number is much larger than any other number in the column.

1048
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:07,000
Actually in the data sheet. This is the largest number in the whole table.

1049
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:13,000
Suppose we figure this actually there's a type of it should be 943. Is that a 4,942?

1050
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:25,000
I'm asking you if I change this number to 942 with the mean change, smaller, larger, with a meeting change, smaller or larger.

1051
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:34,000
Someone Google Answer. And I did the mean, Okay, so good, I think you can go and have it.

1052
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:53,000
Okay, I I think the main will change but maybe the Median won't change, because the Median is the central value Oh, with the mean the be larger or smaller, less I change it to 400 900 smaller.

1053
02:53:53,000 --> 02:54:01,000
Right? Yeah, the mean will be smaller. Okay, let me let's cool that's cool.

1054
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:05,000
Okay, let me ask the second question: Right? What would any of this number change?

1055
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:17,000
And in which way I think the standard deviation is gonna change, because it depends on outliers and 4, 9, 4, 2 skews.

1056
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:26,000
It tools like the it's? use it towards one end? So if if it changes to 9, 42, then the standard deviation should change.

1057
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:32,000
Yeah, how about the ref maximum's gonna change as well?

1058
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:36,000
Maybe the 70 fifth course Central's gonna change as well.

1059
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:47,000
Okay, you can think about the reason, medium. doesn't change is because meeting is not set of the But that same principle apply to the present power as well.

1060
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:57,000
So let's see. yeah let me hyper here 9 4, 2. Usc.

1061
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:05,000
The mean got smaller media. stay the same standard deviation. get a whole lot smaller maximum change, and this will stay the same.

1062
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:12,000
Okay. So just for you to understand how how these numbers are determined by the allliers.

1063
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:33,000
Thanks for your all your answers, any comments, questions.

1064
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:46,000
Now there are some of subjective questions. Right? your supervisor would like to know if there is evidence that a number of these are being us should has increased or decreased over time.

1065
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:51,000
State your conclusion, and how the statistic of computing one supports the conclusion.

1066
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:54,000
So I didn't really do everything you want but I sort of did it?

1067
02:55:54,000 --> 02:56:05,000
Here. you see the number of these are the average number of these are usually in 3 years, or 231, 227150.

1068
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:13,000
Right. The question is that do you think the number of these are are issues are going down?

1069
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:39,000
Yes or no. Why, why and why not?

1070
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:44,000
Okay, So i'll do a little more so these are the mean in the 3 years.

1071
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:49,000
If I got a medium which you will, if you do, complete, you know, access at Number One.

1072
02:56:49,000 --> 02:57:01,000
This is number you cannot get

1073
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:07,000
So what's interesting is that if you look at the the mean number of visa across the 3 years they are going down.

1074
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:11,000
If you look at the meeting number of these across the 3, or they are going home.

1075
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:24,000
So how do we interpret this? But do you really think the the number of Isa for the 3 years is going off with them?

1076
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:32,000
I think that, based on what we're seeing it could just be that certain countries are either increasing or decreasing the number of uses.

1077
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:49,000
So I think it's based off of country. and not necessarily the whole like total of thesis, so I think a better measure would be the total number as opposed to looking at the Median or the me because based on

1078
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:56,000
here. We're having some student data so yeah yeah you're absolutely right.

1079
02:57:56,000 --> 02:58:00,000
This is highly skilled data, right, which has some impacts.

1080
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:05,000
Right. So the the mean number visa is going down, which means the total number of user is also going down.

1081
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:23,000
So if you look at the total number of visa given out to all the countries they are going down, however, because the meeting is going on, which means that a randomly drawing country is more likely to go get more visa over the time so the only reason

1082
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:32,000
that a total number of these are going down is because the total number of visa is sort of a determined by a few countries like South Korea.

1083
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:36,000
Right. south. Korea is going down right a few countries.

1084
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:41,000
They got you on fewer visa, but the majority of country, actually they got more and more like India is going down.

1085
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:45,000
India also is. you know this is all liar right here.

1086
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:51,000
But for the majority of the country if you run them into the country is actually more likely to go off because the meetings go on as you've been done.

1087
02:58:51,000 --> 02:59:01,000
It's going off right. Some of them are going out actually more than half of going up like Poland or other other places like you know, Peru.

1088
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:05,000
Okay, more than half of the contractor are going off that's why, the meeting is going home.

1089
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:10,000
So really, really, if you want to look at overall, the whole total number of visa is going down.

1090
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:18,000
But the majority of the country Actually, the number of you said the car is going on. so they they represent just different information.

1091
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:32,000
Any question, comment.

1092
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:35,000
That's why you know if you look at this table right there are all sorts of number.

1093
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:44,000
We do not just make a sense out of it but it's this summary statistic and give us a picture, but just be very helpful, which is a little bit, and they have different implementations.

1094
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:53,000
But sometimes they give you different conclusions even is really going off or going down, depending on what you?

1095
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:56,000
Where are you? Loop right? Philippines is going up.

1096
02:59:56,000 --> 03:00:04,000
The poll is going off right. Some country are going down. Okay.

1097
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:15,000
I'm curious about. If you is there a best way to visualize that if you were trying to show that visually.

1098
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:18,000
Yeah, depending on what you saw, what I I can do.

1099
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:22,000
You know things we have country. I like to show the show a world map.

1100
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:27,000
I know I like to use caller to show the change a visa right.

1101
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:28,000
If this country are going off, I should show a red caller.

1102
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:34,000
If this country is going down, show a green color, so maybe different kind of red and green, then I immediately can tell.

1103
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:37,000
You know the on the world map? How many are red? How many are green?

1104
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:40,000
Right. So the overall trend that's why we I would put it.

1105
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:46,000
That's a good question, though. remember then maybe there could be a better way. Thank you.

1106
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:52,000
I I was, I had a question, so if the if the total number of sample changes.

1107
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:54,000
If it decreases you're saying that the mean decreases.

1108
03:00:54,000 --> 03:01:01,000
But the median does not really follow that trend. It can increase a decrease depending on the value of the sample.

1109
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:10,000
So what about the standard deviation in this case? I mean, make not this particular case, But what happens at the about what happens to the standard deviation?

1110
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:14,000
Is there a relation between what they? They are separate.

1111
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:17,000
The standard deviation and the me on the medium are separate matters everything.

1112
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:21,000
Remember the me and the media measures some of the location.

1113
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:24,000
The standard division measure somewhat the spread right so they could go either way.

1114
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:28,000
They could go together up or down for a one-off one down.

1115
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,000
So they're just no they're measuring different things right here.

1116
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:38,000
The standard deviations going down. Well, that's not necessarily the case. They could also go on.

1117
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:47,000
Okay, Thank you.

1118
03:01:47,000 --> 03:02:05,000
Yeah, that's all and if there's no more question you know I I could start them next lecture, but I really think you know

1119
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:11,000
Maybe let's don't rush too much in the beginning you know

1120
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:17,000
Let's see the next lecture is the

1121
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:21,000
Is about Sam holding. I i've already actually touched a little bit about?

1122
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:24,000
How do we do? sampling right sampling design?

1123
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:27,000
Those kind of thing. I will basically go much deeper tomorrow.

1124
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:33,000
For the rest of time today. Not I. I think we could stop already.

1125
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:41,000
But I want to take the you know. maybe 10 to 50 min again, just like what we did yesterday.

1126
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:45,000
Bye let's talk about the article you pick on day one.

1127
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:56,000
If you haven't got a chance. to talk about it or some other news news article regarding anything to do with public health that you wrap, you know, today or yesterday.

1128
03:02:56,000 --> 03:03:04,000
Yeah, I understand. You know all of us are doing it virtually with all the different surrounding there we go.

1129
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:07,000
But you know, if some of you could don't mind turn on the video, you know.

1130
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:15,000
So that gotta I got a a feeling of speaking to to to real person, you know, just getting that.

1131
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:18,000
I'll make it you know so much more welcome thank you so much so.

1132
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:24,000
Yeah, let's just chat a little bit for you know 10 to 15 min, and then call the day.

1133
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:33,000
How about that anyone else will share anything you'll read

1134
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:47,000
So I can go I don't know if anybody's been paying attention but recently. there's been a lot of articles around covid waves around the country about a new sub variant that's that's

1135
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:54,000
quote unquote spreading the country. and all the articles essentially are are the same in the sense.

1136
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:57,000
So there's a sense that there is an increasing wave that's happening.

1137
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:03,000
But we're not exactly sure about the way due to

1138
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:17,000
The significant change in report and then testing right. So when Covid first, not first again, but when it was in full swing, a lot of testing was happening at Centers at Walgreens at hospitals, that urgent cares that

1139
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:22,000
emergency departments that kind of thing. so those numbers can be easily be tracked right.

1140
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:34,000
But now the greater percentage of testing is happening at home right and So there's no way to tell if people are getting more infections and then staying home, or or that the number of infections.

1141
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:42,000
I've actually got now, because the end the sample and is significantly lower now, because a lot of it is happening at home.

1142
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:50,000
And then there's there's also the the the commentary that goes along with that is, if people are testing at home.

1143
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:55,000
Are they staying home when they test positive right? Are we seeing a wave?

1144
03:04:55,000 --> 03:05:11,000
Because people are testing positive and still sort of continuing their behaviors that, combined with the the relaxation of public health measures like masking in public and requirements for masking on planes and things of that have

1145
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:23,000
some public health issues really concerned that you know we're in for another another boom, because we're combining a virus that's changing with decreasing public health.

1146
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:36,000
General measures and we don't really know who's sick or when they're sick, because we're not, you know, testing in the centralized places that we can track so it's kind of an interesting topic that that I

1147
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:51,000
was reading about. Yeah, thanks for sharing me. Other people feel free to add, I you know I I probably agree. I mean, I heard from some panic those from my my friends, you know they they got people around them got Covid recently quite a few

1148
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:57,000
and what someone with moderate was severe. Same thing, and they they especially if they heard from France.

1149
03:05:57,000 --> 03:06:01,000
I think a lot of people got the new variance they called V.

1150
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:06,000
A 4 B. 5 or something right they say there's a there's a you know, Boom.

1151
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:11,000
There. I guess it's sooner or later. you'll be here, just from away learning the past.

1152
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:14,000
But I totally agree with you. I got so many of these at home.

1153
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:21,000
Pass right piled out here. i'm not using them because I don't have a samecom, but I I can see many people doing that at home.

1154
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:25,000
I I hope they they stay at home whenever they have a symptom or test positive.

1155
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:30,000
But but but both our every we don't have enough data to say anything now on it, Right?

1156
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:35,000
So we make our own call so that's that's the other question right?

1157
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:40,000
What's in the learning, testing for right because what people are coming to the hospital?

1158
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:52,000
So when you were coming to the hospital if you had Gi symptoms, we were testing I don't think people an hour at home having diarrhea testing themselves for covid right and so it's

1159
03:06:52,000 --> 03:07:11,000
it's it's in it's interesting absolutely absolutely Oh, any other people have thought of all this poppy

1160
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:33,000
Hello, Okay, you guys, hear me just wanted to add on if anyone is experiencing any type of I don't wanna say well discrepancies i'll say in the home testing versus what populations

1161
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:37,000
clinics or urgent cares are doing.

1162
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:54,000
And the reason I ask is, I had a co-worker once that having symptoms and was testing positive the home tests, However,

1163
03:07:54,000 --> 03:08:07,000
The job was saying. We don't I don't trust the home tests, and we're gonna need you to go to a clinic or an urgent care to get tested in order for us to decide whether or not you

1164
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:13,000
stay home. so I was just curious if anyone else is hearing that.

1165
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:21,000
And What are your thoughts i'm glad you're you're. You're probably the first time last year we got a home task, Kit.

1166
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:27,000
We were so eager because they know they they mentioned you should test every week, regardless. That's how we have kids going to school.

1167
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:32,000
So we had a case tested regardless. actually they have no simple at all, but just the very first pass we'd run.

1168
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:38,000
My, my, my daughter got a sort of a faint pink line there, and indicated auto.

1169
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:46,000
We were scared off we would make phone call from everybody we saw in the past 3 days, and then we went with a Pcr.

1170
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:49,000
Went went to the clinic like Cbs. When the Pcr.

1171
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:54,000
Test happened. another day turned off to be negative, so it turned off finally. You have to so many struggle.

1172
03:08:54,000 --> 03:09:00,000
Talk to the doctor in the end it's a possible so the the homepage at the boss falls probably rate about 1%.

1173
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:08,000
So which means that if you're really not has a call compact, or you don't have same pounds, there are some very high chance I could.

1174
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:15,000
I I I cannot compute the chance. but it's significant chance you have a cost quality, but for your case you mentioned they have symptom already.

1175
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:19,000
Right once you have symptom. Once there is a surrounding like a high prevalence of Covid.

1176
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:25,000
Once you have close compact, then the home pass will be more accurate, so really depends on you.

1177
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:29,000
Know I'm not going to teach this but there's a basic statistic.

1178
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:32,000
I have you to compute the probability. you really are positive.

1179
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:34,000
Once you test problem. but homepass is not as accurate.

1180
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:39,000
So I think your you know what you'll mention them administrator do not really trust Home Path.

1181
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:47,000
They have a valid point, right? cause the the clinic of passage more accurate in your case, I think, because they have symptoms. Then I would actually think the phone has this.

1182
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:52,000
Like, it will be correct.

1183
03:09:52,000 --> 03:10:04,000
Any other thoughts. Yeah, I I think many people are going back with your normal routine now, in regardless of what's going on out there after 2 years of you know in your lifestyle.

1184
03:10:04,000 --> 03:10:07,000
But but there could be a lot thing going on over there.

1185
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:13,000
I I I think to me what's most important is the number of people in Hospital Ryan's not number of people passing off there.

1186
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:22,000
So it seems like the people in hospital is not really subject to this bias in testing that much right, because you got sick very much before you go to hospital.

1187
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:30,000
So it seems like people in hospital this year, although it's still going up a little bit recently, but compared to the last year or 2 years ago is really, you know, much less.

1188
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:37,000
So that that that is my barrier a little bit i'm fully prepared, because nowadays everything my kids go to camp right.

1189
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:48,000
You just have to do that i'm pretty prepared to get in fact, that any time I just don't want that to be interrupted throughout my life and my work too much, although it's hard right cause i'm teaching right now

1190
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:53,000
I have a trip to Europe next month I like to have all of them.

1191
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:57,000
I'm 40, but prepared to get you back in any time just the nature of of life nowadays.

1192
03:10:57,000 --> 03:11:04,000
I guess that's what happened to me I i'm curious about your thoughts how to deal with this nowadays.

1193
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:12,000
Yeah, I mean that's a dominated conversation too much but you know as as a physician in the emergency department.

1194
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:22,000
When when the Covid blaze was going on, and there was a lot of discussion around the public mitigating factors and people unhappy about their personal freedoms.

1195
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:33,000
And so on, and so forth, being interrupted the one thing that we always, you know, is as the workers in the Department always talked about was the number of people who were going to be 5.

1196
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:42,000
But we're admitted to the hospital right so our hospital is a referral hospital, meaning that smaller hospitals are other hospitals.

1197
03:11:42,000 --> 03:11:49,000
Send their patients, usually their second stations. to us right so say for example, you're like in the northern part of Michigan, and you have an injury right?

1198
03:11:49,000 --> 03:12:00,000
They don't have some of the specialty surgeons that they they need to to take care of those patients, or you're super sick, and you're in traversity right the hospital there isn't designed to take care of

1199
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:12,000
you when you're super sick. The system that we run in our state is set such that people are supposed to be transferred from those places to the bigger places like us to get that kind of special to care but when our high school is

1200
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:18,000
full of patient meeting beds are physically full of patients, even if those patients are going to be fine. I can't kick them out.

1201
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:25,000
I say, Hey, go home you're gonna be fine I just can't accept that person who's more sick at another hospital.

1202
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:28,000
And so when we look at these covid trends that you're right people are.

1203
03:12:28,000 --> 03:12:32,000
I mean. The good news is that people are not filling up hospital beds.

1204
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:36,000
Patients who are going to be fine. are having some symptoms, Covid.

1205
03:12:36,000 --> 03:12:44,000
But eventually we'll be okay. But we also have decreasing in the number of staff available.

1206
03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:53,000
So the physical number of beds hasn't changed the capacity of hospitals has gone down because of the the lack of manpower as well.

1207
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:57,000
So

1208
03:12:57,000 --> 03:13:07,000
Yeah, it's very sad to hear that but I I I do feel like the memories really low nowadays.

1209
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:13,000
Okay, you know, anybody has any other falls, or, you know, following this topic is fine.

1210
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:17,000
But even other topics of interest. a little more positive that's fine, too.

1211
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:23,000
Yeah, I was just gonna talk about my little topic is kind of a it's kind of off topic.

1212
03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:38,000
But I'm a i'm i'm in the middle right now. Manuscript proposal right now using the Jackson hard study day, and so right now i'm looking at food and security and how physical activity is

1213
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:42,000
a moderator between Food and security, and cvd risk.

1214
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:48,000
And so I was doing a little ding and I came across this website.

1215
03:13:48,000 --> 03:14:00,000
It broke down statistics, and when I actually looked at statistics and broke it down, you see it so that Mississippi has 82 counties, and out of those 82 counties, 34 of those

1216
03:14:00,000 --> 03:14:05,000
counties alright, a tool, 2% food and security rate.

1217
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:18,000
And so one county has 61,000 people that are food in secure, and that's more than North Dakota, which is the the entire State, is only has 55, and that was just kind of crazy.

1218
03:14:18,000 --> 03:14:23,000
We out one county you missed as more food and secure people than an entire State.

1219
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:31,000
So that was just kind of you know one of those crazy things that I seen, and just really just couldn't believe

1220
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:35,000
Are you? Are you? Are you aware of the kind of a criteria?

1221
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:40,000
They define food in secure, but there's the same right here being used.

1222
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:48,000
Yes, it was the same and they it was they do stamps regular questions like how often like would you say it's hard to access food?

1223
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:57,000
And those those general questions. Yeah, it's kind of shocking statistic.

1224
03:14:57,000 --> 03:15:06,000
So far there are other standardized. Is there a standardized list of questions that they they they ask you know, like in I do.

1225
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:15,000
I do some traumatic brandies research. and so There's like a the national student of neurotic diseases, a standard set of variables that they that they want everybody to use.

1226
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:23,000
That's the same case i'm not sure if It's a standard, because, capturing food and security is a very broad aspect.

1227
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:27,000
So it is a lot that plays into the social determinants of life.

1228
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:31,000
You know, someone in your household could be food and secure while you are not.

1229
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:36,000
But you guys live in the same household, so it is pretty hard to to to capture food and security.

1230
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:47,000
So, I believe. Well, when I was reading like I said, they had different variables and different questionnaires that they use to capture those who security message

1231
03:15:47,000 --> 03:15:55,000
There is that validated 2 question tool I can't think of the name because I do.

1232
03:15:55,000 --> 03:15:58,000
I also do a little bit of work in social terms of health.

1233
03:15:58,000 --> 03:16:08,000
In pediatric specifically and so there are there's like a 2 question questioner that at least here at not we do screen .

1234
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:27,000
But I agree with sean and that there's so many right like It's so complex and like you said like one person can be food insurance, the same household as another who may not screen positive so and on top of that i'm pretty sure

1235
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:48,000
the Usda has some validated measures for food and security that are different lengths depending on need

1236
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:56,000
Yeah, you always watch this sort of a Youtube videos. talk about floating security about many time they talk about it.

1237
03:16:56,000 --> 03:17:04,000
Access to a healthy food all the time. you know like or who doesn't have a grocery store, or those kind of thing.

1238
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:13,000
So really depend on the definition. I I rather use article in a couple years ago, saying of certain province in China, you know, you know, promising China.

1239
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:18,000
Sometimes they have kinds of millions of people. And then the news article from the Government was that okay?

1240
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:24,000
The last year we had 17 I remember? 17 people in poverty that was like, Are you kidding me the 17?

1241
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:31,000
Why don't just give them some money that's 0 right So it's really off to the definition, and use what do they define poverty?

1242
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:53,000
That's all you know i'll say call from the propaganda, but if they lack of healthy food and new trends, and other things right that could totally qualify for the security

1243
03:17:53,000 --> 03:18:13,000
Any other topics on, Thanks.

1244
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:23,000
I do have a quick question, for I guess the person who said that the Usda has some measures for food and security.

1245
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:27,000
If you happens, I guess just come across those I would love to, you know.

1246
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:32,000
Just know what you can sound with me. if you if you find those that'd be great.

1247
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:38,000
Thank you. Yeah, I just had the link up so let me find it again, and i'll message it to you. Alright.

1248
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:51,000
Thank you cool that's very cool

1249
03:18:51,000 --> 03:19:02,000
Okay, anyone hope well share anything if not that's all all the other day and remember to send me the project.

1250
03:19:02,000 --> 03:19:15,263
And there's a online quiz cause that's usual Otherwise i'll see you tomorrow morning, the same same time.
