00:00:17,162 --> 00:00:19,052
Hello, and welcome.

3
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:23,852
I'm Ken Warner, and I'm here today with a
panel of experts to discuss some important

4
00:00:23,852 --> 00:00:26,329
issues facing the future of public health.

5
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:30,835
They are gonna share with us their ideas
and insights about seemingly disparate

6
00:00:30,835 --> 00:00:35,342
issues such as climate change, precision
medicine, and the management of our

7
00:00:35,342 --> 00:00:39,732
healthcare system and how these will
influence public health in the future.

8
00:00:39,732 --> 00:00:43,161
Before we get started,
let me introduce our panel.

9
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:46,913
Mary Anne Udow Phillips is
the Executive Director of the Center for

10
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:50,665
Health Care Research and
Transformation, or C.H.A.R.T.,

11
00:00:50,665 --> 00:00:52,478
at the University of Michigan.

12
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:57,330
C.H.A.R.T. is an independent
501(c)(3) impact organization with

13
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:02,247
a mission to advance evidence based care
delivery, improved population health,

14
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:03,878
and expand access to care.

15
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:09,823
From 2004 through 2007, Mary Anne was
Director of the Michigan Department

16
00:01:09,823 --> 00:01:14,275
of Human Services appointed by
Governor Jennifer M Granholm.

17
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:19,032
Mary Anne came to state service from
BlueCross BlueShield of Michigan where she

18
00:01:19,032 --> 00:01:21,943
served in leadership roles for
over 20 years,

19
00:01:21,943 --> 00:01:27,211
most recently as Senior Vice President of
Healthcare Products and Provider Services.

20
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:30,415
She holds a Masters Degree in
Health Services Administration from

21
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:33,000
the University of Michigan School
of Public Health.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,080
Welcome, Mary Anne.

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,971
>> Great to be here, Ken.

24
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:36,062
>> Thank you.

25
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:38,750
>> Dr Scott Tomlins, obtained his MD and

26
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,370
PhD at the University of
Michigan Medical School.

27
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:47,101
He completed residency in anatomic
pathology at Michigan Medicine in June

28
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:52,148
2012, and is currently an associate
professor of pathology and urology.

29
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:57,471
He has coauthored over 170 manuscripts
focusing on the integrative analysis,

30
00:01:57,471 --> 00:02:02,652
functional characterization, and
clinical translation of cancer genomics.

31
00:02:02,652 --> 00:02:06,768
Most recently, he's focused on
the development, validation, and

32
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:10,899
application of broadly applicable
precision oncology approaches.

33
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:11,780
Welcome, Scott.

34
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,976
>> Thanks, Ken.

35
00:02:12,976 --> 00:02:16,303
>> Herek Clack is a faculty member
in the department of Civil and

36
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,644
Environmental Engineering at
the University of Michigan.

37
00:02:19,644 --> 00:02:24,601
He has a bachelor's degree in Aeronautical
and Astronautical Engineering from MIT.

38
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:25,547
And masters and

39
00:02:25,547 --> 00:02:30,875
PhD degrees in mechanical engineering from
the University of California, Berkley.

40
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:35,580
His research encompasses principles
of air quality engineering to reduce

41
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,566
the emissions of chemical
air contaminants and

42
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:42,760
reduce disease transmission via
airborne viruses and bacteria.

43
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,831
Welcome, Herek.

44
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:44,939
>> Pleasure to be here.

45
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:47,404
>> So thank you all for joining us.

46
00:02:47,404 --> 00:02:50,375
I do wanna emphasize,
as may be obvious to anybody watching,

47
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,834
that we have three very
different issues here, but

48
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:56,222
they're all germane to what we're
gonna be looking at in the future.

49
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:59,615
And there may be some intersections and
we hope to explore some of that.

50
00:02:59,615 --> 00:03:01,748
So Herek, I'd like to start with you.

51
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,834
We're all familiar with
the issue of climate change,

52
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:09,338
but I'm not sure everybody understands
the public health implications of it.

53
00:03:09,338 --> 00:03:12,196
Could you just give us
a little background on that,

54
00:03:12,196 --> 00:03:16,193
what you anticipate seeing in the future
as a result of climate change?

55
00:03:16,193 --> 00:03:17,490
>> So I think the public,

56
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,398
in a way the public face of climate
change would be rising sea level.

57
00:03:21,398 --> 00:03:27,803
And so, you would imagine a greater
inundation of coastal areas by seawater.

58
00:03:27,803 --> 00:03:31,895
Perhaps an increase in diseases that
are transmitted by vectors that

59
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:34,018
are associated with marshy areas.

60
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:39,586
But there are more, as you might expect
with something as complex as climate

61
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:44,723
change, there are certainly more
subtle and less expected impacts.

62
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:49,928
So for example, in my area of research,
the transmission of diseases

63
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:54,693
via the airborne route, if for
those pathogens, viruses, and

64
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:59,369
bacteria that are susceptible
to UV radiation, so sunlight,

65
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:04,753
areas that get a greater amount of
sunlight might experience a decreased

66
00:04:04,753 --> 00:04:09,898
transmission of those pathogens
that are inactivated by sunlight.

67
00:04:09,898 --> 00:04:14,904
And the distribution of increased
sunlight, decreased sunlight,

68
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:20,008
increased rainfall, decreased rainfall,
that will vary, right?

69
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:24,892
So it's not as uniform perhaps as
the public might think about increasing

70
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:25,767
sea levels.

71
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:30,999
Some places will get more rain,
less sunshine, less rain more sunshine.

72
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:32,114
And so, it will vary.

73
00:04:32,114 --> 00:04:38,019
And so, the challenge will be responding
to these changes in disease outbreaks, if

74
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:44,274
we're talking about infectious diseases,
responding to these changes as they arise.

75
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:51,165
Another thing that you might consider
would be the melting of permafrost, right?

76
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:55,743
So where there have been
pathogens buried in the soil,

77
00:04:55,743 --> 00:05:00,918
then as there's warming,
you run the risk of releasing these

78
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:05,895
centuries old pathogens back
into the environment whereas

79
00:05:05,895 --> 00:05:10,699
before they were frozen and
we were sheltered from them.

80
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:15,082
So there are, as you might expect,
there are subtleties, and

81
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:19,712
there's a complexity, I think,
to the health impacts of climate

82
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:23,289
change that are just now
beginning to be explored.

83
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:27,622
>> So as part of that complexity,
are there going to be some

84
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:32,065
winners in terms of health
coming out of climate change?

85
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,809
I mean, we know, we talk about the fact
there are going to be areas of

86
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:40,083
the world Where the geography is gonna
change in a way that will be suitable for

87
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,490
more agriculture than it was previously.

88
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,882
Are we gonna see areas that are gonna
benefit in any sense or any health sense?

89
00:05:46,882 --> 00:05:50,577
>> I would be reluctant
to suggest a winner or

90
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:56,393
loser given that health is impacted by so
many different things.

91
00:05:56,393 --> 00:06:01,559
So those regions, again,
going back to the example of

92
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:08,414
greater sunlight leading to reduced
transmission of certain viruses,

93
00:06:08,414 --> 00:06:12,812
greater sunlight might
also lead to drought.

94
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:16,835
So your health will be compromised
if you don't have access, or

95
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:20,050
if you don't have as much access,
to clean water.

96
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,787
So I think it's just really complex,
right?

97
00:06:22,787 --> 00:06:27,520
So I think kind of the buzz
word really has to be

98
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,381
impacts of climate change
will be uncertain,

99
00:06:32,381 --> 00:06:37,879
will be multifaceted, and
will be unprecedented.

100
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,330
>> Unprecedented, wow.

101
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,290
Thank you.

102
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,964
Actually, I'm gonna go to each of
you individually just to kind of get

103
00:06:43,964 --> 00:06:47,786
an introductory comment as Herek just
gave us on your area of expertise.

104
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:51,809
But be thinking about how these
different issues interact between or

105
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:55,010
among the three subjects
that we're looking at here.

106
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,640
So Scott, I wanna ask you something
about personalized medicine.

107
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,181
We've all heard a little bit about it.

108
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:01,819
I don't think many of
us know a lot about it.

109
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:06,269
Could you just tell us what it is,
and specifically what you see it's

110
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:10,274
implications for health and
health care in the coming years?

111
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:13,898
>> So broadly speaking,
personalized medicine is a concept for

112
00:07:13,898 --> 00:07:18,638
patients with a disease that we're going
to identify the specific treatment for

113
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:23,183
their disease, at the right time,
based on what's causing their disease.

114
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:26,764
So for an example, instead of
talking about all breast cancer,

115
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:30,346
we're gonna talk about what should
be the treatment options for

116
00:07:30,346 --> 00:07:34,657
an individual patient who has breast
cancer, based on, what are the changes

117
00:07:34,657 --> 00:07:38,635
either they inherited from their
parents or that they were exposed to or

118
00:07:38,635 --> 00:07:42,518
that developed in their tumor that
would allow us to best treat them.

119
00:07:42,518 --> 00:07:46,497
And so, importantly, we do that every day.

120
00:07:46,497 --> 00:07:49,167
Oncologists do that every
day in the clinic right now.

121
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:53,197
So they treat patients differently
with breast cancer based on age,

122
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:55,568
family history of breast cancer, etc.

123
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:59,186
They also treat them differently based on
the characteristics of the tumor under

124
00:07:59,186 --> 00:07:59,992
the microscope.

125
00:07:59,992 --> 00:08:03,984
And then, they also do some
standard molecular testing,

126
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,271
looking at changes in the tumor.

127
00:08:06,271 --> 00:08:07,479
And that guides our therapy.

128
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,619
So you could say right now, most women,
and almost every woman certainly seen

129
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:15,268
at the University of Michigan,
is getting personalized medicine.

130
00:08:15,268 --> 00:08:19,276
So where I really think this is, when
we talk about personalized medicine and

131
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:22,299
precision medicine,
we're talking about applying some

132
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:25,260
of the cutting edge technology
that we now have available

133
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,350
that let's us look at the molecular
changes in really unprecedented detail.

134
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,247
It's using that to guide
how we treat patients.

135
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:37,903
And so, that brings up both
the sort of awesome power and

136
00:08:37,903 --> 00:08:42,363
the potential of that technology,
but it also causes

137
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:47,337
a whole bunch of challenges,
both to a practicing doctor.

138
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:50,603
So for example, which of the thousands
of tests should we order?

139
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:52,062
How do we interpret that?

140
00:08:52,062 --> 00:08:55,692
And then, it also brings up
challenges to the health care system.

141
00:08:55,692 --> 00:09:01,096
How do we pay for that, both for an
individual patient as well as for society?

142
00:09:01,096 --> 00:09:02,831
>> All right, thank you.

143
00:09:02,831 --> 00:09:09,257
We will come back to that cuz I think
that's really interesting set of issues.

144
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:15,921
Mary Anne, I hear a lot about population
health and the healthcare system.

145
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:18,253
And I have to tell you,
as an economist and

146
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:22,851
someone who knows a little bit about it,
I've always been a little skeptical that

147
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:27,536
our healthcare system was structured to
foster an interest in population health.

148
00:09:27,536 --> 00:09:31,113
First of all, would you define
population health for folks here?

149
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:35,335
And then, tell us how the healthcare
system might indeed become interested?

150
00:09:35,335 --> 00:09:37,697
>> Yeah, so
it's a really great question, Ken,

151
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:41,075
including the question about how
do you define population health?

152
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:45,255
I think that most health providers,
hospitals and physicians,

153
00:09:45,255 --> 00:09:49,891
define it as looking at the patient
population that they're serving and

154
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:54,375
thinking about them a little bit more
broadly than just the individual

155
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,512
clinical presenting
condition that they have.

156
00:09:57,512 --> 00:10:01,114
So thinking about the environment
that that population lives in,

157
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:05,889
that individual lives in, becomes part of
the responsibility for that health system.

158
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:08,275
So it's a little bit different
from public health, and

159
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,827
I think that's something people
get a little confused on.

160
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:15,454
Because we think of public health
as being related to the community,

161
00:10:15,454 --> 00:10:18,486
to the broader issues
like climate change and

162
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:23,292
all of these bigger things that affect
the entire community around us.

163
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:27,724
Whereas population health tends to
be focused more specifically on

164
00:10:27,724 --> 00:10:32,245
the group of patients that an individual
provider is taking care of.

165
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:34,814
But looking at them more
broadly as a whole person,

166
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:37,702
not just their clinical issue
that's being presented.

167
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:42,538
And I think your core question
about are providers incentivized to

168
00:10:42,538 --> 00:10:47,126
treat people in that broad way
is a really excellent question.

169
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:51,162
We have some things that have been
embedded in our financing system that

170
00:10:51,162 --> 00:10:55,601
do encourage health systems to look at
a person beyond that clinical issue that

171
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:58,106
keeps them in a hospital bed, for example.

172
00:10:58,106 --> 00:11:01,301
But we have many other incentives in
the system that really kind of go

173
00:11:01,301 --> 00:11:02,488
in the other direction.

174
00:11:02,488 --> 00:11:06,035
And so, I think it's a little bit
of a question right now if we can

175
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:10,132
really move our current financing
system to focus on population health.

176
00:11:10,132 --> 00:11:13,213
Kind of like the rhetoric is
trying to encourage us to do it.

177
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:16,596
>> So how would we go about
actually moving it there?

178
00:11:16,596 --> 00:11:19,641
>> So you really have to
look at the incentives and

179
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:21,838
who holds the risk in the system.

180
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:26,124
If we look, for example,
at most European systems, and you go in,

181
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:30,339
I've been in meetings where you
ask people who's responsible for

182
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:32,312
the health of the population?

183
00:11:32,312 --> 00:11:33,330
It's very clear, right?

184
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:37,670
There's usually a government agency
at either the federal level,

185
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,869
the national level, or
a community level that's responsible.

186
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,544
In our system, in America,
it's very fragmented.

187
00:11:44,544 --> 00:11:49,132
We have a public health department
that's responsible for some things.

188
00:11:49,132 --> 00:11:53,277
We have some health systems providers
responsible for some people.

189
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:56,071
And we have health plans,
Medicare, Medicaid, and

190
00:11:56,071 --> 00:12:00,308
private health insurers that all have
a different piece of the picture, right?

191
00:12:00,308 --> 00:12:04,682
You really have to align our very
fragmented and complicated system.

192
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:10,443
You have to align all of these parties
to get to that idea of real population,

193
00:12:10,443 --> 00:12:12,072
real public health.

194
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:13,565
That's really challenging to do.

195
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:18,472
I think we see the beginnings of it
as we see more providers being paid

196
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:20,204
on a capitative basis.

197
00:12:20,204 --> 00:12:23,331
And capitation just means
you're paid per person,

198
00:12:23,331 --> 00:12:25,971
you're not paid per procedure that you do.

199
00:12:25,971 --> 00:12:28,540
Our historic system of paying for

200
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,312
every service a physician does
is enormously fragmenting and

201
00:12:33,312 --> 00:12:38,833
focusing people on just that individual
moment not an entire patient.

202
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:42,392
But if you start paying on
a broader basis and capitating,

203
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:47,699
then you might be incentivized to look at
what's happened upstream with that family,

204
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:51,044
what's happened upstream
with that individual, and

205
00:12:51,044 --> 00:12:54,337
really start to focus on
health beyond medical care.

206
00:12:54,337 --> 00:12:58,838
>> So we do have some systems that
seem to do that better than others.

207
00:12:58,838 --> 00:13:01,187
Kaiser Permanente is an obvious example.

208
00:13:01,187 --> 00:13:05,632
Can you give some examples how, with
their incentives and their capitation and

209
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:09,222
so on, that they are more interested
in population and health?

210
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:12,525
>> Yes, it's a great example to
look at some place like Kaiser or

211
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:16,029
other health plans that assume
that total risk for that patient.

212
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:20,804
And they do things like they may send
a patient home with a scale, somebody who

213
00:13:20,804 --> 00:13:25,594
has a congestive heart failure, so
that that patient can weigh themselves.

214
00:13:25,594 --> 00:13:28,901
And they talk to them about nutrition.

215
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:32,084
They may deal with
transportation issues or

216
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:36,908
other barriers that patients have
to getting their medical care.

217
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:42,311
Our hope is that they deal with
multiple issues that people have.

218
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:47,081
Many people who have serious disease
come in with mental health issues,

219
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:51,382
and they often are dealing with
multiple systems of treatment for

220
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:56,097
mental health care and then,
let's say, a heart condition, right?

221
00:13:56,097 --> 00:14:00,441
And so, in places like Kaiser,
they try to integrate that care.

222
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:03,230
They focus more on teams of practitioners.

223
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,786
And not just practitioners.

224
00:14:04,786 --> 00:14:09,028
One of the exciting developments, I think,
that we're seeing today in health systems

225
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:12,080
is they're using what are known
as community health workers.

226
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,431
These are individuals who don't
have medical training but

227
00:14:16,431 --> 00:14:18,526
they live in the community.

228
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:22,540
They can do better actually at
communicating with patients,

229
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,327
helping them stay on their medication
to prevent an eruption of disease,

230
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:31,727
who might help take them to their
appointments, who might help them

231
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:36,689
coordinate their care, might help them
get food if they are food insecure.

232
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:40,542
Those are the kinds of people that
we're beginning to see health systems,

233
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:41,337
like Kaiser and

234
00:14:41,337 --> 00:14:45,577
some others, employ to really try to help
integrate the care for those patients.

235
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:47,079
It's a very exciting development.

236
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:49,781
>> Sounds like the barefoot doctor
in China in the early '70s.

237
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:51,255
[LAUGH].

238
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:53,806
>> Well, there were many things we've
done through history that we could learn

239
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:54,324
from, right?

240
00:14:54,324 --> 00:14:55,686
